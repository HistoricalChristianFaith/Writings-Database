<FONT  SIZE=4>An Exposition of the Chapters of the Acts of the Apostles.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3008_784412">1</A></SUP> </FONT></H2>

<P>Having had ourselves the advantage of the method and model received from our fathers and teachers, we attempt, in a modest way, to give these in this exposition of the chapters, entreating your forgiveness for the rashness of such an endeavour in us who are young in point both of years and of study,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3010_785023">2</A></SUP> and looking to have the indulgence<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3011_785192">3</A></SUP> of every one who reads this writing in prayer on our behalf. We make this exposition, therefore, after the history of Luke, the evangelist and historian. And, accordingly, we have indicated whole chapters by the letters of the alphabet,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3012_785460">4</A></SUP> and their subdivisions into parts we have noted by means of the asterisk.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn30.htm#P3013_785656">5</A></SUP> </P>
