<P> (<I>d</I>) Was crucified also for us, under Pontius Pilate,</P>

<P>Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; </P>

<P>Who spake by the prophets:</P>

<P>In one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.</P>

<P>We acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins.</P>

<P>We look for the resurrection of the dead,</P>

<P>And the life of the world to come. Amen.</P>

<P>This Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan Creed was solemnly ratified by the Council of Ephesus (a.d. 431) with the decree<SUP><A HREF="#P7936_2562345">2</A></SUP> that "No one<SUP><A HREF="#P7937_2562372">3</A></SUP> shall be permitted to introduce, write, or compose <I>any other faith</I>,<SUP><A HREF="#P7938_2562915">4</A></SUP> besides that which was defined by the holy Fathers assembled in the city of Nice, with <I>the presence of</I> the Holy Ghost."</P>


<br><br><sup id="P7928_2561837">1</sup>: The addition of the Filioque , in the West, is theologically true, but of no authority here. See Pearson, On the Creed .
<br><br><sup id="P7936_2562345">2</sup>: Canon vii.
<br><br><sup id="P7937_2562372">3</sup>: No one . This re-affirms the action of Nicaea itself, and forbids the imposition of anything novel as a creed by any authority whatever. Nothing, therefore, which has not been set forth by Nicene authority (or by the supplementing and co-equal councils of the whole Church, from the same primitive sources) can be a creed, strictly speaking. It may be an orthodox confession, like the Quicunque Vult , but cannot be imposed in terms of communion, any more than the Te Deum .
<br><br><sup id="P7938_2562915">4</sup>: Any other faith . The composition and setting north of another faith , as terms of communion, by Pius IV., bishop of Rome, A.D. 1564, and its acceptance, with additional dogmas, at the opening of the Vatican Council (so-called), A.D. 1869, brought the whole Papal communion under this anathema of Ephesus.
