<h3 align="center">The Second Book</h3>
<h3 align="center">Of the Life and Miracles of St. Benedict <A HREF="#1"><SUP><b>1</b></SUP></A></h3>
<p>
There was a man of venerable life, blessed by grace, and blessed in name, for 
he was called "Benedictus" or Benedict: who, from his younger years, carried 
always the mind of an old man; for his age was inferior to his virtue: all 
vain pleasure he contemned, and though he were in the world, and might freely 
have enjoyed such commodities as it yieldeth, yet did he nothing esteem it, 
nor the vanities thereof. He was born in the province of Nursia, of 
honourable parentage, and brought up at Rome in the study of humanity. But 
for as much as he saw many by reason of such learning to fall to dissolute 
and lewd life, he drew back his foot, which he had as it were now set forth 
into the world, lest, entering too far in acquaintance therewith, he likewise 
might have fallen into that dangerous and godless gulf: wherefore, giving 
over his book, and forsaking his father's house and wealth, with a resolute 
mind only to serve God, he sought for some place, where he might attain to 
the desire of his holy purpose: and in this sort he departed, instructed with 
learned ignorance, and furnished with unlearned wisdom. All the notable 
things and acts of his life I could not learn; but those few, which I mind 
now to report, I had by the relation of four of his disciples: to wit, of <A NAME="p52"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|52</SPAN></A>
Constantinus, a most rare and reverent man, who was next Abbot after him; of 
Valentinianus, who many years had the charge of the Lateran Abbey; of 
Simplicius, who was the third General of his order; and lastly of Honoratus, 
who is now Abbot of that monastery in which he first began his holy life.
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A></SPAN>Chapter One: how he made a
broken sieve whole and sound.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
Benedict having now given over the school, with a resolute mind to lead his 
life in the wilderness: his nurse alone, which did tenderly love him, would 
not by any means give him over. Coming, therefore, to a place called Enside <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> 
and remaining there in the church of St. Peter, in the company of other 
virtuous men, which for charity lived in that place, it fell so out that his 
nurse borrowed of the neighbours a sieve to make clean wheat, which being 
left negligently upon the table, by chance it was broken in two pieces: 
whereupon she fell pitifully a-weeping, because she had borrowed it. The 
devout and religious youth Benedict, seeing his nurse so lamenting, moved with 
compassion, took away with him both the pieces of the sieve, and with tears 
fell to his prayers; and after he had done, rising up he found 
it so whole, that the place could not be seen where before it was broken; and 
coming straight to his nurse, and comforting her with good words, he 
delivered her the sieve safe and sound: which miracle was known to all the 
inhabitants thereabout, and so much admired, that the townsmen, for a 
perpetual memory, did hang it up at the church door, to the end that not only 
men then living, but also their posterity might understand, how greatly God's 
grace did work with him upon his first renouncing of the world. The sieve 
continued there many years after, even to these very troubles of the 
Lombards, where it did hang over the church door.  
<p>
But Benedict, desiring rather the miseries of the world than the praises of 
men: rather to be wearied with labour <A NAME="p53"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|53</SPAN></A>
for God's sake, than to be exalted with 
transitory commendation: fled privily from his nurse, and went into a desert 
place called Sublacum,<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> distant almost forty miles from Rome: in which there 
was a fountain springing forth cool and clear water; the abundance whereof 
doth first in a broad place make a lake, and afterward running forward, 
cometh to be a river. As he was travelling to this place, a certain monk 
called Romanus met him, and demanded whither he went, and understanding his 
purpose, he both kept it close, furthered him what he might, vested him with 
the habit of holy conversation, and as he could, did minister and serve him.  
<p>
The man of God, Benedict, coming to this foresaid place, lived there in a 
strait cave, where he continued three years unknown to all men, except to 
Romanus, who lived not far off, under the rule of Abbot Theodacus,<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> and very 
virtuously did steal certain hours, and likewise sometime a loaf given for 
his own provision, which he did carry to Benedict. And because from Romanus' 
cell to that cave there was not any way, by reason of an high rock which did 
hang over it, Romanus, from the top thereof, upon a long rope, did let down 
the loaf, upon which also with a band he tied a little bell, that by the 
ringing thereof the man of God might know when he came with his bread, and so 
be ready to take it. But the old enemy of mankind, envying at the charity of 
the one and the refection of the other, seeing a loaf upon a certain day let 
down, threw a stone and brake the bell; but yet, for all that, Romanus gave 
not over to serve him by all the possible means he could.  
<p>
At length when almighty God was determined to ease Romanus of his pains, and 
to have Benedict's life for an example known to the world, that such a candle, 
set upon a candlestick, might shine and give light to the Church of God, our 
Lord vouchsafed to appear unto a certain Priest dwelling a good way off, who 
had made ready his dinner <A NAME="p54"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|54</SPAN></A> for Easter day, and spake thus unto him: "Thou hast 
provided good cheer for thyself, and my servant in such a place is afflicted 
with hunger": who, hearing this forthwith rose up, and upon Easter day 
itself, with such meat as he had prepared, went to the place, where he sought 
for the man of God amongst the steep hills, the low valleys and hollow pits, 
and at length found him in his cave: where, after they had prayed together, 
and sitting down had given God thanks, and had much spiritual talk, then the 
Priest said unto him: "Rise up, brother, and let us dine, because today is 
the feast of Easter." To whom the man of God answered, and said: "I know that 
it is Easter with me and a great feast, having found so much favour at God's 
hands as this day to enjoy your company" (for by reason of his long absence 
from men, he knew not that it was the great solemnity of Easter). But the 
reverent Priest again did assure him, saying: "Verily, to-day is the feast of 
our Lord's Resurrection, and therefore meet it is not that you should keep 
abstinence, and besides I am sent to that end, that we might eat together of 
such provision as God's goodness hath sent us." Whereupon they said grace, 
and fell to their meat, and after they had dined, and bestowed some time in 
talking, the Priest returned to his church.  
<p>
About the same time likewise, certain shepherds found him in that same cave: 
and at the first, when they espied him through the bushes, and saw his 
apparel made of skins, they verily thought that it had been some beast: but 
after they were acquainted with the servant of God, many of them were by his 
means converted from their beastly life to grace, piety, and devotion. And 
thus his name in the country there about became famous, and many after this 
went to visit him, and for corporal meat which they brought him, they carried 
away spiritual food for their souls. <A NAME="p55"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|55</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A></SPAN>Chapter Two: how he
overcame a great temptation of the flesh.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
Upon a certain day being alone, the tempter was at hand: for a 
little black bird, commonly called a merle or an ousel, began to 
fly about his face, and that so near as the holy man, if he 
would, might have taken it with his hand: but after he had 
blessed himself with the sign of the cross, the bird flew away: 
and forthwith the holy man was assaulted with such a terrible 
temptation of the flesh, as he never felt the like in all his 
life.  
<p>
A certain woman there was which some time he had seen, the 
memory of which the wicked spirit put into his mind, and by the 
representation of her did so mightily inflame with concupiscence 
the soul of God's servant, which did so increase that, almost 
overcome with pleasure, he was of mind to have forsaken the 
wilderness. But, suddenly assisted with God's grace, he came to 
himself; and seeing many thick briers and nettle bushes to grow 
hard by, off he cast his apparel, and threw himself into the 
midst of them,<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> and there wallowed so long that, when he rose up, 
all his flesh was pitifully torn: and so by the wounds of his 
body, he cured the wounds of his soul, in that he turned 
pleasure into pain, and by the outward burning of extreme smart, 
quenched that fire which, being nourished before with the fuel 
of carnal cogitations, did inwardly burn in his soul: and by 
this means he overcame the sin, because he made a change of the 
fire.  
<p>
From which time forward, as himself did afterward report 
unto his disciples, he found all temptation of pleasure so 
subdued, that he never felt any such thing. Many after this 
began to abandon the world, and to become his scholars. For 
being now freed from the vice of temptation, worthily and with 
great reason is he made a master of virtue: for which cause, in 
Exodus, commandment is given by Moses that the Levites from 
five-and-twenty years and upward should serve, but, after they 
came to fifty, <A NAME="p56"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|56</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb> </SPAN>that they should be ordained keepers of the holy 
vessels.&nbsp; <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> 
<p>
PETER. Somewhat I understand of this testimony alleged: but yet 
I beseech you to tell me the meaning thereof more fully.  
<p>
GREGORY. It is plain, Peter, that in youth the temptation of the 
flesh is hot: but after fifty years the heat of the body waxeth 
cold, and the souls of faithful people become holy vessels.  
Wherefore necessary it is that God's elect servants, whiles they 
are yet in the heat of temptation, should live in obedience, 
serve, and be wearied with labour and pains. But when, by reason 
of age, the heat of temptation is past, they become keepers of 
holy vessels; because they then are made the doctors of men's 
souls.  
<p>
PETER. I cannot deny, but that your words have given me full 
satisfaction: wherefore, seeing you have now expounded the 
meaning of the former text alleged, prosecute, I pray, as you 
have begun, the rest of the holy man's life.
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A></SPAN>Chapter Three: how
Benedict, by the sign of the holy cross, broke a drinking-glass in pieces.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
GREGORY. When this great temptation was thus overcome, the man 
of God, like unto a piece of ground well tilled and weeded, of 
the seed of virtue brought forth plentiful store of fruit: and 
by reason of the great report of his wonderful holy life, his 
name became very famous. Not far from the place where he 
remained there was a monastery,<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> the Abbot whereof was dead: 
whereupon the whole Convent came unto the venerable man Benedict, 
entreating him very earnestly that he would vouchsafe to take 
upon him the charge and government of their Abbey: long time he 
denied them, saying that their manners were divers from his, and 
therefore that they should never agree together: yet <A NAME="p57"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|57</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
at length, 
overcome with their entreaty, he gave his consent.  
<p>
Having now  taken upon him the charge of the Abbey, he took order 
that regular life should be observed, so that none of them could, 
as before they used, through unlawful acts decline from the path of 
holy conversation, either on the one side or on the other: which 
the monks perceiving, they fell into a great rage, accusing 
themselves that ever they desired him to be their Abbot, seeing 
their crooked conditions could not endure his virtuous kind of 
government: and therefore when they saw that under him they 
could not live in unlawful sort, and were loath to leave their 
former conversation, and found it hard to be enforced with old 
minds to meditate and think upon new things: and because the 
life of virtuous men is always grievous to those that be of 
wicked conditions, some of them began to devise, how they might 
rid him out of the way: and therefore, taking counsel together, 
they agreed to poison his wine: which being done, and the glass 
wherein that wine was, according to the custom, offered to the 
Abbot to bless, he, putting forth his hand, made the sign of the 
cross, and straightway the glass, that was holden far off, brake 
in pieces, as though the sign of the cross had been a stone 
thrown against it: upon which accident the man of God by and by 
perceived that the glass had in it the drink of death, which 
could not endure the sign of life: and therefore rising up, with 
a mild countenance and quiet mind, he called the monks together, 
and spake thus unto them: "Almighty God have mercy upon you, and 
forgive you: why have you used me in this manner? Did not I tell 
you before hand, that our manner of living could never agree 
together? Go your ways, and seek ye out some other father 
suitable to your own conditions, for I intend not now to stay 
any longer amongst you." When he had thus discharged himself, he 
returned back to the <A NAME="p58"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|58</SPAN></A> wilderness which so much he loved, and 
dwelt alone with himself, in the sight of his Creator, who 
beholdeth the hearts of all men.  
<p>
PETER. I understand not very well what you mean, when you say 
that he dwelt with himself.<p>GREGORY. If the holy man had longer, contrary to his own mind, 
continued his government over those monks, who had all conspired 
against him, and were far unlike to him in life and 
conversation: perhaps he should have diminished his own 
devotion, and somewhat withdrawn the eyes of his soul from the 
light of contemplation; and being wearied daily with correcting 
of their faults, he should have had the less care of himself, 
and so haply it might have fallen out, that he should both have 
lost himself, and yet not found them: for so often as by 
infectious motion we are carried too far from ourselves, we 
remain the same men that we were before, and yet be not with 
ourselves as we were before: because we are wandering about 
other men's affairs, little considering and looking into the 
state of our own soul.
For shall we say that he was with himself, who went into 
a far country, and after he had, as we read in the Gospel, 
prodigally spent that portion which he received of his father, 
was glad to serve a citizen, to keep his hogs, and would willingly 
have filled his hungry belly with the husks which they did eat: 
who notwithstanding afterward, when he thought with himself of 
those goods which he had lost, it is written of him that, 
returning into himself, he said: How many hired men in my father's 
house do abound with bread? <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> 
<p>
If then, before he were with himself, from whence did he return 
home unto himself? and therefore I said that this venerable man 
did dwell with himself, because carrying himself circumspectly 
and carefully in the sight of his Creator, always considering 
his own actions, always examining <A NAME="p59"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|59</SPAN></A> himself, never did he turn the 
eyes of his soul from himself, to behold aught else whatsoever.  
<p>
PETER. Why, then, is it written of the Apostle, St. Peter, after 
he was by the Angel delivered out of prison, that, returning to 
himself, he said: <i> Now I know verily, that our Lord hath sent his 
Angel, and hath delivered me from the hand of Herod, and from 
all the expectation of the people of the Jews</i>. <sup><A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A></sup> 
<p>
GREGORY. We are two manner of ways, Peter, carried out of 
ourselves: for either we fall under ourselves by sinful 
cogitation, or else we are, by the grace of contemplation, 
lifted above ourselves: for he that kept hogs, through wandering 
of his mind and unclean thoughts, fell under himself: but he 
whom the Angel delivered out of prison, being also rapt by the 
Angel into an ecstasy, was in truth out of himself, but yet 
above himself. Both of them, therefore, did return unto 
themselves; the one when he recollected himself, and forsook his 
lewd kind of life; and the other from the top of contemplation, 
to have that usual judgment and understanding, which before he 
had: wherefore venerable Benedict in that solitary wilderness 
dwelt with himself, because he kept himself, and retired his 
cogitations within the closet of his own soul: for when the 
greatness of contemplation rapt him up aloft, out of all question 
he did then leave himself under himself.  
<p>
PETER. Your discourse doth very well content me: yet I beseech 
you to answer me this question, whether he could in conscience 
give over those monks, whose government he had now taken upon 
him?  
<p>
GREGORY. In mine opinion, Peter, evil men may with good 
conscience be tolerated in that community, where there be some 
good that may be holpen, and reap commodity. But where there be 
none good at all, that receive spiritual profit, often times all 
labour is lost, that <A NAME="p60"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|60</SPAN></A> is bestowed in bringing of such to good 
order, especially if other occasions be offered of doing God 
presently better service elsewhere: for whose good, then, should 
the holy man have expected, seeing them all to persecute him 
with one consent? and (that which is not to be passed over with 
silence) those that be perfect carry always this mind, that when 
they perceive their labour to be fruitless in one place, to 
remove straight to another, where more good may be done.<p>
And for this cause, that notable preacher of the word,<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> who was 
desirous to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, <i> unto whom to live 
is Christ, and to die is gain</i> <sup><A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A></sup>:  and who not only 
desired himself to suffer persecution, but did also animate and 
encourage others to suffer the same; yet being himself in persecution 
at Damascus, got a rope and a basket to pass over the wall, and was 
privily let down. What then? shall we say that 
Paul was afraid of death, when as himself said, that he desired 
it for Christ's sake? not so: but when he perceived that in that 
place little good was to be done by great labour, he reserved 
himself to further labour, where more fruit and better success 
might be expected: and therefore the valiant soldier of Christ 
would not be kept within walls, but sought for a larger field 
where he might more freely labour for his master. And so, in 
like manner, you shall quickly perceive, if you mark well, that 
venerable Benedict forsook not so many in one place, that were 
unwilling to be taught, as he did in sundry other places raise 
up from the death of soul many more, that were willing to be 
instructed.  
<p>
PETER. It is so as you say, and plain reason teacheth it, and 
the example of St. Paul alleged doth confirm it. But I beseech 
you to return unto your former purpose, and to prosecute the 
life of the holy man.  
<p>
GREGORY. When as God's servant daily increased in <A NAME="p61"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|61</SPAN></A>
virtue, and 
became continually more famous for miracles, many were by him in 
the same place drawn to the service of almighty God, so that by 
Christ's assistance he built there twelve Abbeys; over which he 
appointed governors, and in each of them placed twelve monks, 
and a few he kept with himself, namely, such as he thought would 
more profit, and be better instructed by his own presence. At 
that time also many noble and religious men of Rome came unto 
him, and committed their children to be brought up under him, 
for the service of God. Then also Evitius delivered him Maurus,<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> 
and Tertullius the Senator brought Placidus, being their sons of 
great hope and towardness: of which two, Maurus, growing to 
great virtue, began to be his master's coadjutor; but Placidus, 
as yet, was but a boy of tender years.
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A></SPAN>Chapter Four: how Benedict
reformed a monk that would not stay at his prayers.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
In one of the monasteries which he had built in those parts, a 
monk there was, which could not continue at prayers; for when 
the other monks knelt down to serve God, his manner was to go 
forth, and there with wandering mind to busy himself about some 
earthly and transitory things. And when he had been often by his 
Abbot admonished of this fault without any amendment, at length 
he was sent to the man of God, who did likewise very much rebuke 
him for his folly; yet notwithstanding, returning back again, he 
did scarce two days follow the holy man's admonition; for, upon 
the third day, he fell again to his old custom, and would not 
abide within at the time of prayer: word whereof being once more 
sent to the man of God, by the father of the Abbey whom he had 
there appointed, he returned him answer that he would come 
himself, and reform what was amiss, which he did accordingly: 
and it fell so out, that when the singing of psalms was ended, 
and the hour come in which the monks betook themselves <A NAME="p62"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|62</SPAN></A>
to 
prayer, the holy man perceived that the monk, which used at that 
time to go forth, was by a little black boy drawn out by the 
skirt of his garment; upon which sight, he spake secretly to 
Pompeianus, father of the Abbey, and also to Maurus saying Do 
you not see who it is, that draweth this monk from his prayers?" 
and they answered him, that they did not. "Then let us pray," 
quoth he, "unto God, that you also may behold whom this monk 
doth follow": and after two days Maurus did see him, but 
Pompeianus could not.  
<p>
Upon another day, when the man of God had ended his devotions, 
he went out of the oratory, where he found the foresaid monk 
standing idle, whom for the blindness of his heart he strake with 
a little wand, and from that day forward he was so freed from all 
allurement of the little black boy, that he remained quietly at 
his prayers, as other of the monks did: for the old enemy was so 
terrified, that he durst not any more suggest any such cogitations: 
as though by that blow, not the monk, but himself had been strooken.  
<blockquote>

<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A></SPAN>Chapter Five: of a
fountain that sprung forth in the top of a mountain, by the prayers of the man
of God.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
Amongst the monasteries which he had built in those parts, three 
of them were situated upon the rocks of a mountain, so that very 
painful it was for the monks to go down and fetch water, 
especially because the side of the hill was so steep that there 
was great fear of danger: and therefore the monks of those 
Abbeys with one consent came unto the servant of God, Benedict, 
giving him to understand, how laborious it was for them daily to 
go down unto the lake for water: and therefore they added, that 
it was very necessary to have them removed to some other places.  
The man of God, comforting them with sweet words, caused them to 
return back again; and the next night, having with him only the 
little boy Placidus (of whom we spake before), he ascended up to 
the rock <A NAME="p63"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|63</SPAN></A> of that mountain, and continued there a long time in 
prayer; and when he had done, he took three stones, and laid 
them in the same place for a mark, and so, none of them being 
privy to that he had done, he returned back to his own Abbey.  
And the next day, when the foresaid monks came again about their 
former business, he said thus unto them: "Go your way to the 
rock, and in the place where you find three stones laid one upon 
another, dig a little hole, for almighty God is able to bring 
forth water in the top of that mountain, and so to ease you of 
that great labour which you take in fetching it so far." Away 
they went, and came to the rock of the mountain according to his 
direction, which they found as it were sweating drops of water, 
and after they had with a spade made an hollow place, it was 
straightways filled, and water flowed out so abundantly, that it 
doth plentifully, even to this day, spring out and run down from 
the top to the very bottom of that hill.

<p>
At another time, a certain Goth, poor of spirit, that gave over 
the world, was received by the man of God; whom on a day he 
commanded to take a bill, and to cleanse a certain plot of ground 
from briers, for the making of a garden, which ground was by the 
side of a lake. The Goth as he was there labouring, by chance 
the head of the bill slipped off, and fell into the water, which 
was so deep, that there was no hope ever to get it again.<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> The 
poor Goth, in great fear, ran unto Maurus and told him what he 
had lost, confessing his own fault and negligence: Maurus 
forthwith went to the servant of God, giving him to understand 
thereof, who came straightways to the lake: and took the handle 
out of the Goth's hand, and put it into the water, and the iron 
head by and by ascended from the bottom, and <A NAME="p64"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|64</SPAN></A>
entered again into 
the handle of the bill, which he delivered to the Goth, saying: 
"Behold here is thy bill again, work on, and be sad no more."
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C7"></A></SPAN>Chapter Seven: how Maurus
walked upon the water.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
On a certain day, as venerable Benedict was, in his cell, the 
foresaid young Placidus, the holy man's monk, went out to take 
up water at the lake, and putting down his pail carelessly, fell 
in himself after it, whom the water forthwith carried away from 
the land so far as one may shoot an arrow. The man of God, being 
in his cell, by and by knew this, and called in haste for 
Maurus, saying: "Brother Maurus, run as fast as you can, for 
Placidus, that went to the lake to fetch water, is fallen in, 
and is carried a good way off." 
<p>
A strange thing, and since the time of Peter the Apostle never 
heard of! Maurus, craving his father's blessing, and departing 
in all haste at his commandment, ran to that place upon the water, 
to which the young lad was carried by force thereof, thinking that 
he had all that while gone upon the land: and taking fast hold of him 
by the hair of his head, in all haste he returned back again: and 
so soon as he was at land, coming to himself he looked behind 
him, and then knew very well that he had before run upon the 
water: and that which before he durst not have presumed, being 
now done and past, he both marvelled, and was afraid at that 
which he had done.  
<p>
Coming back to the father, and telling him what had happened, the 
venerable man did not attribute this to his own merits, but to the 
obedience of Maurus: but Maurus on the contrary, said that it was done 
only upon his commandment, and that he had nothing to do in that miracle, 
not knowing at that time what he did. But the friendly contention 
proceeding of mutual humility, the young youth himself that was saved from 
drowning did determine: for he said that he saw when he was drawn out of the 
water the Abbot's garment upon his <A NAME="p65"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|65</SPAN></A> head, affirming that it was he that had 
delivered him from that great danger.  
<p>
PETER. Certainly they be wonderful things which you report, and such 
as may serve for the edification of many : for mine own part, the more 
that I hear of his miracles, the more do I still desire.
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C8"></A></SPAN>Chapter Eight: how a loaf
was poisoned, and carried far off by a crow.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
GREGORY. When as the foresaid monasteries were zealous in the love of 
our Lord Jesus Christ, and their fame dispersed far and near, and many 
gave over the secular life, and subdued the passions of their soul, 
under the light yoke of our Saviour: then (as the manner of wicked 
people is, to envy at that virtue which themselves desire not to 
follow) one Florentius, Priest of a church hardby, and grandfather to 
Florentius our sub-deacon, possessed with diabolical malice, began to 
envy the holy man's virtues, to back-bite his manner of living, and to 
withdraw as many as he could from going to visit him : and when he saw 
that he could not hinder his virtuous proceedings, but that, on the 
contrary, the fame of his holy life increased, and many daily, upon 
the very report of his sanctity, did betake themselves to a better 
state of life : burning more and more with the coals of envy, he 
became far worse; and though he desired not to imitate his 
commendable life, yet fain he would have had the reputation of his 
virtuous conversation.  
<p>
In conclusion so much did malicious envy blind him, and so far did he 
wade in that sin, that he poisoned a loaf and sent it to the servant of 
almighty God, as it were for an holy present.  The man of God received 
it with great thanks, yet not ignorant of that which was hidden within.  
At dinner time, a crow daily used to come unto him from the next wood, 
which took bread at his hands; coming that day after his manner, the 
man of God threw him the loaf which the Priest had sent him, giving 
him this charge: <A NAME="p66"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|66</SPAN></A> "In the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, take up that 
loaf, and leave it in some such place where no man may find it."  Then 
the crow, opening his mouth, and lifting up his wings, began to hop up 
and down about the loaf, and after his manner to cry out, as though he 
would have said that he was willing to obey, and yet could not do what 
he was commanded.  The man of God again and again bade him, saying: 
"Take it up without fear, and throw it where no man may find it."  At 
length, with much ado, the crow took it up, and flew away, and after 
three hours, having dispatched the loaf, he returned back again, and 
received his usual allowance from the man of God.  
<p>
But the venerable father, perceiving the Priest so wickedly 
bent against his life, was far more sorry for him than 
grieved for himself. And Florentius, seeing that he could 
not kill the body of the master, laboureth now what he 
can, to destroy the souls of his disciples; and for that purpose 
he sent into the yard of the Abbey before their eyes 
seven naked young women, which did there take hands 
together, play and dance a long time before them, to the 
end that, by this means, they might inflame their minds 
to sinful lust: which damnable sight the holy man beholding 
out of his cell, and fearing the danger which thereby 
might ensue to his younger monks, and considering that 
all this was done only for the persecuting of himself, he 
gave place to envy; and therefore, after he had for those 
abbeys and oratories which he had there built appointed 
governors, and left some under their charge, himself, in the 
company of a few monks, removed to another place.  
<p>
And thus the man of God, upon humility, gave place to the 
other's malice; but yet almighty God of justice did 
severely punish [Florentius'] wickedness. For when the foresaid 
Priest, being in his chamber, understood of the departure 
of holy Benedict, and was very glad of that news, behold 
(the whole house besides continuing safe and sound) that <A NAME="p67"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|67</SPAN></A>
chamber alone in which he was, fell down, and so killed 
him: which strange accident the holy man's disciple 
Maurus understanding, straightways sent him word, he 
being as yet scarce ten miles off, desiring him to return 
again, because the Priest that did persecute him was slain; 
which thing when Benedict heard, he was passing sorrowful, 
and lamented much: both because his enemy died in 
such sort, and also for that one of his monks rejoiced 
thereat; and therefore he gave him penance, for that, 
sending such news, he presumed to rejoice at his enemy's 
death.  
<p>
PETER. The things you report be strange, and much to be 
wondered at: for in making the rock to yield forth water, 
I see Moses; and in the iron, which came from the bottom 
of the lake, I behold Eliseus; in the walking of Maurus 
upon the water, I perceive Peter; in the obedience of the 
crow, I contemplate Elias; and in lamenting the death of 
his enemy, I acknowledge David: and therefore, in mine 
opinion, this one man was full of the spirit of all good 
men.<p>GREGORY. The man of god, Benedict, had the spirit of the 
one true God, who, by the grace of our redemption, hath 
filled the hearts of his elect servants; of whom St. John 
saith: <i>He was the true light, which doth lighten every 
man coming into this world</i>, <sup><A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A></sup>.  Of whom, again, 
we find it written: <i>Of his fulness we have all received</i>, <sup><A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A></sup>.  For God's holy servants might receive virtues 
of our Lord, but to bestow them upon others they could 
not; and therefore it was he that gave the signs of miracles 
to his servants, who promised to give the sign of Jonas to 
his enemies <sup><A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A></sup>: so that he vouchsafed to die in 
the sight of the proud, and to rise again before the eyes of 
the humble: to the end, that they might behold what they 
contemned, and those see that which they ought to worship 
and love: by reason of which mystery it cometh to pass 
that, whereas <A NAME="p68"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|68</SPAN></A> the proud cast their eyes upon the contempt 
of his death, the humble contrariwise, against death, lay 
hold of the glory of his power and might.  
<p>
PETER. To what places, I pray you, after this, did the holy 
man go: and whether did he afterward in them work any 
miracles, or no?  
<p>
GREGORY. The holy man, changing his place, did not for all that 
change his enemy.  For afterward he endured so much the more grievous 
battles, by how much he had now the master of all wickedness fighting 
openly against him.  For the town, which is called Cassino, standeth 
upon the side of an high mountain, which containeth, as it were in the 
lap thereof, the foresaid town, and afterward so riseth in height the 
space of three miles, that the top thereof seemeth to touch the very 
heavens:  in this place there was an ancient chapel in which the 
foolish and simple country people, according to the custom of the old 
gentiles, worshipped the god Apollo.  Round about it likewise upon all 
sides, there were woods for the service of the devils, in which even 
to that very time, the mad multitude of infidels did offer most wicked 
sacrifice.  The man of God coming thither, beat in pieces the idol, 
overthrew the altar, set fire to the woods, and in the temple of 
Apollo, he built the oratory of St. Martin, and where the altar of the 
same Apollo was, he made an oratory of St. John:  and by his continual 
preaching, he brought the people dwelling in those parts to embrace 
the faith of Christ.<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>  
<p>
The old enemy of mankind, not taking this in good part, did not 
privily or in a dream, but in open sight present himself to the eyes 
of that holy father, and with great outcries complained that he had 
offered him violence.  The noise which he made, the monks did hear, 
but himself they could not see:  but, as the venerable father told 
them, he appeared visibly unto him most fell and cruel, and as though, 
with his fiery mouth and flaming eyes, he would have torn him in 
pieces:  what the devil <A NAME="p69"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|69</SPAN></A> said unto him, all the monks did hear; for 
first he would call him by his name, and because the man of God 
vouchsafed him not any answer, then would he fall a-reviling and 
railing at him:  for when he cried out, calling him "Blessed Benedict,&quot; 
and yet found that he gave him no answer, straightways he would turn 
his tune, and say:  "Cursed Benedict, and not blessed:  what hast thou 
to do with me?  and why dost thou thus persecute me?"  Wherefore new 
battles of the old enemy against the servant of God are to be looked 
for, against whom willingly did he make war, but, against his will, 
did he give him occasion of many notable victories.
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C9"></A></SPAN>Chapter Nine: how
venerable Benedict, by his prayer, removed a huge stone.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
Upon a certain day, when the monks were building up the cells of 
the same Abbey, there lay a stone which they meant to employ about that 
business: and when two or three were not able to remove it, they called 
for more company, but all in vain, for it remained so immovable as though 
it had grown to the very earth: whereby they plainly perceived that the 
devil himself did sit upon it, seeing so may men's hands could not so 
much as once move it: wherefore, finding that their own labours could do 
nothing, they sent for the man of God, to help them with his prayers 
against the devil, who hindered the removing of that stone.  The holy man 
came, and after some praying, he gave it his blessing, and then they 
carried it away so quickly, as though it had been of no weight at all.  
<blockquote>

Then the man of God thought good that they should presently 
before his departure dig up the ground in the same place; which being 
done, and a deep hole made, the monks found there an idol of brass, which 
being for a little while by chance cast into the kitchen, they beheld 
fire suddenly to come from it, which <A NAME="p70"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|70</SPAN></A>
to all their sight seemed to set the 
whole kitchen on fire; for the quenching whereof, the monks by casting on 
of water made such a noise, that the man of God, hearing it, came to see 
what the matter was: and himself beholding not any fire at all,which they 
said that they did, he bowed down his head forthwith to his prayers, and 
then he perceived that they were deluded with fantastical fire, and 
therefore bad them bless their eyes, that they might behold the kitchen 
safe and sound, and not those fantastical flames, which the devil had 
falsely devised.

<p>
Again, as the monks were making of a certain wall somewhat 
higher, because that was requisite, the man of God in the 
meantime was in his cell at his prayers. To whom the old enemy 
appeared in an insulting manner, telling him, that he was now 
going to his monks, that were a-working: whereof the man of God, 
in all haste, gave them warning, wishing them to look unto 
themselves, because the devil was at that time coming amongst 
them. The message was scarce delivered, when as the wicked 
spirit overthrew the new wall which they were a building, and 
with the fall slew a little young child, a monk, who was the son 
of a certain courtier.<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> At which pitiful chance all were passing 
sorry and exceedingly grieved, not so much for the loss of the 
wall, as for the death of their brother: and in all haste they 
sent this heavy news to the venerable man Benedict; who commanded 
them to bring unto him the young boy, mangled and maimed as he 
was, which they did, but yet they could not carry him any 
otherwise than in a sack: for the stones of the wall had not 
only broken his limbs, but also his very bones. Being in that 
manner brought unto the man of God, he bad them to lay him in 
his cell, and in that place upon which he used to pray; and 
then, putting them all forth, he shut <A NAME="p71"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|71</SPAN></A>
the door, and fell more 
instantly to his prayers than he used at other times. And O 
strange miracle! for the very same hour he made him sound, and 
as lively as ever he was before; and sent him again to his 
former work, that he also might help the monks to make an end of 
that wall, of whose death the old serpent thought he should have 
insulted over Benedict, and greatly triumphed.

<p>
Among other miracles which the man of God did, he began also to 
be famous for the spirit of prophecy: as to foretell what was to 
happen, and to relate unto them that were present, such things 
as were done in absence. The order of his Abbey was, that when 
the monks went abroad (to deliver any message) never to eat or 
drink anything out of their cloister: and this being diligently 
observed, according to the prescription of their rule, upon a 
certain day some of the monks went forth upon such business: and 
being enforced about the dispatch thereof to tarry somewhat long 
abroad, it fell so out that they stayed at the house of a 
religious woman, where they did eat and refresh themselves. And 
being late before they came back to the Abbey, they went as the 
manner was, and asked their father's blessing: of whom he 
demanded where they had eaten: and they said nowhere. "Why do 
you," quoth he, "tell an untruth? for did you not go into such a 
woman's house? and eat such and such kind of meat, and drink so 
many cups?" When they heard him recount so in particular, both 
where they had stayed, what kind of meat they had eaten, and how 
often they had drunk, and perceived well that he knew all 
whatsoever they had done, they fell down trembling at his feet, 
and confessed that they had done wickedly: who straightways 
pardoned them for that fault, persuading himself <A NAME="p72"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|72</SPAN></A>
that they would 
not any more in his absence presume to do any such thing, seeing 
they now perceived that he was present with them in spirit.

</blockquote>
<p>
A brother also of Valentinian the monk, of whom I made mention 
before, was a layman, but devout and religious: who used every 
year, as well to desire the prayers of God's servant, as also to 
visit his natural brother, to travel from his own house to the 
Abbey: and his manner was, not to eat anything all that day 
before he came thither. Being therefore upon a time in his 
journey, he lighted into the company of another that carried 
meat about him to eat by the way: who, after the day was well 
spent, spake unto him in this manner: "Come, brother," quoth he, 
"let us refresh ourselves, that we faint not in our journey": to 
whom he answered: "God forbid: for eat I will not by any means, 
seeing I am now going to the venerable father Benedict, and my 
custom is to fast until I see him." The other, upon this answer, 
said no more for the space of an hour. But afterward, having 
travelled a little further again he was in hand with him to eat 
something: yet then likewise he utterly refused, because he 
meant to go through fasting as he was. His companion was 
content, and so went forward with him, without taking anything 
himself.  But when they had now gone very far, and were well 
wearied with long travelling, at length they came unto a meadow, 
where there was a fountain, and all such other pleasant things 
as use to refresh men's bodies. Then his companion said to him 
again: "Behold here is water, a green meadow, and a very sweet 
place, in which we may refresh ourselves and rest a little, that 
we may be the better able to dispatch the rest of our journey." 
Which kind words bewitching his ears, and the pleasant place 
flattering his eyes, content he was to yield unto <A NAME="p73"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|73</SPAN></A>
the motion, 
and so they fell to their meat together: and coming afterward in 
the evening to the Abbey, they brought him to the venerable 
father Benedict, of whom he desired his blessing. Then the holy 
man objected against him what he had done in the way, speaking 
to him in this manner: "How fell it out, brother," quoth he, 
"that the devil talking to you, by means of your companion, 
could not at the first nor second time persuade you: but yet he 
did at the third, and made you do what best pleased him?" The 
good man, hearing these words, fell down at his feet, confessing 
the fault of his frailty; was grieved, and so much the more 
ashamed of his sin, because he perceived that though he were 
absent, that yet he did offend in the sight of that venerable 
father.

PETER. I see well that the holy man had in his soul the spirit 
of Heliseus, who was present with his servant Giezi, being then 
absent from him.

dissimulation of king Totila was discovered and found out by venerable Benedict.</b><A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A></u>
</blockquote>
<p>
GREGORY. You must, good Peter, for a little while be silent, 
that you may know matters yet far more important. For in the 
time of the Goths, when Totila, their king, understood that the 
holy man had the spirit of prophecy, as he was going towards his 
monastery, he remained in a place somewhat far off, and 
beforehand sent the father word of his coming: to whom answer 
was returned, that he might come at his pleasure.  The king, as 
he was a man wickedly disposed, thought he would try whether the 
man of God were a prophet, as it was reported, or no. A certain 
man of his guard he had, called Riggo, upon whom he caused his 
own shoes to be put, and to be apparelled with his other 
princely robes, commanding him to go as it were himself to the 
man of God; and to give the better colour to this device, he 
sent three to attend upon him, who especially were <A NAME="p74"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|74</SPAN></A>
always about 
the king: to wit, Vultericus, Rudericus, and Blindinus; charging 
them that in the presence of the servant of God, they should be 
next about him, and behave themselves in such sort as though he 
had been king Totila indeed: and that diligently they should do 
unto him all other services, to the end that both by such 
dutiful kind of behaviour, as also by his purple robes, he might 
verily be taken for the king himself.  Riggo, furnished with 
that brave apparel, and accompanied with many courtiers, came 
unto the Abbey: at which time the man of God sat a little way 
off, and when Riggo was come so near that he might well 
understand what the man of God said, then, in the hearing of 
them all, he spake thus: "Put off, my good son, put off that 
apparel, for that which thou hast on, is none of thine." Riggo, 
hearing this, fell straightways down to the ground, and was very 
much afraid, for presuming to go about to mock so worthy a man, 
and all his attendants and servitors fell down likewise to the 
earth, and after they were up again, they durst not approach any 
nearer to his presence: but returned back to their king, telling 
him with fear, how quickly they were discovered.
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C15"></A></SPAN>Chapter Fifteen: how
venerable Benedict prophesied to king Totila, and also to the Bishop of
Camisina, such things as were afterwards to happen.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then Totila himself in person went unto the man of God; and 
seeing him sitting afar off, he durst not come near, but fell 
down to the ground: whom the holy man (speaking to him twice or 
thrice) desired to rise up and at length came unto him, and with 
his own hands lifted him up from the earth, where he lay 
prostrate: and then, entering into talk, he reprehended him for 
his wicked deeds, and in few words told him all that which 
should befall him, saying: "Much wickedness do you daily commit, 
and many great sins have you done: now at length give over your 
sinful life. Into the city of <A NAME="p75"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|75</SPAN></A> Rome shall you enter, and over the 
sea shall you pass: nine years shall you reign, and in the tenth 
shall you leave this mortal life." The king, hearing these 
things, was wonderfully afraid, and desiring the holy man to 
commend him to God in his prayers, he departed: and from that 
time forward he was nothing so cruel as before he had been. Not 
long after he went to Rome, sailed over into Sicily, and, in the 
tenth year of his reign, he lost his kingdom together with his 
life.  
<p>
The Bishop also of Camisina <A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> used to visit the servant of 
God, whom the holy man dearly loved for his virtuous life. The 
Bishop, therefore, talking with him of King Totila, of his 
taking of Rome, and the destruction of that city, said: "This 
city will be so spoiled and ruined by him, that it will never be 
more inhabited." To whom the man of God answered: "Rome," quoth 
he, "shall not be utterly destroyed by strangers: but shall be 
so shaken with tempests, lightnings, whirlwinds, and 
earthquakes, that it will fall to decay of itself." The 
mysteries of which prophecy we now behold as clear as the day: 
for we see before our eyes in this very city, by a strange 
whirlwind the world shaken, houses ruined, and churches 
overthrown, and buildings rotten with old age we behold daily to 
fall down. True it is that Honoratus, by whose relation I had 
this, saith not that he received it from his own mouth, but that 
he had it of other monks, which did hear it themselves.

<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C16"></A></SPAN>Chapter Sixteen: of a
certain clergyman, whom venerable Benedict for a time delivered from a devil.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
At the same time a certain clergyman, that served in the church 
of Aquinum, was possessed: whom the venerable man Constantius,<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A> 
Bishop of the same city, sent unto many places of holy martyrs 
for help: but God's holy martyrs would not deliver him, to the 
end that the world might know what great grace was in the 
servant of God, Benedict: wherefore at length he was brought unto 
him, <A NAME="p76"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|76</SPAN></A> who, praying for help to Jesus Christ our Lord, did 
forthwith cast the old enemy out of the possessed man's body, 
giving him this charge: "Go your way, and hereafter abstain from 
eating of flesh, and presume not to enter into holy orders, for 
whensoever you shall attempt any such thing, the devil again 
will have power over you." The man departed safe and sound, and 
because punishment fresh in memory useth to terrify the mind, he 
observed for a time what the man of God had given him in 
commandment. But after many years, when all his seniors were 
dead, and he saw his juniors preferred before him to holy 
orders, he neglected the words of the man of God, as though 
forgotten through length of time, and took upon him holy orders: 
whereupon straightways the devil that before had left him 
entered again, and never gave over to torment him, until he had 
separated his soul from his body.  
<p>
PETER. This holy man, as I perceive, did know the secret counsel 
of God: for he saw that this clergyman was delivered to the 
power of the devil, to the end he should not presume to enter 
into holy orders.<p>GREGORY. Why should he not know the secrets of God, who kept the 
commandments of God: when as the scripture saith: <i>He that 
cleaveth unto our Lord, is one spirit with him?</i> <sup><A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A></sup><p>PETER.
If he that cleaveth unto our Lord, be one spirit with our 
Lord, what is the meaning of that which the Apostle saith: <i>Who 
knoweth the sense of our Lord, or who hath been his counsellor?</i> <sup><A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A></sup>, for it seemeth very inconvenient to be ignorant of 
his sense, to whom being so united he is made one thing.  
<p>
GREGORY. Holy men, in that they be one with our Lord are not 
ignorant of his sense: for the same Apostle saith <sup><A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A></sup>:
<i>For what man 
knoweth those things which belong to man, but the spirit of man 
which is in him? Even so,</i> <A NAME="p77"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|77</SPAN></A> <i>the things which belong to God, no 
man knoweth, but the spirit of God.</i>  And to show 
also that he knew such things as belong to God, he addeth 
straight after: <i>But we have not received the spirit of this 
world, but the spirit which is of God.</i> And for this cause, 
again he saith: <i>that eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor it 
hath ascended into the heart of man, those things which God hath 
prepared for them that love him, but God hath revealed to us by 
his spirit.</i><p>PETER. If, then, the mysteries of God were revealed to the same 
Apostle by the spirit of God, why did he then, entreating of 
this question, set down these words beforehand, saying: <i>O the 
depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God: how 
incomprehensible be his judgments, and his ways investigable?</i> <sup>2</sup><p>
And again, whiles I am thus speaking of this matter, another 
question cometh to my mind: for the prophet David said to our 
Lord: <i>With my lips have I uttered all the judgments of thy mouth</i>. Wherefore, seeing it is less to know, 
than to utter: what is the reason that St. Paul affirmeth the 
judgments of God to be incomprehensible; and yet David saith that 
he did not know only them, but also with his lips pronounce them?  
<p>
GREGORY. To both these questions I have already briefly 
answered, when I said that holy men, in that they be one with 
our Lord, are not ignorant of the sense of our Lord.  For all 
such, as do devoutly follow our Lord, be also by devotion one 
with our Lord; and yet for all this, in that they are laden with 
the burthen of their corruptible flesh, they be not with God: 
and so in that they be joined with him, they know the secret 
judgments of God, and in that they be separated from God, they 
know them not: for seeing they do not as yet perfectly penetrate 
his secret mysteries, they give testimony that his judgments be 
incomprehensible.<p>
But those that do with their soul adhere unto him, and cleaving 
unto the sayings of the holy scripture, or to secret revelations, 
acknowledge what they receive: such persons both know <A NAME="p78"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|78</SPAN></A>
these things 
and do utter them: for those judgments which God doth conceal they 
know not, and those which he doth utter they know: and therefore 
the prophet David, when he had said: <i>I have with my lips uttered 
all the judgments</i>; <sup><A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A></sup> he addeth immediately,
<i>of 
thy mouth</i>: as though he should plainly say: Those judgments I may 
both know and utter, which I knew thou didst speak, for those things 
which thou dost not speak, without all question, thou dost conceal from our 
knowledge.  
<p>
Wherefore the saying of David and St. Paul agree together: 
for the judgments of God are incomprehensible; and yet 
those which himself with his own mouth vouchsafeth to speak, are 
uttered with men's tongues: because men may come to the 
knowledge of them, and being revealed, they may be uttered, and 
by no means can be kept secret.  
<p>
PETER. Now I see the answer to my question. But I pray you to 
proceed, if anything yet remaineth to be told of his virtue and 
miracles.

the man of God, Benedict, did foretell the suppression of one of his own Abbeys.</b><A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A></u>
</blockquote>
<p>
GREGORY. A certain noble man called Theoprobus was by the good 
counsel of holy Benedict converted: who, for his virtue and merit 
of life, was very intrinsical and familiar with him. This man 
upon a day, coming into his cell, found him weeping very 
bitterly.  And having expected a good while, and yet not seeing 
him to make an end (for the man of God used not in his prayers 
to weep, but rather to be sad), he demanded the cause of that 
his so great heaviness, to whom he answered straightway, saying: 
"All this Abbey which I have built, and all such things as I 
have made ready for my brethren, are by the judgment of almighty 
God delivered to the gentiles, to be spoiled and overthrown: and 
scarce could I obtain of God to have their lives spared, that 
should then live in it." His words Theoprobus then heard, <A NAME="p79"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|79</SPAN></A>
but we 
see them to be proved most true, who know that very Abbey to be 
now suppressed by the Lombards. For not long since, in the night 
time, when the monks were asleep, they entered in, and spoiled 
all things, but yet not one man could they retain there, and so 
almighty God fulfilled what he promised to his faithful servant: 
for though he gave them the house and all the goods, yet did he 
preserve their lives. In which thing I see that Benedict imitated 
St. Paul: whose ship <sup><A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A></sup> though it lost all the goods, yet, for his 
comfort, he had the lives of all that were in his company 
bestowed upon him, so that no one man was cast away.

<p>
Upon a certain time, Exhilaratus our monk, a lay-brother, whom 
you know, was sent by his master to the monastery of the man of 
God, to carry him two wooden bottles, commonly called flagons, 
full of wine: who in the way, as he was going, hid one of them 
in a bush for himself, and presented the other to venerable Benedict: who took it very thankfully, and, when the man was going 
away, he gave him this warning: "Take heed, my son," quoth he, 
"that thou drinkest not of that flagon which thou hast hidden in 
the bush: but first be careful to bow it down, and thou shalt 
find what is within it." The poor man, thus pitifully confounded 
by the man of God, went his way, and coming back to the place 
where the flagon was hidden, and desirous to try the truth of 
that was told him, as he was bowing it down, a snake 
straightways leaped forth. Then Exhilaratus perceiving what was 
gotten into the wine, began to be afraid of that wickedness 
which he had committed.

<p>
Not far from his Abbey, there was a <A NAME="p80"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|80</SPAN></A> village, in which very many 
men had, by the sermons of Benedict, been converted from idolatry 
to the true faith of Christ. Certain Nuns also there were in the 
same town, to whom he did often send some of his monks to preach 
unto them, for the good of their souls. Upon a day, one that was 
sent, after he had made an end of his exhortation, by the 
entreaty of the Nuns took certain small napkins, and hid them 
for his own use in his bosom: whom, upon his return to the 
Abbey, the man of God very sharply rebuked, saying: "How cometh 
it to pass, brother, that sin is entered into your bosom ?" At 
which words the monk was much amazed for he had quite forgotten 
what he had put there; and therefore knew not any cause why he 
should deserve that reprehension: whereupon the holy man spake 
to him in plain terms, and said: "Was not I present when you 
took the handkerchiefs of the Nuns, and put them up in your 
bosom for your own private use?" The monk, hearing this, fell 
down at his feet, and was sorry that he had behaved himself so 
indiscreetly: forth he drew those napkins from his bosom, and 
threw them all away.

<p>
Upon a time, whiles the venerable Father was at supper, one of 
his monks, who was the son of a great man, held the candle: and 
as he was standing there, and the other at his meat, he began to 
entertain a proud cogitation in his mind, and to speak thus 
within himself: " Who is he, that I thus wait upon at supper, 
and hold him the candle? and who am I, that I should do him any 
such service?" Upon which thought straightways the holy man 
turned himself, and with severe reprehension spake thus unto 
him: "Sign your heart, brother, for what is it that you say?  
Sign your heart": and forthwith he called another of the monks, 
and bad him take the <A NAME="p81"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|81</SPAN></A> candle out of his hands, and commanded him 
to give over his waiting, and to repose himself: who being 
demanded of the monks, what it was that he thought, told them, 
how inwardly he swelled with pride, and what he spake against 
the man of God, secretly in his own heart. Then they all saw 
very well that nothing could be hidden from venerable Benedict, 
seeing the very sound of men's inward thoughts came unto his 
ears.

<p>
At another time, there was a great dearth in the same country of 
Campania: so that all kind of people tasted of the misery: and 
all the wheat of Benedict's monastery was spent, and likewise all 
the bread, so that there remained no more than five loaves for 
dinner.  The venerable man, beholding the monks sad, both 
rebuked them modestly for their pusillanimity, and again did 
comfort them with this promise: "Why," quoth he, "are you so 
grieved in your minds for lack of bread? Indeed, today some want 
there is, but tomorrow you shall have plenty": and so it fell 
out, for the next day two hundred bushels of meal was found in 
sacks before his cell door, which almighty God sent them: but by 
whom, or what means, that is unknown to this very day: which 
miracle when the monks saw, they gave God thanks, and by this 
learned in want, not to make any doubt of plenty.  
<p>
PETER. Tell me, I pray you, whether this servant of God had 
always the spirit of prophecy, when himself pleased, or only at 
certain times?<p>GREGORY. The spirit of prophecy doth not always illuminate the 
minds of the prophets; because, as it is written of the Holy 
Ghost that <i>he breatheth where he will</i> <sup><A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A></sup>, so we are 
also to know that he doth breathe likewise for what cause, and 
when he pleaseth. And <A NAME="p82"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|82</SPAN></A> hereof it cometh, that when king David 
demanded of Nathan <sup><A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A></sup> whether he might build a temple for the 
honour of God, the prophet Nathan gave his consent; and yet 
afterward utterly forbad it. From hence likewise it proceedeth 
that, when Heliseus saw the woman weeping, and knew not the 
cause, he said to his servant that did trouble her: <i>Let her 
alone, for her soul is in grief, and God hath concealed it from 
me, and hath not told me.</i> <sup><A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A></sup> Which thing almighty 
God of great piety so disposeth: for giving at some times the 
spirit of prophecy, and at other times withdrawing it, he doth 
both lift up the prophets minds on high, and yet doth preserve 
them in humility: that by the gift of the Spirit, they may know 
what they are by God's grace: and at other times, destitute of 
the same Spirit, may understand what they are of themselves.  
<p>
PETER. There is very great reason for that you say. But, I pray 
you, let me hear more of the venerable man Benedict, if there be 
anything else that cometh to your remembrance.
<blockquote>
<p>
<u><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C22"></A></SPAN>Chapter Twenty-two: how,
by vision, venerable Benedict disposed the building of the Abbey of Taracina.</b><A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A></u>
</blockquote>
<p>
GREGORY. At another time he was desired by a certain virtuous 
man, to build an Abbey for his monks upon his ground, not far 
from the city of Taracina. The holy man was content, and 
appointed an Abbot and Prior, with divers monks under them: and 
when they were departing, he promised that, upon such a day, he 
would come and shew them in what place the oratory should be 
made, and where the refectory should stand, and all the other 
necessary rooms: and so they, taking his blessing, went their 
way; and against the day appointed, which they greatly expected, 
they made all such things ready as were necessary to entertain 
him, and those that should come in his company. But the very 
night before, the man of God in sleep appeared to&nbsp; <A NAME="p83"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|83</SPAN></A>
the Abbot and 
the Prior, and particularly described unto them where each place 
and office was to be builded. And when they were both risen, 
they conferred together what either of them had seen in their 
sleep: but yet not giving full credit to that vision, they 
expected the man of God himself in person, according to his 
promise. But when they saw that he came not, they returned back 
unto him very sorrowfully, saying: "We expected, father, that 
you should have come according to promise, and told us where 
each place should have been built, which yet you did not." To 
whom he answered: "Why say you so, good brethren? Did not I come 
as I promised you?" And when they asked at what time it was: 
"Why," quoth he, "did not I appear to either of you in your 
sleep, and appointed how and where every place was to be 
builded? Go your way, and according to that platform which you 
then saw, build up the abbey." At which word they much 
marvelled, and returning back, they caused it to be builded in 
such sort as they had been taught of him by revelation.  
<p>
PETER. Gladly would I learn, by what means that could be done: 
to wit, that he should go so far to tell them that thing in 
their sleep, which they should both hear and know by vision.  
<p>
GREGORY. Why do you, Peter, seek out and doubt, in what manner 
this thing was done? For certain it is, that the soul is of a 
more noble nature than the body. And by authority of scripture 
we know that the prophet Habaccuc was carried from Judea with 
that dinner which he had, and was suddenly set in Chaldea <sup><A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A></sup>; by 
which meat the prophet Daniel was relieved: and presently after 
was brought back again to Judea. If, then, Habaccuc could in a 
moment with his body go so far, and carry provision for another 
man's dinner: what marvel is it, if the holy father Benedict 
obtained grace to go in spirit <A NAME="p84"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|84</SPAN></A> and to inform the souls of his 
brethren that were asleep, concerning such things as were 
necessary: and that as Abacuck about corporal meat went 
corporally, so Benedict should go spiritually about the dispatch 
of spiritual business?  
<p>
PETER. I confess that your words have satisfied my doubtful 
mind. But I would know what manner of man he was in his ordinary 
talk and conversation.
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C23"></A></SPAN>Chapter Twenty-three: of
certain Nuns absolved after their death.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
GREGORY. His common talk, Peter, was usually full of virtue: for 
his heart conversed to above in heaven, that no words could in 
vain proceed from his mouth. And if at any time he spake aught, 
yet not as one that determined what was best to be done, but 
only in a threatening manner, his speech in that case was so 
effectual and forcible, as though he had not doubtfully or 
uncertainly, but assuredly pronounced and given sentence.  
<p>
For not far from his Abbey, there lived two Nuns in a place by 
themselves, born of worshipful parentage: whom a religious good 
man did serve for the dispatch of their outward business. But as 
nobility of family doth in some breed ignobility of mind, and 
maketh them in conversation to show less humility, because they 
remember still what superiority they had above others: even so 
was it with these Nuns: for they had not yet learned to temper 
their tongues, and keep them under with the bridle of their 
habit: for often did they by their indiscreet speech provoke the 
foresaid religious man to anger; who having borne with them a 
long time, at length he complained to the man of God, and told 
him with what reproachful words they entreated him: whereupon he 
sent them by and by this message, saying: "Amend your tongues, 
otherwise I do excommunicate you"; which sentence of 
excommunication notwithstanding, he did not then presently 
pronounce against them, but only threatened if they amended not <A NAME="p85"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|85</SPAN></A>
themselves.
But they, for all this, changed their conditions 
nothing at all: both which not long after departed this life, 
and were buried in the church: and when solemn mass was 
celebrated in the same church, and the Deacon, according to 
custom, said with loud voice: "If any there be that do not 
communicate, let them depart": the nurse, which used to give 
unto our Lord an offering for them, beheld them at that time to 
rise out of their graves, and to depart the church. Having often 
times, at those words of the Deacon, seen them leave the church, 
and that they could not tarry within, she remembered what 
message the man of God sent them whiles they were yet alive. For 
he told them that he did deprive them of the communion, unless 
they did amend their tongues and conditions. Then with great 
sorrow, the whole matter was signified to the man of God, who 
straightways with his own hands gave an oblation, saying: "Go 
your ways, and cause this to be offered unto our Lord for them, 
and they shall not remain any longer excommunicate": which 
oblation being offered for them, and the Deacon, as he used, 
crying out, that such as did not communicate should depart, they 
were not seen any more to go out of the church: whereby it was 
certain that, seeing they did not depart with them which did not 
communicate, that they had received the communion of our Lord by 
the hands of his servant.  
<p>
PETER. It is very strange that you report: for how could he, 
though a venerable and most holy man, yet living in mortal body, 
loose those souls which stood now before the invisible judgment 
of God?<p>GREGORY. Was he not yet, Peter, mortal, that heard from our 
Saviour: <i>Whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be 
bound also in the heavens: and whatsoever thou shalt loose in 
earth, shall be loosed also in the heavens?</i> <sup><A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A></sup> whose 
place of binding and loosing those have at this time, <A NAME="p86"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|86</SPAN></A> which by 
faith and virtuous life possess the place of holy government: 
and to bestow such power upon earthly men, the Creator of heaven 
and earth descended from heaven to earth: and that flesh might 
judge of spiritual things, God, who for man's sake was made 
flesh, vouchsafed to bestow upon him: for from thence our 
weakness did rise up above itself, from whence the strength of 
God was weakened under itself.  
<p>
PETER. For the virtue of his miracles, your words do yield a 
very good reason.
<blockquote>
<p>

<p>
GREGORY. Upon a certain day, a young boy that was a monk, 
loving his parents more than reason would, went from the Abbey 
to their house, not craving the father's blessing beforehand: 
and the same day that he came home unto them, he departed this 
life. And being buried, his body, the next day after, was found 
cast out of the grave; which they caused again to be put in, and 
again, the day following, they found it as before. Then in great 
haste they went to the man of God, fell down at his feet, and 
with many tears beseeched him that he would vouchsafe him that 
was dead of his favour. To whom the man of God with his own 
hands delivered the holy communion of our Lord's body, saying: 
"Go, and lay with great reverence this our Lord's body upon his 
breast, and so bury him": which when they had done, the dead 
corpse after that remained quietly in the grave. By which you 
perceive, Peter, of what merit he was with our Lord Jesus 
Christ, seeing the earth would not give entertainment to his 
body, who departed this world out of Benedict's favour.  
<p>
PETER. I perceive it very well, and do wonderfully admire it.

GREGORY. A certain monk there was so inconstant and fickle of 
mind, <A NAME="p87"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|87</SPAN></A> that he would needs give over the Abbey; for which fault 
of his, the man of God did daily rebuke him, and often times 
gave him good admonitions: but yet, for all this, by no means 
would he tarry amongst them, and therefore continual suit he 
made that he might be discharged.  The venerable man upon a 
time, wearied with his importunity, in anger bad him depart; who 
was no sooner out of the Abbey gate, but he found a dragon in 
the way expecting him with open mouth, which being about to 
devour him, he began in great fear and trembling to cry out 
aloud, saying: "Help, help! for this dragon will eat me up." At 
which noise the monks running out, dragon they saw none, but 
finding him there shaking and trembling, they brought him back 
again to the Abbey, who forthwith promised that he would never 
more forsake the monastery, and so ever after he continued in 
his profession: for by the prayers of the holy man, he saw the 
dragon coming against him, whom before, when he saw not, he did 
willingly follow.

relation of the honourable man, Anthony, who said that his 
father's boy was so pitifully punished with a leprosy, that all 
his hair fell off, his body swelled, and filthy corruption did 
openly come forth.  Who being sent by his father to the man of

<p>
Neither is that to be omitted, which one of his disciples called 
Peregrinus used to tell: for he said that, upon a certain day, 
an honest man, who was in debt, found no other means to help 
himself, but thought it his best way to acquaint the man of God 
with his necessity: whereupon he came to the Abbey, and finding 
the servant of almighty God, gave him to understand, how he was <A NAME="p88"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|88</SPAN></A>
troubled by his creditor for twelve shillings which he did owe 
him. To whom the venerable man said that himself had not so much 
money, yet giving him comfortable words, he said: "Go your ways, 
and after two days come to me again, for I can not presently 
help you": in which two days, after his manner, he bestowed 
himself in prayer: and when upon the third day the poor man came 
back there were found suddenly upon the chest of the Abbey, 
which was full of corn, thirteen shillings: which the man of God 
caused to be given to him that required but twelve, both to 
discharge his debt, and also to defray his own charges.  
<p>
But now will I return to speak of such things as I had from the mouth 
of his own scholars, mentioned before in the beginning of this 
book. A certain man there was who had an enemy that did notably 
spite and malign him, whose damnable hatred proceeded so far 
that he poisoned his drink, which, although it killed him not, 
yet did it change his skin in such sort that it was of many 
colours, as though he had been infected with a leprosy: but the 
man of God restored him to his former health: for so soon as he 
touched him, forthwith all that variety of colours departed from 
his body.

<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C28"></A></SPAN>Chapter Twenty-eight: how
a cruet of glass was thrown upon the stones, and not broken.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
At such time as there was a great dearth in Campania, the man of 
God had given away all the wealth of the Abbey to poor people, 
so that in the cellar there was nothing left but a little oil in 
a glass. A certain sub-deacon called Agapitus came unto him, 
instantly craving that he would bestow a little oil upon him.  
Our Lord's servant, that was resolved to give away all upon 
earth that he might find all in heaven, commanded that oil to be 
given him: but the monk that kept the cellar heard what the 
father commanded, yet did he not perform it: who inquiring not 
long after whether he had given that which he willed, the monk 
told him that he had not, <A NAME="p89"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|89</SPAN></A> adding that if he had given it away, 
that there was not any left for the Convent. Then in an anger he 
commanded others to take that glass with the oil, and to throw 
it out at the window, to the end that nothing might remain in 
the Abbey contrary to obedience. The monks did so, and threw it 
out at a window, under which there was an huge downfall, full of 
rough and craggy stones upon which the glass did light, but yet 
continued for all that so sound as though it had never been 
thrown out at all, for neither the glass was broken nor any of 
the oil shed. Then the man of God did command it to be taken up 
again, and, whole as it was, to be given unto him that desired 
it, and in the presence of the other brethren he reprehended the 
disobedient monk, both for his infidelity, and also for his 
proud mind.
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
After which reprehension, with the rest of his brethren he fell 
to praying, and in the place where they were, there stood an 
empty barrel with a cover upon it: and as the holy man continued 
in his prayers, the oil within did so increase, that the cover 
began to be lifted up, and at length fell down, and the oil, 
that was now higher than the mouth of the barrel, began to run 
over upon the pavement, which so soon as the servant of God, Benedict, beheld, forthwith he gave over his prayers, and the oil 
likewise ceased to overflow the barrel. Then he did more at 
large admonish that mistrusting and disobedient monk, that he 
would learn to have faith and humility, who upon so wholesome an 
admonition was ashamed, because the venerable father had by 
miracle shown the power of almighty God, as before he told him 
when he did first rebuke him: and so no cause there was why any 
should afterward doubt of his promise, seeing at one and the 
same time, for a small glass almost empty which he gave away, he 
bestowed upon them an whole barrel full of oil. <A NAME="p90"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|90</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

</blockquote>
<p>
Upon a certain time, as he was going to the oratory of St. John, 
which is in the top of the mountain, the old enemy of mankind 
upon a mule, like a physician, met him, carrying in his hand an 
horn and a mortar. And when he demanded whither he was going: 
"To your monks," quoth he, "to give them a drench" [i.e. a large dose 
of veterinary medicine].  
<p>
The venerable father went forward to his prayers, and when he had 
done, he returned in all haste, but the wicked spirit found an 
old monk drawing of water, into whom he entered, and 
straightways cast him upon the ground, and grievously tormented 
him. The man of God coming from his prayers, and seeing him in 
such pitiful case gave him only a little blow with his hand, and 
at the same instant he cast out that cruel devil, so that he 
durst not any more presume to enter in.  
<p>
PETER. I would gladly know, whether he obtained always by 
prayer, to work such notable miracles; or else sometimes did 
them only at his will and pleasure.<p>GREGORY. Such as be the devout servants of God, when necessity 
requireth, use to work miracles both manner of ways: so that 
sometime they effect wonderful things by their prayers, and 
sometime only by their power and authority: for St. John saith: <i>So many as received him, he gave them power to be made the sons 
of God.</i> <sup><A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A></sup> They, then, that by power be the sons of 
God, what marvel is it, if by power they be able to do wonderful 
things? And that both ways they work miracles, we learn of St.  
Peter: who by his prayers did raise up Tabitha; and by his sharp 
reprehension did sentence Ananias and Sapphira to death for 
their lying.<sup><A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A></sup> For we read not, that in the death of them he 
prayed at all, but only rebuked them for that sin which they had 
committed. Certain therefore it is that sometimes they do these 
things by power, and sometimes by prayer: for Ananias and 
Sapphira by a severe <A NAME="p91"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|91</SPAN></A> rebuke, St. Peter deprived of life: and by 
prayer restored Tabitha to life. And for proof of this, I will 
now tell you of two miracles, which the faithful servant of God, Benedict, did, in which it shall appear most plainly that he 
wrought the one by that power which God gave him, and obtained 
the other by virtue of his prayers.
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C31"></A></SPAN>Chapter Thirty-one: of a
country fellow, that, with the only sight of the man of God, was loosed from his
bands.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
A certain Goth there was called Galla,<A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A> an Arian heretic, who, in 
the time of King Totila, did with such monstrous cruelty 
persecute religious men of the Catholic church, that what priest 
or monk soever came in his presence, he never departed alive.  
This man on a certain day, set upon rapine and pillage, 
pitifully tormented a poor country man, to make him confess 
where his money and wealth was: who, overcome with extremity of 
pain, said that he had committed all his substance to the 
custody of Benedict, the servant of God: and this he did, to the 
end that his tormentor, giving credit to his words, might at 
least for a while surcease from his horrible cruelty.
Galla hearing this tormented him no longer: but binding his arms fast 
with strong cords, drave him before his horse, to bring him unto 
this Benedict, who, as he said, had his wealth in keeping. The 
country fellow, thus pinioned and running before him, carried 
him to the holy man's Abbey, where he found him sitting before 
the gate, reading upon a book. Then turning back to Galla that 
came raging after, he said: "This is father Benedict, of whom I 
told you": who looking upon him, in a great fury, thinking to 
deal as terribly with him as he had with others, cried out aloud 
to him, saying: "Rise up, sirrah, rise up, and deliver me 
quickly such wealth as thou hast of this man's in keeping."
The man of God, hearing such a noise, straightways lifted up his 
eyes from reading, and beheld both him and the country <A NAME="p92"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|92</SPAN></A>
fellow; 
and turning his eyes to his bands, very strangely they fell from 
his arms, and that so quickly as no man with any haste could 
have undone them. Galla, seeing him so wonderfully and quickly 
loosed, fell straight a-trembling, and prostrating himself upon 
the earth bowed down his cruel and stiff neck to the holy man's 
feet, and with humility did commend himself to his prayers. But 
the venerable man for all this rose not up from his reading, but 
calling for some of his monks commanded them to have him in, and 
to give him some meat. And when he was brought back again, he 
gave him a good lesson, admonishing him not to use any more such 
rigour and cruel dealing. His proud mind thus taken down, away 
he went, but durst not demand after that anything of the country 
fellow, whom the man of God, not with hands, but only with his 
eyes, had loosed from his bands. And this is that, Peter, which I told you, that those which in a 
more familiar sort serve God, do sometime, by certain power and 
authority bestowed upon them, work miracles. For he that sitting 
still did appease the fury of that cruel Goth, and unloose with 
his eyes those knots and cords which did pinion the innocent man's 
arms, did plainly shew by the quickness of the miracle, that he 
had received power to work all that which he did. And now will I 
likewise tell you of another miracle, which by prayer he obtained 
at God s hands.
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C32"></A></SPAN>Chapter Thirty-two: how
by prayer venerable Benedict raised up a dead child.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
Being upon a day gone out with his monks to work in the field, a 
country man carrying the corpse of his dead son came to the 
gate of the Abbey, lamenting the loss of his child: and 
inquiring for holy Benedict, they told him that he was abroad with 
his monks in the field. Down at the gate he laid the dead body, 
and with great sorrow of soul ran in haste to seek out the 
venerable father. At the <A NAME="p93"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|93</SPAN></A> same time, the man of God was returning 
homeward from work with his monks: whom so soon as he saw, he 
[the country man] began to cry out: "Give me my son, give me my son!" 
<p>
The man of God, amazed at these words, stood still, and said: "What, 
have I taken away your son?" "No, no," quoth the sorrowful father, " 
but he is dead: come for Christ Jesus' sake and restore him to 
life." 
<p>
The servant of God, hearing him speak in that manner, and 
seeing his monks upon compassion to solicit the poor man's suit, 
with great sorrow of mind he said: "Away, my good brethren, 
away: such miracles are not for us to work, but for the blessed 
Apostles: why will you lay such a burthen upon me, as my 
weakness cannot bear?" But the poor man, whom excessive grief 
enforced, would not give over his petition, but swore that he 
would never depart, except he did raise up his son.  
<p>
"Where is he, then?" quoth God's servant.  
<p>
He answered that his body lay at the gate of the Abbey: to which 
place when the man of God came with his monks, he kneeled down 
and lay upon the body of the little child, and rising, he held up 
his hands towards heaven, and said: "Behold not, O Lord, my sins, 
but the faith of this man, that desireth to have his son raised to 
life, and restore that soul to the body, which thou hast taken away." 
<p>
He had scarce spoken these words, and behold the soul returned back 
again, and therewith the child's body began to tremble in such 
sort that all which were present did behold it in strange manner 
to pant and shake. Then he took it by the hand and gave it to 
his father, but alive and in health. Certain it is, Peter, that 
this miracle was not in his own power, for which prostrate upon 
the ground he prayed so earnestly.  
<p>
PETER. All is most true that before you said, for what you 
affirmed in words, you have now verified by examples and works.  
But tell me, I beseech you, whether holy <A NAME="p94"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|94</SPAN></A>
men can do all such 
things as they please, and obtain at God's hands whatsoever they 
desire.

<u><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C33"></A></SPAN>Chapter Thirty-three: of
a miracle wrought by his sister Scholastica.</b><A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A></u>
</blockquote>
<p>
GREGORY. What man is there, Peter, in this world, that is in 
greater favour with God than St. Paul was: who yet three times 
desired our Lord to be delivered from the prick of the flesh, 
and obtained not his petition? Concerning which point also I 
must needs tell you, how there was one thing which the venerable 
father Benedict would have done, and yet he could not.  
<p>
For his sister called Scholastica, dedicated from her infancy to our 
Lord, used once a year to come and visit her brother. To whom 
the man of God went not far from the gate, to a place that did 
belong to the Abbey, there to give her entertainment.  And she 
coming thither on a time according to her custom, her venerable 
brother with his monks went to meet her, where they spent the 
whole day in the praises of God and spiritual talk: and when it 
was almost night they supped together, and as they were yet 
sitting at the table, talking of devout matters, and darkness 
came on, the holy Nun his sister entreated him to stay there all 
night, that they might spend it in discoursing of the joys of 
heaven. But by no persuasion would he agree unto that, saying 
that he might not by any means tarry all night out of his Abbey.  
<p>
At that time, the sky was so clear that no cloud was to be seen.  
The Nun, receiving this denial of her brother, joining her hands 
together, laid them upon the table: and so, bowing down her head 
upon them, she made her prayers to almighty God: and lifting her 
head from the table, there fell suddenly such a tempest of 
lightning and thundering, and such abundance of rain, that 
neither venerable Benedict, nor his monks that were with him, 
could put their head out of door: for the holy Nun, <A NAME="p95"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|95</SPAN></A>
resting her 
head upon her hands, poured forth such a flood of tears upon the 
table, that she drew the clear air to a watery sky, so that 
after the end of her devotions, that storm of rain followed: and 
her prayer and the rain did so meet together, that as she lifted 
up her head from the table, the thunder began, so that in one 
and the very same instant, she lifted up her head and brought 
down the rain. The man of God, seeing that he could not by 
reason of such thunder and lightning and great abundance of 
rain return back to his Abbey, began to be heavy and to 
complain of his sister, saying: "God forgive you, what have you 
done?" to whom she answered: "I desired you to stay, and you 
would not hear me, I have desired our good Lord, and he hath 
vouchsafed to grant my petition: wherefore if you can now 
depart, in God's name return to your monastery, and leave me here 
alone."<p>
But the good father, being not able to go forth, tarried 
there against his will, where willingly before he would not 
stay. And so by that means they watched all night, and with 
spiritual and heavenly talk did mutually comfort one another: 
and therefore by this we see, as I said before, that he would 
have had that thing, which yet he could not: for if we respect 
the venerable man's mind, no question but he would have had the 
same fair weather to have continued as it was, when he set 
forth, but he found that a miracle did prevent his desire, 
which, by the power of almighty God, a woman's prayers had 
wrought. And it is not a thing to be marvelled at, that a woman 
which of long time had not seen her brother, might do more at 
that time than he could, seeing, according to the saying of St.  
John, <i>God is charity</i> <sup><A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A></sup> and therefore of right she 
did more which loved more.  
<p>
PETER. I confess that I am wonderfully pleased with that which 
you tell me.<A NAME="p96"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|96</SPAN></A>

<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C34"></A></SPAN>Chapter Thirty-four: how
Benedict saw the soul of his sister ascend into heaven.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
GREGORY. The next day the venerable woman returned to her 
Nunnery, and the man of God to his Abbey: who three days after, 
standing in his cell, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, beheld 
the soul of his sister (which was departed from her body), in 
the likeness of a dove to ascend into heaven: who rejoicing much 
to see her great glory, with hymns and lauds gave thanks to 
almighty God, and did impart the news of this her death to his 
monks, whom also he sent presently to bring her corpse to his 
Abbey, to have it buried in that grave which he had provided for 
himself: by means whereof it fell out that, as their souls were 
always one in God whiles they lived, so their bodies continued 
together after their death.
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C35"></A></SPAN>Chapter Thirty-five: how
he saw the whole world represented before his eyes: and also the soul of
Germanus, Bishop of Capua, ascending to heaven.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
At another time, Servandus, the Deacon, and Abbot of that 
monastery, which in times past was founded by the noble man 
Liberius <A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A> in the country of Campania, used ordinarily to come and 
visit the man of God: and the reason why he came so often was, 
because himself also was a man full of heavenly doctrine: and so 
they two had often together spiritual conference, to the end 
that, albeit they could not perfectly feed upon the celestial 
food of heaven, yet, by means of such sweet discourses, they 
might at least, with longing and fervent desire, taste of those 
joys and divine delights. When it was time to go to rest, the 
venerable Father Benedict reposed himself in the top of a tower, 
at the foot whereof Servandus the Deacon was lodged, so that one 
pair of stairs went to them both: before the tower there was a 
certain large room in which both their disciples did lie.  
<p>
The man of God, Benedict, <A NAME="p97"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|97</SPAN></A> being diligent in watching, rose early up 
before the time of matins (his monks being yet at rest) and came 
to the window of his chamber, where he offered up his prayers to 
almighty God. Standing there, all on a sudden in the dead of the 
night, as he looked forth, he saw a light, which banished away 
the darkness of the night, and glittered with such brightness, 
that the light which did shine in the midst of darkness was far 
more clear than the light of the day. Upon this sight a 
marvellous strange thing followed, for, as himself did afterward 
report, the whole world, gathered as it were together under one 
beam of the sun, was presented before his eyes, and whiles the 
venerable father stood attentively beholding the brightness of 
that glittering light, he saw the soul of Germanus, Bishop of 
Capua, in a fiery globe to be carried up by Angels into heaven.<A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>  
<p>
Then, desirous to have some witness of this so notable a 
miracle, he called with a very loud voice Servandus the Deacon 
twice or thrice by his name, who, troubled at such an unusual 
crying out of the man of God, went up in all haste, and looking 
forth saw not anything else, but a little remnant of the light, 
but wondering at so great a miracle, the man of God told him all 
in order what he had seen, and sending by and by to the town of 
Cassino, he commanded the religious man Theoprobus to dispatch 
one that night to the city of Capua, to learn what was become of 
Germanus their Bishop: which being done, the messenger found 
that reverent Prelate departed this life, and enquiring 
curiously the time, he understood that he died at that very 
instant, in which the man of God beheld him ascending up to 
heaven.  
<p>
PETER. A strange thing and very much to be admired. But whereas 
you say that the whole world, as it were under one sunbeam, was 
presented before his eyes, as I must needs confess that in 
myself I never had experience of any such thing, so neither can 
I conceive <A NAME="p98"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|98</SPAN></A> by what means the whole world can be seen of any one 
man.  
<p>
GREGORY. Assure yourself, Peter, of that which I speak: to wit, 
that all creatures be as it were nothing to that soul which 
beholdeth the Creator: for though it see but a glimpse of that 
light which is in the Creator, yet very small do all things seem 
that be created: for by means of that supernatural light, the 
capacity of the inward soul is enlarged, and is in God so 
extended, that it is far above the world: yea and the soul of 
him that seeth in this manner, is also above itself; for being 
rapt up in the light of God, it is inwardly in itself enlarged 
above itself, and when it is so exalted and looketh downward, 
then doth it comprehend how little all that is, which before in 
former baseness it could not comprehend. The man of God, 
therefore, who saw the fiery globe, and the Angels returning to 
heaven, out of all doubt could not see those things but in the 
light of God: what marvel, then, is it, if he saw the world 
gathered together before him, who, rapt up in the light of his 
soul, was at that time out of the world? But albeit we say that 
the world was gathered together before his eyes, yet were not 
heaven and earth drawn into any lesser room than they be of 
themselves, but the soul of the beholder was more enlarged, 
which, rapt in God, might without difficulty see that which is 
under God, and therefore in that light which appeared to his 
outward eyes, the inward light which was in his soul ravished 
the mind of the beholder to supernal things, and shewed him how 
small all earthly things were.  
<p>
PETER. I perceive now that it was to my more profit that I 
understood you not before: seeing, by reason of my slow 
capacity, you have delivered so notable an exposition. But now, 
because you have made me thrughly to understand these things, I 
beseech you to continue on your former narration.<A NAME="p99"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|99</SPAN></A>

<p>
GREGORY.  Desirous I am, Peter, to tell you many things of this 
venerable father, but some of purpose I let pass, because I make 
haste to entreat also of the acts of other holy men:  yet I would 
not have you to be ignorant, but that the man of God amongst so 
many miracles, for which he was so famous in the world, was also 
sufficiently learned in divinity:  for he wrote a rule for his 
monks, both excellent for discretion and also eloquent for the 
style.  Of whose life and conversation, if any be curious to know 
further, he may in the institution of that rule understand all 
his manner of life and discipline:  for the holy man could not 
otherwise teach, than himself lived.

venerable Benedict did prophesy to his monks, the time of his own death.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
The same year in which he departed this life, he told the day of 
his holy death to his monks, some of which did live daily with 
him, and some dwelt far off, willing those that were present to 
keep it secret, and telling them that were absent by what token 
they should know that he was dead.  Six days before he left this 
world, he gave order to have his sepulchre opened, and forthwith 
falling into an ague, he began with burning heat to wax faint, 
and when as the sickness daily increased, upon the sixth day he 
commanded his monks to carry him into the oratory, where he did 
arm himself with receiving the body and blood of our Saviour 
Christ; and having his weak body holden up betwixt the hands of 
his disciples, he stood with his own lifted up to heaven, and as 
he was in that manner praying, he gave up the ghost.  Upon which 
day two monks, one being in his cell, and the other far distant, 
had concerning him one and the self-same vision:  for they saw 
all the way from the holy man's cell, towards the east even up to 
heaven, hung and adorned with tapestry, and shining with an 
infinite <A NAME="p100"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|100</SPAN></A> number of lamps, at the top whereof a man, reverently 
attired, stood and demanded if they knew who passed that way, to 
whom they answered saying, that they knew not.  Then he spake 
thus unto them:  "This is the way," quoth he, "by which the 
beloved servant of God, Benedict, is ascended up to heaven."  And 
by this means, as his monks that were present knew of the death 
of the holy man, so likewise they which were absent, by the token 
which he foretold them, had intelligence of the same thing.  
Buried he was in the oratory of St. John Baptist which himself 
built, when he overthrew the altar of Apollo; who also in that 
cave in which he first dwelled, even to this very time, worketh 
miracles, if the faith of them that pray requireth the same.
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><u><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C38"></A></SPAN>Chapter Thirty-eight: how
a mad woman was cured in his cave.</u></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
For the thing which I mean now to rehearse fell out lately.  A certain 
woman falling mad, lost the use of reason so far, that she walked up 
and down, day and night, in mountains and valleys, in woods and fields, 
and rested only in that place where extreme weariness enforced her to 
stay.  Upon a day it so fell out, that albeit she wandered at random, 
yet she missed not the right way: for she came to the cave of the 
blessed man Benedict: and not knowing anything, in she went, and reposed 
herself there that night, and rising up in the morning, she departed as 
sound in sense and well in her wits, as though she had never been 
distracted in her whole life, and so continued always after, even to 
her dying day.  
<p>
PETER. What is the reason that in the patronage of martyrs we often 
times find, that they do not afford so great benefit by their bodies, 
as they do by other of their relics: and do there work greater 
miracles, where themselves be not present?  
<p>
GREGORY. Where the holy martyrs lie in their bodies, there is no 
doubt, Peter, but that they are able to work <A NAME="p101"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|101</SPAN></A>
many miracles, yea and 
also do work infinite, to such as seek them with a pure mind.  But 
for as much as simple people might have some doubt whether they be 
present, and do in those places hear their prayers where their 
bodies be not, necessary it is that they should in those places 
shew greater miracles, where weak souls may most doubt of their 
presence.<p>
But he whose mind is fixed in God, hath so much the greater merit 
of his faith in that he both knoweth that they rest not there in 
body, and yet be there present to hear our prayers.  And therefore 
our Saviour himself, to increase the faith of his disciples, said: <i>If I do not depart, the Comforter will not come unto
you</i> <sup><A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A></sup>: for, seeing certain it is that the comforting Spirit doth 
always proceed from the Father and the Son, why doth the Son say 
that he will depart that the Comforter may come, who never is 
absent from the Son?  But because the disciples, beholding our Lord 
in flesh, did always desire to see him with their corporal eyes, 
very well did he say unto them: "Unless I do go away, the Comforter 
will not come:" as though he had plainly told them: If I do not 
withdraw my body, I cannot let you understand what the love of the 
spirit is: and except you give over [cease] to love my carnal presence, 
never will you learn to affect me with true spiritual love.  
<p>
PETER. That you say pleaseth me very well.  
<p>
GREGORY. Let us now for a while give over our discourse, to the end 
that if we mean to prosecute the miracles of other Saints, we may 
through silence be the more able to perform it.

being. <i>Cf. </i>Lanciani, <i>Wanderings in the Roman Campagna, </i>pp.

is variously written : Equitius, Evitius, Euticius ; &quot;Tertullius the
senator&quot; is simply <i>Tertullus patricius. </i>For the reception of
children into the order, <i>cf. </i>chap. 59 of the <i>Rule. </i>According to
the tradition, Maurus became the Benedictine apostle of France, and died in 584,
while Placidus died a martyr's death in Sicily in 541, a few years before the
death of St. Benedict himself.

bakehouse, in the garden, or in any other occupation or place, shall do anything
amiss, break or lose anything, or offend in any way whatsoever, and do not come

great Abbey of Monte Cassino in 528 or 529. Dante translates St. Gregory's words
in the <i>Paradiso </i>(xxii. 37-45), where he puts them into the mouth of St.
Benedict himself:</p>

courtier&quot; is hardly the equivalent of <i>cujusdam curialis filius. A
curialis, </i>or <i>decurio, </i>was member of the municipal council of some
provincial town. <i>See </i>Hodgkin, II. pp. 577 <i>et seq.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="19"></A>19.&nbsp;Chapter XII. p. 71. &quot;The brother who is sent
on an errand, and expects to return to his monastery the same day, shall not
presume to eat outside his house, even though he be asked to do so by any one,
unless he be so ordered by his abbot. If he do otherwise, let him be
excommunicated.&quot; (<i>Rule of St. Benedict, </i>chap. 51, Gasquet's

<p><A NAME="21"></A>21.&nbsp;Chapters XIV. and XV. pp. 73-75. Totila (Baduila)
became king of the Ostrogoths in Italy in 541, when Belisarius had won back for
Justinian and the Empire all the peninsula south of the Po. His interview with
St. Benedict took place probably in the following year, 542. Of his four Gothic
attendants here mentioned&#8212;Riggo, Vult, Ruderic, and Bleda&#8212;the last two are
also known in history as having been sent by the king to besiege Florence in
this same year. (<i>Cf. </i>Hodgkin, <i>Italy and her Invaders, </i>II. p. 433).
Totila reconquered almost all Italy, except Ravenna and Ancona ; he captured
Rome twice (546 and 549), and overran Sicily ; but in 552 was defeated by Narses
and killed in the rout of his army. It was naturally impossible for St. Gregory
to take an impartial view of the Goths, and modern historians depict Totila in
far more favourable colours. According to Dr. Hodgkin, he was &quot;upon the
whole one of the best types of the still future age of chivalry that the
Downfall of the Empire can exhibit.&quot;</p>

instituted to protect the people from the unjust extortions of the imperial
officials. <i>Cf. </i>Hodgkin, <i>Italy and her Invaders, </i>I. pp. 625-628.</p>

21, 543. Their bodies are supposed to lie together under the high altar of the
abbey church at Monte Cassino ; but this is a little uncertain, as they are said
to have been at one time translated (perhaps temporarily) to France.</p>

<A NAME="43"></A>43.&nbsp;Chapter XXXV. p. 96. This <i>Liberius quondam
patricius </i>is probably the Liberius mentioned in the letters of Cassiodorus
(Hodgkin, <i>The Letters of Cassiodorus, </i>pp. 178, 179) as a Roman noble who
had been Praetorian Prefect under Theodoric. The monastery is referred to in St.
Gregory's letters, <i>Registrum, Epist. </i>ix. 162, 164 (Ewald and Hartmann,
ii. pp. 162, 163). St. Germanus, Bishop of Capua, died in 540 or 541, and is
commemorated on October 30.
<p><A NAME="44"></A>44.&nbsp;<i>Ibid. </i>pp. 97, 98. This vision of the whole
world, and St. Gregory's explanation, deeply impressed the mediaeval mind. It
was imitated by Marcus, the Irish Benedictine who wrote the Vision of Tundal (<i>Visio
Tnugdali, </i>ed. Wagner, p. 52), and by Dante <i>(Par. </i>xxii. 133-153). St.
Thomas Aquinas discusses it with a view to showing that St. Gregory's words do
not imply that St. Benedict, still living in the present life, saw God in that
vision <i>per essentiam, </i>in His Essence. (<i>Summa Theologica, </i>II. ii.
Q. 108, A. 5 ad 3.)</p>
<p><A NAME="45"></A>45.&nbsp;Chapter XXXVI. p. 99. &quot;For he wrote a rule for
his monks, both excellent for discretion and also eloquent for the style.&quot;
The Latin runs : <i>Nam scripsit monachorum regulam, discretione praecipuam,
sermone luculentam. </i>St. Gregory himself, in the epistle to Bishop Leander
prefixed to the <i>Moralia, </i>professes to despise &quot;literary style&quot;
(<i>ipsam loquendi artem, quam magisteria disciplinae exterioris insinuant) </i>;
&quot;for I deem it most unworthy,&quot; he says, &quot;to restrict the words of
the heavenly oracle under the rules of Donatus&quot; (<i>Epistola missoria ad
Leandrum Hispalensem, </i>cap. 5). For the style and Latinity of the Rule, <i>cf.
</i>especially E. Wolfflin, <i>Die Latinitat des Benedikt von Nursia </i>in <i>Archiv
fur lateinische Lexikographie und Grammatik, </i>ix. Munich, 1896.</p>
