online edition</b></p>
<hr>

<p>I became aware of the existence of this translation by accident.&nbsp; An
American gentleman emailed me and asked after this work, and also Optatus of
Milevis.&nbsp; A quick search revealed the existence of this translation; an
inter-library loan brought the book to my hands in a week; and a weekend's work
placed it online.</p>

<p>The work itself is medieval; collections of hearsay about miracles of the
saints.&nbsp; Much of it is plainly exaggerated or untrue.&nbsp; Some people
blasphemously call this 'pious fiction' -- I am less sympathetic to this,
although perhaps I expect too much accuracy.&nbsp; In my view telling plainly
doubtful stories about miracles simply encourages scepticism about the Christian
faith. But the constant refrain of the book is the devastation caused by the
Lombard invasions.&nbsp; Perhaps it is harsh to criticise people trying to find
some comfort from stories, in a dreadful world; and the later history of the
book is not the responsibility of its author.</p>

<p>The book itself is an Arts and Crafts movement volume.&nbsp; The headings are
all in Gothic, the binding is a reproduction of a 16th century Italian binding,
and illustrations, some in colour, appear at intervals.&nbsp; The illustrations
are all photographs or colourings of Renaissance paintings, and have been
omitted.&nbsp; Likewise the list of illustrations with notes has been
omitted.&nbsp;&nbsp; The notes appeared at the back; I have mixed them in with
the footnotes (all biblical references) and placed them at the end of each
book.&nbsp; The text itself OCR'd&nbsp; very easily; the headings had to be
typed in.</p>

<p>The text is very old-fashioned, and was modernised only in spelling, and not
always then.&nbsp; I have added some more -- 'Bennet' changed to 'Benedict',
'Totilas' to 'Totila', etc.&nbsp; But I do not have the time to remove all the
Jacobean phraseology.</p>

<p>Book 2 had been scanned long ago by the St. Pachomius Library, an Orthodox
website.&nbsp; They placed it in the public domain, for which many thanks.&nbsp;
I have used this as the basis for book 2, while adding in page numbers and
footnotes.</p>
