Our Lord is with thee, thou blessed amongst women. 30<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P594_79928">101</A> And she, when she beheld, was agitated at his word, and pondered what this salutation could be. 31<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P595_80041">102</A> And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God. 32<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P596_80140">103</A> Thou shall now conceive, and bear a son, and call his name Jesus. 33<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P597_80223">104</A> This shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father: and he shall rule over the house of Jacob for ever; 34<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P598_80422">105</A> and to his kingdom there shall be no end. 35<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P599_80481">106</A> Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be to me when no man hath known me? 36<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P600_80575">107</A> The angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit will come, and the power of the Most High shall rest upon thee, and therefore shall <I>he</I> that is born of thee be pure, and shall be called the Son of God. 37<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P601_80799">108</A> And lo, Elizabeth thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her, her that is called barren. 38<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P602_80960">109</A> For nothing is difficult for God. 39<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P603_81011">110</A> Mary said, Lo, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be unto me according unto thy word.

All things are possible to him that believeth. 40<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P2474_267158">107</A> And immediately the father of the child cried out, weeping, and said, I believe, my Lord; help my lack of faith. 41<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P2475_267288">108</A> And when Jesus saw the hastening of the people, and their coming at the sound, he rebuked that unclean spirit, and said to it, Thou dumb<SUP><A HREF="#P2476_267442">309</A></SUP> spirit that speakest not, I command thee,<SUP><A HREF="#P2477_267576">310</A></SUP> come out of him, and enter not again into him. 42<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P2478_267705">111</A> And that spirit, devil,<SUP><A HREF="#P2479_267746">311</A></SUP> cried out much, and bruised him, and came out; and that child fell as one dead, and many thought that he had died. 43<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P2480_267934">113</A> But Jesus took him by his hand, and raised him up, and gave him to his father; and that child was healed from that hour. 44<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P2481_268086">114</A> And the people all marvelled at the greatness of God.</P>

<P> 45<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P2483_268172">115</A> And when Jesus entered into the house, his disciples came, and asked him privately,<SUP><A HREF="#P2484_268273">312</A></SUP> and said unto him, Why were we not able to heal him? 46<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P2485_268366">117</A> Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief.

<P> 42<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P3471_374772">237</A> And when the days of his going up were accomplished, he prepared himself that he might go<SUP><A HREF="#P3472_374879">485</A></SUP> to Jerusalem. 43<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P3473_375006">239</A> And he sent messengers before him, and departed,<SUP><A HREF="#P3474_375072">486</A></SUP> and entered into a village<SUP><A HREF="#P3475_375382">487</A></SUP> of Samaria, that they might make ready for him. 44<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P3476_375455">242</A> And they received him not, because he<SUP><A HREF="#P3477_375510">488</A></SUP> was prepared for going to Jerusalem. 45<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P3478_375570">244</A> And when James and John his disciples saw it, they said unto him, Our Lord, wilt thou that we speak, and fire come down from heaven, to extirpate them, as did Elijah also? 46<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P3479_375759">245</A> And Jesus turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not of what spirit ye are. 47<A HREF="anf10-51.htm#P3480_375857">246</A> Verily the Son of man did not come to destroy lives, but to give life.

(Brit. Mus. MS., fol. 190a), and some say that the Greek citation and in the Diatessaron, which Tatianus the pupil of Justianus the philosopher wrote, the quotation is not written , "Isaiah," but, "as it is written in the prophet". This is a remarkable statement about the Diatessaron . But the sentence is hardly grammatical. Perhaps the words printed in italics originally formed a complete sentence by themselves, possibly on the margin. If this conjecture be correct we might emend, e.g., by restoring them to the margin, and repeating the last three words or some equivalent phrase in the text. It would be interesting to know how the Paris MS. reads. see below, p. 138 (Suggested Emendations).

<br><br><sup id="P1409_154243">131</sup>: This is the reading adopted by Ciasca in his Latin version. The diacritical points in the Arabic text, as he has printed it (perhaps a misprint), give second person plural passive instead of third plural active.

<br><br><sup id="P2454_264385">303</sup>: This rendering assumes that the diacritical point is due to a clerical error. The text as printed can hardly be translated without forcing.
<br><br><sup id="P2455_264571">304</sup>: This Arabic word repeatedly represents a Syriac ran (cf. §53, 11). A different word is so used in §26, 21.
<br><br><sup id="P2459_265066">305</sup>: The Syriac word used in the Peshitta is here translated just as it was translated in §1, 79 (see note); but the Greek shows that in the present passage the Syriac word means go about (cf. Cur.).

<br><br><sup id="P2477_267576">310</sup>: Ciasca's Arabic follows Vat. MS. in inserting a that (pronoun) after thee .
<br><br><sup id="P2479_267746">311</sup>: Doubtless alternative renderings of the same Syriac word ( demon ).

<br><br><sup id="P2542_274377">321</sup>: So the Arabic; but the Syriac versions follow the Greek, and consent is doubtless a (very easy, and, in view of the succeeding context, natural) clerical error for an original Arabic charge .

<br><br><sup id="P2550_275474">323</sup>: Lit. blame , a mistranslation (found also in the Brit. Mus. text of Ibn-at-Tayyib's Commentary) of the Syriac word, which is ambiguous (cf. even the Greek). For a somewhat similar case see §50, 11, note.

The word pith , which occurs also in the [AE]thiopic version (Ezek. 27, 25; Jubilees, ch. 16) and in Ibn-at-Tayyib's exposition, though not in the Brit.
