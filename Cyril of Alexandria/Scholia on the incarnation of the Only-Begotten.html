<h3 align="center">SCHOLIA ON THE INCARNATION OF THE ONLY-BEGOTTEN.</h3>
<p align="center">[Translated by P.E. Pusey]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>1.</SPAN>&nbsp;What is Christ?</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name Christ hath neither the force of a definition, nor does it denote the essence of any of what kind it is, as for example a man or a horse or an ox, but it rather makes declaration of a thing wrought. For some of them of old were anointed with oil, as then pleased God, and the anointing was a token to them of kingdom: Prophets too were spiritually anointed with the Holy Ghost, so as thence too to be named christs (and
<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> the blessed David sings in the Person of God and says, <i>Touch not Mine anointed and do My Prophets no harm: </i>the Prophet Habuccuc too says, <i>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people, to save Thy christs</i>): but in regard of Christ the Saviour of all we say that an anointing took place, yet neither symbolic, as though done with oil, nor as for the grace of Prophet's office, nor yet that which is understood as in destination for the achievement of ought, such as we say took place in the case of Cyrus, who reigned over the Persians and Medes, for he led an army against the land of the Babylonians, God Almighty over all instigating him thereto. For it was said, <i>Thus saith the </i>Lord <i>to Cyrus My christ, whose right hand I held. </i>Albeit the man was an idolater, he was called
christ, by reason of being as it were anointed king by the decree from above and fore-ordained by God to mightily
<A NAME="p186"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|186</SPAN></A> subdue the land of the Babylonians:----but this rather do we say
<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>Since on account of the transgression in Adam, <i>sin hath reigned </i>against <i>all, </i>and then the Holy Ghost fled away from the human nature and it came therefore to be in all ill, and it needed that by the Mercy of God, it mounting up to its pristine condition should be accounted worthy of the Spirit:----the Only-Begotten Word of God became Man, and appeared to them on earth with Body of earth, and was made free from sin, that in Him Alone the nature of man crowned with the glories of sinlessness, should be rich in the Holy Ghost, and thus be re-formed unto God through holiness: for thus does the grace pass through to us too, having for its beginning Christ the First-born among us. And therefore does the blessed David teaching
us sing to the Son, <i>Thou lovedst righteousness and hatedst wickedness, therefore God, Thy God anointed Thee with the oil of gladness.</i></p>
<p>The Son therefore has been anointed like us in human wise <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
with the praises of sinlessness, as I said: the nature of man having in Him been made illustrious and now become worthy of partaking of the Holy Ghost, no more departing, as at the beginning, but delighting to dwell therein. Wherefore it is also written that the Spirit soared down upon Christ <i>and hath abode upon Him. </i>Christ therefore is the Word of God called Who because of us and as we is Man and in servant's form: both anointed as Man after the Flesh, and anointing Divinely with His own Spirit them that believe on Him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>2.</SPAN>&nbsp;How we must understand Emmanuel.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God the Word is named Emmanuel, because He <i>laid hold of the seed of Abraham </i>and like <i>as partook of flesh and blood.
</i>Now Emmanuel is interpreted, <i>With us is God. </i>But we confess that the Word of God was <i>with us, </i>not
<A NAME="p187"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|187</SPAN></A> locally (for in what place is God not, Who fills all things?) nor because He is seen to come to us by way of aid (for thus was it said to Jesus, <i>As I was with Moses, so I will be</i>, <i>with thee too), </i>but because He was made in our condition,
i. e. in human nature, without forsaking His own Nature, for the Word of God is Unchangeable in Nature.</p>
<p>But why was it, when it was said to Jesus, <i>As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee, </i>that he was nevertheless not called Emmanuel? this is the reason, even though He be said to be with any of the saints. We therefore say that He God the Word became with us, at that time of which
Baruch says, <i>He did shew Himself upon earth and conversed with men, </i>and <i>found out all the way of instruction and gave it to Jacob His servant and to Israel His beloved, for He is our God and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison with Him.
</i>As far then as pertained to His being God by Nature, He was not with us; for incomparable is the difference between Godhead and manhood and exceeding great the difference of the natures.</p>
<p>And therefore was the Divine David calling to Mystic relationship God the Word Who had not as yet come to us and saying in spirit, <i>Why hast Thou departed far from us, O Lord, despisest us in season in tribulation? </i>Therefore He departed not
<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> from us, but was with us, Who while He remained what He was, <i>took hold of the seed of Abraham, </i>as I said; received moreover the form of a servant, and was beheld as Man upon the earth.</p>
<p>But Christ and Emmanuel signify to us the Same Son, the one, because He was anointed as we in human wise, receiving the Spirit for the nature of man in Himself first (for He is set forth as the first beginning of the race),
<A NAME="p188"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|188</SPAN></A> Himself again anointing, as God, with the Holy Ghost those who believe in Him; the other, because He was with us in the way I have explained, whereof the Prophet Isaiah tells us saying, <i>Behold a Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son and shall call His Name Immanuel. </i>For when the
holy Virgin conceived out of the Holy Ghost, but bare according to the flesh a Son, then too was He called Emmanuel; for the Incorporeal was with us by carnal birth, and
that took place which was told by David, <i>God shall appear openly, our God and shall not be silent, </i>and that (I deem),
<i>I Who speak am at hand. </i>For the Word spake through the Prophets as yet
Unembodied, He came Embodied.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>3.</SPAN>&nbsp;What is Jesus.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the force of the ideas <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> whereby we are bound to speak of One Son of God, Christ and Emmanuel and Jesus are the Same, and this name too from the fact, <i>for He shall save </i>(it says) <i>His people from their sins. </i>For just as the name Emmanuel meant, that the Word of God through His Birth of a woman was made with us; and Christ again, that made Man. He is said to be anointed as we in human wise; so too Jesus, that He saved us <i>His people, </i>which specially proves Him to be truly God and by Nature Lord of all. For the creature is not said to belong to a mere man
<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>, but rather it will befit to say that all things are the
Only-Begotten's even though He was made Man.</p>
<p>Some one haply will say, Yet the people of Israel were called Moses'.</p>
<p>To this we will say, The people was called God's and that was true; but because they passed into revolt, and made a calf in the desert, they were dishonoured of God, He vouchsafed not any more to call them His people, but made them over to a man. Not so we, for we are Jesus' own, in that He is God and all things created through Him. For so saith David, <i>For He hath made us and not </i>we <i>ourselves, </i>we <i>are the people of His pasture and the sheep of His</i>
<A NAME="p189"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|189</SPAN></A> <i>Hand. </i>And Himself again says of us, <i>My sheep hear My voice and they follow Me, </i>and again, <i>And other sheep I have which are not of this fold, them also I must bring and there shall be one fold, one Shepherd. </i>And He bade too the blessed Peter, <i>Simon, </i>son <i>of Jonas, lovest thou Me? feed My lambs.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>4.</SPAN>&nbsp;Why the Word of God was called Man.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Word out of God the Father was called Man, albeit by Nature God, in that He partook of blood and flesh like we. For thus was He seen of those on the earth, and not letting go what He was, but assuming human nature like us, perfect as regards itself; yet in human nature too hath He remained God and Lord of all, by Nature and in truth Begotten of God the Father.  And this the most wise Paul most clearly shews us, for he says, <i>The first man </i>is <i>of the earth earthy, the second Man the Lord </i><A HREF="#7"><sup>7</sup></A><i> out of Heaven.  </i>Albeit the  holy Virgin  hath borne   the Temple united to the Word, yet is Emmanuel said to be  (and rightly) out of heaven, for from above and out of the Essence of God the Father was His Word begotten.    Yet He descended unto us when He was made Man; yet thus too is He from above.    And John testified, saying of Him, <i>He that cometh from above is above all, </i>and Christ Himself saith <i>to </i>the people of the Jews, Ye <i>are from beneath, </i>I <i>am from above, </i>and again, I <i>am not of this world, </i>albeit He was as Man .<sup> </sup>called part of the world; yet therewith also was He above: the world as God.   For we remember that He plainly says, <i>And no man hath ascended up to heaven but He That came
down from Heaven, the Son of man. </i>But we say that the <A NAME="p190"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|190</SPAN></A>
Son of Man came down from Heaven by an economic union, the Word allotting to His own Flesh the endowments of His glory and God-befitting Excellency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>5.</SPAN>&nbsp;In what way the Word of God is said to have been emptied.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God the Word full by nature and in every way Perfect, and distributing <i>out of His own Fullness </i>His own goods to the creature, we say was emptied: in no wise wronged in His own Proper Nature, nor changed so as to become otherwise, nor made in ought inferior, for inconvertible and unchangeable is Himself also even as He Who begat Him, and never may He be capable of passion. But when He was made Flesh, i.e. Man, He made (as He said, <i>I will pour forth of My Spirit upon all flesh</i>) the poverty of human nature His own; first, in that He was once made man, albeit He remained God; next in that He took the form of a servant, Who is in His own Nature free, as Son, and while He is Himself the Lord of glory He is said to receive glory: Himself Life, He is said to be quickened: and receives power over all, Himself King of all and with God, and Ho was obedient to the Father, suffered the Cross and so on. But these things befit the measure of the human nature, yet He makes them His own with flesh and fulfils the economy, remaining what He was.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C6"></A>6.</SPAN>&nbsp;How Christ is One.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Divine Paul writes, <i>Though there be gods many and lords many in heaven and in earth, yet to us One God the Father of Whom all things and we of Him, and One Lord Jesus Christ through Whom all things and we through Him. </i>Yea and the very wise John said of God the Word, that <i>All things were made through Him, and without Him was nothing made, </i>and the blessed Gabriel declared the Gospel to the Holy Virgin saying, <i>Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and, bear a Son, and shalt call His Name Jesus. </i>Since then the Divine Paul declares that all things were made through Jesus Christ, and the Divine Evangelist confirms the force of the sentence and preaches that He
<A NAME="p191"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|191</SPAN></A> was God the Maker of all things, speaking truly, and the Angel's voice too points out that Jesus Christ was truly born of the Holy Virgin: yet we do not say that Jesus Christ was mere man
<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>, nor do we conceive of God the Word apart from His human nature but, we say that He was made One out of both, as God made Man, the Same begotten Divinely out of the Father as Word, and humanly out of woman as Man: not as though called to a second beginning of being then when He is said to have been born after the flesh: but begotten indeed before all ages, yet when the time came wherein He must fulfil the economy, born also of a woman after the flesh. Therefore, albeit others are called by like name
christs, yet is there <i>One Jesus Christ through Whom are all things, </i>not that a man was made Maker of all things, but that God the Word, through Whom all things were made, <i>like </i>as we <i>took part of flesh and blood, </i>and was called Man, yet lost not what He was; for so, so made in flesh is He rightly understood to be Maker of all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C7"></A>7.</SPAN>&nbsp;How Emmanuel is One.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once for all in the last ages is God the Word said to have been made Man, and (as Paul
saith) was <i>manifested by the Sacrifice of Himself . </i>And what is the Sacrifice? He offered His own Body for us for an odour of a sweet savour to God the Father, and <i>entered in once into the holy place not by the blood of goats and hulls, but by His own Blood, </i>for so to them who believe on Him <i>obtained </i>He <i>eternal redemption. </i>Therefore very many before Him were saints but no one of them was called Emmanuel. Why? For not yet had the time come, when He was to be with us, i.e., to come in our nature through flesh, Who is superior to every creature. One therefore is Emmanuel, for once was the Only-Begotten made Man, when He underwent fleshly Birth
through the holy Virgin.   For it was said to Jesus  too, <i>I </i><A NAME="p192"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|192</SPAN></A>
<i>will be with thee, </i>yet was he not Emmanuel; He was also with Moses, yet neither was he called Emmanuel. As often therefore as we hear the name, <i>With us is God, </i>given to the Son, let us wisely conceive that not so was He with us in the last times, as He is sometimes said to have been with the saints, for with them He was as a helper only: but with us He was, because He was made like us, not losing His own nature, for He is unchangeable as God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C8"></A>8.</SPAN>&nbsp;What we say the union is.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Union is arrived at in many ways: for some severed in disposition and mind and at variance one with another are said to be united in friendly agreement, laying aside their differences. And we say that things are united which are joined to one another or brought together in other ways, either by juxta-position or mixture or composition. When therefore we say that the Word of God was united to our nature, the mode of union is clearly above man's understanding; for it is not like one of those mentioned, but wholly ineffable and known to no one of those who are, save only to God Who knoweth all things.</p>
<p>And no marvel, if we are overcome by such ideas, when if we accurately investigate our own matters how they be, we confess that the grasp of them is beyond the understanding that is in us. For after what mode we conceive that the soul of man is united to his body, who can tell? But if we, who are wont to conceive and avail to speak scantly and with difficulty must form our judgement of things so subtil and beyond understanding and speech; we say that it will befit to conceive (yet altogether less than the truth is our word)  that of such sort is the union
<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A><i> </i>of <A NAME="p193"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|193</SPAN></A>
Emmanuel, as one reckons that the soul of man too has with its own body. For the soul makes its own the things of the body although in its own nature imparticipate of its sufferings, both physical and those brought on it from without. For the body is moved to natural desires and the soul which is in it shares the perception thereof by reason of the union, but participates in no way, yet thinks that the achievement of the desire is its own enjoyment. And even though the body be struck by any or be cut with steel, it co-grieves, its own body suffering, yet will itself in its own nature suffer nought of the things inflicted.</p>
<p>Nevertheless above this too do we say that the union is in the case of Emmanuel. For it were necessary that the soul united thereto should grieve along with its own body, that so, fleeing the disgrace, it might submit a tractable neck to God. But of God the Word, it were absurd to say that He were co-percipient of the contumelies (for free from passion is the Godhead and not in our condition), yet has He been united to flesh possessed of a reasonable soul, and when it suffered, He was impassibly in cognizance of what befell it and brought to naught as God the infirmities of the flesh, yet made them His own as belonging to His own Body: thus is He said both to hunger and be weary and suffer for us.</p>
<p>Hence the union of the Word with the human nature may be not unaptly compared with our condition.
For<sup> </sup>as the body is of other nature than the soul, yet is one man <A NAME="p194"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|194</SPAN></A>
produced and said to be of both; so too out of the Perfect Person of God the Word, and of manhood perfect in its own mode, is One Christ, the Same God and Man in the Same. And the Word (as I said) makes its own the sufferings of Its own Flesh, because Its own is the Body and not another's: and It shares with Its own Flesh the operation of the God-befitting might that is within It; so that it should be able both to quicken the dead and to heal the sick.</p>
<p>But if we must, using examples out of the God-inspired Scripture, shew as in type the mode of the union, come let us say it, as we are able.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C9"></A>9.</SPAN>&nbsp;Of the coal.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Prophet Isaiah says, <i>There was sent unto me one of the Seraphim and in his hand a live coal which he took with the tongs from off the altar and he said to me, Lo this touched thy lips and shall take away thine iniquities and purge thy
sins. </i>But we say that the live coal fulfils to us the type and image of the Incarnate Word, Who, if He touch our lips, i. e., when we confess the faith Him-ward, doth then both make us pure from every sin and free us from the pristine charges against us.</p>
<p>Natheless one may see in the coal, as in an image, the Word of God united to the human nature, yet not losing the being what He is, but rather
trans-elementing what He had taken, or united, unto His own glory and operation. For as fire having to do with wood and entering into it, seizes hold of it, and removes it not from being wood, but transmutes it rather into the appearance and force of fire, and inworks all its own property therein, and it is now reckoned one with it, so shall you conceive of Christ too. For God united ineffably with the manhood, hath kept it what we say that it is, and Himself hath remained what He was; but once united, is accounted one with it, making His own what is its, and Himself too introducing into it the operation of His own Nature.
<A NAME="p195"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|195</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C10"></A>10.</SPAN>&nbsp;That the flesh having a reasonable soul hath become the Body of the unembodied Godhead, and that by severing them one from another, we shall wholly and surely undo the plan of the
economy in Christ.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Song of Songs our Lord Jesus Christ Himself has been introduced to us saying, I am <i>the flower of the plain, the lily of the vallies. </i>As then the smell is something
unembodied, for it uses as its own body that wherein it is, yet is the lily conceived of as one out of both, and the failing of one utterly destroys the plan thereof, for in the object is the smell and the object is its body: so shall we conceive of the Nature of the Godhead in Christ too, that it sheds forth on the world the savour of His own more than earthly Excellence
<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>, as in the object His human Nature, and that the unembodied by Nature became by economic union
all-but embodied also, because It willed to be recognized through the Body; for It hath wrought therein things God-befitting. Hence will the Unembodied be rightly conceived of as in His own Body, even as in the flower too, the object, is the scent, yet both together is called lily.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C11"></A>11.</SPAN>&nbsp;That the Word being co-brought to true union with the human nature, the things united
</b><A HREF="#11"><sup>11</sup></A><b> have remained unconfused.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The holy Tabernacle was reared by the will of God in the wilderness and in it was manifoldly typified Emmanuel. The God of all said therefore to the divine Moses,
<i>And thou shalt make an ark of incorruptible wood, two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and half its breadth and a cubit and a half its height, and thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it. </i>But
the wood that will not rot will be a type of the incorruptible Body (for cedar does not rot); gold as matter surpassing all others will indicate to us the Excellence of the Divine Essence.
<A NAME="p196"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|196</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But observe how the whole ark <A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> was overlaid with pure gold within and without. For God the Word was united to the holy Flesh, and this (I deem) is it that the ark was overlaid without. But that He made His own the reasonable Soul also that was within the Body, will this
shew, viz., that He bade that it should be overlaid within also. And that the Natures or Hypostases have remained unconfused, shall we see hence. For the gold that was spread upon the wood, remained what it was, and the wood was rich in the glory of the gold; yet it ceased not from being wood.</p>
<p>But that the ark is taken as a type of Christ one may be assured of through many proofs. For it used to precede them of Israel, seeking rest for them; Christ too somewhere says, <i>I go to prepare a place for you.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C12"></A>12.</SPAN>&nbsp;That the Word being God was made Man, and that not man merely honoured with bare connection was called to equal Dignity or Authority with God the Word, as some suppose.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Divine Paul says that <i>great is the Mystery of godliness. </i>And this is true, for <i>the Word was manifested in the flesh, </i>since He is God; <i>justified in Spirit, </i>for in no wise is He seen to be holden by our infirmities, albeit for us made Man, for He did no sin; <i>seen </i>moreover <i>of angels, </i>for neither were they ignorant of His generation after the Flesh; He was <i>preached </i>moreover <i>unto the Gentiles, </i>as God made Man; and thus <i>believed on in the world. </i>And this the Divine Paul proved thus writing, <i>Wherefore remember that ye </i>being <i>in time past Gentiles in the flesh who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands, that at that time ye were without Christ, aliened from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without</i>
<A NAME="p197"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|197</SPAN></A> <i>God in the world. </i>The Gentiles were therefore without God in the world, when they were without Christ; but when they acknowledged Him to be truly and by Nature God, themselves too were acknowledged by Him confessing the faith. And He was <i>received up into glory, </i>Divine glory that is; for blessed David sings, <i>God is gone up in joy. </i>For He went up verily with Body, not in bare Godhead, for God was Incarnate.</p>
<p>We believe therefore, not in one like us honoured with Godhead by grace, lest we be caught worshippers of a man, but rather in the Lord Who appeared in servant's form, and Who was truly like us and in human nature, yet remained God, for God the Word, when He took flesh, laid not down what He was, but is conceived of the Same God alike and Man.</p>
<p>Thus is the faith and rightly. But if any say, What harm if a man like us be conceived of as laying hold on Godhead and not God rather be made man? we shall answer that there are a thousand things which may be brought to bear against this, and which all but tell us that we ought firmly to strive against it and not thus to believe.</p>
<p>For come before ought else, let us look at the mode of the economy with Flesh and thoroughly investigate the nature of our condition; the nature of man was perilled and was brought down to the extreme of ill, condemned to curse and death and involved in the toils of sin, was straying and was in darkness, it knew not Him Who is by Nature and truly God, it worshipped the creature more than the Creator. How then could it be freed from such ills? Or do we say that it was lawful for it to lay hold on the Divine Nature, albeit it did not at all know what the Dignity of the Supreme Nature is, it which was holden of unlearning and darkness, and denied by the soil of sin? how was it like that it could mount up to the All-Pure Nature and lay hold on glory which none can lay hold of, except he receive it? For let it be supposed that by knowledge for<sub> </sub>example, and through knowing we say that it lays hold
thereof: who is to teach it? For <i>how shall they believe </i><A NAME="p198"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|198</SPAN></A>
except  they hear?   But   this is   not   at   all to   take   hold of Godhead, and to seize the glory that beseems It.</p>
<p>Hence it will be more meet (and reasonably so) to conceive that God the Word through Whom are all things, desiring to save that which was lost; by co-abasement<sup> </sup>unto us, lowered Himself to what He was not, in order that the nature of man too might become what it was not, eminent in the Dignities of the Divine Supremacy by union with Him, and should be rather brought up to what was above nature, than bring down unto what was alien from His Nature, the Unchangeable, as God. It behoved that the Incorruptible should lay hold on the nature subject to corruption, that He might free it from the corruption, it behoved that He Who knew not to sin should be made conformal with those who were under sin, that He might make sin to cease: for as where is light, there surely darkness will have no work, so where incorruption is present, is all necessity that corruption flee, and that, since He Who knew not sin hath made His own that which was under sin, sin should come to nought.</p>
<p>But that the Word, being God, was made Man, and not rather that Christ was Man deified, I will endeavour to shew from the Holy Scriptures also. Blessed Paul says therefore of the Only-Begotten, <i>Who being in the Form of
God thought not the being equal with God a thing to seize, but emptied Himself taking servant's form, made in the likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross; wherefore God also highly exalted Him and gave Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus Christ every knee should bow of heavenly and earthly and infernal and every tongue confess Lord Jesus Christ to the glory of God the Father. </i></p>
<p>Whom therefore shall we say was in the Form of God and Equality of the Father, and thought these things <i>not a thing to seize; </i>but descended rather into emptiness and into servant's form, and humbleth Himself and was made in our likeness?    If man made of a woman bare and sole,
<A NAME="p199"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|199</SPAN></A> how was he in the Form and Equality of the Father? or how has he fulness that he may be conceived of as emptied? or in what height placed afore, is he said to have humbled himself? or how was he made in the likeness of men, who was so formerly too by nature, even though haply he were not said to be so made? yea where was he emptied, taking the fulness of the Godhead? or how was he not made most high who mounted up into glory supernal?</p>
<p>Therefore we say that not man was made God, but rather that the Word of God Who was in Equality and Form of the Father was made in emptiness because of: the human nature, for He was emptied in this way, by reason of our likeness, being Full, as God: He was humbled on account of the Flesh, while He departeth not from the Throne of the Divine Majesty, for He hath His Seat Most High: He was made in the likeness of men, being of the Same Form with the Father, of Whose Essence He is the Form. Yet since He was once made as we, He is said to have ascended with Flesh too into the glory of the Godhead, which indeed He had evident as His own, yet was He in it after another sort, on account of the Human Nature, for He is believed to be Lord of all, even with Flesh.</p>
<p>But to Him boweth every knee, and that not to the grief or dishonour of the Father, but rather <i>to </i>His <i>glory: </i>for He rejoiceth and is glorified when the Son is adored by all, albeit made like us; for it is written again, <i>For He
took not on Him angels but He took on </i>Him <i>the seed of Abraham, wherefore in all things it behoved Him to be made like
unto </i>His <i>brethren. </i>Lo the Word took hold of the seed of Abraham, in that He is God, not some man like us took hold of Godhead, and He is Himself made like unto us, and is called our Brother as Man, not we to Him as regards the Nature of the Godhead. And again: <i>Forasmuch then
as the children partook of blood and flesh, He also Himself likewise partook of them, that through death He might destroy him who holdeth the power of death, that is, the devil, and might deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. </i>Lo again Himself just as
<A NAME="p200"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|200</SPAN></A> we partook of blood and flesh; and this hath a reason most closely united and kin, for it is written, <i>For what the Law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of flesh of sin and for sin condemned sin in the flesh. </i>Observe again that not man is shewn to be affecting the Divine Nature, and mounting up to His Dignity; but God the Father sending rather His Son <i>in the likeness of flesh of sin </i>to destroy sin. Therefore the Word, being God, made Man let Himself down into emptiness; and Christ is seen to be no mere man, affecting the Divine Glory.</p>

<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C13"></A>13.</SPAN>&nbsp;That the Word of God made Man is called Christ Jesus.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Desiring to investigate the Mystery of the economy with flesh of the Only Begotten, we say this, holding true doctrine and right faith, that the Word Himself out of God the Father, Very God out of Very God, the Light That is out of Light, was Incarnate and made Man, descended suffered rose from the dead: for thus defined the holy and great Synod the Symbol of the Faith;</p>
<p>But investigating and desiring to learn what is the true meaning of the Word being Incarnate and made Man; we see that it is not to take man in connection in regard of equality of dignity or authority or of mere community of name of sonship; but rather to be made man as we, together with <i>His </i>preserving to His own Nature Its being unchanged and without turn, Who economically became in assumption of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>One therefore is He Who before the Incarnation is called by the God-inspired Scripture, Only-Begotten, Word, God, Image, Brightness, Impress of the Person of the Father, Life, Glory, Light, Wisdom, Power, Arm, Right Hand, Most Highest, Magnificence, Lord of
Sabaoth, and other like names, truly most God-befitting; and after the Incarnation, Man, Christ Jesus, Propitiation, Mediator, Firstfruits of them that slept, First-begotten of the dead, Second  Adam, <i>Head of the Body the  Church;  </i>the first
<A NAME="p201"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|201</SPAN></A> names also following Him: for all are His, both the first and those in the last times of the world.</p>
<p>One therefore is He Who both before the Incarnation was Very God and in the human nature hath remained That He was and is and shall be. We must not then sever the One Lord Jesus Christ into Man separately and into God separately, but we say that Jesus Christ is One and the Same, yet knowing the distinction of the Natures and keeping them unconfused with one another.</p>
<p>When therefore Holy Writ says that in Christ dwelt <i>all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, </i>we do not therefore
say that the Word by Himself dwelt in another, the man Christ, nor plucking asunder one from another things united do we conceive of two sons, but this rather, that holy Writ calls by the name Christ sometimes separately the human nature of the Word of God which He having as His own, used as a Temple. And it has been written somewhere of human souls also, <i>Them that dwell in houses
of clay, whereof we too are of the same clay. </i>Do we then, since he calls the bodies of men <i>houses of clay, </i>and affirms that their souls dwell in them, sever one man into two? yet how is it not wholly without blame
<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>, that in a man should be said to dwell his spirit? so that even though the form of speech passes through this mode, unable to do otherwise, it does not beseem that the natures of things are therefore injured, but rather we must conceive that they hasten the straight way of the truth.</p>
<p>When then any of those things which do not possess like nature one with another, are seen brought together to unity by composition, and the one (for example) is said to dwell within the other; we must not sunder them into two, seeing that the concurrence unto unity is in no wise injured, even though one of the things united be separately called by us what the two together are. For in man too (as I said) is said to dwell his spirit; yet both the spirit separately and likewise the body are called man.
<A NAME="p202"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|202</SPAN></A> And some such thing as this doth the most wise Paul indicate to us saying, <i>For though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day. </i>When then any saith that our inward man dwelleth in our outward man, he speaks true, yet he does not sever the one into two. The Prophet Isaiah too somewhere
saith, <i>By night does my spirit rise early unto Thee, O God. </i>Is then his spirit said to rise early to God, as being other than himself? albeit how is it not absurd to say any thing of this kind? Therefore we must know figures of speech, yet not depart from what is reasonable, but fetch about the force of the things signified to the aim befitting each.</p>
<p>And although Jesus be said to advance <i>in age and wisdom and grace, </i>this will pertain to the economy. For the Word of God permitted His Humanity to advance by reason of the habits of its proper nature, and willed as it were by little and little to extend the illustriousness of His own Godhead, and along with the age of the Body to put out therewith what is Its own; so that nought strange should be seen and terrify any with its overmuch unwontedness: while even so they spake, <i>How knoweth this man letters having never learned? </i>Therefore bodily is the increase; and the advance in grace and wisdom will befit the measures of the Human nature: yet we say that the Word out of God is Himself in His own Nature All-Perfect, not lacking <i>advance, </i>nor <i>wisdom, </i>nor <i>grace, </i>but that He imparts rather to the creature wisdom and grace and the things whereby it is in good case.</p>
<p>And though Jesus be said also to suffer, the suffering will belong to the economy; but is said to be His, and with all reason, because His too is that which suffered, and He was in the suffering Body, He unknowing to suffer (for He is Impassible as God); yet as far as pertained to the daring of those who raged against Him, He would have suffered, if He could have suffered.</p>
<p>Therefore since the Only-Begotten has been made as we, as often as He is called Man by the God-inspired Scripture, considering the economy, let us confess that even so is He God by Nature.

<p>God says somewhere to the hierophant Moses, <i>And thou shalt make a mercy seat, by inlaying of pure gold: two cubits:</i> <i>and a half the length thereof and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and thou shalt make two cherubim of gold, of beaten work, and shalt put them on either side, one cherub on this end the other cherub on that end of the mercy seat, and, thou shalt make the two cherubim on the two ends thereof. The cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings and, their faces one to another, looking to the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be. </i>A most sure image will this be that God the Word even in the human nature remained God and in His own Glory and Majesty even though for the economy's sake made like unto us; for <i>a propitiation through faith </i>was Emmanuel made unto us. And this the most wise John proved saying to us, <i>My little children, these things write I unto you that ye sin not; and if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, and He is the Propitiation for our sins</i>; so too Paul says, <i>Whom God set forth a propitiation through faith in His Blood.</i></p>
<p>But see the Cherubim standing round about the Mercy seat and overshadowing it with their wings, but turned toward the Mercy seat and all but fixing their eye on their Lord's beck. For to the will of God alone looketh the whole multitude of the heavenly spirits, and is never sated with the sight of God. So doth the Prophet Isaiah say that he saw the Son on <i>a throne high and lifted up, </i>the Seraphin standing around and waiting on Him as God.</p>

<p>The Divine Moses was of old appointed to free Israel from the violence of the Egyptians. But since it was needful that they who were under the yoke of an unwonted servitude, should first learn that God was now reconciled to them, He bade him work miracles: for a miracle
<A NAME="p204"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|204</SPAN></A> oft-time brings us to belief. Moses therefore says to God Almighty, <i>But if they shall not believe me nor hearken to my voice, saying, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee, what shall I say to them? the Lord then said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod: and He said to him, Cast it on the ground: and he cast it on the ground </i><A HREF="#14"><sup>14</sup></A><sup> </sup><i>and it became a serpent and Moses fled from before it: and the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail; and he put forth his hand and took it by the tail and it became a rod in his hand. And He said to him, That they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob hath appeared unto thee.
</i>Observe herein <A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> the Son of God by Nature and in truth, as a Rod of the Father (but the Rod is the ensign of Kingdom), for in the Son hath He power over all. Whence Divine David also
saith, <i>Thy Throne, O God
is for ever and ever, a Rod of Equity the Rod of Thy Kingdom. </i>But He cast it on the ground,
i. e., surrounded it with an earthly Body, or through the human nature sent it upon the earth, for then, then was it made in likeness of the wicked, men that is, for of wickedness is the serpent a token.</p>
<p>And that this is true, thou wilt hence know. For our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, in image and figure of the economy wrought with flesh is taken for the brazen serpent which Moses reared to cure the serpents' bites. For He
says, <i>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have eternal life. </i>For as the serpent made of brass was an occasion of salvation to those in peril (for looking on it they were saved), so our Lord Jesus Christ too to those who see Him in the likeness of bad men in that He was made Man, yet are
<A NAME="p205"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|205</SPAN></A> not ignorant that He is God Who quickens, will be the Bestower of Life and the power of escaping bitter and venomous beasts, I mean the powers that oppose us.</p>
<p>It will be a figure too of this that Moses' Rod devoured the other rods, which the Magi had cast on the ground. The Rod therefore was indeed cast on the earth, yet did not abide a serpent, but taken again it was what it had been; for although the Father's Rod, i.e., the Son, through Whom He hath power over all was made (as I said before) in our likeness: yet when the economy was fulfilled He hastened back into Heaven and was again as in the Father's Hand <i>a Rod of Righteousness </i>and of Rule; for He sitteth at the Right Hand of His Father in His own Majesty, possessing the Supreme Throne even with
Flesh.</p>

<p><i>And the Lord God said again to him, Put thine hand into thy bosom, and he put his hand into his bosom and took forth his hand out of his bosom and his hand became as snow. And He said again, Put thine hand into thy bosom, and he put his hand into his bosom and brought it forth of his bosom, and it was turned again to the colour of his flesh. </i>The Hand
and the Right Hand of God the Father the Divine Scripture calls His Very Son. For it introduces Him saying,
I <i>by Mine Hand founded the Heaven, </i>and the Divine David too singeth, <i>By the Word of the Lord the Heavens were
stablished.
</i>See therefore that Moses' hand was as yet hidden in his bosom and had not yet become leprous; brought forth and immediately it became leprous; then after a while put in and again brought forth, and for the future
not leprous; <i>for it was restored </i>(it says) <i>to the colour of his flesh. </i>Therefore as long as God the Word was in the Bosom of the Father, He shone with the brightness of Godhead, but when He was in a manner forth of it because of the Incarnation or being made Man, He became
<i>in the likeness of flesh of sin </i>and <i>was numbered among the wicked: </i>for the Divine Paul
saith, <i>Him who knew not sin</i> <A NAME="p206"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|206</SPAN></A>
<i>He made sin for us, that </i>we <i>might he made the Righteousness of God in Him.
</i>This I think is what the leprosy means, for the leper was unclean according to the Law. But when He was again in the Bosom of the Father (for He was taken up at the Resurrection from the dead), the Hand again brought forth was seen clean; for our Lord Jesus Christ will come, He will come in His season in the brightness and glory of the Godhead, although He have not cast away our likeness. For blessed Paul too saith of
Christ, For He <i>once died to take away the sins of many, and unto them that look for Him unto salvation shall He appear the second time without sin.</i></p>
<p>Therefore as often as the Divine Scripture names Christ Jesus, do not think of man by himself, but think rather that Jesus Christ is the Very Word out of God the Father, even

<p>They who have their faith in Christ undefiled, and approved by right votes of all men, will say that God the Word Himself out of God the Father descended into emptiness, taking servant's form and, making His own the Body which was born of the Virgin, was made as we and called Son of Man. He is indeed God according to the Spirit, yet the Same Man according to the flesh
<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>. And the Divine Paul also addressed the people of the Jews saying, <i>God Who manifoldly and in many ways of old spake to the fathers in the prophets, in these last days spake to us in
the Son. </i>And how is God the Father understood to have spoken <i>in the last days in His Son? </i>For He spake to them of old the Law through Him; and hence the Son Himself says  that they are His Words through the  most wise
<A NAME="p207"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|207</SPAN></A> Moses. For He says, <i>Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets, I am not come to destroy but to fulfil: for I say unto you that one jot or one tittle shall not pass from the Law till all be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away but My words shall not pass away:</i> there is also the Prophet's voice, <i>I that speak am at hand. </i>Hence when He was made in flesh, then spake <i>to us the Father through </i>Him, as saith blessed Paul, <i>in the last days. </i>But lest we should not believe that He it is Who before the ages also was Son, he added immediately, <i>Through Whom He made the worlds too: </i>he also mentions that He is <i>the brightness of the glory and the Impress of the Person </i>of the Father.</p>
<p>Man therefore was He truly made, through Whom God the Father <i>made the worlds too; </i>and was not (as some suppose) in a man, so as to be conceived of by us as a man who has God indwelling in him. For if they believe that these things are really so, superfluous will seem to be the blessed Evangelist John, saying, <i>And the Word was made Flesh. </i>For where the need of being made man? or why is God the Word said to be Incarnate, unless <i>was made flesh </i>means that He was made like us, and the force of the being made man declares that He was made like us, yet remained even so above us, yea also above the whole creation?</p>
<p>But I think it due by instances also to prove what I have said and to persuade that the Only-Begotten has been made Man and is God even with Flesh and hath not rather indwelt in a man, rendering him God-clad, like others too who have been made partakers of His Godhead.</p>

<p>It is written of Christ, <i>But when He was at Jerusalem in the feast day many believed in His Name, when they saw the signs which He was doing, but Jesus Himself trusted not Himself to them, because He knew all men and because He needed not that any one should bear witness of a man, for Himself knew what was in man. </i>If He were a God-clad man, how were not the many deceived who at Jerusalem believed on His Name? or how doth He Alone know the things which are in man when none else knoweth them
<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>? for God is said to have <i>fashioned </i>our <i>hearts one by one. </i>Or why doth He Alone forgive sins? for He
saith, <i>That the Son of Man hath power upon earth to forgive sins. </i>Why is He Alone apart from others the
Co-sessor of God the Father? why do the Angels worship Him Alone, and did He teach us to deem of the Father as our common Father which is in Heaven, but ascribeth Him in special manner to Himself?</p>
<p>But perchance you will say that words of this sort are to be attributed to the  indwelling Word.    Ought He not
<A NAME="p212"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|212</SPAN></A> therefore, according to the measure beseeming Prophets, Himself too to have said, <i>Thus saith the Lord
</i><A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>?<i> </i>But when He would ordain the things that are above the Law, taking to Himself authority befitting a Legislator, He used to
say, I <i>say to you.</i></p>
<p>How says He that He is free and not indebted <A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> to God? It is because He is Son in truth. And if He were a God-clad man, would He be also free by Nature? For God Alone is free and unbound: for He Alone exacts as it were tribute from all, and receives from all as from debtors due observance. And if Christ is the end of the Law and the Prophets, yet is a God-clad man, might one not say that the end of the prophetic preachings has brought upon us the charge of man-worship?</p>
<p>Again, the Law set forth, <i>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve. </i>By which teaching it led us unto Christ, as unto a knowledge more excellent than they had who were in the shadow: shall we therefore, making light of worshipping God, worship a man who has God indwelling? for where were it best that God be conceived to be? in heaven or in a man? in Seraphim or in earthly body?</p>
<p>If therefore He were God-clad man, how partook He like as we in flesh and blood? For if because He indwelt him, this were enough for Him that He should partake of ours like as we, and if His so participating is the being made man: He indwelt in many saints too: He was therefore not once but full often made man. Why therefore is He
said <i>once in the end of the world </i>to have <i>appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself? </i>how do the Divine
Scriptures preach to us one Coming of the Word?</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C26"></A>26.</SPAN>&nbsp;If <A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
He were a God-clad man, He too (it seems) was made the Temple of God, and how is Christ in us also? as a Temple in temples? or rather as God in the temples through
<A NAME="p213"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|213</SPAN></A> the Spirit? If He were a God-clad man, why is His Body alone Life-giving? for such should have been the bodies of others also, wherein indwelt Almighty God.</p>
<p>And the Divine Paul also wrote somewhere, <i>He that despised Moses' Law died without any mercy at the hands of two or three witnesses; of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the Son of God and hath deemed polluted the Blood of the Covenant?
</i>Yet Divine was the Law, and the Commandments spoken through Angels: how then will he be <i>thought worthy of sorer punishment
</i>who hath <i>deemed polluted the Blood of </i>Christ? or how is the faith Christ-ward better than the worship after the Law? But (as we have already said) Christ is not as other saints, a God-clad man, but rather God in truth and He possesses glory higher than all the world, because, being the Word of God by Nature, God was made flesh or perfect man; for we believe that the Body which was united to Him is ensouled and endowed with reason, and wholly true is the union.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C27"></A>27.</SPAN>&nbsp;How we must understand <i>The Word was made Flesh and dwelt in us, </i>and how the Word is sent which is God, and how the Body is said to be His own.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blessed Paul makes mention that the Only-Begotten Word of God took hold of Abraham's seed and also that He partook of flesh and blood as we. We remember too the voice of John, for he says, <i>And the Word was made Flesh and dwelt in us. </i>Was it therefore the aim of these men, being spiritual, to teach that the Word of God suffers change, or that it is right that He should undergo the mutation which belongs rather to the creature? so that that too which He was not, He should haply either come to of His own will, or another against His will drive Him into another nature? God forbid: for He remains the Same, excluding from His Nature every change, unknowing to suffer <i>a shadow of turning: </i>for That Supreme and Heavenly Nature is ever fixed in Its own.</p>
<p>How then the Word has been made Flesh it is needful to see.    First then the Divine Scripture full often calls man
<A NAME="p214"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|214</SPAN></A> flesh and as it were from part makes declaration of the whole animal, and does the same sometimes no less from the soul alone, for it is written that <i>all flesh shall see the salvation of God, </i>and moreover the Divine-uttering Paul
saith, <i>I conferred not with flesh and blood, </i>and the hierophant Moses addressed them of Israel, <i>Thy fathers went down into Egypt in threescore and fifteen souls. </i>And one would not therefore say that bare and fleshless souls made their descent into Egypt, nor again that to soulless bodies and mere flesh God gave bounteously of His salvation.</p>
<p>As often therefore as we hear that the Word was made Flesh, let us conceive of man made out of soul and body. But the Word being God was made perfect man taking a body endowed with soul and mind, and having united this to Himself in truth, as He knows (for thoughts of this kind are utterly unattainable by our mind), was called son of man. Yet if one must say somewhat, looking as in a mirror, the human mind defines that the Word was united to the Body having a reasonable soul, much as is the soul of man too to its own body, which is of other nature than it, yet obtains even thus participation and union with the body, so as to appear not other than it, in that by composition one living thing is effected out of both, it nevertheless remaining (as I mentioned before) in its own nature. Hence we say that not by mutation or change has the Word of God been made Man, nor yet that It recked not of being God (how could it be so?) but that taking flesh of a woman and united to it from the womb, He proceeded forth, the Same, Man and God, for not as casting away the Ineffable Generation out of God the Father, did He endure that of a woman, inviting Him to a beginning so to say of being, but rather permitted to His own Flesh to be called into being by means of the laws of its own nature, in regard I mean to the mode of its birth: nevertheless the human nature hath in Him something special, for He was born of a Virgin and hath Alone a mother incognizant of marriage. And he says that <i>made Flesh </i>He also <i>tabernacled in us, </i>that through both he might shew that He both was made Man
<A NAME="p215"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|215</SPAN></A> and let not go His own, for He hath remained what He was.</p>
<p>For that which dwelleth is full surely conceived of as one thing in another, to wit, the Divine Nature in the human, not undergoing mixture or any commingling or passing into what it was not. For that which indwells in another, becomes not that which it is wherein it dwells; but is conceived of rather as one thing in another. But in respect of the Nature of the Word and of the Manhood, the diversity herein indicates to us only the difference [of natures]. For One Christ is conceived of out of both. Preserving well therefore (as I said before) the inconfusion, he says that <i>the Word tabernacled in us. </i>For he knows that the Only-Begotten Incarnate and made Man is One Son.</p>
<p>But see (I pray) that the Divine Evangelist is wisely crowning the whole nature of men, for he says that the Word <i>dwelt in us, </i>not saying that the Incarnation of the Word took place for any other reason (as seems to me) save that we too, enriched by the participation of Himself through the Holy Ghost might gain the benefit of adoption. Therefore we believe that in Christ took place an union most complete and true: but in us even though He be said to dwell, He will make His Indwelling non-essential
<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>. <i>For in Him dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead
bodily, </i>i. e., not by participance or relation only, as when light shineth in or fire infuseth into other things its innate heat, but (so to say) that Very Divine and Untaint Nature is to be understood as that which is making for Itself an Indwelling by means of a true (as we said before) Union in the Temple which is born of the Virgin: for thus Christ Jesus both is and is conceived of as One.</p>
<p>And that our speech is overcome in its utmost possible expression, I will not deny, but let not the Mystery of Christ be therefore disbelieved, but let it be deservedly
<A NAME="p216"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|216</SPAN></A> more marvellous: for the more it overpasses all mind and speech, the more must it be put beyond all marvel.</p>
<p>But we do not say that the Word made Flesh, i. e., Perfect man, is comprehended by the limit of the body (for that were most silly), but we believe that thus too It fills (as It useth) Heaven and earth and the things below: for all things are full of God, and all things little to Him. But how is He wholly both in each and in all, is hard to understand and say, yea rather is even impossible.</p>
<p>And He possesses this too (as I suppose) that He is without Body and Unportioned; yet is the Body called by us the own of the Word, not in the same way as laughing is proper to a man or neighing to a horse, but because it was made His by true union, accomplishing the use of an instrument unto whatever was its nature to work, save only what belongs to sin.</p>
<p>Yea and if God the Word be haply said to have been sent, let not any one of you be terrified, thinking, Whither shall the Unembodied advance? or whither He withdraw of Whom all things are full? but let him know that the mode of mission is of another kind: not that He Who is sent should change from place to place but rather that He should take on Him a sacred ministry, which we learn was also enjoined to the disciples by Christ the Saviour of all. Again, the Divine Paul too says of Christ, <i>Wherefore, holy
brethren partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus Christ, </i>Note
that when he shews Him ministering in human wise albeit He is by nature God, then does he also attribute to Him the office of the Apostolate: but it is nought unreasonable (as we said before) if God the Word be said to be sent by the Father, for He most surely fills all things and in no place at all is He absent: but we interpreting things Divine by human words, are wont to understand economies of the Immortal Nature by bodily outlines.</p>
<p>Again though the Holy Ghost fills all things, the blessed Paul writes and says, <i>And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, wherein we cry Abba,</i>
<A NAME="p217"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|217</SPAN></A> <i>Father: </i>and the Saviour Himself too
saith, <i>It is expedient for you that I go away, for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you, but when I depart I will send Him to you </i><A HREF="#30"><sup>30</sup></A>.<i> </i>We must therefore referring all things to the Rule of piety, follow sure knowledge, for so doing shall we best profit ourselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C28"></A>28.</SPAN>&nbsp;How the holy Virgin is conceived of as Mother of God.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Word out of God the Father was begotten in some ineffable way (for beyond all understanding is His Generation, and as befits the Unembodied Nature): yet is That which is begotten conceived of as the Own Offspring of the Generator and Consubstantial with Him, for therefore is It called also Son: the Name indicating to us the Verity of the (so to say) Birth and Parturition. And since the Father ever liveth and hath being, it must needs be that He on account of Whom He is Father co-live and have co-Being Eternally with Him. <i>The Word </i>therefore <i>was in the beginning and was God and, was with God </i>(as saith the most wise Evangelist), but in the last times of the world <i>for us men and for our salvation was made flesh and was made Man: </i>and not at all letting go what He was, but having His own Nature unchanged and existing ever in the excellences of Godhead, yet undergoing for us economically the emptiness and not despising the poverty that belongs to the human measures. For being <i>Rich He became poor </i>(as it is written), that we <i>by His poverty might become rich. </i>He was made therefore Man and is said to have endured Generation after the flesh of a woman, because of His taking of the holy Virgin the Body that was united to Him of a truth: whence we say that the holy Virgin is Mother of God, as having borne Him in fleshly or human wise, albeit that He hath His Generation before the ages out of the Father
<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>. <A NAME="p218"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|218</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this, that some suppose that the Word was then called to a beginning of being when He became Man, is utterly impious and exceeding discordant. For the Saviour Himself shews them to be most unwise, saying in regard to Himself, <i>Verily I say unto you, Before Abraham was </i>I <i>am: </i>for how was He before Abraham Who was born after the flesh many ages after him? The Divine-uttering John too will I deem suffice to convict them saying, <i>This was He of Whom </i>I <i>said, After me cometh a Man Who was made before me, for He was before me.</i></p>
<p>Leaving therefore as exceeding foolish to contend about what is superfluous, come let us rather go on to what is beyond, I mean unto what is profitable. Let not any be troubled, hearing the holy Virgin called Mother of God, nor let them fill their souls with Jewish unbelief, yea rather with Gentile impiety. For the Jews attacked Christ saying, <i>For a good work we stone Thee not but for blasphemy because </i>Thou, <i>being a Man, makest Thyself God: </i>and the children of the Greeks, hearing the doctrines of the Church that God hath been born of a woman, laugh.</p>
<p>But they shall eat the fruit of their own impiety, and shall hear of us, <i>The fool will utter folly and his heart imagine vain things. </i>But the plan of our Mystery, albeit <i>to the Jews it be an offence, to the Gentiles folly, </i>yet to us who know it, verily admirable is it and saving and far removed from being to be disbelieved by any. For if there were any whatever who should dare to say that this flesh made of earth had become mother of the bare Godhead, and that she bare out of her own self the Nature which is over the whole creation, the thing would be madness and nothing else: for not of earth has the Divine Nature been made, nor will that which is subject to decay become the root of immortality nor that which is subject to death bear the Life of all things, nor yet the Unembodied be the fruit of the palpable body, that which is subject to birth [bear] that which is superior to birth, that which hath its beginning in time, that which is without beginning.</p>
<p>But since we affirm that the Word became as we and <A NAME="p219"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|219</SPAN></A>
took a body like to our bodies and united this of a truth unto Himself, in a way namely beyond understanding and speech, and that He was thus too made Man and born after the flesh, what is there incredible therein or worthy of disbelief? albeit the human soul (as we have already full often said) being of other nature than the body, is yet born with it, just as we say that it too has been united therewith. Yet will no one (I deem) suppose that the soul has the nature of the body as the beginning of its own existence, but God inplaces it ineffably in the body and it is born along with it; yet do we define as one the animal that is made up out of both,
i. e., man. Therefore the Word was God but was made Man too, and since He has been born after the flesh by reason of the human nature, she who bare Him is necessarily Mother of God. For if she have not borne God, let not Him Who is born of her be called God; but if the God-inspired Scriptures call Him God, as God Incarnate and made Flesh, and it be not possible in any other way to be Incarnate, save through birth of a woman, how is she not Mother of God, who bare Him?</p>
<p>But that He is truly God Who was born, we shall know from the God-inspired Scripture too.</p>

<p>The Passion therefore will belong to the Economy, God the Word esteeming as His own the things which pertain to His own Flesh, by reason of the Ineffable Union, and remaining external to suffering as far as pertains to His own Nature, for God is Impassible. And no wonder, since we see that the soul itself of a man, if its body suffer somewhat, remains external to the suffering as far as belongs to its own nature, yet is it not conceived of as external to suffering, in that the body which suffers is its very own: and albeit it be impalpable and simple, yet is that which suffers not foreign to it. Thus will you understand of Christ too the Saviour of all.</p>
<p>But I will make use of examples which may shew us by way of shadow, that the Only-Begotten shared in the suffering as far as belongs to the ownness of His Body, yet remained free from suffering, as God. Almighty God then was bidding the most wise Moses to work miracles, that Israel might believe him that he was sent from God, and that they should be set free from violence: He says, <i>And
thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the earth, and the water which thou shalt take from the river, shall he blood upon the earth. </i>But we say that the water
is an image of life, and that the Son proceeding out of the Father as out of a river, by reason of being of the
<A NAME="p226"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|226</SPAN></A> Same Essence, is by Nature Life, and therefore quickens all things. But when (He says) thou shalt have poured forth the water, <i>it shall be blood upon the earth. </i>Hence, when He was made flesh of the earth,
i. e., when He girt Himself with flesh from the earth, then is He said to have suffered death in it like to our death, albeit He is by Nature Life.</p>
<p>In Leviticus God intimates that the leper is polluted and impure and therefore bids that he should be put forth of the camp, and that if the disease be healed, he should thus be cleansed. <i>And they shall take for him that is cleansed two clean birds and cedar wood and scarlet wool and hyssop, and the priest shall command and they shall hill one of the birds in an earthen vessel in living water, and the living bird shall he take and shall bathe it in the blood of the bird that was killed in the living water and he shall sprinkle upon him who is cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and he shall be clean. </i>Us there rendereth clean and washeth away the soils of our uncleanness and driveth off the mortality of fleshly desire the Most Precious Blood of Christ and the purification of all-holy Baptism. But note this (for letting alone subtil search into the force of the Scriptures, we will for the present make mention of what helps to the mystery): he compares Christ to two birds
<A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>, not as though there were two sons, but rather one out of two, the Godhead and the manhood, gathered together into union. The birds are clean, for our Lord Jesus Christ did no sin, but the Word was holy, in Godhead and in Manhood: He is likened again to flying things, by reason of His being high above the earth and from above, for Christ is <i>the Man out of Heaven, </i>albeit the holy Virgin bare His Flesh
<A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>. <A NAME="p227"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|227</SPAN></A> How then is He from above and out of Heaven? God the Word from above and out of the Father, taking flesh from the holy Virgin and manifesting it as His own, as though He had brought it down from above and out of Heaven, said, <i>No man hath ascended up into Heaven, save He That came down from Heaven, the Son of Man: </i>for He ever allotteth to His own Flesh that which is His own, and once united to it is accounted one with it.</p>
<p>Yet see, when the one bird is slain, the other is dipped in his blood, yet died not. And what is this? The Word lived, even though His Flesh died, and He was participant in the Passion, through ownness and union with it. Therefore the Same was living, as God, but like as He made His Body His own, so did He receive into Himself in all ownness the sufferings too of His Body, Himself suffering nought in His own Nature. It is therefore helpful and necessary unto profit that in regard to Christ we should admit the <i>after one manner and another, </i>as belonging to one and the same person, yet should not permit Him to be severed into two sons, albeit the things done be said to be of diverse kind and in no ways harmonizing with one another.</p>
<p>This is what I mean: we say that God the Word is born out of a woman after the flesh, albeit Himself give to all to be born, and call to the birth the things which are not yet
<A NAME="p228"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|228</SPAN></A> born. How then doth the Same both undergo birth and call to being? After one manner and another. For He was born, in that He is conceived of as Man like us, He calleth into being the things that are not, in that He is God by Nature; for it is written of Him, <i>The Little one waxed and grew strong, filled with wisdom and grace, </i>albeit He is by Nature all-Perfect as God, and <i>out of His </i>own <i>Fulness </i>imparteth spiritual gifts to the saints, and is Himself Wisdom and the Giver of grace. How then waxeth the Little one and is <i>filled with wisdom and grace? </i>After one manner and another. For the Same, Man alike and God, makes His own the human, by reason of the union, and is all-Perfect and Giver of wisdom and grace as God.</p>
<p>He is called First-born and Only-Begotten, but if one should examine the force of the words, the First-born will be He Who is First-born among many brethren, the Only-Begotten as Sole, no longer First-born among many brethren. Yet is the Same one and other; how then? After one manner and another. First-born among many brethren by reason of the human nature, the Same again Only-Begotten, as Alone Begotten of the Alone God the Father. He is said to have been sanctified through the Spirit and moreover to sanctify
<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A> those who come to Him; He was baptized according to the Flesh and was baptizing in the Holy Ghost; how then doth the Same both sanctify and is sanctified, baptizeth and is baptized? After one manner and another; for He is sanctified humanly, and thus is He baptized: He sanctifies Divinely and baptizeth in the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Himself raising the dead was raised from the dead, and being Life by Nature is said to quicken. And how again? After one manner and another. For the Same was raised from the dead and is said to be quickened after the Flesh, yet quickens and raises the dead as God. He suffers and does not suffer
<A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>, after one manner and another:  for He <A NAME="p229"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|229</SPAN></A>
suffers humanly in the Flesh as Man, He is impassible Divinely as God.</p>
<p>Himself hath adored with us, for Ye <i>worship </i>(He says) <i>what ye know not, </i>we <i>worship what we know: </i>yet is He
to be adored also, for to Him <i>every knee boweth: </i>and this again after one manner and another. For He worshippeth as having assumed the nature that payeth worship, He again the Same is worshipped as surpassing the nature that worshippeth in that He is conceived of as God. Yet must we not sever the worship unto man by himself and God by Himself, nor yet as connected with God by equality of dignity, while the Persons are dissevered, do we say that the man is worshipped with Him (for it were replete with the uttermost impiety): but we must worship One Word of God Incarnate and made man, and at the same time believe that the Body united to Him was ensouled with a reasonable soul like ours. For neither did God Almighty bid two first-borns to be worshipped as well by us as by the holy Angels (for One is He Who was brought <i>into the world</i>):<i> </i>and if we look more carefully into the mode of this bringing in, we find it to be the mystery of the Economy with flesh. But He was brought into the world then when He was made Man, albeit He be seen to be in His own Nature most far removed from the earth and be believed to be truly in the Excellence of Godhead: for Other than the elements is their Maker. Therefore above the things which Himself made is He by Nature in that He is God by Nature. Yet is One (as I said before) to be worshipped then too when He is <i>among many brethren: </i>for then is He for that reason called <i>First-born.</i></p>
<p>One <A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A> did the blind from the birth when wondrously healed worship: for <i>Jesus </i>(it says) <i>finding him in the temple said, Dost </i>thou <i>believe on the Son of God, </i>and he said, <i>Who is He, Lord, that I might believe on Him?   </i>Christ
<A NAME="p230"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|230</SPAN></A> manifesting Himself embodied to him says, <i>Thou had both seen Him and He That speaketh with thee is He. </i>Seest thou how He used the singular number, not permitting God and man to be conceived of separately? yea rather if one were to call Emmanuel man, it signifies not bare man (far from it) but the Word of God united to our nature. As One did the Divine disciples worship Him, when beholding Him wondrously borne on the waters they worshipped <i>saying, Truly </i><A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A> <i> Thou art the Son of God. </i></p>
<p>When therefore Ave say that man is co-worshipped with God, we have brought in a gross severance. For the word, <i>With, </i>except it be said of one by composition, will always full surely persuade us to conceive of two. For like as no one will be said to live with himself nor again to eat with to pray with and to walk with himself (for the <i>with </i>prefixed to the word introduces a declaration of two persons): so if one say that the man is co-worshipped with God, he will without question say two sons and severed one from another: for the plan of union, if it be
<A NAME="p231"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|231</SPAN></A> conceived of in regard to mere equality of dignity or authority, is convicted of being untrue. And this has been shewn by us in many words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C37"></A>37.</SPAN>&nbsp;Against those who say the human befit God the Word by reference only.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some prate concerning the Economy with flesh of the Only-Begotten and, bringing down to our frail perceptions the Mystery venerable and great and most dear to the Spirits above, whereby also we are saved, pollute the comeliness and beauty of the Truth, whereas they ought, not to try and prop up whatever seems to them right, but rather with subtil and keen eye of the mind to look into the aim of the Sacred Writings and thus to go on the right road, following what the most holy fathers have searched out, who taught by the illuminings of the Holy Ghost, denned for us the Symbol of faith, saying that the God the Word Himself Which was in mode ineffable
<A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A> begotten out of the Essence of the Father, by Whom all things were made which are in Heaven and which are in earth, for us men and for our salvation came down, was made flesh, was made man, suffered, ascended into heaven, will in his season come to judge quick and dead.</p>
<p>But there are certain who deem that they are learned and knowing and are puffed up with pride and swelling, who if they hear these words, mock, and deem that those things which are so rightly said, are mad ravings: while we specially believe that the knowledge of the Truth lay open through the illumination of the Holy Ghost to the holy Fathers. But they, as if they alone could think what is better, deem that not the Only-Begotten Son of God Himself, God the Word Which is out of His Essence, suffered in His own Flesh for us humanly, albeit conceived of as God He have in His own Nature the inability to suffer; but putting as man separately and by himself him that was born of the holy Virgin, and attributing to him to what extent it seems good to them, a kind of glory, they say that he was united to the Word of God the Father.    And
<A NAME="p232"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|232</SPAN></A> explaining the mode of the union, they say that there was given him by God equality of dignity or authority and to be called by like name both Christ and Son and Lord. But if the man who is invented by them be said to suffer ought, it must (they say) be referred to God the Word Himself, in that he is connected to Him by equality of worth, while in their severed natures each is what he is.</p>
<p>I will open the force of their opinions, so far as I can, bringing forward instances from the Sacred Writings. Christ hungered, was wearied with the journey, slept, entered into the boat, was stricken with blows by the attendants, was scourged by Pilate, received the spittle of the soldiers, who piercing with the spear His Side, offered vinegar mingled with gall to His Mouth: yea and He tasted death, suffering the Cross and other contumelies of the Jews. All these things they declare to have befallen indeed the man, but to be referred to the Person of the Very Son. But we believe, as in One God the Father Almighty, Maker of all things visible and invisible, so too in One our Lord Jesus Christ His Son. And we refuse to divide Emmanuel into man by himself and into the Word by Himself: but knowing that the Word became truly Man too as we, we say that Himself the Same is God of God, and in human wise Man as we of a woman. And we assert that by reason of the ownness of the flesh He suffered indeed infirmities, yet reserved to His Nature its impassibility, in that He was not Man alone but the Same therewith also God by Nature. And like as the Body was His own, so too the natural and blameless passions of the body and the things which by the frowardness of some were put upon Him.</p>
<p>He suffered without suffering Who did not therefore humble Himself that He might only be like us, but because (as I said before) He had reserved to His Nature superiority to all these things. But if we should say that through conversion or mutation of His own Nature He had passed into the nature of the flesh
<A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>, it would be in all ways <A NAME="p233"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|233</SPAN></A>
necessary for us even against our will to confess that the Hidden and Divine Nature was
passible. But if He have remained unchanged albeit He have been made man as we, and it be a property of the Heavenly Nature that It cannot suffer, and the passible body have become His own through the union:----He suffers when the Body suffers, in that it is said to be His own body. He remains Impassible in that it is truly His property to be unable to suffer.</p>
<p>And if Emmanuel have been glorified through suffering, as Himself says when about to suffer for us the Precious
Cross, <i>Now is the son of man glorified, </i>why do they not blush, attributing the glory of the Passion to a man having connection only with Him in Equality of dignity? for as they deem, He connected with Himself according to the Will and Good-pleasure of the Father a man only and made him equal to His own glory, and permitted that by like name he should be styled both Christ and Son and God and Lord:----hence neither is the Word truly Incarnate nor was He at all made man. And haply to call the holy doctors of the whole world false and liars, will do no harm? for either let them say, yea rather come forward and prove that the mode of connection which is brought in by
<A NAME="p234"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|234</SPAN></A> them has the force of incarnation and that that is that the Word was made flesh; or if they think that these things are not so, why do they invent for us a mode of unconnected connection, the truth being neglected? whereas it would be fitting that they should say that the Word of God the Father was united to our humanity, for thus in His own flesh is He conceived to have suffered what belongs to man, but so far as pertains to the Nature of the Godhead, He is free from all that disturbs, as God.</p>
<p>And that by speaking of <i>reference </i><A HREF="#45"><sup>45</sup></A>, which I know not how they invented, they withdraw Emmanuel from His Glory and make Him barely one of the Prophets, and set Him amid the measure of the many, and are full surely caught thus doing, I will prove, giving examples from the Divine Scripture.</p>
<p>There once murmured <A HREF="#46"><sup>46</sup></A> in the wilderness against Moses and Aaron the people of Israel saying, <i>Would we had died, stricken by the Lord in Egypt when we were sitting at the flesh pots and were eating bread even to fulness. </i>Therefore the most wise Moses says (for it were like that he should reply to men so rashly impatient), <i>But who are </i>we? <i>for neither against us is your murmuring but against God. </i>And in those times even God Almighty used to reign through the holy Prophets over the people of Israel, but they in this too, slack of courage approached the Divine Samuel saying, <i>Lo </i>THOU <i>hast grown old and thy sons walk not in thy ways and now set over us a king which may judge us even as the other nations. </i>The Prophet felt this grievously but Almighty God said, <i>Hear the voice of the people even as they have spoken to thee, for not thee have they rejected but Me they have rejected that I should not reign over them.</i></p>
<p>And elsewhere too has Christ said to the holy Apostles, <i>He who receiveth you hath received Me: </i>and He promiseth that He will address the merciful before His Tribunal, <i>Come, ye blessed of My Father, </i>receive <i>the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.    </i>And
<A NAME="p235"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|235</SPAN></A> acknowledging as His own their righteous ways towards those to whom they had dealt kindly, He says, <i>In that ye
did it to one of these least, to Me did ye it. </i></p>
<p>Lo in these instances is clearly recognized the mode of reference of what kind it is. The people of Israel were murmuring against Moses and Aaron and the matter had reference to God, yet were Moses and Aaron men as we. In the same way too will you conceive as to the others whereof we have just made mention, yet were some (as I said before) holy men and worthy of admiration, yet men as we. Is it then in this way that the man too who is connected (as they call it) with God the Word, will have reference of his sufferings to Himward? And how will he not now be mere man and apart and nought else? Hence Emmanuel is not truly God, is not Only-Begotten Son, is not God by Nature.</p>
<p>Why then was no one of the rest honoured by God the Word with equality of dignity or of sway, but they contend that this man alone obtained all things equal? specially seeing that God, the Saviour of all men, judgeth <i>not
according to the person hut righteous judgement, </i>as Himself maketh mention. Why then doth He co-sit Alone? how will He come as Judge, with Angels waiting on Him? why is He Alone worshipped as well by us as by the spirits above?</p>
<p>But in good truth it is so (says he), for we find that thou also dost the same, for thou confessest that He suffered, in that thou attributest to Him the sufferings of the flesh, albeit thou keepest Him impassible as God.</p>
<p>But we, good sirs, (shall I say) having first united to the Word the human, have to the flesh allotted the sufferings, have kept Him impassible as God: for though He hath become as we, yet are we cognizant of His God-befitting Excellence and of His Supreme Endowments.</p>
<p>Hence first putting the Union as a basis and foundation to the Faith, we confess that He suffered in the flesh, that He remained again superior to suffering in that He possesses Impassibility in His own Nature.    But if we are
<A NAME="p236"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|236</SPAN></A> diligent to put apart God and Man, severing the Natures one from another, and then say that in reference only does the Word of God make His own what have befallen His Body; He That is born of the holy Virgin, <i>Emmanuel, which is, interpreted, With us is God, </i>will haply have but the measure of Moses and Aaron.</p>
<p>Thus even though He say through the holy Prophets, <i>My Back have I given to scourges, My Cheeks to blows, My Face
I turned not from the shame of spittings, </i>and again, <i>They dug My Hands and My Feet, they told all My Bones, </i>and again, <i>They gave for My meat gall and for My thirst they gave Me to drink vinegar: </i>we shall allot all these things to the Only-Begotten Himself, Who suffered Economically in the flesh according to the Scriptures (for <i>with His wheal
were </i>we <i>healed, and Himself hath been weakened because of our sins</i>), yet do we know that He is Impassible by Nature. For if (as I just said) Himself is Man alike and God, with reason do the Sufferings belong to His Manhood, His own as God is it to be conceived of as superior to suffering.</p>
<p>Thus minded shall we be pious and through such right thoughts advancing, we shall attain <i>unto the prize of our high calling </i>in Christ Jesus, through Whom, and with Whom to God the Father be glory with the Holy Ghost unto ages of ages, Amen.</p>

[comp. dial. i. p. 398 c, hom. pasch. x, A.D. 423, p. 159 c] but has been made in truth this which we too are,
without only sin. He is therefore God in that He is Word of the Father, and the own of His Essence; man, in that He hath been made flesh as it is written, and put about Him our flesh. The faith respecting our Lord Jesus Christ having this definition, let the words [spoken] of Him be discerned according to the ratio befitting them; and if thou hear, I <i>and the Father are One, </i>view the One Godhead of the Son and of the</p>
<p>Father and conceive of the Son as God out of the Essence of the Father; if again thou hear of Him that He wept and was grieved and was in fear and <i>began to be in sore distress, </i>conceive of Him again as being man along with being also God and attribute to the human nature what is due thereto. For since He took a Body mortal and subject to decay and liable to such like passions, needs does He with the flesh make His own its sufferings, and when it endures them, Himself is said to be enduring them. For thus do we say that He was both crucified and died, the flesh suffering this, not the Word apart and by Himself, for He is Impassible and Immortal. Hence we shall orthodoxly receive what is said,
allotting to the Godhead the God-befitting, attributing to the flesh the things spoken of because of it and as it were forth of it through the natural motions that are in us: of which the mind having the perception, gushes up through the tongue the things voicelessly whispered in the depth out of sight.&quot;

<p><A NAME="33"></A>33.&nbsp;<sup>h</sup> Either Immanuel, <i>With us is God, </i>or, Jesus, <i>Saviour, </i>are new names, as specially belonging to the time of the Incarnation. S. Cyril elsewhere speaks of each: in his Thesaurus he had said, &quot;Except the Son were God by Nature, He would not have been called, <i>With us is God, </i>which took place when He was born through a woman, assuming likeness with us. Not at all of an angel or of any other generate being is the word, <i>Emmanuel, </i>the invention, but the Father thus named the Son. And the holy Prophet will be our witness, saying of the Divine Offspring, <i>And they shall call His name that new Name which the Lord shall give Him </i>(Isa.
lxii. 2 LXX). For a <i>new name </i>verily to the Son is <i>Emmanuel, that is, With us is God. </i>For before His Presence in the world with flesh, He was and was called merely God; after the Birth from the Virgin, no longer merely God, but, <i>with us, </i>i. e. God made man. Since therefore the Father calls His own Son God, let them blush who impiously and unlearnedly say that He was made. For what is by Nature God, is not a creature,&quot; cap. 32 p. 303 b c.   &quot;This new Name (Jesus)
we say has been given to the Word through the Angel's voice.&quot; de recta fide to the Emperor, p. 2p d. &quot;Before the times of the Incarnation no one is found naming the Word out of God, Jesus or Christ, unless by foreknowledge that He should be called this in due time when He also was made flesh. A <i>new name </i>therefore to Him is the Name <i>Jesus, </i>when He was made man.&quot; de recta fide to the Princesses, p. 120 d. &quot;For <i>a new name </i>to the Word is Jesus, concurrent with the birth of the flesh. And the Prophet's oracle will support us, which says, <i>And they shall call His Name the new name which the Lord shall give Him</i>.&quot; Dial. v. 551 d. &quot;For when will any shew that the Word was called Jesus or Christ, save because He was made man? for He is <i>Jesus, </i>because He saves His people, Christ, because anointed for our sakes. Therefore not the Word out of God the Father, as yet bare before the Incarnation, but made in flesh does he call both Jesus and Christ: and of Him questionless does he say that He was <i>yesterday and to-day, The Same too for ever.&quot; </i>Hom. Pasch. vii. (A.D. 420) p. 101 b c.</p>

(<span class="Greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;' &#x1F21;&#x03BC;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;</span>),<i> </i>be he anathema. For
that <i>the second Man </i>is <i>out of Heaven, </i>and <i>As is the Heavenly, such too they that are heavenly, </i>and, <i>No one hath gone up into Heaven except He Who came out of Heaven, the Son of Man, </i>and whatever else there is, is to be understood as said, because of the union with the Heavenly
(<span class="Greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x1F70; &#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03BD; &#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x1F78;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x1F78;&#x03BD; &#x03BF;&#x1F50;&#x03C1;&#x1F71;&#x03BD;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x1F15;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>).&quot; t.1 p. 740 ed. Par. 1609.</p>
<p>S. Cyril in 7th Paschal homily (A.D. 420, probably almost ten years before his books against
Nestorius) had said, &quot; God the Word was born on earth through the holy Virgin, after the flesh, but came down from heaven. How then does He say that <i>the Son of man came down out of Heaven? </i>how again does He say that He <i>will go up where He was before </i>(S. John vi. 62)? Thou seest therefore how drawing in the ineffable concurrence in union unparted and unsevered
(<span class="Greek">&#x1F00;&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F71;&#x03C4;&#x1FF3; &#x03C4;&#x03B5; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x1F00;&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1FF3; . . . &#x1F11;&#x03BD;&#x1F79;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;</span>),<i> </i>He would have One Christ both
before flesh and with flesh confessed by us. Therefore He says that His flesh albeit by nature of earth came down from above and out of Heaven, and will ascend into Heaven too <i>where it was before. </i>For that which is inherent in Him by Nature He puts about His own flesh as being not other than it as regards the Economic union. And we will not because of the utter union of things unlike in their nature, take away the fact that One is properly the Radiance of the Father, the other again the little flesh
(<span class="Greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03BA;&#x1F77;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) of earth or perfect man: but even thus distinguishing and in mere ideas (see above p. 78 note z) parting the plan of each, we will draw them in to union again
unparted. For <i>the Word was made flesh, </i>according to the holy Evangelist, not turned into flesh.&quot; p. 102 b c d. See also de recta fide to the Emperor, p. 36 a b.</p>
<p><A NAME="39"></A>39.&nbsp;<sup>o</sup> &quot;He sanctifies, being Holy by Nature, as God; He is sanctified with us humanly, when taking the likeness with us (and in this respect I mean He is
sanctified albeit having authority over all as God), He <i>is not ashamed to call us brothers.&quot; </i>dial. vi. p. 596 e.&nbsp;</p>
<p><A NAME="40"></A>40.&nbsp;<sup> p</sup> &quot;If being God Immortal, He is said
to die as man, being; Most High as God He is said to be exalted as man.&quot;
Thes. cap. 20 p. 196 c. See the very similar words near the end of the Quod Unus, pp. 302-304, and the notes f, g, h.</p>
<p><A NAME="41"></A>41.&nbsp;<sup>q</sup> See this same argument in the treatise de Recta Fide to the Emperor Theodosius p. 31, put forth anew in the little Dialogue De Incarnatione
Unigeniti, p. 703: see also above, p. 76.</p>
<p><A NAME="42"></A>42.&nbsp;<sup>r</sup> S. Cyril's argument on those words in his Thesaurus, against the Arians who denied the Son's Godhead, equally holds here as to its being no mere man apart by himself who was walking on the water. S. Cyril says, &quot;What then will they say who contend against the Truth and follow only their own likings, when they seethe whole choir of the holy Apostles together worshipping the Son as God and saying with an oath that <i>Truly </i>He is <i>the Son of God? </i>for if according to their unlearning He is one of the creatures how is He <i>truly Son of God? </i>for it were impossible that one who has not by nature come forth out of any, and who has not the own
(<span class="Greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x1F34;&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) of the essence of him who begat him, be truly son. And how if the disciples made a mistake in saying this, was the Saviour silent, albeit He did not disregard them when they made mistakes? and verily to Peter when on one occasion he answered not aright, He
says, <i>Get behind Me satan, thou art an offence to Me because thou savourest not
God's but man's. </i>But since He was silent, when called <i>truly the Son of God, </i>in that He rebuked them not as mistaken, it is clear that He accepts them as  saying  aright.    Seeing then that
the holy Apostles say that He is Son and <i>truly </i>so, and that Christ Himself assents to it, who will endure them who bruit something else?&quot;
Thes. cap. 32, pp. 308 d e. &quot;What did the most wise disciples, esteeming Him as Son not as creature? For when stepping on edge of wave, strewing neath His Feet with ineffable might the moist and soon-dissolving nature of the waters, He coursed the wide expanse, and gave the holy disciples an unwonted wonder, and at length of His own will vent with them and sailed in their little skiff, albeit He might most easily, had He willed to do it, have been borne on the waves themselves: they in astonishment and reflecting on that resistless authority, began to worship saying, <i>Truly Thou art Son of God. </i>Will they then, doing this with an oath and saying that He is <i>truly Son of God, </i>be reasonably accused of falsehood and be taken and convicted of aberration from the truth? For if He is not Son, sprung of the Essence of Him Who begat Him, but a creature, gilded with the glory of sonship and having the appellation in mere words, why did they worship Him? why did the initiators and heralds of the Truth call Him Son?&quot;   Dial ii. p.437 d e.</p>
<p><A NAME="43"></A>43.&nbsp;<sup>s</sup>  inaestimabiliter, put at the beginning of &sect; 28 to translate
<span class="Greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x03C1;&#x1F75;&#x03C4;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span>; the Syriac version too gives <i>unspeakably.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="44"></A>44.&nbsp;<sup>t</sup> This most carefully guarded language of S. Cyril is not the effect of any
necessity arising from controversy with Nestorius, but of a mind from the beginning educated in careful precision of thought and utterance as regards the Mystery of the Incarnation. In his 7th Paschal homily (A.D. 420), after speaking of great agricultural distress in various degrees of severity in different villages in Egypt, S. Cyril points out that it is the due punishment of their sin and speaks of the proneness to pity of the Only-Begotten, and that He is God and Man in One. See a passage quoted from this Homily, above p. 227 note n, and the closing words of the extract, &quot;For the <i>Word was made flesh, </i>as saith the holy Evangelist, not turned into flesh; for he says not this, but called Him flesh, instead of saying in full man.&quot;
Hom. Pasch. vii. 102 d. And in the Thesaurus, &quot;It was then the aim of the Incarnate Word to shew clearly that He really put about Him flesh and has been made man, not casting away the being God the Word: for it was not possible that the human race should in other way be saved. Yet lest any hearing that He has been made flesh should suppose that
the Unchangeable Word of God has been transformed and become ought else than He was from the beginning, needs does He at one time utter words befitting man, at another displays deeds belonging to Godhead alone, in order
that both together (<span class="Greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x03C6;&#x1F79;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>)<i> </i>may be conceived of.... Sin, as sinless and unknowing to have it Me rightly rejects, but suffers His body and His human nature to suffer what belong to the nature itself, as a proof that He really and truly bears flesh and was made man, according to the Scriptures. But since (as we said above) it behoved Him to be shewn forth as God even in flesh, He works sometimes what belong to God and says to them who see Him, <i>If ye believe not Me, </i>i. e. by reason of looking on a man, <i>yet believe My works, that ye may know and believe that </i>I <i>am in the Father and the Father in Me. </i>Hence the things said and wrought in God-befitting wise shew that the Saviour is God: and again the things said and done humanly shew that He is of a truth man. For this is the force of the mystery.&quot;
