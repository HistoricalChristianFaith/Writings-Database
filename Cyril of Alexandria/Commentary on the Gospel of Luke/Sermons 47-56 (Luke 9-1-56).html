  <h3><a name="SERMON XLVII.">SERMON XLVII.</a></h3>
  <p>9:1-5. <i>And when He had called the twelve Apostles, He gave them power
  and authority over all the devils, and to heal sicknesses. And He sent them to
  preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. And He said unto them, Take
  nothing for the way: no staff: no scrip: neither bread nor money: nor shall ye
  have two coats. And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence
  depart. And whosoever will not receive you, when ye depart from that city,
  shake off the dust from your feet for their testimony.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>IT is a true saying, that the fruit of good deeds is honourable. For those
who wish to lead lives pure and undefiled as far as is possible for men, Christ
will adorn with His gifts, and grant them an abundant recompense for all their
saintly deeds, and make them partakers of His glory. For it is impossible that
He should ever lie who says: &quot;As I live, saith the Lord, those who honour
Me, I will honour.&quot;</p>
<p>As a plain and clear proof of this, I take the glorious and noble company of
the holy Apostles. Behold them highly distinguished, and crowned with more than
human glory, by this fresh gift bestowed by Christ. &quot;For He gave them, it
says, power and authority over all the devils, and to heal sicknesses.&quot;
Observe again, I pray, that the Incarnate Word of God exceeds the measure of
humanity, and is radiant with the dignities of the Godhead. For it transcends
the limits of human nature, to give authority over unclean spirits to whomsoever
He will: as does also the enabling them to deliver from sicknesses such as were
afflicted with them. For God, indeed, bestows on whom He will powers of this
kind; and on His decree alone it depends that any are able, according to His
good pleasure, to work divine miracles, and act as ministers of the grace that
is from above: but to impart to others the gift bestowed on them, is altogether
an impossibility. For the majesty and glory of the supreme nature is found
existing essentially in nothing that has being, except in Itself, and It only. <A NAME="p200"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|200</SPAN></A>
Be it, therefore, angel or archangel, that any one mentions, or thrones and
dominions, or the seraphim, which again are higher in dignity, let him wisely
understand this: that they indeed possess pre-eminent authority by the powers
given them from above, such as language cannot describe, nor nature bestow: but
reason altogether forbids the supposition of their imparting these powers to
others. But Christ bestows them, as being God therefore, and as out of His own
fulness: for He is Himself the Lord of glory and of powers.</p>
<p>The grace then bestowed upon the holy Apostles is worthy of all admiration;
but the bountifulness of the Giver surpasses all praise and admiration: for He
gives them, as I said, His own glory. Man receives authority over the evil
spirits, and reduces unto nothingness the pride that was so high exalted, and
arrogant, even that of the devil: his wickedness he renders ineffectual, and, by
the might and efficacy of the Holy Ghost, burning him as with fire, he makes him
come forth with groans and weeping from those whom he had possessed. And yet in
old time he had said: &quot;I will hold the whole world in my hand as a nest,
and will take it as eggs that are left: and there is no one that shall escape
from me, or speak against me.&quot; He missed, then, the truth, and fell from
his hope, proud and audacious though he was, and vaunting himself over the
infirmity of mankind. For the Lord of powers marshalled against him the
ministers of the sacred proclamations. And this verily had been foretold by one
of the holy prophets when speaking of Satan and the holy teachers: &quot;That
suddenly they shall arise that bite thee: and they shall awake that afflict
thee, and thou shalt be their prey.&quot; For, so to speak, they bit Satan by
attacking his glory, and making his goods a spoil, and bringing them unto Christ
by means of <A NAME="p201"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|201</SPAN></A> faith in Him: for so
they attacked Satan himself. Great therefore was the power given unto the holy
Apostles by the decree and will of Christ, the Saviour of us all. &quot;For He
gave them power and authority over the unclean spirits.&quot;</p>
<p>We will, in the next place, also inquire, if it seem good, whence a grace,
thus illustrious and famous, descended upon mankind. The Only-begotten Word
therefore of God crowned human nature with this great honour by becoming flesh,
and taking upon Him our likeness. And thus, without in one single particular
departing from the glories of His majesty;----for He wrought deeds worthy of
God, even though He became, as I said, like unto us, and was of flesh and
blood;----He broke the power of Satan by His almighty word. And by His rebuking
the evil spirits, the inhabitants of earth became able to rebuke them also.</p>
<p>And that what I say is true, I will endeavour to make quite certain. For the
Saviour, as I said, was rebuking the unclean spirits: but the Pharisees, opening
their mouth to deride His glory, had the effrontery to say, &quot;This man
casteth not out devils, but by Beelzebub, prince of the devils.&quot; But the
Saviour rebuked them for so speaking, as men prone to mockery, and ill-disposed,
and utterly without understanding, thus saying; &quot;If I by Beelzebub cast out
devils, by whom do your sons east them out? Therefore shall they be your
judges.&quot; For the blessed disciples, who were sons of the Jews by their
descent according to the flesh, were the terror of Satan and his angels: for
they broke their power in the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. And our Lord
further said: <i>&quot;</i>But if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils, then
the kingdom of God is come upon you.&quot; For He, as the Only-begotten Son of
the Father, and the Word, both was and is omnipotent, and there is nothing that
is not easy to Him: but inasmuch as He rebuked evil spirits while He was man,
human nature was triumphant in Him, and crowned with godlike glory; for it was
capable of rebuking even the evil spirits with power. By Christ's casting out
devils, therefore, the kingdom of God came unto us: for one may affirm that it
is the perfection of godlike majesty to be able to beat down Satan in spite of
his resistance. <A NAME="p202"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|202</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He glorified therefore His disciples by giving them authority and power over
the evil spirits, and over sicknesses. Did He then thus honour them without
reason, and make them illustrious without any cogent cause? But how can this be
true if For it was necessary, most necessary, that having been publicly
appointed ministers of the sacred proclamations, they should be able to work
miracles, and by means of what they wrought convince men of their being the
ministers of God, and mediators of all beneath the heaven, inviting them all to
reconciliation and justification by faith, and pointing out the way of salvation
and of life that is thereby. For the devout and intelligent need generally only
reasoning to make them understand the truth: but those who have wandered without
restraint into rebellion, and are not prepared to receive the sound speech of
him who would win them for their true profit;----such require miracles, and the
working of signs: and scarcely even so are they brought to thorough persuasion.</p>
<p>For we often find that the discourse of the holy Apostles prospered in this
way. For, for example, Peter and John delivered from his malady that lame man
who lay at the beautiful gate. And upon his entering the temple, they had his
aid, as it were, in testimony of the great deed that had been wrought, and spake
with great boldness concerning Christ, the Saviour of us all; even though they
saw that those whose lot it was to be rulers of the synagogue of the Jews, were
still travailling with bitter ill-will against Him. For they said: &quot;Ye men
of Israel, why wonder ye at this, or why gaze ye at us, as though by our own
might or righteousness we made this man to walk? The God of Abraham, and the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified His Son
Jesus, Whom ye delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he would
have let Him go. But ye denied the Holy One, and the Just, and asked for a
murderer to be granted you. And Him the Prince of Life ye killed; Whom God
raised from the dead. And of Him we are witnesses: and His Name, through faith
in His Name, hath made this man strong whom ye see and know: and faith in Him
hath given him this soundness in the presence of you all.&quot; But although
many of the Jews were embittered at a loftiness of speech such <A NAME="p203"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|203</SPAN></A>
as this, yet against their will they put, so to speak, a bridle upon their
wrath, being ashamed because of the greatness of the miracle.</p>
<p>And there is another point we must not omit. For having first invested the
holy Apostles with powers thus splendid, He then bids them depart with speed,
and commence their office of proclaiming His mystery to the inhabitants of the
whole earth. For just as able generals, having equipped their bravest soldiers
with weapons of war, send them against the phalanxes of the enemy; so too does
Christ, our common Saviour and Lord, send the holy teachers of His mysteries,
clad as it were in the grace that He bestows, and fully equipped in spiritual
armour, against Satan and his angels; that so they may be unconquerable and
hardy combatants. For they were about to do battle with those who in old time
held mastery over the inhabitants of earth; even against the wicked and opposing
powers, who had divided among them all under heaven, and had made those their
worshippers who had been created in the image of God. These, then, the divine
disciples were about to vex, by summoning to the knowledge of the truth those
that were in error, and giving light to them that were in darkness: while those
who in old time worshipped them, they rendered earnest followers of such
pursuits as become saints.</p>
<p>For this reason very fitly He bade them take nothing with them, wishing them
both to be free from all worldly care, and so entirely exempt from the labours
that worldly things occasion, as even to pay no regard to their necessary and
indispensable food. But manifestly One Who bids them abstain even from things
such as these, entirely cuts away the love of riches and the desire of gain. For
their glory, He said, and, so to speak, their crown, is to possess nothing. And
He withdraws them even from such things as are necessary for their use, by the
command to carry nothing whatsoever, neither staff, nor scrip, nor bread, nor
money, nor two coats. Observe, therefore, as I said, that He withdraws them from
vain distractions, and anxiety about the body, and bids them have no cares about
food, repeating to them, as it were, that passage in the Psalm: &quot;Cast thy
care upon the Lord, and He shall feed thee.&quot; For true also is that which
Christ said: <A NAME="p204"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|204</SPAN></A> &quot;Ye are not able
to serve God and Mammon.&quot; And again; &quot;For where thy treasure is, there
will thy heart be also.&quot;</p>
<p>That they may lead, therefore, a consistent and simple life, and, being free
from vain and superfluous anxiety, may devote themselves entirely to the duty of
proclaiming His mystery, and labour without ceasing in publishing to men
everywhere the tidings of salvation, He commands them to be indifferent both as
regards clothing and food. And to the same effect the Saviour elsewhere spake:
&quot;For let your loins, He says, be girt, and your lights burning.&quot; But
by their loins being girt, He means the readiness of the mind for every good
work: and by their lights burning, that their heart be filled with divine light.
And in like manner the law also of Moses plainly commands those who ate of the
lamb: &quot;Thus shall ye eat it: your loins shall be girt: and your staves in
your hands: and your sandals on your feet.&quot; Observe, therefore, that those
in whom Christ, the true Lamb, dwells, must be like men girt for a journey: for
they must &quot;shoe their feet with the readiness of the Gospel of peace,&quot;
as blessed Paul wrote unto us; and be clad as becometh wayfarers. For it is not
fitting for those charged with the divine message, if they would prosper in
their office, to remain stationary; but, as it were, they must constantly be
moving forward, and run, not for an uncertainty, but to win a glorious hope. For
even those who once had fallen under the hand of the enemy, if by faith they
fight for Christ, the Saviour of us all, will inherit an incorruptible crown.</p>
<p>But I can imagine some one saying, O Lord, Thou hast commanded thy ministers
to carry with them no supply whatsoever of necessaries for food and raiment:
whence, then, will they obtain what is essential and indispensable for their
use? This too He at once points out, saying; &quot;Into whatsoever house ye
enter, there abide, and thence depart.&quot; The fruit, He says, which you will
obtain from those you instruct, shall be sufficient. For those who receive from
you things spiritual, and gain the divine seed for their souls, shall take care
of your bodily needs. And this no one can blame: for the wise Paul also sent
word as follows: &quot;If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great
thing if we shall reap your bodily things? <A NAME="p205"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|205</SPAN></A>
&quot;So the Lord also commanded, that those who preach the Gospel shall live of
the Gospel.&quot; And that this same truth is signified by the command of Moses,
he clearly shews, saying, &quot;It is written, Thou shalt not muzzle the
trampling ox.&quot; And what the intention of the law is he again showed,
saying, &quot;Doth God care for oxen? or sayeth He it altogether on our account,
because it is fit that he who plougheth should plough in hope: and he who
trampleth the corn as having hope to share in it?&quot; For the teachers,
therefore, to receive from those taught these trifling and easily procurable
matters is in no respect injurious.</p>
<p>But He commanded them both to abide in one house, and from it to take their
departure.<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> For it was right, both that those who
had once received them should not be defrauded of the gift: and that the holy
Apostles themselves should not place any impediment in the way of their own zeal
and earnestness in preaching God's message, by letting themselves be carried off
to various houses by those whose object was, not to learn of them some necessary
lesson, but to set before them a luxurious table, beyond what was moderate and
necessary.</p>
<p>And that it is by no means without its reward to honour the saints, we learn
from our Saviour's words. For He said unto them; &quot;Whosoever receiveth you
receiveth Me, and whosoever receiveth Me receiveth Him That sent Me.&quot; For
He purposely makes His own, and takes unto Himself, the honours paid to the
saints, in order that on every side they may have security. For what is there
better, or what is comparable unto the honour and love due unto God? But this is
rendered by giving honour to the saints. And if he who receiveth them is right
blessed, and of glorious hope, how must not also the converse be entirely and
absolutely true! For he must be full of utter misery, who is indifferent to the
duty of honouring the saints. For this reason He said, &quot;that when ye go out
from that house, shake off the very dust from your feet for their
testimony.&quot; <A NAME="p206"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|206</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And next, we must see what this signifies. And it is this: That from those
who would not receive them, nor set store by the charge confided to them, nor
obey the sacred message, nor receive the faith;----from such they should refuse
to receive any thing whatsoever. For it is unlikely that those who despise the
master of the house, will shew themselves generous to the servants: and that
those who impiously disregard the heavenly summons, will ask a blessing of its
preachers, by offering them things of no value, and such as the disciples could
without trouble obtain from their own people. For it is written, &quot;Let not
the oil of the wicked anoint my head.&quot; And besides they ought to feel that
their love was due to those only who love and praise Christ; and avoid all
others of a different character: for it is written: &quot;Have I not hated, O
Lord, them that hate Thee: and been hot exceedingly at Thy enemies? I have hated
them with a perfect hatred: they have become my enemies.&quot; So is the love
proved of earthy soldiers: for it is not possible for them to love foreigners,
while paying a due regard to their king's interests. We learn this too by what
Christ says: &quot;that he who is not with Me is against Me; and he that
gathereth not with Me altogether scattereth.&quot;</p>
<p>Whatsoever, therefore, Christ commanded his holy Apostles was exactly fitted
for their use and benefit: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise and
dominion, with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever, Amen. <A NAME="p207"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|207</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <h3><a name="SERMON XLVIII">SERMON XLVIII</a>.</h3>
  <p>9:12-17. <i>And the day began to decline: and the twelve drew near, and
  said unto Him, Send the multitudes away, and let them go into the villages,
  and fields round about, and lodge, and find victuals: for we are here in a
  desert place. But He said unto them, Give ye them to eat. But they said, We
  have no more than five loaves and two fishes: unless we go and buy food for
  all this people. But they were about five thousand men. And He said to His
  disciples, Make them sit down in companies of fifty each. And they did so, and
  made them all sit down. And when He had taken the five loaves and the two
  fishes, He looked up to heaven and blessed them, and brake, and gave to His
  disciples to set before the multitudes. And they did eat, and were all filled:
  and that which remained over unto them was taken up, even twelve baskets of
  fragments.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>THE Jews, in my opinion, have not a single argument thai can serve before the
tribunal of God as a defence for their disobedience: for their opposition had no
appearance of reason on its side. And why so? Because the law of Moses, by
shadows and figures, led them unto the mystery of Christ. For the law, or rather
the things it contained, was symbolical, and in it the mystery of Christ was
depicted by type and shadow as in a painting. And the blessed prophets also
foretold long before that in due time there should come One to redeem all
beneath the heaven, and further proclaimed the very place of His birth in the
flesh, and the signs that He would accomplish. But they were so obdurate, and
their mind so indiscriminately set upon that alone which agreed with their
prejudices, that they would not receive the words of instruction, nor be brought
to obedience even by miracles so splendid and glorious.</p>
<p>Such then was their conduct: but let us, who have acknowledged the truth of
His appearing, offer Him our praises for His godlike works; such as that which
the passage before us records. For we learn by it, that our Saviour from time to
<A NAME="p208"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|208</SPAN></A> time went out from Jerusalem and
other cities and towns, followed by multitudes, some seeking deliverance from
the tyranny of devils, or recovery from sickness; but others desiring to receive
instruction from Him, and constantly with great earnestness, remaining with Him,
that they might be made fully acquainted with His sacred doctrines. When then
the day was declining, as the Evangelist says, and evening had all but arrived,
the disciples had care of the multitudes, and drew near, offering requests on
their behalf. For they said, &quot;Send them away, that they may go into the
neighbouring villages and fields, and lodge and find victuals; for we are in a
desert place.&quot;</p>
<p>But let us carefully inquire what is the meaning of the expression &quot;Send
them away.&quot; For we shall see by it both the admirable faith of the holy
apostles, and also the supernatural and wonderful power of Christ the Saviour of
us all, in whatsoever He willeth to perform. For, as I said, some of them
followed beseeching Him to deliver thorn from the evil spirits that oppressed
them, while others sought recovery from various maladies. Since, therefore, the
disciples knew that by the mere assent of His will he could accomplish for those
sick persons what they wanted, they say &quot;Send them away:&quot; not so
speaking as though they were themselves at all annoyed, and considered that the
proper time had gone by; but seized with love toward the multitudes, and
beginning to have a concern for the people, as being already intent upon their
pastoral office: so that we may even take pattern by them ourselves. For to draw
near, and make supplication on the people's behalf, is an act becoming to the
saints, and the duty of spiritual fathers, and the proof of a mind that has
regard not to selfish objects alone, but already considers as its own the
interests of others: of which surpassing love this is a clear and very evident
instance. And if we may be permitted to carry our argument above the level of
human things, we say, for the benefit of such as meet with it, that when in
earnest prayer we continue with Christ, whether asking of Him healing for the
maladies of our souls, or deliverance from other sicknesses, or desiring to
obtain anything whatsoever for our advantage; there is no doubt that when we ask
in prayer any thing that is good for us, there supplicate in our behalf both the
<A NAME="p209"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|209</SPAN></A> intelligent powers, and those holy
men who have freedom of access unto Him.</p>
<p>But observe the incomparable gentleness of Him Whom they supplicate. For not
only does He grant all that they ask Him to bestow on those who followed Him,
but also adds thereto of His own bountiful right hand; refreshing in every way
those that love Him, and nurturing them unto spiritual courage. And this we may
see from what has now been read. For the blessed disciples besought Christ that
those who were following Him, having had their requests granted them, might be
sent away, and disperse as they best could. But He commanded them to supply them
with food. The thing, however, was impossible in the eyes of the disciples, for
they had brought nothing with them but five loaves and two fishes: and this they
drew near and confessed to Him. To magnify, therefore, the greatness of the
miracle, and make it in every way evident that He is in His own nature God, He
multiplies that little many times, and looks up to heaven to ask a blessing from
above, being intent in this also upon our good. For He is Himself That which
filleth all things, being the blessing that cometh from above from the Father.
But that we may learn that when we commence a meal, and are about to break
bread; it is our duty to offer it to God, placing it, so to speak, upon our
stretched out hands, and calling down a blessing upon it from above, He
purposely became our precedent, and type, and example in the matter.</p>
<p>But what was the result of the miracle? It was the satisfying a large
multitude with food: for there were as many as five thousand men besides women
and children, according to what another of the holy Evangelists has added to the
narrative. Nor did the miracle end here; but there were also gathered twelve
baskets of fragments. And what do we infer from this? A plain assurance that
hospitality receives a rich recompense from God. The disciples offered five
loaves: but <A NAME="p210"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|210</SPAN></A> after a multitude thus
large had been satisfied, there was gathered for each one of them a basketful of
fragments. Let nothing therefore prevent those who are willing from receiving
strangers, whatever there may be likely to blunt the will and readiness of men
thereunto: and let no one say, &quot;I do not possess suitable means; what I can
do is altogether trifling and insufficient for many.&quot; Receive strangers, my
beloved; overcome that unreadiness which wins no reward: for the Saviour will
multiply thy little many times beyond expectation, and though thou givest but
little, thou wilt receive much. &quot;For he that soweth blessings shall also
reap blessings,&quot; according to the blessed Paul's words.</p>
<p>The feeding, therefore, of the multitudes in the desert by Christ is worthy
of all admiration; but it is also profitable in another way. For we can plainly
see that these new miracles accord with those in old time, and that they are the
acts of one and the same power. &quot;He rained manna in the desert upon the
Israelites; He gave them bread from heaven; man did eat angels' food,&quot;
according to the words of praise in the Psalms. But lo! again in the desert He
has abundantly supplied those in need of food, bringing it down, as it were,
from heaven. For His multiplying that little many times, and feeding, so to
speak, with nothing so large a multitude, is not unlike that former miracle. And
to address myself once again to the throng of the Jews, Thou wast in need of the
natural water, when thou wast walking in that long wilderness; and God gave thee
thy desire beyond thy hopes, and from an unlooked-for quarter. For, as the
Psalmist says, &quot;He clave the rock in the desert; He gave them drink as from
the vast abyss; and He brought forth water out of the rock, and made water flow
like rivers.&quot; Tell me then, when thou hadst drunk, didst thou praise the
Worker of the miracle? Didst thou raise thy tongue for thanksgiving? or wast
thou induced by what had happened to acknowledge the ineffable power of God? Not
so: for thou murmuredst against God, saying, &quot;Can God prepare a table in
the wilderness? If He smote the rock, and the waters flowed, and He made the
streams overflow; can He also give bread, or prepare a <A NAME="p211"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|211</SPAN></A>
table for His people? Thou wast not astonished at seeing the flint rock the
source of copious rivers; fountains issuing marvellously from stones, and
streams running with rapid force, but imputedst weakness to Him Who is Almighty.
And yet how was it not rather thy duty to perceive that He is the Lord of
powers? How indeed could He be unable to prepare a table, Who made the flint
rock a fountain and a stream, flowing over for that multitude?</p>
<p>But since thou hast brought thyself to so great folly as to imagine that
there is anything impossible with God, and with empty babble hast said that He
cannot prepare a table for His people in the wilderness, answer the question we
now put to thee: Wilt thou embrace the faith now that thou seest a table
prepared by Christ in the wilderness, and an innumerable multitude so abundantly
supplied with food that twelve baskets of remnants were collected? or wilt thou
still refuse to believe, and ask another sign? When, therefore, wilt thou be
found believing? When wilt thou cease from finding fault with the ineffable
power of Christ? When wilt thou put a door and bolt to thy tongue? and
delivering it from the language of blasphemy, change it to a better use by
praising Him, so that thou also mayest be a partaker of the blessings He
bestows? For His mercies are revealed upon those who love Him, and He delivers
them from all sickness. He supplies them also with spiritual food, by means of
which each one attains to manliness in every thing that is praiseworthy. But
upon the unbelieving and contemptuous He bestows no such gifts, but rather
brings upon them that condemnation which they fitly deserve. For by one of His
holy prophets He as it were said unto them, &quot;Behold, they who serve Me
shall eat, but ye shall suffer hunger. Behold, they who serve Me shall drink,
but ye shall thirst. Behold, they who submit themselves to Me shall rejoice in
happiness, while ye shall lament from sorrow of heart, and wail from contrition
of spirit.&quot; And again it is written, &quot;The Lord killeth not the
righteous soul with hunger, but wasteth the life of the wicked.&quot;</p>
<p>For the flocks of the believers have, as it were, a pasture full of divers
plants and flowers, in the holy Scriptures, which are their wise guides: and
filled with spiritual joy at the glorious doctrines and instructions which they
contain, they <A NAME="p212"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|212</SPAN></A> frequent the sacred
courts. And this it is which long ago was proclaimed in the words of Isaiah:
&quot;And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill,
running waters upon that day.&quot; And again; &quot;And the mountains shall
drop sweetness: and the hills flow with milk.&quot; For it is the custom of
divine Scripture to compare to mountains and hills those set over others, and
whose office it is to teach, inasmuch as they are high exalted, in respect, I
mean, of their thoughts being occupied with elevated subjects, and withdrawn
from things earthly: while the waters and the sweetness and the milk are the
instructions which flow from them as from fountains. &quot;There shall be then,
He says, at that time from every high mountain, and from every high hill,
flowing waters, and sweetness and milk.&quot; And these are the spiritual
consolations of holy instructors, offered to the people under their charge. Of
these the Jewish congregations are deprived, because they did not receive
Christ, the Lord of the hills and mountains, the Giver of spiritual consolation,
Who offers Himself as the bread of life to those who believe in Him: for He it
is Who came down from heaven, and gave life to the world: by Whom, and with
Whom, to God the Father be praise and dominion with the Holy Ghost, for ever and
ever, Amen. <A NAME="p213"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|213</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>WELL may we call out to those who would search the sacred Scriptures,
&quot;Arouse ye, and awake.&quot; For it is a thing impossible to perceive the
exact meaning of the mystery of Christ, if we use for this end a debauched mind,
and an understanding drowned, so to speak, in sleep. Need rather is there of a
wakeful mind, and a penetrating eye; for the subject is one difficult to
comprehend in the highest degree. And this is apparent now that our discourse
has come to the explanation of the passage before us. For what says the
Evangelist? &quot;And it came to pass that as He was alone, praying, His
disciples were with Him; and He asked them, saying; Whom do the multitudes say
of Me that I am? Now the first thing we have to examine is, what it was which
led our Lord Jesus Christ to propose to the holy apostles this question, or
inquiry, For no word or deed of His is either at an unseasonable time or without
a fitting reason; but rather, He does all things wisely and in their season.
What therefore do we say, or what suitable explanation do we find for His
present acts? He had fed in the desert a vast multitude of five thousand men:
and how had He fed them? With five loaves! breaking with them into morsels two
small fish! And these so multiplied out of nothing, that twelve baskets of
fragments even were taken up. The blessed disciples therefore were astonished as
well as the multitudes, and saw by what had been wrought, that He is <A NAME="p214"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|214</SPAN></A>
in truth God and the Son of God. And afterwards, when they had withdrawn from
the multitude and He was alone, He occupied Himself in prayer, in this too
making Himself our example, or rather instructing the disciples how to discharge
efficiently their office as teachers. For it is, I think, the duty of those who
are set over the people, and whose lot it is to guide Christ's flocks,
constantly to occupy themselves with their necessary business, and openly
practise those things with which God is well pleased: even that saintlike and
virtuous conduct which gains great admiration, and is certain to profit the
people under their charge. For they ought either to be actively engaged in those
duties which are to the glory of God: or such as in their retirement bring upon
them a blessing, and call down upon them power from on high: of which latter,
one and the most excellent is prayer. Knowing which the divine Paul said,
&quot;Pray without ceasing.&quot;</p>
<p>As I said, then, the Lord and Saviour of all made Himself an example to the
disciples of saintlike conversation, by praying alone, with them only in His
company. But His doing so might perchance trouble the disciples, and beget in
them dangerous thoughts. For they saw Him praying in human fashion, Whom
yesterday they beheld working miracles with godlike dignity. It would not
therefore have been entirely without reason, had they said among themselves; Oh,
strange conduct! Whom must we consider Him to be? God, or man? If we say man,
and like one of us; like one, that is, of the holy prophets; we see from the
ineffable miracles which He works, that He far transcends the limits of human
nature: for in manifold ways He doeth wonders as God. If we say He is God,
surely to pray is unbefitting One Who is God by nature. For of whom can God ask
what He wishes to receive? And of what can God at all be in want? To chase away
therefore such confusing thoughts, and to calm their faith, which, so to speak,
was tempest-tossed, He makes this inquiry; not as though He were at all ignorant
of what was commonly said of Him, either by those who did not belong to the
synagogue of the Jews, or by the Israelites themselves: His object rather was to
rescue them from the general mode of thinking, and implant in them a correct
faith, &quot;Whom, therefore, He asks, do the multitudes say that I am? <A NAME="p215"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|215</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thou seest the skilfulness of the question. He did not at once say,
&quot;Whom do ye say that I am? but refers to the rumour of those that were
without, that having rejected it, and shewn it to be unsound, He may then bring
them back to the true opinion. Which also happened: for when the disciples had
said, &quot;Some John the Baptist, and others Elijah, and others, that some
prophet of those in old time has risen up;&quot; He said to them, &quot;But ye,
whom do ye say that I am?&quot; Oh! how full of meaning is that &quot;ye!&quot;
He separates them from all others, that they may also avoid their opinions, and
not conceive an unworthy idea of Him, nor entertain confused and wavering
thoughts, themselves too imagining that John had risen again, or one of the
prophets. Ye therefore, He says, who have been chosen; who by My decree have
been called to the apostleship; who are the witnesses of My miracles; whom do ye
say that I am?</p>
<p>First before the rest Peter again springs forth, and makes himself the
mouthpiece of the whole company, pouring forth the expression of love to God,
and giving utterance to a correct and faultless confession of faith in Him,
saying, &quot;The Christ of God.&quot; The disciple is unerring: a thoroughly
intelligent explainer of the mystery. For he does not simply say, that He is a
Christ of God; but &quot;the Christ&quot; rather: for there are many who have
been called &quot;Christ,&quot; from having in various ways been anointed of
God. For some have been anointed as kings; and some as prophets; while others,
having received salvation by That Christ Who is the Saviour of all, even we
ourselves, obtain the appellation of christ, as having been anointed by the Holy
Ghost. For it is said in the words of the Psalmist, of those in old time, that
is, before the coming of our Saviour: &quot;Touch not My christs, and do My
prophets no harm.&quot; But the words of Habakkuk refer to us; &quot;Thou hast
gone forth to the salvation of Thy people: to save Thy christs.&quot; Christs
therefore there are many, and they have so been called from the fact [of having
been anointed ]: but He Who is God the Father's Christ is One, and One only: not
as though we indeed are christs, and not God's christs, but belonging to some
other person: but because He and He alone has as His Father Him that is in
heaven. Since therefore most wise Peter, confessing the faith correctly and
without <A NAME="p216"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|216</SPAN></A> error, said, &quot;The
Christ of God,&quot; it is plain, that distinguishing Him from those to whom the
appellation generally belongs, he referred Him to God, as being His sole
(Christ). For though He be by nature God, and shone forth ineffably from God the
Father as His only begotten Word, yet He became flesh according to the
Scripture. The blessed Peter therefore professed faith in Him, lending, as I
before said, his words to the whole company of the holy apostles, and acting as
spokesman for them all, as being more accurate than the rest.</p>
<p>And this too we ought to observe: that in Matthew's account we find that the
blessed disciple said, &quot;Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
God:&quot; but the wise Luke, summing up so to speak the purport, agrees with
him in the thoughts, but using fewer words, tells us that he said, &quot;The
Christ of God.&quot; Moreover no mention is here made of that which the Saviour
spake to him: but in Matthew again we find that He said to Him plainly:
&quot;Blessed art thou, Simeon, son of Jonah: for flesh and blood hath not
revealed it to thee, but My Father in heaven.&quot; The disciple therefore was
verily taught of God; nor did he make this profession of faith for us of his own
thoughts merely, but because the divine light shone upon his understanding, and
the Father led him to a correct knowledge of the mystery of Christ. What
therefore do those mistaken innovators <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> say to
this, who unwarrantably pervert the great and adorable mystery of the
incarnation of the Only Begotten, and fall from the right way, walking in the
path of crookedness? For the wise Peter acknowledged one Christ: while they
sever that One into two, in opposition to the doctrines of truth. 'But yes, he
replies, the disciple acknowledged one Christ; and so do we also affirm that
there is one Christ, by Whom we mean the Son, even the Word that, is from God
the Father <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>.' To this then <A NAME="p217"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|217</SPAN></A>
what do we reply? Is it not plain then, we say, to every one, that Christ asks
the holy apostles, not, Whom do men say that the Word of God is? but, who
&quot;the Son of man is?&quot; and that <A NAME="p218"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|218</SPAN></A>
it was of Him that Peter confessed, that He is &quot;the Christ of God?&quot;
Let them also explain this to us: How is Peter's confession worthy of
admiration, if it contain nothing profound and hidden, and, so to speak, not
apparent to the generality? For what verily did God the Father reveal to him?
That the Son of man is a man? Is this the God-taught mystery? Is it for this
that he is admired, and deemed worthy of such surpassing honours? For thus he
was addressed, &quot;Blessed art thou, Simeon, son of Jonah.&quot;</p>
<p>The reason, however, for which he was thus admired is a very just one; for it
was because he believed that He Whom he saw as one of us, that is, in our
likeness, was the Son of God the Father, the Word, namely, That sprang forth
from His substance, and became flesh, and was made man. See here, I pray, the
profundity of the thoughts, the importance of the confession, the high and
weighty mystery. For He Who was there in the likeness of mankind, and as a
portion of creation, was God, Who transcends all created things! He Who dwells
in the high and lofty place was abased from His glory to be in poverty like unto
us! And He Who, as God, is Lord of all, and King of all, was in the likeness of
a slave, and in the measure of a slave! This is the faith the Saviour crowns; to
those thus minded He extends His bountiful right hand. For when He had praised
Peter, and said that he was taught of God, as one who had obtained the
revelation from above, from God the Father, He makes him more assured and more
abundantly confirmed in the faith he had professed concerning Him, by saying:
&quot;And I say unto thee, that thou art a stone<i>; </i>and upon this stone I
will build My church: and I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever
thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>For observe how He makes Himself at once the Lord of heaven and of earth. For
He promises things that exceed our nature, and surpass the measure of humanity;
yea, rather, even that of the angelic rank: and are suitable for that nature
only to bestow, Whose glory and sovereignty transcend all. For, first He says
that the church belongs to Him; the sacred Scriptures nevertheless distinctly
ascribe it rather to God, <A NAME="p219"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|219</SPAN></A> and to
Him only, saying that it is &quot;the church of God.&quot; <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
For they say that &quot;Christ presented it to Himself, having neither spot nor
stain, but holy rather, and blameless.&quot; As being God therefore He says that
it is His, and promises moreover to found it, granting it to be unshaken, as
being Himself the Lord of powers.</p>
<p>And next He says that He gives him the keys of heaven. Who is it then that
thus pours forth language appropriate to God? Is it an angel? or some other
intelligent power, whether principality, or throne, or dominion? or those holy
seraphs? Not at all: but, as I said before, such language belongs to Almighty
God alone, Whose is the sovereignty of earth and heaven. Let not, then, these
innovators divide the one Christ, so as to say that one Son is the Word of God
the Father, and that He Who is of the seed of David is another Son. For Peter
made mention of one Christ; even the Only-begotten Who became man and was made
flesh: and for this confession was counted worthy of these extraordinary honours.</p>
<p>When, however, the disciple had professed his faith, He charged them, it
says, and commanded them to tell it to no man: &quot;for the Son of man,&quot;
He said, &quot;is about to suffer many things, and be rejected, and killed, and
the third day &quot;He shall rise again.&quot; And yet how was it not rather the
duty of disciples to proclaim Him everywhere? For this was the very business of
those appointed by Him to the apostle-ship. But as the sacred Scripture saith,
&quot;There is a time for everything.&quot; There were things yet unfulfilled
which must also be included in their preaching of Him: such as were the cross;
the passion; the death in the flesh; the resurrection from the dead; that great
and truly glorious sign by which testimony is borne Him that the Emanuel is
truly God, and by nature the Son of God the Father. For that He utterly
abolished death, and effaced destruction, and spoiled hell, and overthrew the
tyranny of the enemy, and took away the sin of the world, and opened the gates
above to the dwellers upon earth, and united earth to heaven: these things
proved Him to be, as I said, in truth God. He commanded <A NAME="p220"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|220</SPAN></A>
them, therefore, to guard the mystery by a seasonable silence until the whole
plan of the dispensation should arrive at a suitable conclusion. For then, when
He arose from the dead, He gave commandment that the mystery should be revealed
to all the inhabitants of the earth, setting before every man justification by
faith, and the cleansing efficacy of holy baptism. For He said, &quot;All power
is given unto Me in heaven and in earth: Go ye, make disciples of all nations,
baptizing them in <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> the Name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and teaching them to observe all those things
which I have commanded you. And lo! I am with you always, even unto the end of
the world.&quot; For Christ is with us and in us by the Holy Ghost, and dwells
in the souls of us all: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise and
dominion and honour with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever, Amen. <A NAME="p221"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|221</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> MIGHTY generals encourage their trained
warriors to deeds of courage, not only by promising them the honours of victory,
but even by telling them that the very fact of suffering brings them glory, and
gains for them all praise. For it is impossible for those who would win fame in
battle not sometimes to have to endure wounds also from their opponents. But
their suffering is not without its reward, for they are praised as those who
bravely assaulted the enemy; and the very wound bears witness to the courage and
valour of their mind. And much the same arguments we see our Lord Jesus Christ
also using in a discourse, the occasion of which was as follows; He had just
shewn the disciples that it was altogether necessary for Him to endure the
wicked enterprizes of the Jews, and be mocked by them, and spit upon in the
face, and put to death, and the third day rise again. To prevent them,
therefore, from imagining that He indeed for the life of the world would suffer
the scorn of those murderers, and the other cruelties which they inflicted upon
Him; but that they would be permitted to live quietly, and might without blame
avoid the suffering readily for their piety's sake, and the endurance even of
death <A NAME="p222"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|222</SPAN></A> itself in the flesh, should
it so befal, and by so doing would incur no disgrace, He of necessity, so to
speak, testifies that those who would be thought worthy of the glory He bestows,
must attain to it by proportionate acts of bravery, saying, &quot;He that will
come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross every day, and come
after Me.&quot;</p>
<p>Here, too, we must wonder at the love of Christ the Saviour of us all towards
the world; for He not only consented Himself to suffer and bear so great
ignominy, humbling Himself even to the cross and death for our sakes, but also
rouses His chosen followers to the same excellent desire: even those who were to
be the instructors of men every where, and hold the post of commanders-in-chief
over the people committed to their care. For those who were appointed to so
great a ministry must in very deed be thoroughly brave and valiant, armed with
an unshaken mind and invincible courage, so as to dread no difficulties, and
even if death befal, to deride its terrors, and set at nought every fear. He who
thus acts denies himself, since, so to speak, he resigns this temporal life, and
deems its concerns worthy of no regard, inasmuch as his choice is to suffer for
the blessedness and love that is in Christ. So does a man follow Christ. For the
company of the holy Apostles is, as it were, set before us by the Psalmist's
harp, as crying out unto Christ the Saviour of all: &quot;For Thy sake we are
killed every day; we have been counted as sheep for the slaughter.&quot; For in
this also they are like unto the Emmanuel, &quot;Who for the joy that He had,
endured the cross, having despised the shame.&quot;</p>
<p>He would have those, therefore, who were to be the teachers of all beneath
the sun superior to timidity and the base love of the world, laying it down as
their duty to suffer for love of Him. And He has Himself taught us what is the
character of those of His apostles who love Him, where he said to the blessed
Peter, &quot;Simeon, son of Jonah, lovest thou Me? Feed My lambs; feed My
sheep.&quot; &quot;He was the good Shepherd; He laid down His life for the
sheep.&quot; For He was not a hireling; rather, those that were saved were His
own: He saw the wolf coming; He made no attempt to flee; He despised not the
flock; but, on the contrary, yielded Himself to be torn by it, that He might
deliver and save us: &quot;For by His bruises we have been healed,&quot;
&quot;and He was <A NAME="p223"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|223</SPAN></A> afflicted for our
sins.&quot; Those, therefore, who would follow Him, and earnestly desire to be
like Him, and are set over His intelligent flocks, must undergo similar labours.
For numerous savage beasts encircle them, violent, and implacable, and that slay
cruelly, and hurry souls to the pit of destruction. For the more learned and
skilful of the heathen possess great eloquence, and adorn their false doctrine
with beautiful language: and thus they pervert some simple-minded men, making
them often wish to share their malady, and depart from the God Who is over all,
to worship others in His stead which are no gods. These heaped upon the holy
Apostles unendurable persecutions, and exposed them again and again to dangers.
For the blessed Paul commemorates the things he had been seen to suffer at
Iconium and Lystra, and at Ephesus and Damascus, For at one time he says,
&quot;In Damascus the chief captain of Aretas the king watched the city of the
Damascenes wishing to seize me, and from a window they let me down from the wall
in a basket, and I was delivered from his hands.&quot; And again at another
time, &quot;Alexander the smith caused me much evil.&quot; What then is the
testimony of this mighty Evangelist, this courageous and valiant champion, who
everywhere despised the utmost dangers? &quot;For to me,&quot; he says,
&quot;that I live is Christ; and that I die is gain.&quot; And again, &quot;I am
crucified with Christ; but henceforth I no more live, but Christ liveth in me:
and that which I live here in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, Who
loved me, and yielded up Himself for my sake.&quot;</p>
<p>But the violence of the Jews broke forth frequently against the other
apostles also: they persecuted them; they summoned them before their synagogues;
they scourged them wickedly, commanding them to keep silence, and desist from
their sacred preachings: for they said, &quot;Did we not strictly command you
not to speak to any man in this Name?----even the Name of Christ, the Saviour of
us all;----and behold! ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine.&quot; But
after the disciples had borne their violent accusation for the firm love they
had to Christ, they went out &quot;rejoicing that they were counted worthy to
suffer shame for the Name.&quot; But had they been timid, and abject, and
frightened at words, and overpowered by the terrors of death, how would they
have been proved? or how have offered as fruits to God those who were called by
their <A NAME="p224"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|224</SPAN></A> means? For, also, the wise
Paul whom no difficulty whatsoever could overpower, when on his way to Jerusalem
the prophet Agabus loosed his girdle, and bound his own feet, and said, &quot;So
shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind that man to whom this girdle belongs,&quot;
answered and said, ''What do ye, that ye weep and break my heart? for I am ready
not only to be bound, but also to die for the Name of our Lord Jesus
Christ.&quot; Excellently, therefore, did He command them manfully to prevail
over every persecution, and boldly to undergo trials, as being well assured that
if thus they will be zealous in His cause, they will become His friends, and
share His glory. If, therefore, a man be ready to endure and despise the terrors
of death, has he lost himself and departed, and is there nothing more in store
for him? By no means: for in that he loses his life, he especially finds it;
while to find it is to bring upon himself destruction. What fear, therefore, can
the saints now feel, if that which seemed to be hard proves rather joyous to
them that bear it; while that which is dear to men, as being exempt from pain,
leads them especially downwards to destruction and the snare of hell, according
to the Scripture.</p>
<p>But <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> that it is incomparably better, far above
the splendour and pleasure of the world, to excel in the love of Christ, He
shows us by saying, &quot;For what is a man profited who hath gained the whole
world, but hath lost himself, or fallen short?&quot; For when a man looks
chiefly to that which is pleasant and profitable for the moment, and therefore
avoids suffering, and desires to live joyously, even though he have wealth and
abundance of possessions, yet what profit hath he therefrom when he has lost
himself? &quot;Treasures profit not the wicked,&quot; but &quot;the fashion of
this world passeth away:&quot; and &quot;like clouds those pleasures
recede,&quot; and riches flies away from those that possess it: &quot;but
righteousness delivereth from death.&quot;</p>
<p>And further, to set plainly before us the reward of our <A NAME="p225"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|225</SPAN></A>
being willing to labour, He says: &quot;For whosoever shall be ashamed at Me and
at My words, at Him shall the Son of man be ashamed when He shall come in His
glory, and of His Father, and of His holy angels.&quot; Much that is both useful
and necessary does He effect by these words. For in the first place He shews
that entirely and altogether it follows that those who are ashamed <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
at Him and at His words will meet with the reward they merit. And what could so
give us joy as this? For if there are some in whose presence the Judge feels
shame, as owing them the reward of obedience, and the dignities and crown due to
their love and affection for Him, and the honours won by their bravery, how may
we not without fear of contradiction say that they most certainly will
henceforth live in never-ending honours and praises who have attained to such
splendid blessings?</p>
<p>But, next, He also begets in them fear as well, in that he says that He shall
descend from heaven, not in His former lowliness and humiliation, like unto us,
but in the glory of His Father; even in godlike and transcendent glory, with the
holy angels keeping guard around Him. Most miserable, therefore, and ruinous
would it be to be condemned of cowardice and indolence when the Judge has
descended from above, and the angelic ranks stand at His side. But great and
most blessed, and a foretaste of final blessedness is it to be able to rejoice
in labours already accomplished, and await the recompense of past toils. For
such as these shall be praised, Christ Himself saying unto them: &quot;Come, ye
blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
of the world.&quot; May we also be deemed worthy of these rewards by the grace
and lovingkindness of Christ the Saviour of us all: by Whom and with Whom to God
the Father be praise and dominion, with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever, Amen.

<p>THOSE who are skilful in the combat rejoice when the spectators clap their
hands, and are roused to a glorious height of courage by the hope of the
chaplets of victory: and so those whoso desire it is to be counted worthy of the
divine gifts, and who thirst to be made partakers of the hope prepared for the
saints, joyfully undergo combats for piety's sake towards Christ, and lead elect
lives, not setting store by a thankless indolence, nor indulging in a mean
timidity, but rather manfully resisting every temptation, and setting at nought
the violence of persecutions, while they count it gain to suffer in His behalf.
For they remember that the blessed Paul thus writes, <A NAME="p227"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|227</SPAN></A>
&quot;The sufferings of this present time are not worthy of the glory that is
about to be revealed in us.&quot;</p>
<p>Observe, therefore, how perfectly beautiful is the method which our Lord
Jesus Christ uses here also for the benefit and edification of the holy
Apostles. For He had said unto them, &quot;Whosoever will come after Me, let him
deny himself and take up his cross every day, and follow Me. For he that will
save his life shall lose it; and he that will lose his life for My sake shall
find it.&quot; The commandment is indeed both for the salvation and honour of
the saints, and the cause of the highest glory, and the means of perfect joy:
for the choosing to suffer for the sake of Christ is not a thankless duty, but
on the contrary makes us sharers in everlasting life, and the glory that is
prepared. But as the disciples had not yet obtained power from on high, it
probably occasionally happened, that they also fell into human weaknesses, and
when thinking over with themselves any such saying as this, may have asked
&quot;how does a man deny himself?&quot; or how having lost himself does he find
himself again? And what reward will compensate those who thus suffer? Or of what
gifts will they be made partakers? To rescue them therefore from such timid
thoughts, and, so to speak, to mould them unto manliness, by begetting in them a
desire of the glory about to be bestowed upon them, He says, &quot;I say unto
you, there are some of those standing here, who shall not taste of death until
they have seen the kingdom of God.&quot; Does He mean that the measure of their
lives will be so greatly prolonged as even to reach to that time when He will
descend from heaven at the. consummation of the world, to bestow upon the saints
the kingdom prepared for them? Even this was possible for Him: for He is
omnipotent: and there is nothing impossible or difficult to His all-powerful
will. But by the kingdom of God He means the sight of the glory in which He will
appear at His manifestation to the inhabitants of earth: for He will come in the
glory of God the Father, and not in low estate like unto us. How therefore did
He make those who had received the promise spectators of a thing so wonderful?
He goes up into the mountain taking with Him three chosen disciples: and is
transformed to so surpassing and godlike a brightness, that His garments even <A NAME="p228"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|228</SPAN></A>
glittered with rays of fire, and seemed to flash like lightning. And besides,
Moses and Elijah stood at Jesus' side, and spake with one another of His
departure, which He was about, it says, to accomplish at Jerusalem: by which is
meant the mystery of the dispensation in the flesh; and of His precious
suffering upon the cross. For it is also true that the law of Moses, and the
word of the holy prophets, foreshewed the mystery of Christ: the one by types
and shadows, painting it, so to speak, as in a picture; while the rest in
manifold ways declared beforehand, both that in due time He would appear in our
likeness, and for the salvation and life of us all, consent to suffer death upon
the tree. The standing, therefore, of Moses and Elijah before Him, and their
talking with one another, was a sort of representation, excellently displaying
our Lord Jesus Christ, as having the law and the prophets for His body guard, as
being the Lord of the law and the prophets, and as foreshown in them by those
things which in mutual agreement they before proclaimed. For the words of the
prophets are not at variance with the teachings of the law. And this I imagine
was what Moses the most priestly and Elijah the most distinguished of the
prophets were talking of with one another.</p>
<p>But the blessed disciples sleep awhile, as Christ continued long in
prayer:----for He performed these human duties as belonging to the
dispensation:----and afterwards on awaking they became spectators of changes
thus splendid and glorious: and the divine Peter, thinking perchance, that the
time of the kingdom of God was even now come, proposes dwellings on the
mountain, and says that it is fitting there should be three tabernacles, one for
Christ, and the others for the other two, Moses and Elijah: &quot;but he knew
not,&quot; it says, &quot;what he was saying.&quot; For it was not the time of
the consummation of the world, nor for the saints to take possession of the hope
promised to them; for as Paul says, &quot;He will change our humble body into
the likeness of His,----that is, Christ's----glorious body.&quot; As therefore
the dispensation was still at its commencement, and not yet fulfilled, how would
it have been fitting for Christ to have abandoned His love to the world, and
have departed from His purpose of suffering in its behalf? For He redeemed all
under heaven, by both undergoing death <A NAME="p229"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|229</SPAN></A>
in the flesh, and by abolishing it by the resurrection from the dead. Peter
therefore knew not what he said <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>But besides the wonderful and ineffable sight of Christ's glory, something
else was done, useful and necessary for the confirmation of their faith in Him:
and not for the disciples only, but even for us too. For a voice was given forth
from the cloud above, as from God the Father, saying: &quot;This is My beloved
Son, hear Him. And when there was the voice,&quot; it says, &quot;Jesus was
found alone.&quot; What then will he who is disputatious and disobedient, and
whose heart is incurable, say to these things? Lo! Moses is there, and does the
Father command the holy apostles to hear him? Had it been His will that they
should follow the commandments of Moses, He would have said, I suppose, Obey
Moses; keep the law. But this was not what God the Father here said, but in the
presence of Moses and the prophets, He commands them rather to hear Him. And
that the truth might not be subverted by any, affirming that the Father rather
bade them hear Moses, and not Christ the Saviour of us all, the Evangelist has
clearly marked it, saying, &quot;When there was the voice, Jesus was found
alone.&quot; When therefore God the Father, from the cloud overhead, commanded
the holy apostles, saying, &quot;Hear Him,&quot; Moses was far away, and Elijah
too was no longer nigh; but Christ was there alone. Him therefore He commanded
them to obey.</p>
<p>For He also is the end of the law and the prophets: for which reason He cried
aloud to the multitudes of the Jews: &quot;If ye had believed Moses, ye would
have believed Me also: for he wrote of Me <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>.&quot;
But as they persevered even unto the end in despising the commandment given by
most wise Moses, and in rejecting the word of the holy prophets, they have
justly been alienated and expelled from those blessings that were <A NAME="p230"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|230</SPAN></A>
promised to their fathers. For &quot;obedience is better than sacrifices, and to
hearken than the fat of rams,&quot; as the Scripture saith. And thus much then
of the Jews: but upon us who have acknowledged the revelation, all these
blessings have necessarily been bestowed, by means of and as the gift of the
same Christ: by Whom and with Whom, to God the Father be praise and dominion,
with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever. Amen. <A NAME="p231"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|231</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <h3><a name="SERMON LII">SERMON LII</a>.</h3>
  <p>9:37-43. <i>But it came to pass, the day after, as they came down from the
  mountain, a great crowd met Him. And, behold, a man cried out from the crowd,
  saying, Teacher, I beseech Thee to regard my Son, for he is my only one. And
  lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out, and it convulseth and
  teareth him, and he foameth; and having bruised him scarcely departeth from
  him. And I besought Thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not. And
  Jesus answered, and said: O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall
  I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither. And when he was yet
  coming, the devil threw him down, and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the
  unclean spirit, and healed the child, and gave him to his father. And all
  wondered at the majesty of God.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>ALL Scripture is inspired of God and profitable: but especially above all
besides this is the case with the holy Gospels. For He Who in old time spake the
law to the Israelites by the ministry of angels, has in person spoken unto us,
when having taken our likeness, He appeared upon earth, and went about among
men. For most wise Paul writes: &quot;That while in old time God spake to the
fathers by the prophets in manifold parts, and manifold manners, He hath in
these latter days spoken unto us by the Son.&quot; And by one of His holy
prophets, He somewhere Himself saith, &quot;I Who speak am near as the
brightness upon the mountains, as the feet of him that proclaimeth tidings of
peace; as one that proclaimeth good things.&quot; For lo! He frees us from the
tyranny of the enemy, that we may in purity follow Him; and that having brought
to nought &quot;the world rulers of this darkness,&quot; even wicked spirits, He
may present us unharmed unto God the Father.</p>
<p>For that it is by Him that we have gained deliverance from the power of
unclean spirits, this lesson proves. For we heard read that a man ran towards
Him from among the multitude, and related the intolerable malady of his son. For
he said <A NAME="p232"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|232</SPAN></A> that he was cruelly torn
by an evil spirit, and suffered violent convulsions. But the manner of his
approach was not free from fault: for he made loud outcries against the company
of the holy apostles, saying that they could not rebuke Satan: whereas it would
have been more fitting, had he honoured Jesus when asking His aid, and imploring
grace. For He grants us our request when we honour and confide in Him, as being
the Almighty, Whose power nothing can withstand. For He verily is the Lord of
powers <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>, and nothing can offer resistance to His
will. Yea rather, everything whatsoever that is capable of possessing power
obtains entirely from Him the possibility of being what it is. For just as He
sheds His light upon those who are capable of being illuminated, as being
Himself the true light; and just as in like manner He is the bestower of wisdom
upon those who are capable thereof, as being Himself Wisdom, and perfect
understanding: so, inasmuch as He is Power, He bestows power on those capable of
receiving it. When then by our disbelief we despise His glory, and wickedly
scorn His supreme majesty, we can receive nothing from Him: for &quot;we must
ask in faith, nothing wavering,&quot; as His disciple said.</p>
<p>And that this saying is true, we may perceive even from what takes place
among us. For such as present petitions to those who preside over affairs upon
earth, and govern mighty thrones, preface their requests with suitable praises,
and confess their universal power and majesty; addressing the memorial they
present, &quot;To the Lords of earth, and sea, and of <A NAME="p233"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|233</SPAN></A>
every people and race among mankind:&quot; and afterwards they add an account of
what they would ask. The father therefore of the demoniac was rude and
uncourteous: for he did not simply ask the healing of the child, and in so doing
crown the healer with praises, but, on the contrary, spake contemptuously of the
disciples, and found fault with the grace given them. &quot;For I brought him,
he says, to Thy disciples, and they could not cast it out.&quot; And yet it was
owing to thy own want of faith that the grace availed not. Dost thou not
perceive that thou wast thyself the cause that the child was not delivered from
his severe illness?</p>
<p>For that we must have faith when we draw near to Christ, and whosoever have
obtained from Him the grace of healing, He teaches us Himself, by everywhere
requiring faith of those who approach Him, desiring to be counted worthy of any
of His gifts. For, for instance, Lazarus died at Bethany, and Christ promised to
raise him. When then one of his sisters doubted of this, and had no expectation
that the miracle would take place, Christ said, &quot;I am the resurrection and
the life. He that believeth in Me, even though he die, shall live.&quot; And we
find elsewhere a similar occurrence. For Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue of the
Jews, when his only daughter was now breathing her last, being caught, so to
speak, in the meshes of death, besought Jesus to deliver the damsel from what
had happened: and Christ accordingly promised so to do upon arriving at the
house of the supplicant. But as He was on His way, a man met Him from the
relatives of the ruler of the synagogue, saying, &quot;Thy daughter is dead:
trouble not the Teacher.&quot; And what was Christ's reply? &quot;Fear not: only
believe, and she shall live.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the duty therefore of the father of the lad rather to lay the blame
upon his own unbelief, than upon the holy apostles. For this reason Christ
justly called out, &quot;O faithless and perverse generation: how long shall I
be with you, and suffer you?&quot; He justly therefore calls both the man
himself, and those like him in mind a faithless generation. For it is a wretched
malady, and whosoever is seized by it is, as He shews, perverse, and utterly
without knowledge to walk uprightly. And therefore the sacred Scriptures say of
such persons, &quot;that their ways are crooked, and their paths <A NAME="p234"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|234</SPAN></A>
perverse.&quot; From this malady the divine David fled: and in order that he may
also benefit us, he reveals the set purpose of his mind thereupon, saying,
&quot;A crooked heart hath not cleaved unto me:&quot; that is, one that cannot
walk in an upright course. To such the blessed Baptist, as the forerunner of the
Saviour, cried, saying, &quot;Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths
straight.&quot;</p>
<p>The man therefore was thoroughly an unbeliever, and perverse, refusing the
straight paths, straying from the mark, and wandering from the right ways <A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>.
And Christ deigns not to be with such as are thus minded, and have fallen into
this wickedness: and if one may speak in the manner of men, He is tired and
weary of them. And this He teaches us saying, &quot;How long shall I be with
you, and suffer you?&quot; For he who says, that those were powerless for the
expulsion of evil spirits, who by Christ's will had received power to cast them
out, finds fault with the grace itself, rather than with the receivers of it. it
was wicked blasphemy therefore: for if grace be powerless, the fault and blame
is not theirs who have received it, but rather belongs to the grace itself. For
any who will may see that the grace which wrought in them was Christ's. For, for
instance, the lame man at the beautiful gate of the temple was made whole; but
Peter ascribed the miracle to Christ, saying to the Jews, &quot;For Him Whom ye
crucified, even by Him this man stands before you whole: and the grace which He
bestows hath given him this soundness.&quot; Elsewhere the same blessed Peter
proclaimed to one of those who were healed by Him, &quot;Aeneas, Jesus Christ
healeth thee.&quot; It is plain therefore in every way that the man wickedly
found fault with Christ's power in saying of the holy apostles, &quot;they could
not cast it out.&quot;</p>
<p>And besides, Christ is angry when wrong is done unto the holy preachers who
have been entrusted with the word of His Gospel, and appointed to teach it to
all under heaven, inasmuch as witness is borne them by His grace, that they are
His <A NAME="p235"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|235</SPAN></A> disciples, and they shed the
light of the true knowledge of God on those who everywhere were convinced by
their doctrines, and the wonderful miracles they wrought. For the miracle
constantly, so to speak, leads on to faith. It would have been deserved
therefore, had the father of the demoniac gone away disappointed, and been
refused the bounteous gift. But that no man might imagine that Christ also was
unable to work the miracle, He rebuked the unclean spirit, and forthwith
delivered the youth from his malady, and gave him to his father. For up to this
time he had not been his father's, but the property of the spirit that possessed
him: but being now delivered from his violence, he became once again his
father's property, as Christ's gift: Who also gave the holy apostles authority
to work divine miracles, and rebuke with irresistible might impure spirits, and
crush Satan.</p>
<p>And the multitudes, the blessed Evangelist says, wondered at the majesty of
God. When Christ then works miracles, it is God Who is glorified, and God only
and solely. For He is by nature God, and His majesty is incomparable, and His
supremacy without a rival, resplendent with the sovereignty of God the Father.
He is therefore to be extolled with praises, and let us say unto him, &quot;O
Lord God of powers, Who is like unto Thee? Powerful art Thou, O Lord, and Thy
truth is round about Thee.&quot; For all things are possible to Him, and easy to
accomplish, and nothing whatsoever is too difficult or high: by Whom and with
Whom, to God the Father be praise and dominion, with the Holy Ghost, for ever
and ever, Amen. <A NAME="p236"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|236</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <h3><a name="SERMON LIII">SERMON LIII</a>.</h3>
  <p>9:43-45. <i>And while every one wondered at all things which He did, He
  said unto His disciples, Lay ye these words to your ears: For the Son of man
  is about to be delivered up into the hands of men. But they knew not this
  saying, and it was hid from them that they should not understand it: and they
  feared to ask Him of this saying.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>PROFOUND in very deed is the mystery of godliness, according to the
expression of the wise Paul: but God the Father reveals it to such as are worthy
of receiving it. For the Saviour Himself also, when speaking to the Jews, said,
&quot;Murmur not among yourselves: no man can come unto Me, unless the Father
Who sent Me draw him.&quot; When then the blessed Peter had been counted worthy
of a grace thus glorious and wonderful, being in the neighbourhood of Caesarea
Philippi, he made a correct and faultless confession of faith in him, saying,
&quot;Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot; And what was the
reward of which he was thought worthy? It was to hear Christ say, &quot;Blessed
art thou, Simeon, son of Jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it to
thee, but My Father in heaven.&quot; And he further received surpassing honours:
for he was entrusted by Him with the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and the
confession of his faith was made the firm foundation for the Church. &quot;For
thou,&quot; He says, &quot;art a stone: and upon this stone I will build My
Church: and the gates of hell shall not overpower it.&quot;</p>
<p>That those therefore who were to teach the whole world might know exactly His
mystery, He usefully and necessarily explains it clearly to them beforehand,
saying, &quot;Lay ye these words to your hearts <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>;
for the Son of man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.&quot; The
reason then which led Christ so to speak is, I think, a subject both useful <A NAME="p237"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|237</SPAN></A>
and necessary for our consideration. He had then led up into the mountain Peter,
and James, and John, and been transfigured before them, and His countenance
shone as the sun: and He shewed them the glory, with which in due time He will
arise upon the world. For He will come, not in humiliation such as ours; nor in
the meanness of man's estate, but in the majesty and splendour of the Godhead,
and in transcendent glory. And again, when He came down from the mountain. He
delivered a man from a wicked and violent spirit. Yet was He certainly about to
bear for our sakes His saving passion; and endure the wickedness of the Jews;
and, as the minister of His mysteries says, &quot;by the grace of God to taste
death for every man.&quot; But when this came to pass, there is nothing unlikely
in supposing that the disciples would be troubled; and in their secret thoughts
perhaps even say, How is One so glorious; Who raised the dead by His godlike
power; Who rebuked the seas and the winds; Who by a word crushed Satan; how is
He now seized as a prisoner, and caught in the snares of these murderers? Were
we then mistaken in thinking that He is God? Have we fallen from the true
opinion regarding Him? For that those who knew not the mystery, that our Lord
Jesus Christ would endure the cross and death, would find therein an occasion of
stumbling, is easy to perceive, even from what the blessed Peter said to Him.
For though he had not as yet been witness of His passion, but only had heard
beforehand that it would befal Him, he interrupted Him, saying, &quot;That be
far from Thee, Lord: this shall not be unto Thee.&quot;</p>
<p>In order, therefore, that they might know what certainly would happen, He
bade them, so to speak, store up the mystery in their mind. &quot;For lay ye
it,&quot; He says, &quot;to your hearts.&quot; In which words, the
&quot;ye&quot; distinguishes them from all others. For He wished indeed that
they should themselves know what would happen, but not that they should
communicate it to others. For it was not right for the unlearned to be taught
simply His future passion, but far better, to convince them at the same time of
His having risen divinely from the grave, and abolished death, and so avoid the
danger of their being offended. When therefore the time comes, He says, that I
must suffer, ask not, How it is that One so glorious, Who <A NAME="p238"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|238</SPAN></A>
performed all these signs, has fallen like one of us unawares into the hands of
His enemies: but, on the contrary, be assured, when reflecting upon the
dispensation, that I am not led by human compulsion, but go willingly thereunto.
For what is there to hinder one Who knows beforehand and clearly proclaims what
is to happen, to refuse to suffer, if He so will?<i> </i>But I submit to suffer,
in order that I may redeem all beneath the heavens. For this He plainly teaches
us elsewhere, saying, &quot;No man taketh My life from Me, but I lay it down of
My own will. I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take it
again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But they, it says, knew not this saying; and it was hid from them, that
they might not perceive it.&quot; Now naturally any one may justly wonder, when
meditating with himself, how it was that the disciples knew not the mystery of
Christ. For though they belonged to the companies of the Jews, yet they were
neither slothful nor contemptuous, but on the contrary most earnest and
diligent. For though reckoned as handicraftsmen, whose trade was fishing in the
lake, yet, as I said, they had been soberly educated, and were far from ignorant
of the Mosaic Scriptures: for for this very reason Christ had chosen them. How
then were they ignorant of the mystery of Christ, when it had been shadowed
forth for them in various places by the law, and beautifully foreshewn in its
types as in a painting? For, to shew my meaning by an example, they were not
able to flee away from the bondage of Egypt, nor escape from the hand that
oppressed them, until they had sacrificed a lamb according to the law of Moses;
and when they had eaten its flesh, they anointed the lintels with its blood; and
so put the destroyer to shame. But it was not the mere sacrifice of a sheep that
made them, superior to death and the destroyer. Types travail with the truth:
and this act of theirs was, as I said, a foreshowing, by means of what was done
in shadows, of the saving efficacy of the death of Christ, and of the abolition
of destruction by His blood: Who also further drives away our cruel tyrant,
Satan, and delivers from the mastery of impure spirits those whom they had
enslaved, and who, like the Israelites made to serve in bricklaying, had become
the victims of earthly cares, and <A NAME="p239"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|239</SPAN></A>
polluted fleshly lusts, and the unprofitable distractions of this world.</p>
<p>The mystery of the passion may be seen also in another instance. For
according to the Mosaic law two goats were offered, differing in nothing from
one another, but alike in size and appearance. Of these, one was called
&quot;the lord:&quot; and the other, the <i>&quot;</i>sent-away.&quot; <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
And when the lot had been cast for <A NAME="p240"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|240</SPAN></A>
that which was called &quot;lord,&quot; it was sacrificed: while the other was
sent away from the sacrifice: and therefore had the name of the
&quot;sent-away.&quot; And Who was signified by this? The Word, though He was
God, was in our likeness, and took the form of us sinners, as far as the nature
of the flesh was concerned. The goat, then, male or female, was sacrificed for
sins. But the death was our desert, inasmuch as by sin we had fallen under the
divine curse. But when the Saviour of all Himself, so to speak, undertook the
charge, He transferred to Himself what was our due, and laid down His life, that
we might be sent away from death and destruction.</p>
<p>The mystery, therefore, was revealed to the Jews, by what was shadowed in the
law, had they only been acquainted with the sacred Scriptures. But, as the
blessed Paul wrote, &quot;Blindness in part hath happened unto Israel;&quot; and
&quot;even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is laid upon their heart:
nor is it unveiled, because in Christ it is done away.&quot; They then boast
indeed of the law, but its purpose is entirely hidden from them; for it leads us
to the mystery of Christ. But that they were without understanding our Saviour
shews, saying; &quot;Search the Scriptures: for in them ye think ye have eternal
life: and they it is that testify of Me. And ye desire not to come unto Me, that
ye may have life.&quot; For the divinely-inspired Scriptures conduct him who has
understanding to an accurate knowledge of the doctrines of the <A NAME="p241"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|241</SPAN></A>
truth: but they do not at all benefit the unwise, the ignorant, and the
careless. Not because they cannot do so, but because the infirmity of their mind
renders them incapable of receiving the light which the Scriptures give. For
just as the light of the solar radiance is useless to those deprived of sight;
not as though it cannot shine, but because their eyes are incapable of admitting
and receiving it; so the holy Scriptures, though inspired by God, profit nothing
the unlearned and foolish.</p>
<p>Our duty, therefore, is to draw near unto God, and say; &quot;Open mine eyes:
and I shall perceive the wondrous things of Thy law.&quot; So He will reveal
Christ to us: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father be praise and dominion
with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever, Amen. <A NAME="p242"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|242</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>YE who are zealous after spiritual skilfulness, and thirst for the
communication of the sacred doctrines, receive once again the things ye love.
And it is no earthly teacher Who leads you to the gainful booty, nor one like
unto us Whom ye obtain as your guide, but the Word of God, Who came down from
above, even from heaven, and is the true light of heaven and earth. For the
whole rational creation is illuminated by His means, inasmuch as He is the giver
of all wisdom and understanding. From Him we receive all knowledge of virtue,
and the perfect ability to perform good works such as become saints. For, as
Scripture saith, &quot;we are taught of God.&quot; And the passage just laid
before us bears witness also to what I have said. &quot;For there entered,&quot;
it says, &quot;a thought among them:&quot;----that is, among the holy
Apostles,----&quot;which of them is chief.&quot;</p>
<p>And now let him who thinks that Jesus was a mere man learn that he is in
error, and far gone from the truth. For let him know, that though God the Word
became flesh, yet that it was not possible for Him to cease to be that which He
was, and that He continued to be God. For to be able to search the hearts and
reins, and know their secrets, is the attribute of the supreme God alone, and
besides Him of no other being whatsoever. But behold, Christ searcheth the
thoughts of the holy Apostles, and fixeth the eye of Godhead upon their hidden
feelings. Therefore He too is God, as being adorned with honours thus glorious
and divine. <A NAME="p243"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|243</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But let us just now investigate this question, whether all the blessed
disciples in common were seized with this malady? whether this thought entered
all at once? But it is, in my opinion, altogether incredible to suppose that all
of them at the same moment became the common prey of one malady: but when, as I
imagine, it happened to one, the wise Evangelist, that he might not be found
framing an accusation against an individual among his fellow disciples,
expresses himself indefinitely, saying, &quot;There entered a thought among
them, who of them is chief.'' By this, however, we are permitted to see how very
wily Satan is in doing evil. For most versatile and full of contrivance is this
snake for mischief, plotting in a diversity of ways against those whose love is
fixed upon an honourable life, and who earnestly seek after more excellent
virtues: and if by fleshly pleasures he can prevail over any one's mind, he
savagely makes the assault, and sharpens the goad of voluptuousness, and by the
very audacity of his attacks, humbles to base lusts even a well-confirmed mind.
But if any one be manly, and escape from these snares, he then uses other
artifices, contriving baits to tempt him unto mental maladies. For he sows some
seed or other displeasing to God: and in those in whom there is something noble,
and the praise of an excellent life, he excites the passion of vainglory,
exciting them by little and little to an abominable haughtiness. For just as
those who in warlike guise are equipped to do battle with invaders, use many
contrivances against them; either drawing bows, which discharge arrows, or
hurling stones from slings, or manfully charging them with drawn swords: so also
Satan uses every artifice in carrying on war against the saints by means of
manifold sins.</p>
<p>The passion, therefore, and lust of vainglory attacked some one of the holy
Apostles; for the mere disputing who of them is the chief, is the mark of an
ambitious person, eager to stand at the head of the rest. But He slept not Who
knoweth how to deliver, even Christ; He saw in the disciple's mind this thought,
springing up, in the words of Scripture, like some bitter plant: He saw the
tare, the work of the wicked sower: and before it grow up high; before it struck
its root down <A NAME="p244"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|244</SPAN></A> deep; before it grew
strong, and took possession of the heart; He, so to speak, tears up the evil by
the very root. He saw the barbarian's arrow that had found entrance: and before
it prevailed, and pierced through the mind, He contrives a medicine. For when
passions are but beginning in us, and, so to speak, as yet in their infancy, and
not full grown, nor firmly rooted, they are easily overcome. But when they have
increased, and grown strong, they are hard to put off, and bear themselves with
no little audacity. For this reason one of the wise said: &quot;If the spirit of
the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place: for yielding heals many
sins.&quot;</p>
<p>In what way, then, does the Physician of souls amputate the passion of
vainglory? How does He deliver the beloved disciple from being the prey of the
enemy, and from a thing hateful to God and man? &quot;He took a child, it says,
and set it by Him;&quot; and made the event a means of benefiting both the holy
Apostles themselves, and us their successors: for this malady as a general rule
preys upon all those who are in any respect superior to other men.</p>
<p>But of what did He make the child He had taken a type and representation? Of
an innocent and unambitious life. For the mind of a child is void of fraud, and
his heart sincere; his thoughts are simple; he covets not rank, and knows not
what is meant by one man being higher in station than another: he has even no
unwillingness to be regarded as the least, nor sets himself above any other
person whatsoever: and though he be of good family by birth, he does not quarrel
about dignity even with a slave: nor though he have rich parents, is he aware of
any difference between himself and poor children. On the contrary, he likes
being with them, and talks and laughs with them without distinction. In his mind
and heart there is great frankness arising from simplicity and innocence. For
even the Saviour once said to the holy Apostles, or rather to all those who love
Him: &quot;Verily I say unto you, that unless ye be converted, and become like
these children, ye cannot enter the kingdom of God.&quot; And at another time
again, when the women were bringing to Him their infants, and the disciples
prevented them, He said, &quot;Suffer the little children, and forbid them not,
to come unto Me; for of such as they is <A NAME="p245"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|245</SPAN></A>
the kingdom of heaven.&quot; And again the most wise Paul desires that those who
believe in Christ should be <i>&quot;</i>grown men in understanding, but in
malice babes.&quot; And another of the holy Apostles said: &quot;As babes just
born, love the rational and pure milk, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation,
if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is kind.&quot;</p>
<p>As I said then, Christ brought forward the child as a pattern of simplicity
and innocence, &quot;and set him also by Him;&quot;&quot; shewing by him, as in
a figure, that He accepts and loves those who are such, and deems them worthy,
so to speak, of standing at His side, as being like-minded with Him, and anxious
to tread in His steps. For He said, &quot;Learn of Me: for I am meek, and lowly
in heart.&quot; And if He Who transcends all, and is crowned with such
surpassing glories, is lowly in heart, how must it not bring upon such as we
are, yea, even upon our very selves, the blame of utter madness, if we do not
bear ourselves humbly towards the poor, and learn what our nature is, but love
to vaunt ourselves ambitiously above our measure!</p>
<p>And He further says: &quot;He that receiveth this child in My name receiveth
Me: and he that recciveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me.&quot; Since, therefore,
the reward of those that honour the saints is one and the same, whether he who
is honoured be, if it so chance, of modest rank, or of exalted station and
dignity;----for he receiveth Christ, and by Him and in Him the Father;----how
was it not utterly foolish for them to quarrel among themselves, and aim at
pre-eminence, and be unwilling to be thought inferior to others, when they were
to be accepted on equal terms!</p>
<p>But He makes the purport of this declaration even still more <A NAME="p246"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|246</SPAN></A>
plain by saying: &quot;For he that is least among you all, the same is
chief.&quot; And how is he the chief, who is regarded as the least? Is the
comparison in point of virtue? But how can this he? The foremost place is not
assigned to him who is chief in virtue above him who is otherwise. In what way,
then, is he chief who is least? Probably, then, He calls him least whom lowly
things please, and who, from modesty, does not think highly of himself. Such a
one pleases Christ: for it is written, &quot;that every one that exalteth
himself shall be abased: and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.&quot;
And Christ Himself somewhere says, &quot;Blessed are the poor in spirit: for
their's is the kingdom of heaven.&quot; The ornament, therefore, of a soul that
is sanctified is a poor and humble mind: but the wish to think highly of
oneself, and to be at strife with the brethren for the sake off honour and
dignity, and foolishly to quarrel with them, is in like manner a disgrace. Such
conduct separates friends, and makes even those perhaps great enemies whoso
dispositions are similar. It overpowers the law of nature, and subverts that
innate affection which we owe our brethren. It divides lovers, and sometimes
makes even those enemies of one another, who are united by being born from one
womb. It fights against and resists the blessings of peace. Miserable is it, and
a malady invented by the wickedness of the devil. For what is there more
delusive than vainglory? Like smoke it is dispersed; like a cloud it passeth
away, and like the vision of a dream changeth into nothingness. It scarcely
equalleth the herbage in endurance, and withereth like grass. For it is written,
that &quot;all flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of
grass.&quot; It is a weakness, therefore, despised even among us, and numbered
among the greatest evils. For who does not reckon a vainglorious man, inflated
with empty airs, an annoyance? Who does not regard with contempt, and give the
name of &quot;boaster,&quot; to one who refuses to be on an. equality with
others, and thrusts himself forward as if claiming to be accounted their
superior? Let, then, the malady of vaingloriousness be far from those who love
Christ: and lot us rather consider our companions as better than we are, and be
anxious to adorn ourselves with that humility of mind, which is well-pleasing to
God. For being thus <A NAME="p247"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|247</SPAN></A> simple-minded,
as becometh saints,<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> we shall be with Christ, Who
honoureth simplicity: by Whom and with Whom, to God the Father, be praise and
dominion with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever, Amen. <A NAME="p248"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|248</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>9:49-50. <i>And John answered and said: Teacher, we saw one casting out
  devils in Thy Name, and we forbade him because he followeth not with us. But
  Jesus said unto him: Forbid him not: for he is not against you. For whosoever
  is not against you, is on your part.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>PAUL requires us to &quot;prove every thing,&quot; and says, &quot;Be wise
money-changers.&quot; But an exact and scrupulous knowledge of each particular
matter we can obtain from no other source than from divinely-inspired Scripture.
For David in the Psalms, addressing as it were Christ, the Saviour of all,
declares; &quot;Thy law is a lamp to my feet, and a light unto my paths.&quot;
And Solomon also writes, that &quot;the commandment of the law is a lamp and a
light.&quot; For just as this sensible light that is in the world, by falling on
our bodily eyes, dispels the darkness; so also the law of God, when admitted
into the mind and heart of man, illuminates it thoroughly, and does not suffer
it to fall against the stumblingblocks of ignorance, nor be caught in the
wickednesses of sin.</p>
<p>And this I say from admiration of the skilfulness here also displayed in the
lessons from the Gospel just set before us, and the purport of which ye
doubtless wish to be taught, seeing ye have assembled here from love of the
sacred doctrines, and with eagerness have formed the present meeting. What
therefore do the wise disciples say, or what do they wish to learn from Him Who
endoweth them with all wisdom, and revealeth to them the understanding of every
good work? &quot;Teacher, we saw one casting out devils in Thy name, and we
forbade him.&quot; Has the sting of envy troubled the holy disciples? Do they
grudge those highly favoured? Have even they admitted within them a passion so
abominable and hateful to God? &quot;We saw one, they say, casting out devils in
Thy name, and we forbade him.&quot; Tell me, dost thou forbid one who in
Christ's name troubles Satan, and crushes evil demons? How was it not thy duty
rather to reflect, that he was not the doer <A NAME="p249"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|249</SPAN></A>
of these wonders, but that the grace which was in him wrought the miracle by the
power of Christ? How therefore dost thou forbid him who in Christ wins the
victory? &quot;Yes,&quot; he saith; for he followeth not with us.&quot; Oh blind
speech! For what if he be not numbered among the holy Apostles, who is crowned
with Christ's grace, yet is he equally with you adorned with apostolic powers.
There are many diversities of Christ's gifts, as the blessed Paul tcacheth,
saying; &quot;that to one is given the word of wisdom, but to another the word
of knowledge: and to another faith; and to another gifts of healings.&quot;</p>
<p>What therefore is the meaning of his &quot;not walking with us,&quot; or what
is the force of the expression? Look then; for I will tell you as well as I can.
The Saviour gave the holy Apostles authority over unclean spirits, to cast them
out, and to heal all disease and all sickness among the people. And so they did;
nor was the grace given them ineffectual. For they returned with joy, saying;
&quot;Lord, even the devils are subject to us in Thy name.&quot; They imagined,
therefore, that leave was given not to any one else but to themselves alone to
be invested with the authority which He had granted them. For this reason they
draw near, and want to learn, whether others also might exercise it, even though
they had not been appointed to the apostleship, nor even to the office of
teacher.</p>
<p>We find something like this also in the ancient sacred Scriptures. For God
once said to the hierophant Moses: &quot;Choose thee seventy men of the elders
of Israel, and I will take of the Spirit that is upon thee, and give it,&quot;
He says, &quot;to them.&quot; And when those who were chosen had assembled at
the former tabernacle, two men only excepted, who had remained in the camp, and
the spirit of prophecy descended upon them, not only those who were assembled in
the holy tabernacle prophesied, but those also who had remained in the camp. But
&quot;Jeshua, it says, who stood before Moses, said, Eldad and Midad, lo! they
prophesy in the camp. My lord Moses forbid them. And Moses said unto Jeshua,
Enviest thou me? Would that all the Lord's people were prophets, the Lord
putting His Spirit upon them.&quot; But it was Christ Who at that time made the
hierophant Moses thus speak by the Holy Ghost: and here also in person He saith
to the holy Apostles; &quot;Forbid not him who is crushing Satan,&quot; that is,
in His name, <A NAME="p250"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|250</SPAN></A> &quot;for he is not
against you,<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> He says; for he who is not against
you is on your part.&quot; For on the part of us who love Christ, are all who
wish to act to His glory, and are crowned by His grace. And this is a law to the
churches continuing even to this day. For we honour only those who lift up holy
hands, and purely and without fault or blame, in Christ's name, rebuke unclean
spirits, and deliver multitudes from various diseases: for we know that it is
Christ Who worketh in them.</p>
<p>We must, however, examine such things carefully. For there are verily men,
who have not been counted worthy of Christ's grace, but make the reputation of
being saints and honourable an opportunity of gain. Of such one may say, that
they are bold and shameless hypocrites, who seize honours for themselves, even
though God has not called them thereto; they praise themselves, and imitate the
bold doings of the false prophets of old, of whom God said; &quot;I have not
sent the prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken unto them, yet they
prophesied.&quot; And so too may He say of these, I have not sanctified them,
but they falsely assume the gift for themselves: they have not been counted
worthy of My grace, but wickedly seize those things which I bestow on such alone
as are worthy to receive them. These, making a show of fasting, walk sadly with
downcast looks, while full of fraud and baseness. And often they pride
themselves on letting their nails grow long: and are especially fond of their
complexion being sallow: and though no one compel them, they delight in enduring
such misery as men have to bear in prison, hanging collars on their necks, and
putting fetters sometimes on their hands and feet. Such persons the Saviour has
commanded us to avoid, saying; &quot;Beware of those who come to you in sheep's
clothing: but within are ravening wolves.&quot;</p>
<p>To this, however, some one may object, 'But who, O Lord, knows the heart of
man? Who sees what is concealed within us, but Thou alone, Who by Thyself didst
form our hearts, and tryest hearts and reins? Yes, He says: &quot;By their
fruits ye shall know them:&quot; not by appearances, not by outward show, but by
fruits. For what is the object of their <A NAME="p251"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|251</SPAN></A>
hypocrisy? Plainly it looks to the love of gain. For they gape at the hands of
those who visit them: and if they see them empty, they are greatly distressed,
and stung with annoyance. For piety is with them merchandize. If, however, thou
lovest wealth, and lusteth after base gains, and hast given a place in thy mind
to that most base passion,----the love of money,----put off the sheep's skin;
why labourest thou in vain, by making a pretence of an austere and unworldly
conduct? Abandon this excessive rigour of life, and aim instead at being one who
is contented with little. Ask this of God: seek His righteousness: &quot;Cast
thy care upon the Lord: and He shall nourish thee.&quot;</p>
<p>But there are even some who use from time to time incantations and certain
abominable mutterings, and wickedly make certain fumigations <A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>,
and command the use of amulets. 'But yet,' says one, 'who has without thought
taken part in these practices, in their incantations they use the Name of the
Lord of Sabaoth.' Are we, then, to acquit them of blame because they bestow on a
wicked and impure devil an expression suitable to God only, and call the wicked
Satan the Lord of Sabaoth; asking of him as the reward of blasphemy, aid in the
things they request of him? Not that he really aids them, for he is powerless;
but rather brings down to the pit of destruction those that call upon him. For
the Lord speaketh not untruly where He says that Satan casteth not out Satan <A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>It is necessary, therefore, for our salvation and well-pleasing to God, to
flee far from every thing like this. But when thou seest one who has been
brought up in the church, innocent, simple, without hypocrisy, whose mode of
life is worthy of emulation, who is known of many as the companion of holy
monks, who flees from the arts of the city, who is fond of desert places, who
loves not gain, nor schisms, and, besides all this, has a correct faith, and is
made honourable by the grace of Christ, through the operation of the Holy Ghost,
so as to be even able to work those things that are by Christ; unto <A NAME="p252"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|252</SPAN></A>
such a one draw near with confidence: he shall pray for thee purely, and his
grace shall minister unto thee. For the Saviour and Lord of all grants the
requests of those who ask Him: by Whom and with whom to God the Father be praise
and dominion, with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever, Amen. <A NAME="p253"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|253</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those who are abundantly endowed with vast wealth, and pride themselves on
their ample riches, assemble fit persons to their banquets, and set before them
a sumptuously furnished table, producing by a diversity of dishes and sauces of
various kinds a pleasure superior to the mere satisfying of hunger. But from
this no benefit arises, but rather great injury to the banqueters. For more than
a sufficiency after the calls of hunger have been satisfied is always hurtful.
But those who possess heavenly riches, and know the sacred doctrines, and have
been illuminated with divine light, nourish their souls by feasting them on
instructive discourses, in order that they may become both fruitful towards God,
and skilled in the pathway unto all virtue, and earnest in accomplishing those
things by means of which a man attains to a happy issue. To this intellectual
and holy table, therefore, the sacred Word invites us; for it says, &quot;Eat
and drink, and be drunken, my friends.&quot; But friends of whom? evidently of
God. And it is worthy of note that we are to be drunken with these things, and
that we can never be satiated with that which is to our edification. Let us see,
therefore, what kind of profit the lesson from the Gospel sets before us upon
the present occasion.</p>
<p>&quot;For <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> when,&quot; it says, &quot;the days
were fulfilled for His <A NAME="p254"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|254</SPAN></A> being taken
up, He set His face to go to Jerusalem.&quot; By which is meant, that as the
time had now come when at length having borne for us His saving passion, He
should ascend to heaven, and dwell with God the Father, He determined to proceed
to Jerusalem. For this is, I think, the meaning of His having set His face. He
sends, therefore, messengers to prepare a lodging for Him and His companions.
And when they came to a village of the Samaritans, they were not received. At
this the blessed disciples were indignant, not so much on their own account as
because they did not honour Him Who is Saviour and Lord of all. And what
followed? They murmured greatly: and as His majesty and power was not unknown to
them, they said, &quot;Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire come down from heaven,
and consume them?&quot; But Christ rebuked them for so speaking. And in these
last words lies the purport of the lesson: and therefore let us accurately
examine the whole passage. For it is written, &quot;Churn milk, and it becomes
butter.&quot;</p>
<p>It would be untrue, then, to affirm that our Saviour did not know what was
about to happen: for as He knows all things, He knew, of course, that His
messengers would not be received by the Samaritans. Of this there can be no
doubt. Why, then, did He command them to precede Him? The reason of it was His
custom assiduously to benefit the holy Apostles in every possible way: and for
this end His practice sometimes was to put them to the proof. As for instance,
He was sailing once upon the lake of Tiberias with those named above; and while
so doing he fell asleep purposely: and a violent wind having risen upon the
lake, a rough and unusual storm began to rage, and the boat was in danger, and
the crew in alarm. For He intentionally permitted the storm and the fury of the
tempest to rage against the ship, to try the faith of the disciples, and to make
manifest the greatness of His power. And this, also, was the result. For they,
in the littleness of their faith, said, &quot;Master, save us, we perish.&quot;
And He at once arose and shewed that He is Lord of the elements; for He rebuked
the sea and the tempest, and there was an exceeding great calm. And so also on
this occasion: He knew, indeed, that those who went forward to announce that he
would lodge with them would not be received by the Samaritans; but He permitted <A NAME="p255"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|255</SPAN></A>
them to go, that this again might be a means of benefiting the holy Apostles.</p>
<p>What, then, was the purpose of this occurrence? He was going up to Jerusalem,
as the time of His passion was already drawing near. He was about to endure the
contumelies of the Jews; He was about to be set at nought by the scribes and
Pharisees; and to suffer those things which they inflicted upon Him when they
proceeded to the accomplishment of all violence and wicked audacity. In order,
therefore, that they might not be offended when they saw Him suffering, as
understanding that He would have them also to be patient, and not to murmur
greatly, even though men treat them with contumely, He, so to speak, made the
contempt they met with from the Samaritans a preparatory exercise in the matter.
They had not received the messengers. It was the duty of the disciples, treading
in the footsteps of their Lord, to bear it patiently as becometh saints, and not
to say anything of them wrathfully. But they were not yet so disposed; but being
seized with too hot indignation, they would have called down fire upon them from
heaven, as far as their will went. But Christ rebuked them for so speaking.</p>
<p>See here, I pray, how great is the difference between us and God: for the
distance is immeasurable. For He is slow to anger, and long-suffering, and of
incomparable gentleness and love to mankind: but we children of earth are quick
unto anger, hasty unto impatience, and refuse with indignation to be judged by
others when we are found out in committing any wrong act; while we are most
ready to find fault with others. And therefore God the Lord of all affirms,
saying; &quot;For My thoughts are not as your thoughts, nor your ways as My
ways; but as the heaven is far from the earth, so are My ways from your ways,
and My thoughts from your thoughts.&quot; Such, then, is He Who is Lord of all:
but we, as I said, being readily vexed, and easily led into anger, take
sometimes severe and intolerable vengeance upon those who have occasioned us
some trifling annoyance: and though commanded to live according to the Gospel,
we fall short of the practice commanded by the law. For the law indeed said,
&quot;Eye for eye; tooth for tooth; hand for hand:&quot; and commanded that an
equal retribution should suffice: but we, as I <A NAME="p256"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|256</SPAN></A>
said, though perhaps we have suffered but a trifling wrong, would retaliate very
harshly, not remembering Christ, who said: &quot;The disciple is not greater
than his teacher, nor the slave than his master;&quot; Who also, &quot;when He
was reviled, reviled not again; when suffering, threatened not; but committed
His cause to Him Who judgeth righteously.&quot; As treading this path
much-enduring Job also is justly admired: for it is written of him, &quot;What
man is like Job, who drinketh wrongs like a draught?&quot; For their benefit,
therefore, He rebuked the disciples, gently restraining the sharpness of their
wrath, and not permitting them to murmur violently against those who sinned, but
persuading them rather to be longsuffering, and to cherish a mind immovable by
ought of this.</p>
<p>It benefited them also in another way: they were to be the instructors of the
whole world, and to travel through the cities and villages, proclaiming
everywhere the good tidings of salvation. Of necessity, therefore, while seeking
to fulfil their mission, they must fall in with wicked men, who would reject the
divine tidings, and, so to speak, not receive Jesus to lodge with them <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>.
Had Christ, therefore, praised them for wishing that fire should come down upon
the Samaritans, and that so painful a torment should be inflicted upon them,
they would have been similarly disposed in many other instances, and when men
disregarded the sacred message, would have pronounced their condemnation, and
called down fire upon them from above. And what would have been the result of
such conduct? The sufferers would have been innumerable, and no longer would the
disciples have been so much physicians of the sick, as torturers rather, and
intolerable to men everywhere. For their own good, therefore, they were rebuked,
when thus enraged beyond measure at the contumely of the Samaritans: in order
that they might learn that as ministers of the divine tidings, they must rather
be full of longsuffering and gentleness; not revengeful; not given to wrath, nor
savagely attacking those who offend them.</p>
<p>And that the ministers of God's message were longsuffering, <A NAME="p257"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|257</SPAN></A>
Paul teaches us, saying, &quot;For I think that God hath set forth us the
apostles last, as it were, condemned to death; for we are made a spectacle unto
the world, and to angels, and to men. Being reviled, we bless; being defamed, we
persuade: we have become the offscouring of the world; the refuse of all men up
to this day.&quot; He wrote also to others, or rather to all who had not yet
received Christ in them, but, so to speak, were still afflicted with the pride
of the Samaritans: &quot;We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to
God.&quot;</p>
<p>Great, therefore, is the benefit of the gospel lessons to those who are truly
perfect in mind; and may we also, taking them unto ourselves, benefit our souls,
ever praising Christ the Saviour of all: by Whom and with Whom to God the Father
be praise and dominion, with the Holy Ghost, for ever and. ever, Amen.</p>

of Nestorius, confining the appellation &quot;Christ&quot; to the divine Person,
the Word, and denying it to the human person, the &quot;Son of man,&quot; or
&quot;Son of David.&quot; But they require some modification: for Nestorius did
not confine the appellation, Christ, to the divine Person, but said that it was
a title common to both. So in his letter to Cyril, Harduin's Conc. I. 1278,
having quoted the words of the Creed, &quot;We believe in Jesus Christ, our
Lord, His only-begotten Son,&quot; he says, 'Observe, I pray, how, having laid
down as foundations the terms Lord, Jesus, Christ, Only-begotten, and Son, as
common both to the Godhead and the manhood, they proceed to build upon them the
tradition of the Incarnation, and the Passion, and the Resurrection.' And soon
afterwards commenting upon Phil. ii. 5, he says, 'St. Paul being about to speak
of the Passion, that no one may imagine God the Word to be capable of suffering,
uses the term Christ, as significative of the Substance incapable of suffering
and of that capable of suffering in a single person.' So again he does not
object to the title of <span class="Greek">&#x03A7;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>
being applied to the Virgin; <span class="Greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F50; &#x03C6;&#x03B8;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x1FF6; &#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x03C6;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x1FC7; &#x03A7;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03BA;&#x1FF3; &#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03B8;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x1FF3;</span>:
Quat. xxi. p. 1412. What he denied was that there was any such union of the two
natures in our Lord as for the Virgin to be correctly called <span class="Greek">&#x0398;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>,
or for it to be orthodox to affirm the divinity of our Lord considered as the
Son of man. Thus in Quat. xvi, p. 1415, he says, 'Because God was present in
that which was assumed, viz., human nature, that which was assumed, as being
joined with That Which assumed it, is also called God, because of the Assumer.' <span class="Greek">&#x1F18;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x1F75;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1; &#x1F10;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x1FF7; &#x03BB;&#x03B7;&#x03C6;&#x03B8;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B9; &#x0398;&#x03B5;&#x1F78;&#x03C2;, &#x1F10;&#x03BA; &#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03B2;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2; &#x1F41; &#x03BB;&#x03B7;&#x03C6;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x1F76;&#x03C2;, &#x1F61;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x1FF7; &#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03B2;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B9; &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03C6;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x1F76;&#x03C2;, &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03B3;&#x03C7;&#x03C1;&#x03B7;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F77;&#x03B6;&#x03B5;&#x03B9; &#x0398;&#x03B5;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>.
But in this very quaternion he says that Christ is a title applicable to either
nature: 'The appellation Christ, like that of Son, and Lord, as used in the
Scriptures of the Only-Begotten, expresses the two natures, signifying at one
time the Godhead, at another the manhood, and at another both together.'
Nevertheless he affirmed that these titles were used differently of the two
natures: for while they belonged to the divinity absolutely, they belonged to
the manhood only <span class="Greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1F71;&#x03C6;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>,<i>
</i>by conjunction: for the two natures were not <i>united </i>but <i>coupled, </i>each
energizing separately and apart. And this <span class="Greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1F71;&#x03C6;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span><i>
</i>was the very keystone of his doctrine, so that he well said in Quat. xv. <span class="Greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C3;&#x1F7B;&#x03B3;&#x03C7;&#x03C5;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD; &#x03C6;&#x1F7B;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03C9;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C1;&#x1FF6;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD; &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1F71;&#x03C6;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>.<i>
</i>In Cyril's answer to his letter preserved in Harduin I. 1286, we have a most
temperate and exact statement of the doctrine sanctioned by the council of
Ephesus, and confirmed subsequently at Chalcedon; 'Confessing that the Word was
substantially united----<span class="Greek">&#x1F21;&#x03BD;&#x1FF6;&#x03C3;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span><i>
</i>not <span class="Greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1FC6;&#x03C6;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>----to
the flesh, we worship one Son and Lord Jesus Christ, not putting them apart and
distinguishing between man and God, nor regarding them as joined to one another
by oneness of dignity and command: nor again giving the name of Christ in one
special sense to the Word of God, and in another special sense to the seed of
the woman: but acknowledging one Christ only, even the Word of God the Father,
with the flesh which He made His own.&quot; This last quotation shews with what,
modification we are to take the less exact statement in the text; in answering
which, however, S. Cyril refutes, not the confining the title, Christ, to the
divinity, but the separation of the natures, shewing that Peter acknowledged Him
Whom he saw present before him as &quot;the Son of God the Father, the
&quot;Word That sprang forth from His substance.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="4"></A>4.&nbsp;<sup>g</sup> The Copyist has here apparently omitted
a line to the effect that the Scriptures also ascribe the church to Christ.</p>
<p><A NAME="5"></A>5.&nbsp;<sup>i</sup> As the Syriac has but one preposition [Syriac]
with which to express both <span class="Greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F30;&#x03C2;</span>
and <span class="Greek">&#x1F10;&#x03BD;</span>, the translation may either be
&quot;into&quot; the Name, or &quot;in&quot; the Name,</p>
<p><A NAME="6"></A>6.&nbsp;<sup>a</sup> A few passages occur in the Aurea
Catena, ascribed to S. Cyril, not contained in the Greek, and such are generally
also not recognised by the Syriac. The commencement of this homily is, however,
an instance to the contrary, the purport of it being very correctly given; as
also another passage which occurs towards the end.</p>
<p><A NAME="7"></A>7.&nbsp;<sup>b</sup> Aquinas (Ed. Ven. 1775, vol. v. 134),
has &quot;Quod autem incomparabiliter exercitium pacis Christi superet delicias
et pretiosa mundi, insinuat subdens; Quid proficit &amp;c.&quot; It is
impossible to conjecture what can have been the reading of the translator in the
Library of the Fathers, who renders it, 'But that incomparable exercise of the
passion of Christ, which surpasses the delights and precious things of the
world, is alluded to when He adds, 'What is a man advantaged,' &quot; &amp;c.</p>
<p><A NAME="8"></A>8.&nbsp;<sup>c</sup> In this argument S. Cyril takes the
being ashamed in a good sense, as &quot;feeling reverence at.&quot; Similarly it
is understood by the Vulgate: Qui enim erubuerit Me, et Meos sermones, hunc
Filius hominis erubescet. This Wiclif renders, &quot;Whoso schameth Me and My
wordis, mannes Sone shall schame him,&quot; &amp;c. And the sense in which he
uses shame we may see in his version of Luke xviii. 2: &quot;There was a juge in
a citee, that drede not God, neither schamede of men.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="9"></A>9.&nbsp;<sup>n</sup> Mai adds a passage from B, giving a
completely distinct reason for the transfiguration, namely, that it was to teach
the disciples that at the resurrection the body is not &quot;put off, but a sort
of light-like glory envelopes it.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="10"></A>10.&nbsp;<sup>o</sup> Again Mai ascribes a passage from B
and F to Cyril, remarking upon the terror with which the disciples fell to the
ground on hearing the Father's voice, that it proves the necessity of Christ's
mediatorship in human form, inasmuch as the glory of God would otherwise have
been unendurable to mankind. The passage following the quotation from St. John
he omits.</p>
<p><A NAME="11"></A>11.&nbsp;<sup>p</sup> This title of Deity, which is of very
frequent occurrence in S. Cyril's works, is the Greek translation of
&quot;Jehovah Sabaoth,&quot; the Lord of Hosts, Ps. xxiv. 10; and this again the
Latins render, &quot;Dominus virtutum.&quot; By &quot;powers&quot; the Syrians
understood an order of the angelic hierarchy, inferior only to the Cherubs and
Seraphs. Among the MSS. obtained by the late Dr. Mill from the Syriac Christians
of Malabar, I have found two lists of ecclesiastical and angelic dignities, in
which they are ranked as follows: 1. Players on musical instruments. 2. Singers.
3. Doorkeepers. 4. Readers. 5. Subdeacons. 6. Deacons. 7. Priests. 8. Visitors.
9. Chorepiscopi. 10. Bishops. 11. Metropolitans. 12. Patriarchs. 13. Angels. 14.
Archangels. 15. Principalities. 16. Dominions. 17. Thrones. 18. Lordships. 19.
Powers. 20. Cherubs. 21. Seraphs. By visitors, though the title is taken from
the Peschito version of 1 Pet. ii. 25, I imagine the <span class="Greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03B4;&#x03B5;&#x03C5;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x1F76;</span>
of the Greek Canons to be meant; and the Chorepiscopi, or Village-bishops, had
no power to ordain any one above a subdeacon.</p>
<p><A NAME="12"></A>12.&nbsp;<sup>q</sup> Aquinas translates correctly,
Nescientes procedere rectis incessibus: for though incessus is properly the act
of walking, yet as early as Tacitus it began to be used for a path. The
translator of the Aurea Catena nevertheless renders it, &quot;not knowing how to
continue in the right beginnings.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="13"></A>13.&nbsp;<sup>r</sup> In the text S.Cyril has the right
reading &quot;ears,&quot; but both here and afterwards he changes it to
&quot;hearts,&quot; possibly through inadvertence, as no MS. contains this
reading, though the more obvious expression.</p>
<p><A NAME="14"></A>14.&nbsp;<sup>s</sup> This translation of Lev. xvi. 8. was
apparently adopted by S. Cyril to escape from an objection brought against the
passage by Julian, as proving the existence of a Deus Averruncus, &quot;an
evil-averting demon.&quot; For the text is rightly translated by the Sept. <span class="Greek">&#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x1FC6;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x1F15;&#x03BD;&#x03B1; &#x03C4;&#x1FF7; &#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x1FF3; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x1FC6;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x1F15;&#x03BD;&#x03B1; &#x03C4;&#x1FF7; &#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x1FF3;</span>
:<i> </i>&quot;one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat,&quot;
as the A. V. renders it. But as <span class="Greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x1FD6;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>
in classical Greek signifies a &quot;demon who averts evil,&quot; Julian
inferred from it the existence of these inferior powers, unto one of which he
supposed the second goat was offered: and therefore Cyril, not being acquainted
with Hebrew, gives it another meaning, of which the Greek may possibly admit:
namely, that two lots were written for the goats, inscribed with these two
names, conf. Lib. ix. contra Jul. vi. 301. E. So again in his Epistle to Acacius,
V. pt. ii. 224. arguing against a faction, who had adopted the same opinions, he
says, &quot;He commanded therefore two goats to be offered, and two lots to be
written for them, so as for the one goat to be called Lord, and the other goat <span class="Greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x1FD6;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>.
These therefore were the names of the goats.&quot; In modern times, Bochart,
Suicer, and Gesenius, all adopt Julian's view, that <span class="Greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x1FD6;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>
is equivalent to <span class="Greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x1FD6;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>,
though it draws but slight confirmation from Josephus, who says, indeed, that
the goat was an <span class="Greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x1F78;&#x03C2;</span>,
an averting of evil, but evidently is referring to v. 21. where Aaron is
commanded to lay the sins of the people upon the goat's head. That Cyril had
never heard of this meaning of <span class="Greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x1FD6;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>
is plain; for he calls it <span class="Greek">&#x1F44;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x03B1; &#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;-&#x03C2; &#x03BC;&#x1F72;&#x03BD; &#x1F31;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x1FD6;&#x03C2; &#x03BD;&#x1F79;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03C2; &#x03BF;&#x1F50;&#x03BA; &#x1F10;&#x03B3;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;, &#x1F10;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03B2;&#x1F72;&#x03C2; &#x03B4;&#x1F72; &#x1F34;&#x03C3;&#x03C9;&#x03C2; &#x1F11;&#x03B1;&#x03C5;&#x03C4;&#x1FF7;</span>,
i. e. to Julian : and nothing could be more unsafe than to interpret the
language of the Sept. by classical Greek usage. That the Jews of the second
century understood it in a passive sense is plain from Aquila, who renders it <span class="Greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x03BB;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>,
and Symmachus who gives <span class="Greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03C7;&#x1F79;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>:
while the Greek fathers always treat it as equal to <span class="Greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03BC;&#x03C0;&#x1F79;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>,
and the Latins as Emissarius, i. e. the goat sent away. Besides, it is quite
impossible to suppose that either the Sept., or Aquila and the other Greek
translators of the O.T., meant their renderings as an equivalent of the Hebrew
[Hebrew], any more than our own translators their word &quot;scapegoat:&quot;
for there is not the most distant connection between the Hebrew and any of these
significations. They are mere substitutions of the general sense of the passage
for a word confessedly untranslatable; for Jonathan, Onkelos, the Samaritan, and
most other versions, retain the original word, as does also the A. V. in the
margin: or perhaps, they may have supposed it to be explained by [Hebrew],<i> </i>as
it occurs in vv. 10. 21. 22. As regards the meaning of [Hebrew] <i>Azazel, </i>some
consider it to be the name of a mountain; Bochart, &quot;the wastes:&quot;
others, one of the four chiefs of the devils, whose names Menachem on Lev.
assures us are Sammael, Azazel, Azael, and Machazeel: others, that it is Satan's
lieutenant, so called in the hymn against Marcion cited by Epiphanius from
Irenaeus:----</p>
<p align="center"><span class="Greek">&#x1F05; &#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03B9; &#x03C7;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x03B7;&#x03B3;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6; &#x03C3;&#x1F78;&#x03C2; &#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F74;&#x03C1; &#x03A3;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F70;&#x03BD; &#x1F00;&#x03B5;&#x1F76; &#x03B4;&#x1F30; &#x1F00;&#x03B3;&#x03B3;&#x03B5;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x03B4;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1F71;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03C9;&#x03C2; &#x1F08;&#x03B6;&#x03B1;&#x03B6;&#x1F74;&#x03BB; &#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03BD;</span>.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, I think Ewald's opinion, Krit. Gr. p. 243, is the most
defensible, that Azazel means &quot;total separation or removal;&quot; for
Gesenius' objection, that Moses would not have used so hard a word when simpler
expressions were at hand, has little force, since possibly Moses may have
preserved in this rite some patriarchal observance: and nothing is so retentive
of ancient words,----as well as also of customs and ideas,----as the ritual of a
nation.</p>
<p><A NAME="15"></A>15.&nbsp;<sup>u</sup> The MS. reads, &quot;as becometh the
rich;&quot; but as the argument is not addressed to them in particular, I
imagine that the translator mistook <span class="Greek">&#x1F41;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>
for <span class="Greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>,
and have translated accordingly.</p>
<p><A NAME="16"></A>16.&nbsp;<sup>x</sup> This reading is also found in most
copies of the Philoxenian Version.</p>
<p><A NAME="17"></A>17.&nbsp;<sup>y</sup> In the margin this is explained by
&quot;they make fumigations, like persons burning spices.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="18"></A>18.&nbsp;<sup>z</sup> In the margin this passage is said to
be spoken &quot;against the sorcerers.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="19"></A>19.&nbsp;<sup>a</sup> The Greek of this passage is partially
preserved in Cr.'s Catena, p. 80. Corderius and Aquinas have also each some
fragments in the Latin, but Mai has found no portion of this sermon in his
Catena;, and very little of those that precede, except of that upon the
transfiguration.</p>
<p><A NAME="20"></A>20.&nbsp;<sup>b</sup> This apparently very simple metaphor,
though it occurs also in Rev.iv.20, has not been understood by the translator of
Aquinas (Oxf. 1843), who renders, &quot;quasi non concedentes secum commorari
Jesum,&quot; &quot;allowing not that Jesus sojourned on earth with them!&quot;</p>
