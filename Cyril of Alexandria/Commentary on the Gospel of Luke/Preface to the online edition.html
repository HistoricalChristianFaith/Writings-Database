<p>Among the manuscripts brought back to the British Library from the Nitrian
desert in Egypt by Archdeacon Tattam in 1842, were two volumes containing the <i>Commentary
on Luke</i> of Cyril of Alexandria.&nbsp; This text consisted of a compilation
of 156 sermons, although some had suffered damage.&nbsp; The text had not
survived in Greek, although long quotations existed in Byzantine
catena-commentaries -- chains of quotations of the Fathers, which had been
published by Angelo Mai and by Cramer.</p>
<p>Robert Payne-Smith produced an edition of the Syriac text: <i>Cyrilli
Alexandriae Archiepiscopi Commentarii in Lucae Evangelium; quae supersunt
Syriace e Manuscriptis apud Museum Britannicum</i>.&nbsp; Ed. R. Payne Smith,
pp. 447, 4to. Oxonii: e typographeo academico. 1858.&nbsp; In 1859 he produced
an English translation, supplemented from the catenas, and this is the text that
appears here.</p>
<p>The gospel text at the head of each sermon forms part of the Syriac text.</p>
<p>In 2005 the volumes of the translation stood on the shelves of Cambridge
university library.&nbsp; I made a photocopy of them.&nbsp; In February 2006 I
scanned them in, using my 25-page sheet feeder, and created 13 directories each
of around 60 pages.&nbsp; I then began to convert the images into text using
Finereader OCR.&nbsp; The marginal notes and footnotes made this a slow
business, even though I omitted much.&nbsp; I laboured for some months, into
2007, completing most of the first volume.&nbsp; Then I halted.&nbsp; I found
that the first volume had appeared on archive.org in PDF form, thereby rendering
my labour useless.</p>

<p>I resumed work during 2008.&nbsp; In the interval I had received the
occasional enquiry about it, and I did not like leaving the work
incomplete.&nbsp; But this time I took a different approach.&nbsp; There was no
need for the footnotes or marginalia.&nbsp; In addition, I decided to modernise
the text in the remainder of the sermons.&nbsp; The original was in
mock-Jacobean English, full of Thee's and Thou's.&nbsp; This means that in order
to use the book the reader must translate mentally into modern English as he
goes along.&nbsp; Not everyone can do this, and it is wearing even for those of
us to whom it is no obstacle.&nbsp; Naturally this renders the text less useful
to the academic; but I take it that the academic will consult the copies on
archive.org.&nbsp; I hope that the easier reading of the later sermons will
encourage people to make use of them.</p>
