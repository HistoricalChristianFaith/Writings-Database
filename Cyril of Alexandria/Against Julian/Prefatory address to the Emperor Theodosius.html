<p align="center"><b>Cyril of Alexandria, Against Julian (2006) Prefatory
Address</b></p>
<hr>

<h3 align="center"><b>Address of the blessed Cyril, Archbishop of
Alexandria,&nbsp;<br>
to the very pious emperor Theodosius, devoted to Christ.</b></h3>
<p>The exceptional success of your holy principate, which deserves fame but
discourages praise, your incomparable provision for piety, are the heritage from
On High which you echo and which you have preserved, unconquered, from the
traits of envy, thanks to a skill in public affairs which you got from your
father and also your grandfather, as can clearly been seen in this field. Also I
propose to apply to your own person the words of our Saviour, who said: &quot;A
city on a hill cannot be hidden&quot;; isn't what is on the heights not always,
on the same basis, the same thing as that which is seen?</p>
<p>However what could equal Your Serenity? Nothing in the world, since the glory
of your sceptre has reached the supreme limits by illuminating the whole
universe with the glow of your perfect administration, while your leniency and
your piety towards Christ delight Heaven &#8212; I mean the rational powers which
reign in its heights. So great indeed is the admiration that you receive in
these two connections that, having here and there equal and rival virtues, you
have placed yourself beyond praise in all its forms. The votive offerings that
others devote to you, Emperor Theodosius devoted to Christ, are the trophies of
victories, crowns, thanksgivings and all other ways of honouring, not without
reason, the imperial power.</p>
<p>2. As for us, that destiny has given to sacred service, we had the duty to
offer you a work composed with the greatest care to the glory of God: your
inclinations, your practice and the authentic wishes of your heart have indeed
always carried you to applaud that glory, to hold execrable those who, like
drunken men, insult it in one way or another, to put them in the row of your
worst enemies, to gratify on the other hand with every kind of favour those who
choose to glorify God in thought and word. I would willingly consider these
excellent provisions as a proof of holiness, in perfect suitability to the
glorious heights which you occupy. In a psalm to Christ the Saviour of the
world, David, the inspired prophet exclaimed: &quot;Didn't I hate those who hate
you, Lord, and was I not consumed toward your enemies? I made myself hate them
with a perfect hatred, they became my own enemies!&quot; These words are fully
justified: indeed one can give as a shining proof of his attachment to your
person the combat which he ardently carries out against those who chose, I do
not know through what blindness, not to love you; in the same way, one could
express all the authenticity of his love for Christ by impetuously attacking
those who have discredited Christianity, with on the lips, almost like a cry,
these words of the Scripture inspired by God: &quot;I am filled with a jealous
zeal for the Lord!&quot;</p>
<p>It is necessary for me to say now what kind of work I am offering you here.</p>
<p>3. Forgive me for having resolved to speak not only against a king, but also
for the glory of Christ, the great King, who reigns with his Father over the
world; it is with him alone that it is true to say: &quot;Through me kings
reign&quot;, because he is the &quot;Lord of glory&quot; in heaven and on earth.
It necessarily follows that the champions of the divine teachings - us, in fact
- given this office by Christ, must oppose to those who intend to defile his
glory the arguments able to plead his cause, to appear sound to readers, to be a
more useful aid for those whose heart is easily led astray and is inclined to
yield to difficulties, and for those on the other hand who are well established
in the faith to be a kind of stick able to support them in the strengthening of
this faith and to maintain undimmed the tradition of orthodoxy.</p>
<p>However who is it that has entered into war against the glory of Christ? They
are legion, those who at various periods have let themselves go at this
foolishnes, driven by the perversity of the devil; but none as went far as
Julian, who damaged the prestige of the Empire by refusing to recognize Christ,
dispenser of royalty and power. Before his accession to the throne, he was
counted among the believers: he had even been admitted to Holy Baptism and had
studied the Holy Scriptures.</p>
<p>4. But some sinister characters, followers of superstition, entered I do not
know how into connections with him and sowed in him the maxims of apostasy;
then, allied with Satan in this design, they led him towards the practices of
the Greeks and transformed into a servant of impure demons one who had been
raised in holy churches and monasteries: &quot;bad company corrupts good
upbringing&quot;, as the very wise Paul says. However, I affirm that those who
wish to preserve a solid thought, and who keep in their spirit, like an
invaluable pearl, the tradition of the true faith, do not have to offer to the
peddlers of superstition any occasion to insinuate themselves, in any case to
speak to them freely. Is it not written: &quot;You will be holy with the holy,
irreproachable with the irreproachable, chosen with the chosen, and you will
outwit the cheat&quot;? The eloquence with which he was gifted the all-powerful
Julian used against our common Saviour Christ; he composed three books against
the holy gospels and against the very pure Christian religion, he used them to
shake many spirits and to cause them uncommon wrongs. Indeed, the light-minded
and easily seduced fall easily into his sights, and constitute a welcome
amusement for the demonic powers; but not spirits strengthened in the faith
which do not let themselves be disturbed sometimes: they believe that Julian
knows the holy and divine Scriptures, since he accumulates in his own works &#8212;
without otherwise knowing well what it says!... &#8212; a number of testimonies that
he borrows from them.</p>
<p>5. Very many followers of superstition, when they meet Christians, overpower
them with any kind of sarcastic remarks, and rely on the works of Julian to
attack us, which they proclaim to be of an incomparable effectiveness, adding
that there never was a learned man on our side able to refute them, or even show
them at fault; also, at the instigation of more than one person, and full of
confidence once again in the word of God: &quot;Get under way, and I will open
your mouth!&quot;, I put myself to the duty of rebutting this Greek eyebrow
raised against the glory of Christ, to help to the extent of my abilities those
which have been deceived, in order to convict of error and of ignorance of the
Scriptures the man who has accused our common Saviour Christ.</p>
<p>I dedicate my work on this subject to Your Greatness devoted to Christ and
very august: may God always keep him, guarantee success against his enemies in
an inimitable felicity, place the whole universe at his feet, grant to him to
transmit his august power to the sons of his sons, with the approval of Christ,
by whom and with whom glory to God the Father and to the Holy Ghost, for all the
centuries! Amen.</p>
