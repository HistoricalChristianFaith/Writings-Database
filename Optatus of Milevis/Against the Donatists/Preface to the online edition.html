<p align="center"><b>Optatus of Milevis, Against the Donatists (1917). Preface
to the online edition</b></p>
<hr>

<p>Optatus of Milevis wrote his sole surviving work around 370 AD.&nbsp; The
work was directed against those called by their opponents 'Donatists', who
comprised nearly the entire church of Roman Africa and were orthodox in belief
and practice.&nbsp; The polemic of Optatus is one of our primary sources for the
origins of Donatism, and was written in response to a book by the Donatist
bishop Parmenian.</p>
<p>There may be more than one opinion on the statements of Optatus.&nbsp; This
writer has witnessed various church splits down the years.&nbsp; Two examples
may be adduced here.</p>
<p>In 1982, the Anglican church of St. Aldates had as its rector the writer and
evangelist Michael Green.&nbsp; A group of people under the influence of the
charismatic movement felt that God wanted the church to move in a particular
direction.&nbsp; The church leadership did not agree, and in the end this group
split off and formed their own independent congregation.&nbsp; After the split,
which involved a good many hurt feelings, Aldates nevertheless offered help to
the new church, recognised them, assisted them to find a place in Oxford and
retained links with those involved.</p>
<p>In 1999, the Anglican bishop of Worcester, Peter Selby, made it clear through
various press interviews that he was strongly in favour of promoting unnatural
vice in the clergy, despite an agreement among the bishops of the Church of
England not to do this.&nbsp; The parochial church council of St. John's,
Kidderminster, then voted that they could no longer accept the authority of Dr
Selby as their bishop. In retaliation Mr Selby
then sacked the clergyman, Charles Raven, demanded he and his congregation get out of the
church, and threatened to have the priest arrested; and Mr Raven was apparently
indeed interviewed by the police.&nbsp; The church emptied,
and a new free church, Christ Church
Kidderminster ("http://www.themelios.org.uk/"), was formed in 2002.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Do as you would be done by&quot; is the first principle of
morality.&nbsp; We should ask which of these two instances shows the Spirit of
Christ at work.&nbsp; The church is centred on Christ and his teaching, or it is
nothing.&nbsp; But unless we seek the will of God, unless we act in love, we
achieve nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems inappropriate for this amateur writer to venture to criticise
Optatus or the translator who has very generously made this text available to us
all in English.&nbsp; However splits are occurring all the time, and
there are lessons to be learned in how we deal with them. The instances just
quoted may inform our attitude to what Optatus tells us.</p>
<p>A split had occurred in the church in Africa some 60 years earlier.&nbsp; During the
persecution of the Christians carried out by the emperor Diocletian, attempts
were made by the state to seize church property and books of scripture.&nbsp;
Those who cooperated in 'handing over' these were known as <i>traditores</i> --
from which we get the English word 'traitor'.&nbsp; Soon after the end of the
persecution in 305, a certain Caecilian was consecrated Bishop of Carthage by
someone who was widely believed to be a <i>traditor</i>. The accusation was
believed by the overwhelming majority of Christians in the province, and it was
likewise believed that such a consecration must be invalid.</p>
<p>The African bishops voted that Caecilian should be removed from his office; yet
he did not vacate the
see.&nbsp; A small number of people remained with him; everyone else consecrated
another man as bishop.&nbsp; (In every split of principle, a certain number of
people tend to remain with the buildings, often because they wish to ignore the
split, have relatives buried around those buildings, or other reasons).</p>
<p>The African bishops then appealed for help to the new Christian emperor,
Constantine.&nbsp; With hindsight we can see that this was a dreadful mistake;
but probably it was less obvious at the time.&nbsp; Constantine very properly
refused to become involved, but arranged for a council of Gallic bishops to
examine the matter.</p>
<p>This Council of Arles pronounced Caecilian innocent.&nbsp; The account given
by Optatus -- how Caecilian boldly, or cynically, demanded that 'proof' be
produced of what a whole province knew -- may remind some who have argued with
atheists of the tactics commonly employed to advance that creed.&nbsp; Its
apologists routinely resort to argument by assertion; when the assertion is
contradicted, they demand 'proof' from their opponent.&nbsp; The naive Christian
tries to prove his case, knowing that he has evidence aplenty; the atheist
simply picks holes in any evidence produced, so as to create the impression that
the matter is open, and so 'wins' by default without ever offering any evidence
for his case.&nbsp; Was it so with Caecilian?</p>

<p>Caecilian then gave further proof of the manner of man he was.&nbsp; He
arranged for the persecution of the other Christians by the state.&nbsp; The same soldiers that had
looted and murdered at the command of Diocletian were ordered into action at the
behest of the Bishop of Carthage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>What statements, agreed by all sides, do we have about Caecilian?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Almost everyone in the province believed that he was consecrated by a traitor.</li>
  <li>He held onto consecration despite his poor reputation in the community.</li>
  <li>He preferred to remain bishop, and allow a schism centred around him
    personally rather than resign.</li>
  <li>He organised the first church-led persecution in history.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it really possible to say that Caecilian knew Jesus; or that he was not
just a self-serving timeserver, of the kind that has become drearily familiar in
subsequent centuries?&nbsp; Or are our sources too tangled by accusation and
counter-accusation for us to certainly know?</p>
<p>But what if the Donatists were right?&nbsp; What does a believer do, when this situation
arises?&nbsp; When a wicked bishop is enthroned, the laity and junior clergy are
placed in a very difficult position.&nbsp; In a sense, they have nowhere to
go.&nbsp; The laity can silently desert the churches.&nbsp; After the
restoration of Charles II, when the bishops were of this kind, the diarist
Samuel Pepys reports the steady emptying of the churches.&nbsp; He also reports
the venom of the bishops and their rage against the non-conformist
congregations.&nbsp; Like Caecilian, the wicked bishop is eager to unsheath the
sword.&nbsp; The junior clergy can only resign or endure victimisation.&nbsp;
Another Anglican bishop demanded a personal oath of
obedience from a clergyman.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a curious characteristic of these situations, that other bishops do not
come to the aid of the sheep.&nbsp; Episcopacy, it seems, is thicker than the
body and blood of Christ.&nbsp; What are the laity and junior clergy to do?</p>
<p>These questions confronted the African Christians in the early 4th
century.&nbsp; They rallied around a new bishop, Majorinus, and after his death
around his successor, Donatus.&nbsp; The bishops elsewhere had failed
them.&nbsp; Those who have seen how church politics operate in the 21st century
may reasonably question whether Caecilian had nobbled the Council of Arles, and
likewise claimed the right to run his diocese by himself.&nbsp; At all events,
he remained unchallenged, and the schism was soon reinforced by
persecution.&nbsp; This in turn produced resentment, and then retaliation.&nbsp;
The hand of the devil in all this is easy to see!</p>
<p>It is not easy at this distance to see why the schism was not settled.&nbsp;
After all, the Donatists were orthodox.&nbsp; They were quite willing to appoint
an outsider as their bishop, so long as he was not a scumbag.&nbsp; Optatus
tells us that Parmenian was not an African.&nbsp; If the bishop is tainted, why
could not a man of undoubted holiness be appointed, if not immediately then on
his death?&nbsp; Was there really no candidate that would have been acceptable
to Rome and the Donatists?&nbsp; Was this never tried?</p>
<p>As time went by, the schism grew more entrenched, and parallel organisations
were set up.&nbsp; Yet never the Donatist case never seems to have been seriously engaged with.&nbsp;
The objection was one of principle; the retort one of ecclesiastical
administration.&nbsp; The schism was to outlast the empire, and to cease only
with the destruction of the church in North Africa.&nbsp; Dossiers of letters
were produced in proof of one side or the other; accusations of forgery quickly
accompanied them.</p>
<p>It is hard for this writer to address the points that Optatus makes without
making comparisons. Daily there are reports of sodomising bishops persecuting
believers in the Episcopal Church of the USA, seizing churches, initiating
lawsuits for property, locking out worshippers, arranging for congregations in
exile to be expelled from their borrowed buildings and unfrocking clergy who
dare to place their trust in Christ.&nbsp; Here too the supposedly orthodox
bishops seem to make no provision to aid the sheep, while enjoying the salaries
and social esteem.&nbsp; We might ask why each congregation is left to fight its
own battle, parish by parish? Here and there signs of a desire to fight back, to
retaliate, of anger and frustration can be seen.&nbsp; No doubt in due course
some will despair, and ask why God does not defend the faithful from the wolves;
and thus Satan's purpose in installing these wicked men is gratified.&nbsp; A
Donatist would find much to sympathise with.&nbsp; But would Optatus?</p>
<p>Many who read Optatus will be thus somewhat unconvinced by his arguments.&nbsp; Some of the
arguments against the Donatists often seem to involve further atheist-type
arguments.&nbsp; Never is the issue of principle at the root of things
addressed.&nbsp; Instead another tactic is used. Many a dishonest writer has
projected his own vices and misdeeds, and accused his opponent of them, not
because it is true but to try to get them on the defensive and to cover up his
own misdeeds.&nbsp; The apologists of Caecilian blandly accuse the first
Donatist leaders also of being <i>traditores</i>.&nbsp; Well, it's a useful
tactic, if you don't mind being a liar.&nbsp; There's no evidence of this, other
than the unsupported assertion, and it is irrelevant to Caecilian personally
being the root of the schism.&nbsp; The Donatist complaint of murderous
persecution is met with a calculated <i>tu quoque</i>, vague but no doubt
referring to the banditry that was carried out in the name of Donatism, once the
schism had taken hold.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course if the Donatists can be accused of
doing something wrong, then does that excuse any amount of bloodshed?&nbsp; And
so on.&nbsp; Optatus is the heir to all this, and many of the arguments he has
read and repeats seem to have been manufactured in this way.</p>
<p>Much of what Optatus writes grates on some minds.&nbsp; The church
organisation comes first; the question of right or wrong is barely discussed,
and treated as unimportant.&nbsp; The clergy deserve special treatment.&nbsp; In
short, we are firmly in the mindset of the medieval church, not the New
Testament.&nbsp; To any who have witnessed the abuse of episcopal power to
stifle objections of principle, Optatus will be exceedingly hard to read, as he
attacks people who only sought to have an upright church, and defends the
involvement of the police in oppressive action.</p>
<p>What can be said in defence of this?&nbsp; Well, it is entirely possible to
misread the situation.&nbsp; Optatus, after all, is defending a tiny minority
against a book written to attack them. This minority is threatened by popular violence, and dependent on the aid of a not very helpful
secular power to keep the knives of the circumcellion bandits, allegedly in 'defence'
of Donatism, from their throats.&nbsp; Much may be forgiven a man who is on the
defensive; is this, perhaps, the situation in which Optatus writes?&nbsp; It's
hard to see that a Donatist would be impressed by this book; is it perhaps
written to bolster the confidence of the anti-Donatist, rather than as a piece
intended to persuade?&nbsp; We may
see state power oppressing a principled minority in the service of timeservers,
and such things are indeed worthy of condemnation.&nbsp; But we should consider
the possibility that, without hindsight, the situation looked different on the
ground.&nbsp; Optatus could not foresee the burning of Cranmer, Latimer and
Ridley, a thousand years later, however straight the line may seem to some from
the position he takes up to the evils of the inquisition and the persecution of
the faithful by a nominally Christian episcopate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every organisation is entitled to self-definition.&nbsp; It is likewise
entitled to expel those who do not share its values, and to remove any of its
officials who should fall out of sympathy with its aims and objectives.&nbsp; If
a church provides a congregation with a building, and that congregation and its
minister apostasise, then it is surely reasonable to expect the property to
revert to the church.&nbsp; Conversely if those heretics built that building
themselves, common justice suggests that to expel them from it by means of legal
maneuvering is theft.&nbsp; The same applies in each case when a Christian
congregation finds that the church has apostasised.&nbsp; There is no special
ecclesiastical principle involved; merely the ordinary principles of common
justice and fair-dealing.</p>
<p>But it is hard to be neutral on these arguments today, with the sound of
persecution in the air.&nbsp; Let those who can obtain blessing from Optatus do
so. Let us take away from the whole experience the importance of being faithful
to Christ, awareness that the Devil delights in creating these situations in
order to drive believers to despair.&nbsp; He is the Prince of this world, and
God allows him to do as he will, for a little time.&nbsp; Yet in the end it is
all about people.&nbsp; Church buildings will crumble.&nbsp; But human beings
live forever.&nbsp; Do unto others, as you would have them do to you.&nbsp;
Don't curse them if they fail to treat you so: rather love your enemies, do good to those who persecute you.&nbsp;
If they steal the churches you built with your own sweat and labour, let them
have a donation also.&nbsp; For these men, wicked as they are, are but dupes of
Satan, and they too have souls to lose.</p>

<p>The translation that follows appears to have been made by a Roman Catholic
who wrote with Anglo-Catholics in mind.&nbsp; Much of what it contains, in the
very lengthy footnotes, will strike most modern Christians as curious.&nbsp; Is
it really the case that the translator thought that no issue of principle should
override the opinion of the Pope?&nbsp; Or that no Pope had ever erred?&nbsp;
Will modern readers really consider it a condemnation of Donatism, that the
Donatists made the same protests against corrupt ecclesiastical abuse of power
as the Puritans and Covenanters?&nbsp; But most likely we are in danger of
misunderstanding, through being in a very different situation.</p>
