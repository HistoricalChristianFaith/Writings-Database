<p align="center"><b>(I<SPAN class="small">NTRODUCTION</SPAN>.)</b></p>
<p>It is A.D. 320, six years after the vindication of Felix of Aptunga, and another trial is proceeding. Time has amply brought her revenge. Now the accusation is no longer against the consecrator of Caecilian the Catholic Bishop of Carthage, but against Silvanus the Donatist Bishop of
Cirta, the consecrator of Majorinus, who had been intruded into Caecilian's Chair. In this trial it is conclusively proved that Silvanus and his abettors had been guilty not merely of Betrayal----the sin falsely alleged against Felix and Caecilian, as a pretext for abandoning communion with Caecilian----but also of theft and simony under peculiarly disgraceful circumstances.</p>
<p>St. Optatus, in his description of the commencement of the Donatist schism, has mentioned the name of the Deacon
Nundinarius, the editor of the Acts of the Bishops who, in the year 303, met at Cirta to elect a successor to the recently deceased Bishop of that city.<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> When the citizens of Cirta heard that Silvanus had been chosen to be their chief
Pastor----Silvanus, a man of bad reputation, who was well known to them as a <i>Traditor </i>---- they cried out '<i>Traditor est, alius fiat. Purum et integrum civem nostrum
volumus.' </i>The clergy also protested against this election, but Silvanus was supported by a noisy mob of the lowest
<A NAME="p347"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|347</SPAN></A> rabble, and consecrated Bishop by the notorious Secundus of
Tigisis. One of the first acts of Silvanus after his consecration was to ordain a certain Victor. This Victor, in order to be made a priest, paid a large sum of money to
Silvanus, which Silvanus on his part promptly distributed amongst Secundus and the other Bishops who had taken part in his own consecration. (Such was the character of the shameless men, who were so soon, for their own purposes, to precipitate the Donatist schism by their consecration of Majorinus in opposition to Caecilian.)</p>
<p>Now these facts were well known to Nundinarius the Deacon. It was therefore an evil hour for
Silvanus, leading him into much trouble, when, for some reason unknown to us, he violently quarrelled with
Nundinarius. Other guilty Donatist Bishops, especially the terrible Purpurius <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
and a certain Fortis, were greatly alarmed when the news of this quarrel reached their ears, and wrote to
Silvanus, and to their party in Cirta, that it was imperative that a reconciliation should be effected between Silvanus and
Nundinarius. Means must be found to hush the matter up, lest worse things befall them. Evidently it would be too deplorable if it were to be publicly proved that they had been themselves guilty of crimes far more shameful than anything with which they falsely reproached the Catholic Bishops. But it was all to no purpose. Nundinarius was, in the end (though he seems to have wavered for a while), not to be appeased. Catholics called out for a public investigation. It was granted, and followed in due course before
Zenophilus.</p>
<p>Throughout the proceedings Nundinarius proved the case against Silvanus with merciless precision. There was first the evidence of an inhabitant of
Cirta----a certain Victor, a grammarian. As this Victor tried at first to screen
Silvanus, there were read aloud municipal Acts recorded during the persecution when Munatius Felix was
<A NAME="p348"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|348</SPAN></A> <i>Curator. </i>From these it became clear that Silvanus had indeed been a Betrayer, and Victor had to admit this, though he tried to save himself by denying that he was present when it all happened. Then the compromising and discreditable letters were read, from which it was seen how much Purpurius and Fortis dreaded exposure. No doubt they were afraid that Nundinarius might denounce them, as already he had denounced Silvanus in a <i>libellus </i>of accusation, which had been addressed to all the clergy and elders of
Cirta, and was read in full before Zenophilus. Furthermore, witnesses were produced who told the old story of the events that took place at the consecration of
Silvanus, which proved him to have been guilty of Betrayal and Simony. It was also shown that he and
Purpurius, as well as other Donatists, had been guilty of thefts from the Temple of
Serapis. Further evidence was given which proved that the Numidian Bishops (now
Donatists) had received money from Lucilla, in order that Majorinus might be consecrated rival Bishop of Carthage in opposition to Caecilian, and that they had kept it all for themselves, though part of it at least was intended by its donor for the poor.</p>
<p>Most of these Proceedings are extant, but the judgement is wanting. It is, however, certain that Silvanus was banished by Zenophilus for Betrayal,<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> for robbing the Treasury of vinegar casks, for taking money for Ordination, and for having been himself made Bishop by violence, of all of which crimes he had been proved guilty in the course of these Proceedings.

<p>In the consulship of Constantine Maximus Augustus and Constantine the younger the most noble Caesar, on the thirteenth of December,
(Sextus of Thamagudi being the secretary,) <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> after Victor the Grammarian had been brought in and sworn,<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> Nundinarius the deacon also being present,
Zenophilus, a most noble man of consular rank,<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A><sup> </sup>said:</p>

<p>'What is your name?'</p>

<p>He answered:</p>

<p>'Victor.'</p>

<p>Zenophilus said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'What is your station in life?'</p>

<p>Victor said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'I   am a lecturer in the literature of Rome, a Latin grammarian.' <A NAME="p350"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|350</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zenophilus said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'What is your rank?'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Victor said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'My father was a decurion of Cirta. My grandfather was a soldier. He had seen service at court.<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> For our family is of Mauritanian blood.'
  <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zenophilus said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Be mindful of your honour and character, and tell me with simplicity----what was the cause of the dissension amongst Christians?'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Victor said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'I do not know the origin of the dissension. I am one of the Christian people. However, when I lived at Carthage and the Bishop Secundus
  <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> had at length arrived there, they are said to have discovered that Caecilian had been wrongfully
  <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> made a Bishop, by whom I know not; and they set up another in opposition. From that time forward the dissension at Carthage began, but I cannot know its origin fully, for our city always has one church,<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> and if dissension there was, we know nothing about it.'
  <A NAME="p351"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|351</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zenophilus said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Are you in communion with Silvanus?'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Victor answered:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p> 'I am.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zenophilus said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Why then have you passed over that man <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> whose innocence has been cleared
<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>?' And added: 'Besides, it is stated that you know something else with the fullest certainty----that Silvanus is a Betrayer.    Own to this.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Victor replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'This I know not.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zenophilus said to Nundinarius the Deacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Victor says that he does not know that Silvanus is a Betrayer.' <A NAME="p352"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|352</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nundinarius the deacon said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'He knows quite well, for <A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> he himself gave up the codices.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Victor answered:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'I had fled from that storm----and if I lie, let me perish. When we suffered the inrush of sudden persecution, we fled to Mount Bellona.<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> I remained there with Mars the deacon. Victor the priest was there also. When this Mars was ordered to give up all the books, he said that he had not got them. Then Victor gave up the names of all the lectors. They came to my house in my absence. The magistrates went in and carried off my codices. When I got back, I found that the codices had been taken away.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nundinarius the deacon said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'But at the public investigation you answered that you gave up the codices. Why deny things that can be proved?'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zenophilus said to Victor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Acknowledge frankly, that you may not be questioned with greater severity.' <A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nundinarius the deacon said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Let the Acts be read.'&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Zenophilus said:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p> 'Let them be read.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nundinarius then gave them, and the notary read aloud:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And a copy of a letter <A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A> was read aloud:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'Purpurius,<A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A> the Bishop, to his fellow Bishop
  Silvanus----Health in the Lord! Nundinarius the deacon, our son, has come to me and has begged of me to send this letter of supplication to your Holiness, that, if it be possible, there may be peace between you and him. For I wish this to be done in writing by you, if you are willing, in order that no one may know what is going on between us, so that I may alone be concerned with you in this present matter, and may bring to a conclusion
  <A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A> the dissension between you. For he has handed to me a petition written by his hand concerning the affair, on account of which, by your command, he was degraded.<A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>

  <p>It is not right <A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A> for a father to chastise a son against the truth, and I know that the things which were written in the bill of accusation that was handed to me are true. Search for a remedy by which this ill-will may be extinguished before the flame burst forth which it may not be possible afterwards to extinguish without the spiritual shedding of blood. Call together your fellow clerics and the elders of the people who belong to the Church,<A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A> and let them carefully inquire what are these dissensions of yours, that whatever is done may be done according to the precepts of the Faith. You shall not decline to the right hand nor to the left. Be not willing to lend your ear to evil teachers who refuse peace. You slay us all ... [and, in another hand] Fare you well.'</p>

<p>And a copy of another letter:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'Purpurius the Bishop to the Clerics and Elders of Cirta----eternal health in the Lord! Moses cried out to the whole assembly of the children of Israel and told them what the Lord commanded to be done. Nothing was to be done without the advice of the Elders. So do you too, my beloved, whom I know to have all heavenly and spiritual wisdom, search out with all your strength what is the nature of this dissension and bring [men] to peace. For Nundinarius the deacon says that you have knowledge of all the circumstances from which this dissension has arisen between our well-beloved Silvanus and himself. For he has handed me a petition in which all these things have been written. And he said that you too are acquainted with them. I know that no one can overhear.<A HREF="#49"><SUP>49</SUP></A><sup> </sup>Do you search out a satisfactory remedy that this thing may be extinguished without danger to your soul, for fear lest when

Be careful not to decline either to the right hand or to the left. There is question of a matter which belongs to God
  <A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A> who searcheth the thoughts of every man. Be careful that no one knows the story of this conspiracy. What is contained in the bill of accusation is true.<A HREF="#52"><SUP>52</SUP></A> It is not good, for the Lord says &quot;Out of thy mouth thou shalt be condemned and out of thy mouth shalt thou be justified.&quot;
  <A HREF="#53"><SUP>53</SUP></A> '</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also was read out:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'Fortis to our well-beloved brother Silvanus, eternal health in the Lord! Our son Nundinarius the deacon has come to me and related the things which have taken place between you and him, through the intervention of the Evil One, who wishes to turn aside the souls of the just from the way of truth. When I heard these things I fainted in my spirit that such a dissension had come between you----that a priest of God should arrive at that . . .<A HREF="#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A> which is not expedient for us to be done. Now therefore beseech him that you may have, as is possible, the peace of the Lord, the Saviour Christ, with him. Let us not come into a public court and be condemned by the Gentiles. For it has been written &quot;Take heed lest, whilst you bite and accuse one another, you be devoured one by another.&quot;
  <A HREF="#55"><SUP>55</SUP></A> Therefore I beseech the Lord that this scandal may be removed from our midst, so that this business, which concerns God, may be carried through with the giving of thanks,<A HREF="#56"><SUP>56</SUP></A> as the Lord says   &quot;My peace I give unto you, My
  <A NAME="p362"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|362</SPAN></A> peace I leave to you.&quot; <A HREF="#57"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
  What peace can there be, where there is dissension and where there are rivalries? For when I was roasted by the soldiers,

  with such foul treatment,<A HREF="#60"><SUP>60</SUP></A> I commended my soul to God and forgave you,<A HREF="#61"><SUP>61</SUP></A> for God sees the minds of men, and [how, just like you, I was led into the deed you know of
  <A HREF="#62"><SUP>62</SUP></A>]. But God has delivered us and we serve Him together with you. Therefore even as we have been forgiven, so be you two reconciled to peace, that you may be able to celebrate the peace of Easter

  <A HREF="#64"><SUP>64</SUP></A></p>

<p>There was also read out:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'Fortis to the brethren and sons, to the clergy and seniors, eternal health in the Lord! Your deacon, Nundinarius, has come to me and told me of the things that have been done against you, which surely ought to have been adjusted by you in such a way that you should not have arrived at so great a
  <A NAME="p363"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|363</SPAN></A> pitch of madness that men should be degraded
  <A HREF="#65"><SUP>65</SUP></A> for telling the truth----a thing which both you and we know, even as you have related to us. And it is written &quot;Is there not any wise man amongst you who can judge between brethren? But does brother go to law with brother----and this amongst the unbelievers?&quot;
  <A HREF="#66"><SUP>66</SUP></A>----just as you now strive in judgement.<A HREF="#67"><SUP>67</SUP></A> Have things then come to this pass, that we should give such an example to the Gentiles, so that they who have believed in God through us, should themselves speak evil of us, when we come before the public? Therefore, that it may not come to this, do you who are spiritual see to it that no one should know, so that we may keep Easter with peace,<A HREF="#68"><SUP>68</SUP></A> and do you exhort them to be reconciled to Peace, and that there may be no dissension, lest, should things be made public, you too commence to be in danger (if this should occur), and afterwards blame yourselves. You especially will take care, you, Possessor, Donatius the priest,<A HREF="#69"><SUP>69</SUP></A> and Valerius and Victor, each of you,<A HREF="#70"><SUP>70</SUP></A> who know all that was done
  <A HREF="#71"><SUP>71</SUP></A>----take care <A HREF="#72"><SUP>72</SUP></A> that you be at peace one with another.'</p>

<p>Another letter was also read out:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'Sabinus to his brother Silvanus,<A HREF="#73"><SUP>73</SUP></A> eternal health in the Lord!     Nundinarius your son has come to us----not only to
  <A NAME="p364"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|364</SPAN></A> me but also to our brother Fortis, bringing a serious
  <A HREF="#74"><SUP>74</SUP></A> complaint. I am surprised at your lordship,<A HREF="#75"><SUP>75</SUP></A> that you have acted thus with your son, whom you brought up and ordained. For if an earthly building has been erected, is not something heavenly added to it, which is built by the hand of a priest?
  <A HREF="#76"><SUP>76</SUP></A> However, we ought not to be surprised at you, for the Scripture says &quot;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will reject the prudence of the prudent,&quot;
  <A HREF="#77"><SUP>77</SUP></A><i> </i>and again it says &quot;Men have loved the darkness rather than the light,&quot;
  <A HREF="#78"><SUP>78</SUP></A> just as you are doing.<A HREF="#79"><SUP>79</SUP></A> It should be enough for you to know all the facts. Our brother Fortis has written to you about this. Now I would ask of your charity, my very kind brother, to fulfil the saying of the prophet Isaiah: &quot;Cast evil forth from your souls, and come let us dispute together, saith the Lord.&quot; And again, &quot;Cast forth wickedness from your midst.&quot;
  <A HREF="#80"><SUP>80</SUP></A><sup> </sup>So do you now act after this manner.<A HREF="#81"><SUP>81</SUP></A> Overcome and avert the plot of those who have been unwilling that there should be peace between you and your son. No! let your son
  Nundinarius keep Easter in peace with you,<A HREF="#82"><SUP>82</SUP></A> that the matter which is already known to all of us may not became public as well. I would beg of you, my very kind brother, to fulfil the petition of my mediocrity.    Let no one know about it.'</p>

<p>Also another letter was read aloud: <A HREF="#83"><SUP>83</SUP></A></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>'Sabinus to his brother Fortis, eternal health in the Lord! How great is your charity according to the witness of all your colleagues, I know very well
  <A HREF="#84"><SUP>84</SUP></A>; but that you have had a special <A NAME="p365"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|365</SPAN></A>
  friendship with Silvanus,<A HREF="#85"><SUP>85</SUP></A> according to the will of God, who has said &quot;Some I love above my soul,&quot;
  <A HREF="#86"><SUP>86</SUP></A> I know too. Wherefore I have not hesitated to send you these writings, because I caused yours concerning Nundinarius to be given to him. If we act with diligence God's affair always goes vigorously.<A HREF="#87"><SUP>87</SUP></A><sup> </sup>Do not put forward an excuse. For business presses upon us during these days, and urges us without delay to see to these things before the most solemn Feast of Easter, that through you there may be brought about a peace full of fatness,<A HREF="#88"><SUP>88</SUP></A> and we may be found worthy co-heirs of Christ, who has said &quot;My peace I give unto you, My peace I leave to you.&quot; And once again I beseech you to do as I ask.'

<p>After these documents had been read,<A HREF="#89"><SUP>89</SUP></A> Zenophilus said:</p>

<p>Victor said:</p>

<p>Zenophilus said:</p>

<p>Victor answered:</p>

<p> Nundinarius the deacon said:</p>

<p>Zenophilus said to Victor:</p>

<p>Victor said:</p>

<p>'I did cry out, and so did the people. For we wanted our fellow-citizen, a man of integrity.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zenophilus said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'For what reason did you deem him unworthy?'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Victor said:</p>

<p>Then when Victor of Samsuricum and Saturninus the grave-diggers had been brought in and sworn, Zenophilus said:</p>

<p><A NAME="12"></A>12.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> <i>quoniam semper civitas nostra unam Ecclesiam habet. </i>There was at this time only one Bishop at
Cirta. But at the time of the first Conference of Carthage there were two Bishops there, Fortunatus sometimes called Fortunatianus (the Catholic) and Petilianus (the
Donatist)----both of whose names figure amongst the eighteen elected <i>Actores.    </i>We find that Petilianus complained that another Catholic
Bishop named Delphinus (who was too ill to attend the Conference) was living 'in the middle of his Diocese.' St. Augustine tells us (<i>Ep. </i>cxxxix) that this Delphinus had been sent to Numidia by his fellow-Bishops on account of the needs of the Church. At the Conference of Carthage there was a passage of arms between Fortunatus and
Petilianus. When the latter heard the name of the former read aloud, he cried out 'Ipse est persecutor Ecclesiae in eadem civitate ubi ego Episcopus sum.' To which Fortunatus was not slow to retort 'In eadem civitate ab haereticis omnia altaria confracta
sunt' (<i>Gesta Coll. Carthag. diei </i>i, lxv; cxxxviii, cxxxix) ----so that there was not always harmony at
Cirta.</p>
<p><A NAME="13"></A>13.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; <i>intermisso eo.    </i>This has been taken as referring to Caecilian. But these proceedings were not at Carthage, but in

dlxiv: 'Prosecutio Catholicorum,  maioris   esse innocentiae documentum, quod absens <i>purgatus </i>est Felix'). St. Augustine also uses  <i>purgare  </i>in this  sense

'Posteaquam    apertum est in bibliothecam'    (<i>con.  Cresc. </i>iii,  29) and again
'Posteaquam perventum est ad bibliothecam' (<i>ibid. </i>iv, 56). From these two passages Masson made up his reading, accepted by Du Pin, <i>Posteaquam perventum est in bibliothecam.   </i>But, as Baluzius points out, the old reading may well stand, for <i>bibliotheca </i>here probably means <i>bookcase.     </i>Thus Possidius in his life of St. Augustine (chapter xxxi) writes:
'Una cum <i>bibliothecis </i>libros.'</p>
<p><A NAME="27"></A>27.&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp; <i>capitulata.    </i>St. Augustine twice gives us the word
'capitulata' (<i>Ep. </i>clxv; <i>con. Cresc. </i>iii. 29); but once (<i>con. Cresc. </i>iv, 56) for. <i>capitulatam </i>he substitutes <i>capsulam.     Capsa </i>is a <i>box </i>(e.g. for MS. rolls).</p>
<p><A NAME="28"></A>28.&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp; <i>post orcam.    </i>St. Augustine quoting this passage   (<i>con.   Cresc. </i>iii, 29) reads <i>arcam.</i></p>

Most MSS. are formed of <i>quaternions, </i>i.e. of four leaves doubled, the smooth face of one to smooth face of the other, hair face to hair face. Usually the outside is hair face. In <i>quinions </i>and <i>ternions </i>it was necessary to have them alternately hair and smooth face outside. (The codices <i>may </i>have been of papyrus; but they are almost sure to have been of parchment, as papyrus was dearer and very brittle. Codices came into frequent use in the course of the third century, and paper rolls quickly became unusual. The old ones soon disappeared, as from eighty to a hundred years was a long life for a roll.)</p>

<p><A NAME="38"></A>38.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> <i>legit exemplar libelli traditi Episcopis a Nundinario diacono. </i>The words <i>exemplar libelli traditi Episcopis </i>are wanting in the MS., no doubt through the carelessness of a copyist. They have been supplied from St. Augustine (<i>con. Cresc. </i>iii, 29). The MS. for <i>legit </i>has <i>legitur, </i>and it is thus printed by
Ziwsa. <i>Libellus </i>is often used of a petition (e.g. those of heretics to Popes, or of Catholics to Popes against heretics), but it also often means a bill of accusation, as here.</p>

<p><A NAME="43"></A>43.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> <i>exemplum epistulae.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="44"></A>44.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Purpurius of Limata in Numidia. St. Optatus accused him
(i, 13), on the strength of the Acts of the Council of Cirta, of having murdered his sister's sons. These Acts have been preserved by St. Augustine (<i>contra Cresconium </i>iii, 27), where we read as follows:
'Secundus said to Purpurius of Limata: &quot;It is said that you killed the two sons of your sister at
Milevis.&quot; Purpurius answered him: &quot;Do you think that I am terrified by you, like the rest? . . . I did kill them, and I kill those who act against me. So do not provoke me to say more!&quot;'    (Vide p. 418.)</p>
<p><A NAME="45"></A>45.&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> <i>amputem.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="46"></A>46.&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> <i>lapidatus. </i>So St. Augustine understands it. But may it not perhaps be understood literally of <i>stoning?</i> 
Silvanus, no doubt, like Purpurius himself, was capable of anything.</p>
<p><A NAME="47"></A>47.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; <i>verum.    </i>Cf.   Livy   (Book  xxxii):
'Ceterum    et    sociorum audiri postulata verum esse.'</p>
<p><A NAME="48"></A>48.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; <i>ecclesiasticos viros, id  est   </i>men   who   belong to the Church, not heretics or
schismatics.    Purpurius means 'those who belong to our faction,' which he called the Church.</p>
<p><A NAME="49"></A>49.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; <i>ego scio quia auris non est, </i>i.e. I write this to you all, because you know it already.    I know there is no ear listening----no danger of the thing leaking out further.    Du Pin, however, suggests <i>sileo </i>for <i>scio.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="50"></A>50.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Cf. John vii, 24.</p>
<p><A NAME="51"></A>51.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> <i>Dei res agitur.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="52"></A>52.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> <i>vera sunt. </i>This is the emendation of Du Pin for the <i>vestra sunt </i>of the MS., which Ziwsa preserves. 'Vestra' <i>might </i>mean 'The things in the <i>Libellus </i>are for you alone----tell nobody.' (Cf. supra <i>Ego scio</i>----I know that there is no eavesdropper.) But in the preceding letter of Purpurius, we have a parallel passage: 'Et scio, quia <i>vera </i>sunt.'</p>
<p><A NAME="53"></A>53.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> Matt. xii, 37.</p>
<p><A NAME="54"></A>54.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Something evidently is missing here.</p>

<p><A NAME="58"></A>58.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>nam cum ego a milite essem ass </i>.... <i>separatus.    </i>In the MS.
four letters are wanting.    Dom John Chapman suggests that they arc <i>us et </i>(<i>assus et</i>),<i> </i>and I have translated this.</p>
<p><A NAME="59"></A>59.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; <i>et in illo venissem.    </i>This probably is corrupt.    Ziwsa remarks 'Hic locus perobscurus medelam eludere videtur.'    The sense seems sufficiently clear.   Fortis came to the same pass as Silvanus, and gave up the books.    <i>In illo venit.    </i>He will not name the deed.    Then he begged God's pardon and himself forgave
Silvanus.</p>
<p><A NAME="60"></A>60.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp; <i>cum iniuria tali.    </i>Fortis had been tortured, and at last had given way----so he says----if we are to believe him.</p>
<p><A NAME="61"></A>61.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp; <i>et remisi tibi.    </i>He then forgave Silvanus, as he himself hoped to be forgiven.</p>
<p><A NAME="62"></A>62.&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp; <i>eorum, sive a te ad illos perductus sum.    </i>This is   hopelessly
corrupt.    We seem to want something, like <i>quomodo, sicut et tu, ad illud perductus sum;</i>     and so  I have   translated   it,   placing, however, the passage in square brackets.</p>
<p><A NAME="63"></A>63.&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp; <i>et vos reconciliamini pace, ut . . . possimus cum gaudio pacem
celebrare.    Pacem, </i>that is the Peace of Easter.    It is a play upon words, unless indeed for <i>Pacem </i>we should read <i>Pascha, </i>as below.</p>
<p><A NAME="64"></A>64.&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp; There is here a lacuna of nine lines, at the end of which doubtless there were the usual introductory words   for   a new letter:
