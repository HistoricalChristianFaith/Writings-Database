<h2 align="center">PROLOGUE I.
</h2>
<p>FIRST of all I exhort those who will read this book to peruse it with all
attention and diligence, and not to run over it in a perfunctory manner, but
with loving pains to study it and take into their minds impressions of the
places, figures, and histories which it contains; and when the book has been
read to the end, let them further look into the volume which we have composed
for that lover of Christ, Constantinus: a volume wherein we have described more
fully the whole earth, both the one beyond the ocean, and this one, and all its
countries, together with the southern parts from Alexandria to the Southern
Ocean, namely, the river Nile and the countries adjacent, and all the races of
Egypt and Ethiopia; the Arabian Gulf besides, with the countries adjoining and
their inhabitants as far as the same ocean, and likewise the middle country
between the river and the gulf, with the cities, districts and tribes therein
contained----a volume <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> to prove that what things are said by us are
true, and those false which are said by our adversaries, [114] for whose sake
this book and the drawings <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> it contains have been prepared----those,
I mean, concerning the size of the sun, and that sun-burnt, uninhabited part of
the world about which they din our ears, and vomit out fictions and fables. Let
me next exhort my readers to examine the sketch <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> of the universe and
the stellar motions which we have prepared as a representation of <A NAME="p3"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|3</SPAN></A>
the organic sphere of the pagans <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>, and to study the account of it
sent to the pious deacon Homologus, then they with God's help are quite
competent, especially with this book and the volume mentioned, to overthrow from
the foundation the error of the pagan <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> theories. For if any Christian
possesses these three works, and is by divine grace carefully exercised in the
divine scriptures, he will easily confute the foolish views of the
fable-mongers, for, from the figure itself, the constitution of the world and
the very nature of things, they prove that the divine scriptures and the
doctrines preached by Christians are perfectly true. Be strong then, ye
Christians, in the Lord.

<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<h2 align="center">PROLOGUE II.
</h2>
<p align="center"><i>The Christian Topography of the whole world demonstrated from divine
scripture, about which Christians ought not to doubt.</i>
</p>
<p>IN days long gone by I hesitated, O God-beloved, God-loving and Christ-loving
<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> Pamphilus, to take in hand the treatise descriptive of the constitution of the
whole world which you enjoined me to draw up. For even had I so wished, it was
out of my power, as you well know, on account of the lingering illness by which
I was prostrated. <A NAME="p4"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|4</SPAN></A> But since, in answer to your frequent prayers, I have recovered from that
illness, accept at last the Preface to the books of the work which I submit,
partly as fulfilling the obedience I owe you, and partly as dreading the
condemnation of the sluggish servant which the discourse of our Saviour in the
Gospels has pronounced. And let no one condemn me as overbold, because I conduct
the exposition of my subject in a style homely and unmethodical, since it is not
fine phrases the Christian requires but right notions. For while many be the
darts and helmets and shields and wars set in motion against the Church, some
supposed to be Christians, holding divine scripture of no account but despising
and looking down upon it, assume like the Pagan philosophers, that the form of
the heavens is spherical, being led into this error by the solar and lunar
eclipses.<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> We have therefore conveniently divided the subject of the
book into five parts. In the outset then the first part is directed against the
persons referred to who have been misled, and argues that one who wishes to
profess Christianity cannot be led away by the plausible [115] errors of those
outside the Church----errors which are opposed to divine scripture. For should
any one choose to examine closely the Pagan theories he will find them to be
entirely fictitious, fabulous sophistries, and to be utterly impossible. Then
again, for the Christian who will naturally ask and say: these being refuted,
what are the true theories that must be admitted in opposition to them? I have
written the second book, which proceeds to explain from divine scripture the
nature of the Christian theories----to describe the figure of the whole world,
and to notice that some of the ancient Pagans have been of the same opinion.
Then again, by way of replying to one <A NAME="p5"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|5</SPAN></A> who should doubt and ask: how does it appear that Moses and the prophets in
saying such things say what is true? the third book exhibits the credibility of
Moses and the Prophets, showing that they spake not of themselves, but as
inspired by divine revelation, and that the writers alike of the Old and New
Testament, men approved both by word and deed, having foreseen these things,
declared them accordingly. It further shows what is the utility of delineations
of the world, and how the notion of the sphere had its origin and beginning. The
fourth book, again, has been written for behoof of those who wish to run their
eye over the figures, and is a brief recapitulation, along with delineations, of
what has been said before----a refutation, in fact, of the theory of the sphere
and of the Antipodes. Then again, the fifth book has been written for those
enquiring what the Christian theories are, and it shows that in what we have
said and have represented by drawings we have neither devised fictions of our
own nor invented new fables; but from revelation and from what God who created
the world has ordained, have beheld the pattern of the whole world----namely the
Tabernacle prepared by Moses, which the New Testament consistently with this
view has pronounced to be an image of the whole world; and which also by means
of the vail Moses divided, and so made one tabernacle into two, just as God also
in the beginning divided what was one region, extending from the earth to the
highest heaven, into two regions, by means of the firmament; and just as in the
tabernacle there was an outer and an inner place, so here there was a lower and
an upper. Now the lower is this world, and the upper is the world to come, into
which also the Lord Christ, after having risen according to the flesh from the
dead, ascended the first of all, and into which the righteous shall in their
turn afterwards ascend. And since from Adam to Moses, and from Moses to John,
and from John all the Apostles <A NAME="p6"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|6</SPAN></A> and Evangelists, have each and all in harmony, and both by words and types
spoken of these two states; and since not one of them has uttered a discordant
note, either saying that there was a state before the first, or supposing that
there is a third after the second; but all of them, as if inspired by the Holy
Ghost, have proclaimed that there are [116] but two states only, we, therefore,
putting our confidence in the scriptures, which are truly divine, have not only
sketched the figures of the whole world, but also of those very places by which
you will find the Israelites made their exodus, also the mountain on which they
received the law in writing, and were instructed in the knowledge of writing;
also the delineation of the Tabernacle and the settlement in the Land of
Promise; until he who was expected to arise from among them, and who was
predicted by all the men of old and by the Prophets, did actually appear,
proclaiming the future second state, which on his coming he showed in himself to
us all, having entered into the inner Tabernacle, into the upper celestial
region, into which at his second coming he shall call the righteous, saying: <i>Come,
ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world. </i>To Him be glory for ever, Amen! <A NAME="p7"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|7</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

<img src="cosmas1-5.jpg" alt="cosmas1-5.jpg" width="69" height="72" align="left">S many as ardently desire true knowledge and are lovers of the true light,
and earnestly endeavour to become fellow-citizens of the saints in the age to
come, who regard the Old and New Testament as in reality divine scripture, who
are obedient to Moses and the Christ, who follow out to the end the principles
they have adopted, who acknowledge <A NAME="p8"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|8</SPAN></A> that the world was produced by God out of mere nothing, and who believe that
there is a resurrection of men and a judgment, and that the righteous shall
inherit the Kingdom of Heaven; all these carefully examine the divine scriptures
all throughout, to see whether in Moses, who wrote the account of the Creation,
and in the other Prophets, they <A NAME="p9"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|9</SPAN></A> contain descriptions of the places and figures of the whole creation, among
which is indicated also the position of the Kingdom of Heaven, which the Lord
Christ promises God will give to righteous men. And when they find the Old and
New Testaments to be in mutual harmony, they abide therein firmly grounded and
immovable, in nothing confounded by their adversaries. But those on the other
hand who prank themselves out in the wisdom of this world, and are
self-confident that by scholastic reasonings they can comprehend its figure and
position, scoff at all divine scripture as a mass of fables, stigmatising Moses
and the prophets, the Lord Christ and the Apostles as idle babblers,<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
[117] and given over to vain delusions; while with supercilious airs, as if they
far surpassed in wisdom the rest of mankind, they attribute to the heavens a
spherical figure and a circular motion, and by geometrical methods and
calculations applied to the heavenly bodies, as well as by the abuse of words
and by worldly craft, endeavour to grasp the position and figure of the world by
means of the solar and lunar eclipses, leading others into error while they are
in error themselves in maintaining that such phenomena could not present
themselves if the figure was other than spherical. But concerning these matters
we shall not enter into any discussion just at present, since those persons
sufficiently confute the one the other. But those who wish to profess
Christianity, while wishing at the same time to <A NAME="p10"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|10</SPAN></A>
bedeck themselves with the principles, the wisdom, and the diversity of the
errors of this world, and contend that one thing and another should be accepted,
seem to differ nothing from a shadow which exists while the intermediate body
from which it is projected is in light, but which cannot exist when that body is
not in light, nay, is even obliterated by the light when the body is illuminated
all round.
</p>
<p>It is against such men my words are directed, for divine scripture denounces
them, as of old it denounced the strangers sojourning in Samaria, because they
feared God and burned incense and offered worship on the high places.<sup><A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> </sup>Were
one to call such men double-faced<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> he would not be wrong, for, look
you, they wish both to be with us and with those that are against us, thus
making void their renunciation of Satan whom they renounced in baptism, and
again running back to him. Now, such men cannot be with us at all; but they
occupy a middle position, like empty houses standing high up in the air, without
having either foundations in the earth below, or anything from above to hold
them fast.<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> For while they have as yet scarcely come by their
principles they set about destroying them; and before they have yet destroyed
them, they show that their end is unaccomplished, as they stand firm neither on
the one side nor the other, but rather laugh at every one, and are themselves
laughed at by all. In the first place, then, when arguing with them about the
spherical figure, we showed that this figure was not possible, and was indeed
quite inconsistent with the nature of things. Certain of them say that the
heaven is a body consisting of four elements,<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> but some later on
superciliously <A NAME="p11"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|11</SPAN></A>&nbsp; reconstructed it with an additional fifth new element,<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> though formerly
its essential constitution comprised only four elements, for they saw at a
glance that the heaven could not revolve if it was composed of these. But herein
again they are found to be blind even when they think that those who are
sharp-sighted do not see. For since the heaven is seen to be of sundry and
diverse colours, whence a power to produce heat and cold seems to be inherent in
them, they say that the eyes of all are deceived by reason of their immense
distance. Well, then, let any one of them who so wishes come forward and tell
us: Why do the stars which, according to you are evidently fixed in an immovable
sphere, not [118] apparently differ in colour and size, though their distances
from us are seen to be unequal, if the centre of the earth be the point from
which our eyes are directed towards them? And how is it that many of the fixed
stars are equal and like to the planet we call Mars, to which a lower sphere has
been assigned, and how do we in like manner see not a few of them to be like the
planet Jupiter? But <A NAME="p12"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|12</SPAN></A> further, we do not even see the heaven itself to be of one and the same
colour, for, if it were asked from whence can we surmise that the cloud-like
concretions which you have named the galaxy, and which you have so designated
simply because of the difference of their colour, have derived their peculiar
appearance, while the surface on which the ray of vision strikes is uniform? and
if I replied that these were proofs of the composition and mixture of different
elements, no one, I apprehend, would dare to contradict me, even though he were
a lover of falsehood, and much less if one of those who always assign the
foremost place to truth. Now if the heaven has been constituted not of one
single element endowed with a circular motion of its own, but of the mixture of
the four elements, then it cannot well revolve. For it has been said that it
must either be moved downward if the heavy element preponderate, or be carried
upward if the opposite light one prevail, or must be stationary when no element
is preponderant. This is certainly obvious to everybody. For no one would admit
that he has ever seen the heaven move either upwards or downwards.<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
It must be allowed therefore that it is firmly fixed. But should they ask:
Whence are these motions that differ from the rest in an element that is simple
and without qualities? since they say, and not untruly, that those bodies which
they call planets revolve oppositely to the universe; and if in like manner they
say that their revolution is accomplished in certain <A NAME="p13"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|13</SPAN></A>
times which the Creator has fixed, it is evident that they do not even deny
that the planets advance from the East.<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
</p>
<p>Then being mazed with perplexing doubts, as usually happens to those who
shrink from the truth, they say, on finding no way of escape, that the stars
make retrogressions and pauses. But tell me, ye souls that are so ingenious in
tying and untying knots, if from their very nature they have motion, how comes
it that they stand still? For nothing that can thwart them enters as an element
into their natural constitution. And tell me this besides, what is the force or
what the necessity which imposes on them the contrary motion? And here let no
one tell me that it is an ocular deception; for it is no minute distance to
which they advance, seeing that they are often observed to shift their place
from a sign of the zodiac that is in the rear to one in front. But what must we
say of our opponents when passing on to the operations of the stars themselves,
they reach the very height of absurdity, all unconscious that they themselves
stand still or move backward, and are but a sorry set of good-for-nothing
rascals? Now anyone would say that the star previously seen in Aries, but at
present appearing in Pisces, was not in the house of Mars, but in that of
Jupiter, and that it [119] makes <i>movements, </i>not such as they babble about
when it is in Aries, but those which they ascribe to it in its transit through
Pisces. But if they do not admit the retrograde motion <i>of the planets </i>which
is apparent, whence then or wherefore is their course in both directions? They
will perhaps in reply assign as the cause those invisible epicycles which they
have assumed as vehicles on which, as they will insist, the planets are borne
along. But they will <A NAME="p14"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|14</SPAN></A> be in no better case from this invention, for we shall ask: Why have they
need of vehicles? Is it because they are incapable of motion? Then, if so, why
should you assert them to be animated, and that too even with souls more than
usually divine? Or is it that they are capable? The very idea is, methinks,
ridiculous. And why have not the moon and the sun their epicycles? Is it that
they are not worthy on account of their inferiority? But this could not be said
by men in their sober senses. Was it then from the scarcity of suitable material
the Creator could not construct vehicles for them? On your own head let the
blasphemy of such a thought recoil.
</p>
<p>Cease, O ye wiseacres! prating worthless nonsense, and learn at last though
late to follow the divine oracles and not your own baseless fancies. For, tell
us, how ye think that the fixed stars move in an opposite direction to the
universe? Is such a motion theirs only or that of the sphere in which they are
placed? Then, if it is theirs, how do they traverse unequal orbits in equal
time? And how comes it that of the stars in the galaxy not one has ever gone
outside of it, nor any of those outside is seen nearer it or within it? But if
one should say that it is the sphere which moves in the opposite direction, then
it will be found that at the same time it moves oppositely to itself. But who
can imagine a greater absurdity than this? Thus they do their best to prevent
anyone surpassing them in their effrontery----or rather, let me say, in impiety,
since they do not blush to affirm that there are people who live on the under
surface of the earth. What then, should some one question them and say: Is the
sun to no purpose carried under the earth? these absurd persons will, on the
spur of the moment, without thinking, reply that the people of the Antipodes are
there----men carrying their heads downwards, and rivers having a position
opposite to the rivers here! thus taking in hand to turn every thing <A NAME="p15"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|15</SPAN></A>
upside down rather than to follow the doctrines of the truth, in which there
are no futile sophisms, but which are plain and easy and full of godliness,
while they procure salvation for those who reverently consult them.
</p>
<p>But you will most effectually rebuke them if you say: Why does that sphere of
yours not revolve from the north to the south, or from some other quarter to its
opposite? And do not tell me, in answer, that such seemed better to the Maker of
the world, for my <A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> .... But how can you [120] deem that you speak
consistently with the nature of things in supposing that the whole heaven is in
motion and describes a circle, without also supposing that outside of it there
is either some other space or body, even though it were imaginary. For it is
impossible any thing can move apart from the four elements, but must move either
in earth, or in water, or in air, or in fire, whether it is transferred from
place to place into the infinite, or whether it always revolves in the same
place. But if the heaven as it revolves passes into the infinity of space, we
must suppose that beyond it there is an infinite earth into which it rolls, when
noiselessly leaving what is behind it; but if one of the other three elements be
supposed, in not one of them is the sphere adapted to roll and rotate; nay, were
it to be shot into any of them, a whizzing noise would attend the transition.
But if, again, it rolls and rotates always in the same spot without moving from
place to place, then it must be upheld by supports like a turner's lathe, or an
artificial globe, or on an axis like a machine or a waggon. And if so, then we
must again inquire by what the supports and axles are themselves upheld, and so
on <i>ad infinitum. </i>And tell me, pray, how are we to suppose the axis passes
through the middle of the earth, and of what material it consists.
</p>
<p>When these problems then concerning the nature of <A NAME="p16"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|16</SPAN></A>
things are discussed, there remains the conclusion, as we said before, that
the heaven is fixed and does not revolve. But even in supposing that the earth
is in the middle of the universe, as its centre, you immediately give the
deathblow to your own theory when you repeat that the middle is below, for it is
impossible that the same thing can at once both be in the middle and below, for
the middle is the middle between up and down, or between right and left, or
between before and behind. Why do you then, when beleaguered with difficulties,
utter absurdities contrary to nature, in opposition to scripture? For being in
terror lest any one should pose you with this question: How can this unspeakable
weight of the earth be held suspended by the air and not fall down? you have
invented stones of things that are not true, but strange; and, reversing the
order of things, give out that the middle is below; so that if any should
suppose that instead of the earth, fire was the middle, you would then say that
the middle was above instead of below, seeing that the tendency of fire is
upward. To me, therefore, they seem to subvert the first by means of the second,
and the second by means of the first. But if they say that the air because it
surrounds the earth equally on all sides, is pushed on by the universe, and that
the earth remains immovable, and swerves neither to the one side nor the other,
why do men <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> and the irrational animals that live on land or fly in
the air not move along with it, while all of them cleave the air in walking and
in traversing it, and in going on high. And not only is it incapable of
resisting these, but it cannot even sustain the weight of the lightest inanimate
things, such as the shortest of feathers and the smallest of straws, but all of
them cut it, it is so attenuated and so rare, and they outstrip it according to
the force with which they are propelled. How then can we receive such false
theories? <A NAME="p17"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|17</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But should one wish to examine more elaborately the question of the
Antipodes, he would easily find them to be old wives' fables. For if two men on
opposite sides placed the soles of their feet each against each, whether they
chose to stand on earth, or water, or air, or fire, or any other kind of body,
how could both be found standing upright? The one would assuredly be found in
the natural upright position, and the other, contrary to nature, head downward.<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
Such notions are opposed to reason, and alien to our nature and condition. And
how, again, when it rains upon both of them, is it possible to say that the rain
falls down upon the two, and not that it falls down to the one and falls up to
the other, or falls against them, or towards them, or away from them. For to
think that there are Antipodes compels us to think also that rain falls on them
from an opposite direction to ours; and any one will, with good reason, deride
these ludicrous theories, which set forth principles incongruous, ill-adjusted,
and contrary to nature.
</p>
<p>And if one should examine that other sophism of theirs, namely, that the
earth is inflated with air, and that earthquakes occur when the pent-up air
shakes the earth violently, he would be amazed at the imposture and the
contradiction in their statements. For if the earth when equally pressed by the
whole air stands unshaken and unswerving, then, when inflated it ought to be all
the heavier in that quarter, and to swerve to a side, after the example of man
which they adduce. For not only does a man shake and tremble when attacked with <A NAME="p18"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|18</SPAN></A>
flatulency, but he trembles when seized with terror, and when overcome with wine,
and pinched with cold, and when his blood boils with anger, and when he is old
and imbecile, but when he reels under the effects of flatulency death results.
Why then does not the earth also, which according to them is inflated with air,
not collapse and lose its proper place? And why, again, do they further say that
Egypt, because its soil is porous and its furrows allow the air to escape
without violent shocks, is not subject to earthquakes, while in point of fact
earthquakes have been of frequent occurrence in that country, and so violent as
to overthrow cities and level them with the ground: and not only so, but even in
the times of the Greeks, when Alexander, and Seleucus, and Antiochus, and
Ptolemy ruled and reigned, they had recourse to the assistance of
philosophers----Aristotle and his like----and frequently gave practical effect
to what they advised? And when Antioch was being founded by Seleucus <A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
and Antiochus, how was it that the philosophers were not able to point out that
the country there was not safe from earthquakes, but on the [122] contrary
exposed to their frequent visitations? And this we say from having seen that
this city has been repeatedly overthrown by earthquakes; and not Antioch only
but Corinth also, which has close at her hand the mob of the philosophers.
</p>
<p>But if we should care to examine yet another of their opinions----that in
which they say and try to prove by illustrations----that rain is produced from
vapour drawn up <A NAME="p19"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|19</SPAN></A> by heat into the atmosphere, in the same way, say they, as the bath draws up
vapour from the heat, and lets it fall in drops; and just as a cupping-glass
draws up moisture by means of tow and fire, so too does the sun draw up vapour,
and in course of time lets it fall in drops, whence rain is produced. One cannot
but marvel at such wisdom as this, imposing, as it does by its speciousness,
upon the multitude. For since the bath derives its heat not from above but from
below, how can it be said to draw up, and npt rather to push up? So too in the
case of a caldron: it receives its heat not from above but from below, and in
both instances the vapours are pushed up by the heat, and in the rebound, due in
the one case to the roof and in the other to the lid, they fall in drops.
Similar is the case of the cupping-glass, which, did not this instrument itself
constrain nature and suck up moisture, would never have sucked it up at all,<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
no, not even if fire and tow had been applied ten thousand times over. But
further, when one thrusts a damp faggot into the fire, moisture is to such a
degree pushed by the heat that both moisture and smoke are expelled from the
other end of the faggot. And when one has kindled a fire on the ground he sees
the moisture in the faggots conveyed upwards by the smoke, not drawn up by what
is above but pushed up by the heat of the fire. Nay, more, if one washes a
garment and spreads it on the ground, and if, when it has been dried by the sun,
he lifts it up, he will find the moisture which has been expelled from it by the
heat impressed on the ground in the very <A NAME="p20"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|20</SPAN></A>
shape of the garment. In like manner, if one places a hot piece of meat on a
trencher he will see the moisture discharged in both directions, both upwards
and downwards, the heat being intermediate, for above he sees the steam mounting
upwards, and below he sees the trencher bathed in moisture on which the meat has
impressed its own shape; whence it appears that heat does not draw up, as these
sages tell us, but rather pushes up.
</p>
<p>But when we propose a new question to them: Why is it that in the Thebaid,
where the ground is parched up by the heat, the moisture is not drawn up and
turned into rain for that country? they defend themselves by saying that it is a
moderate and not an excessive heat that causes the drawing up. To this we shall
give a very summary reply: And how happens it, we shall ask, that beyond the
Thebaid, in Ethiopia, where the heat is far greater, there are frequent copious
downfalls of rain? And how can they say, those many and tip-top wise men, that
the sun has the power of drawing upwards, and assert also quite confidently that
in the course of his revolution he becomes heated by friction, while they will
not entertain the supposition that the heat is in him by nature. But more: when
they allow that the air is moist and hot, what need have [123] those wiseacres
to resort to sophistry and say that the moisture is drawn up from elsewhere,
when up above they have the heat and moisture at the same spot? But if one
should ask them about one particular element as it is in itself, that is, should
ask them to show its distinctive quality, they immediately find themselves at a
loss, and attribute two qualities to one single element and say: Earth is <i>dry
and cold; </i>water, <i>cold and moist; </i>air, <i>moist and warm; </i>fire, <i>warm
and dry; </i>so that, being beleaguered with difficulties, they assign eight
qualities to the four elements. But at times they say that all the qualities
exist in each of the elements. Once more, therefore, they <A NAME="p21"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|21</SPAN></A>
contradict their own words, by ascribing not four but only two qualities to
each of the four elements. I marvel accordingly at those most excellent men when
they attribute to water <i>coldness and humidity, </i>and to the air <i>humidity
and heat. </i>How do they say that water, that is, the <i>cold and moist, </i>congeals
and becomes ice in winter-time? Wherefrom comes that extreme cold which converts
it into ice? For if they shall say that the departure of the sun naturally
produces this effect, why does it not produce the same effect on the air, which
is naturally <i>warm, </i>and at the same time <i>moist, </i>but makes it, on
the contrary, extremely <i>cold? </i>And how does <i>the cold </i>itself----that
is, water----not make the air----that is, <i>the moist</i>----freeze, but, on
the contrary, it is the latter which makes the former freeze, as we actually
see? Now though I have many things more to say about this question and the
examples which they erroneously adduce in favour of their view of it, I curb
myself, for I feel ashamed of the foolishness of what is said by them, and
consider what has already been said on this subject sufficient.
</p>
<p>There is, however, another sophism held by these wise men which I am
especially anxious to deal with, and will forthwith proceed to discuss. They say
that the heaven which they call a body contains the whole world, and stoutly
maintain that outside of it nothing whatever exists; and yet they define angels
and demons and souls, which are parts of the world as uncircumscribed, neither
containing the heaven, nor contained by the heaven, not understanding what they
say, since that which neither contains nor is contained is never by any
possibility seen among things that are. If then these things be as they say, let
them tell us with respect to their own soul whether it is, or is not. And if
they say it is not, then to their own shame and disgrace they assume themselves
to be soulless. But if they say that it exists, let them tell us whether it is <A NAME="p22"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|22</SPAN></A>
in them or is not in them. If they reply that it is not in them, they answer
not less shamelessly and foolishly than they did before. But if they reply that
the soul is in them, we must ask them a further question: As the body is
circumscribed by the heaven, why is not the soul also circumscribed? And if, as
they say, it illuminates the body without being circumscribed along with it, the
question arises, where is it when it illuminates the body? since it is
impossible that, being a created thing, it should not exist with things created.
And if they say it exists somewhere [124] within the heaven, then it is again
circumscribed by the body itself of the heaven, although it was represented by
them as uncircumscribed. But if they make it exist outside the heaven, they, in
the first place, confute themselves; in the next place, it will either be in a
part of the heaven and occupy but a small part of it, or it will be in the whole
of it, in which case it will circumscribe the heaven and will be found having
form like a bodily substance; and this a spherical form embracing and limiting
the sphere. But if, again, they say that as being uncircumscribed it pervades
all things both within and without, let them not blind themselves to the fact
that they arc both introducing polytheism and imagining an equality with God.
For this property pertains to none except the uncreated Deity who created and
fashioned the universe. So then, professing themselves to be wise, they become
fools, as says the blessed Paul the Apostle, having changed the glory of the
uncircumscribed Deity to their own created souls, thus appropriating to
themselves the glory due to God. They must therefore in every way be avoided.
For, saith the Apostle, from those turn away who hold an outward form of
godliness but deny the power thereof.

exposition of the text (<font face="SPIonic">tou~ keime/nou</font>). The reader should therefore read first
the text and then the notes.&quot; As Cosmas in this book seeks to confute the
system of astronomy called the Ptolemaic----because Ptolemy, though not its
founder, was its chief exponent----it may be of service if we remind the reader
of the main outlines of that system. It assumed that the earth was the Centre of
the universe, and that the heavenly bodies revolved round it in perfect circles
and at a uniform rate of motion. Such phenomena as were found to be inconsistent
with these assumptions were explained by means of subsidiary hypotheses. The
belief that the earth was the centre of the universe seemed to accord with the
relation in which the primary elements of which the material world was thought
to be composed stood to each other. Thus <i>earth, </i>as being the stablest
element, held the lowest place and supported <i>water, </i>above which was
placed <i>air, </i>and above that again, <i>fire, </i>while <i>ether </i>was supposed to extend indefinitely
above the others. In or beyond the ether were certain heavens, each of which
contained a crystalline sphere, whereto was attached a heavenly body, which by
the revolution of its crystalline sphere was made to move round the earth. When
it was discovered that the planets move sometimes from west to east, sometimes
from east to west, and for some time remain stationary at the point where
progression ends and retrogression begins, the ancient astronomers were greatly
puzzled, and to account for these irregularities in the planetary movements
invented the hypothesis of epicycles. This doctrine is explained as follows in
the article on the Ptolemaic System of Astronomy in Chambers's <i>Encyclopaedia:
</i>&quot; The acceleration of the sun on one side, and retardation on the other
side of his orbit, is only apparent, and results from the earth not being in the
centre of his sphere, c (see fig.), but at E, and consequently his motion
appears to be slowest at P and quickest at R.<br>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img src="cosmas1-6.jpg" alt="cosmas1-6.jpg" width="117" height="89">
<p>&quot;The alternate progression and regression of the planets was accounted
for by supposing them to move, not directly with their crystallines, but in a
small circle whose centre was a fixed point in the crystalline, and which
revolved on its axis as it was carried round with the latter; thus (fig.) the
planet was carried round the small circle A B D, as that circle was carried
round P Q R (now supposed to represent the planetary crystalline). The planet,
while in the outer portion of its small circle, would thus have a forward and in
the inner portion a backward motion. The larger circle was called an <i>eccentric
</i>and the smaller an <i>epicycle</i>&quot;

lived by picking up any scattered or refuse produce; and generally of <i>persons

followers, however, eventually came to use the term in the sense of a <i>fifth
element, </i>namely <i>mind, </i>which differed entirely in its nature from the
four elements of common speech. To this effect I may quote the words of Cicero:
&quot;Dicaearchus .... quemdam Phthiotam senem .... disserentem inducit, nihil
esse omnino animum et hoc esse nomen totum inane .... Aristoteles .... quum
quattuor nota illa genera principiorum esset complexus, e quibus omnia
orerentur, quintam quamclam naturam censet esse, e qua sit mens. Cogitare enim
et providere et discere .... haec et similia eorum in horum quattuor generum
inesse nullo putat: quintum genus adhibet vacans nomine et sic ipsum animum <font face="SPIonic">
e0ndele/xeian</font> appellat novo nomine quasi quamdam continuatam motionem et
perennem.&quot; (<i>Tusc. Disp., </i>i, 21, 22). Cicero has here confounded <font face="SPIonic">
e0ntele/xeia</font> with <font face="SPIonic">e0ndele/xeian</font>,<i> </i>of which he has given the meaning
correctly. Probably he had not seen the word in the written pages of Aristotle,
but only heard it from the lips of Greek Peripatetics, who, like their
countrymen of the present day, pronounced the letter <font face="SPIonic"> tau~</font> very like
