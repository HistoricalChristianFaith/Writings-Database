men at first after the Deluge were high up in the air, building the tower in
their warfare with God, they suspected from their constantly observing the
heavenly bodies, but erroneously, that the heaven was spherical; for since the
city where they were building the tower belonged to the Babylonians, an
invention such as this must have originated with the Chaldaeans; whence also the
descendants of Abraham who were Chaldaeans elaborated a barbaric sphere, and
when they went down to Egypt communicated this notion to the Egyptians. The
Egyptians in turn having grasped it as a basis for much active investigation
developed it still further, until the Greek philosophers who visited
Egypt----Pythagoras, Plato and Eudoxus the Cnidian----became acquainted with it,
and basing their study of it on what they had learned [160] from preceding
enquirers elaborated it still further.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Note.</i>
</p>
<p>After the Deluge, when men had multiplied in the interior parts of the East,
where, as has been recorded, the Ark rested, they removed a little way from
their first seats and found a plain in <A NAME="p92"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|92</SPAN></A>
the land of Sennaar (Shinar). Now, as they were all of one speech, they
talked together with one accord, saying: The men who were before us God has
destroyed with a deluge; if he shall again think fit to be wroth with us and
seek to destroy us even with a deluge, we shall <i>all </i>perish to a man. But
come, let us prepare bricks and burn them with fire, that they may withstand the
waters, and building them together with asphalt, let us make a high tower the
top of which shall reach to heaven, in order that being delivered from the
deluge we may find safety in the tower. And we shall readily be able to array
ourselves against him in battle, being very near him, as long as we are all of
us together, before being scattered in different directions, for this is shown
by their saying: <i>And let us make unto ourselves a name before we are
dispersed over the face of the earth</i>.<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A><i> </i>When they had
therefore begun to build, and in their rebellious mood<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> wanted to
mount up into heaven, God, who is full of kindness and compassion, knowing and
foreknowing man whom he had created with freedom both of will and
action----knowing, I say, the strength of reason which he possessed, but at the
same time the weakness of his flesh, was moved with compassion rather than with
anger towards him, and made again a grand dispensation, and suffered them not to
labour nncl toil in vain. For, besides being crushed with hard labour, they were
dashed to pieces, if when high up in the tower they were hurled down from the
top by the violence of the winds, or tumbled down if scorched by heat through
their nearness to the sun, and blinded by terror at the dizzy height. He
therefore confounded their language and divided it into many kinds, and put an
end to their impious madness. He scattered them besides, and settled them over
the whole earth. This was the cause of the dispersion of the nations, and of
every country becoming inhabited. In the last days therefore God being well
pleased with men, according to what is written: <i>Good pleasure towards men</i>,<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A><i>
</i>of his own counsel and goodness resolved to lead them up into heaven, and
after forty clays from his resurrection led (Christ) our first-fruits up into
heaven. And further, in order that <A NAME="p93"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|93</SPAN></A> he might indicate beforehand the ascension of the rest of mankind, he on the
day of Pentecost, having through the Holy Spirit joined together the tongues
which he had formerly divided, gave them from heaven to the Apostles, and they
spake with tongues the mighty works of God. as the Spirit gave them utterance,
so that all who stood around gathered together from all the nations heard, each
of them in his own speech, the mighty works of God, and knew the good-will he
was pleased to show to men, because when of old men had rebelliously sought to
go [161] up into heaven, their design proved abortive; whereas now by the good
pleasure of God, the faithful are carried up into heaven. Glory to the wise and
compassionate God who has granted these favours to men. Amen!
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Further Note.</i>
</p>
<p>When the first men were there at a great height engaged in building the
tower, and frequently turned their eyes upward to the heavenly bodies and saw
some of the stars ascending and others descending, they suspected that the
heaven was somehow made to revolve on some kind of mechanical contrivance, so
that it was spherical. For they were ignorant of the figure of the earth and were not aware that the heavenly bodies are moved in the air by
angels. Under the influence of this suspicion they made those gates which gave
passage through the tower in all directions, contriving that the tower might not
be of course thrown down by the waters of the deluge. In like manner also they
built it with bricks that it might withstand the waters; for it was thus the
tower was constructed. They say, moreover, that its foundations occupy a breadth
in every direction of three miles, and also affirm that the steps by which it is
ascended are arranged circle-wise in the exterior walls, in order that they may
receive light through the windows made in them.

<p align="center"><i>Text.</i>
</p>
<p>While the Israelites were still sojourning in Egypt Moses was born, and being
reared in the palace of the Egyptian king was instructed in all the wisdom of
the Egyptians. Having also from his own observations accepted the sphere <A NAME="p94"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|94</SPAN></A>
and made himself acquainted with astronomy, or even with magic and
hieroglyphic letters----or as I should rather say, the symbols of letters, for
as yet letters were unknown; and, to speak briefly, having become a participant
of all this wisdom, as the divine scripture informs us, when he reached manhood
he preferred to side warmly with his own ancestral race, and he slew the
Egyptian; and being afraid fled into the land of Midian, where he married and
became the father of two sons. And when he was feeding the flocks of his
father-in-law and led them up to Mount Sina&iuml;, he saw that wonderful vision of
the bush----the bush which burned with fire and yet was not consumed. Then, when
he was making haste to see the great marvel, the angel of God called to him in
the name of God, and commanded him to go to King Pharoah in Egypt for the
purpose of leading the children of Israel out of their bondage to the Egyptians.
And when he begged to be let off on account of the impossibility of the thing
(for he saw that as he was a mere man he could not fight against such a mighty
king), God through the angel filled him with confidence, reminding him of his
forefathers: how that through a barren woman and aged parents he had raised
[162] up a great and numerous people. At the same time he prepared him
beforehand for working wonders by means of the rod which Moses held in his hand.
By these wonders Moses was quite astounded, and was persuaded to go away into
Egypt. When he had gone thither, and had several times conversed with Pharoah,
since he was going to show him how God had produced the whole creation----what
creatures first and what second, and so on in proper order<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> . . . And
these things were incredible to men, even as they are also now to those very
clever men----yea, they <A NAME="p95"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|95</SPAN></A> were even incredible to Moses himself, for he had not as yet acquired
experience of these matters; but in agreement with the Egyptians, he also
conjectured that the heaven was of a spherical figure.
</p>
<p>God therefore prepared him to work wonders, and in the name of God to change
the elements, and to show to all the Egyptians and to the Israelites, and
through them to the whole of mankind, that he was faithful to God in all that he
said and did, disposing them and preparing them beforehand to accept him with
readiness. The enchanters also by whom he had been educated combined to contend
with him, and in the divine power he enters the lists against them, instructed
to hold such opponents in contempt, so that they cry off and say: <i>This is the
finger of God</i>.<sup><A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A><i> </i></sup>When he had changed accordingly the
constitution of the waters into blood and killed the fish, and changed the blood
back into water living and productive, and had divided the Red Sea and made it
stand as a wall on this side and that side in presence of the Israelites and the
Egyptians, he was fully believed by them when he afterwards said:----<i>God said
let there be a firmament in the middle of the water, and it shall divide in the
middle water from water, and it was so</i>.<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> In like manner again,
when he had made darkness for three days successively among the Egyptians, while
the Israelites had light, he was again fully believed when he said:----<i>And
there was darkness over the abyss, and God said let there be light, and God
divided the light from the darkness;</i> and he assumed that the first and
second and third day had passed without the sun, moon and stars running their
course, saying:----<i>God divided the light from the darkness</i>.<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A><i>
</i>Then again he brought frogs out of the river and fleas out of the earth, and
therefore he was trusted when saying:----<i>God said let the waters bring</i> <A NAME="p96"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|96</SPAN></A>
<i>forth living creatures, and it was so;</i> and again he said:----<i>Let
the earth bring forth this and that, and it was so;</i> and other things in like
manner marvellous. Last of all, when he had slain all the first-born he was
entitled to belief when saying last of all:----<i>God made man</i>.<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A><i>
</i>And, as we have said above, he so prepared him beforehand that the
Israelites could readily believe what he said and did, since they saw with their
own eyes what he performed.
</p>
<p>When again he had led them out of Egypt and had [163] brought them through
the Red Sea on dry land, and conducted the people to Mount Sina&iuml;, in which he
had seen the divine vision, God still working wonders before the people filled
the mountain with flames of fire and with smoke, while there were heard the
notes of trumpets resounding from heaven and waxing louder and louder; and when
with gloom and darkness and tempest he had made them tremble with exceeding
great fear, he began to speak to Moses in sight of the people out of the cloud.
Then, having taken him up into the mountain to remain for forty days without
food, he hid him in a cloud and in a manner abstracted him from all earthly
things, and made him oblivious of all, including even what he had learned from
the Egyptians, giving him birth anew as if he were a child in the womb. But at
the end of the forty days he gave him a new form and a new soul, and revealed to
him all that he had done in the making of the world in six days, and showing him
in other six days by means of visions the making of the world, performing in his
presence the work of each day, namely, on the first day the first heaven, and
the earth a most spacious house, and within it water, air, fire commingled with
the earth, darkness and angels, having produced everything singly and
collectively from nothing whatever; employing, <A NAME="p97"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|97</SPAN></A>
moreover, his voice alone for the instruction of the angels, he created the
light for the house itself, thus giving light to everything as by a lamp. Then
on the second day he constructed out of the water the firmament, which in the
middle of the height of heaven binds all firmly together, dividing the waters
above from the waters below, as it is placed in the middle between them. There
are therefore two places----an upper and a lower story, so to speak; the lower
he made fit to be a dwelling-place for this mortal and changeful life; the upper
he has made ready beforehand for the coming deathless and unchanging life.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Note.</i>
</p>
<p>The great Moses, after relating that on the second day God had created the
firmament, and by dividing it had made one place into two, explained nothing
further about the future state----that is, the upper place----but turned his
discourse entirely upon this state-----that is, upon the lower place----relating
that God gathered together the waters, and brought forth out of the earth the
green herbs and the trees, and in like manner adorned the heaven with stars, and
again from the waters produced the winged fowl and aquatic animals, and in like
manner again made from the earth brute animals and man. Then again, when he had
been commanded to make the Tabernacle in imitation of the form of the world, he
divided the one tabernacle by means of the veil, and made it into two----an
inner and an outer----within the outer of which the priests continually
discharged their sacred offices as being in this world, while into the inner the
high priest alone once a year entered, as if into the upper place, that is, into
heaven. [164] On this account the inner Tabernacle was entirely inaccessible to
them, being a type of the things in heaven. He was, moreover, believed when with
the same authority he suitably prescribed the laws, and burdens, and
punishments, and the correction of transgressors, having prepared himself for
prescribing what was conducive to discipline and the working of wonders, as when
he involved the Egyptians in plagues and chastisements of various kinds, and
likewise made the Israelites suffer so sorely in the wilderness for their
repeated sins and transgressions, that he <A NAME="p98"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|98</SPAN></A>
destroyed all the men of that generation except two only that were left
alive, while even he himself came to his end with that generation.
</p>
<p>But when the Lord Christ for the salvation of the whole world had appeared
among us to bring to a close the present state and proclaim the one to come, and
announced expressly that the kingdom of heaven was at hand, he also,
appropriately to his proclamation, wrought wonders for the benefit of men, and
not in a single instance for the punishment of any man. He freed those that were
possessed with devils, healed the sick, strengthened the weak, made the lame
walk erect, restored sight to the eyes of the blind, opened the ears of the
deaf, loosened the tongues of the dumb, cleansed lepers, restored the withered
to a well-tempered life, cured withered hands, stanched by his power issues of
blood, reanimated the dead even when corrupt and stinking, prepared the living
for finishing their course, brought good tidings to the poor of treasures of
which they could not be robbed, stilled by his rebuke the rage of the winds and
the fury of the sea, and did all things else which are in harmony with the
proclamation of the Gospel and with the future state; for in that state no devil
gives trouble, no debility exists, all sickness has been banished, with disease
of limbs and distempers, and penury, and issues of blood and commotions of the
elements, and the last enemy----death----is destroyed. When the Jews considered
all this----when they saw that he had not wrought a single miracle for the
punishment of men, except only two, and these not inflicted on man, but upon the
swine and the fig tree, upon brutes and an inanimate object, in order to show
that these also were subject to his power ----they attempted to bring a charge
against him, saying to him in turn: <i>We wish to see a sign from thee, </i>that
is, a sign such as that of Moses, which was for the punishment of men. But the
Lord, knowing the thoughts of their hearts answered, saying: <i>An evil and
adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and no sign shall be given it except
the sign of the prophet Jonas.</i><A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A><i> For as Jonas remained shut up
in the belly of the whale for three days, and afterwards came out therefrom
alive and uncorrupted, so I also being dead, after remaining </i>[165] <i>in the
earth three days shall rise up from the dead living and incorruptible. </i>At
another time, again, when he had made a <A NAME="p99"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|99</SPAN></A>
scourge of small cords and cast out all from the temple, they said to him: <i>What
sign shewest thou that thou dost these things?</i><sup><A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
</sup>and this
although many signs had been given by him. But he in turn said to them: <i>Destroy
this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again</i><sup><A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A></sup>----thus
giving the same answer both times and speaking of the resurrection of his body
as if he should say: When ye see me risen from the dead and see miracles wrought
in my name, then shall ye know our power and our proclamation of good tidings;
that my coming is not for the punishment of men, but for conferring upon them
the resurrection, and immortality, and incorruption, and immutability, and
blessedness. Accordingly, in consistency with his teaching, he wrought also his
miracles. And this very thing Matthew also shows when speaking thus: <i>And
Jesus went about their cities and villages teaching in their synagogues, and
preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all
manner of sickness</i>,<sup><A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A></sup><i> </i>thus implying that he wrought
miracles of a nature consistent with what he preached. But John the Evangelist
thus speaks: <i>Many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. </i>Jesus
said, therefore, unto the twelve: <i>Would ye also go away? </i>But Peter
immediately answering on behalf of all said: <i>Lord, to whom shall we go away?
Thou hast the words of eternal life, and we have believed that thou art the Holy
One of God</i>;<sup><A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A></sup><i> </i>meaning this: What thou teachest us we see
even by the works which are done by thee, for thou promisest us life and a
heavenly kingdom, and we see all things that are done by thee to have regard to
the life of men. How then can we leave thee and attach ourselves to another? Our
portion is therefore with thee, Lord Jesus Christ. Amen!
</p>
<p>But some one may raise a difficulty and ask: Since he had given not even one
sign with a view to the punishment of men, how then did he, taking, as has been
said, a scourge, beat those that were selling in the temple and cast them out of
the temple? Answer: What is alleged is false, for it was not at all to the human
being he applied the scourge, but he adopted an admirable and becoming and
appropriate course, for he scourged the brute beasts only, as it is written: <i>And
having made a scourge of small cords he drove all out of the temple, both the
sheep and the oxen,</i><sup><A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A></sup><i> </i>as <A NAME="p100"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|100</SPAN></A>
much as to say: He scourged animals, but only the irrational, driving also
out of the temple even those that were brought for sacrifice according to the
law, showing by this means that the Judaic dispensation was coming to an end.
Things, again, that had neither life nor sensation he pushed away and overthrew,
as it is written: <i>And he poured out the money-changers' money and overthrew
their tables. </i>The rational beings, however, he neither scourged nor drove
away, but he chastised the irrational, as it is written: <i>And to those that
sold doves he said: Take these </i>[166] <i>things hence, and make not my
Father's house a house of merchandise</i><sup><A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A></sup>----showing by all these
words and acts that the things offered for sacrifice in the first tabernacle
according to the law were to cease, and that another dispensation would be
introduced in its place, harmonising with the inner tabernacle, which was a type
of the things in heaven----that is, of the future dispensation. But the Jews
having perceived how he was shadowing forth to them the cessation of the Jewish
dispensation, questioned him, saying: <i>What sign showest thou that thou dost
these things?</i><A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A><i> </i>But taking appropriate advantage of the question,
he promised them that he would do something darkly to foreshadow the answer. I
refer to the destruction of the temple and to its renovation, because the
destruction of the temple----that is, of his body----is the destruction of this
world, while the renovation and change made upon the temple----that is, upon his
body----is a manifestation of the future state. My argument, accordingly, good
reader, holds sure that he never wrought for the punishment of man but for his
benefit, and he himself elsewhere exclaims: <i>For the Father hath not sent the
Son to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.</i><sup><A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A></sup>
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Text.</i>
</p>
<p>Then he collected the water into one mass and exposed to view the dry land,
which he called earth and which was before hidden by the waters; and he made the
seas, that is, the ocean, as it is called, which encircles this earth, and is
itself encircled by the earth beyond it, and also made <A NAME="p101"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|101</SPAN></A>
the four gulfs which run up into this earth of ours----in order that he might
render the air of the ocean which is interposed between the earth here and the
earth beyond salubrious to those at any time inhabiting either the one or the
other. He also so prepared the gulfs that they could be navigated and afford a
means of transit to different parts of the world, thus always uniting the
dispersed nations in the bonds of amity through the facility with which
commodities might be transported from nation to nation. And he commanded all
kinds of fruits and trees and green herbs to spring up out of the earth. And
again on the fourth day he divided the light, and with its purer portion made
the sun, and with the remainder the moon and the stars, embellishing these
heavenly bodies with the harmonious beauty which adorns all nature, giving order
and harmony to the universe, while assigning to the invisible powers as their
function and their law to administer, rule, and adjust these bodies to the
service of God, that is, of man, and of all that exists on his account; thereby
accustoming and training even these exalted powers to be under law, and calling
into play the good or evil qualities of their rational powers, whence some of
them having transgressed were hurled down from heaven and deprived of their
dignity. For, <i>I</i> <i>saw, </i>saith the Lord, <i>Satan like lightning fall
from heaven;</i><sup><A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A></sup><i> </i>for being puffed up because of the service
entrusted to him by God for the good of men, and because it was his office to
move the air for man and regulate its motion for his uses, and deeming that he
had of himself advanced of his own will [167] to this height, he usurped to
himself the worship due to God, and was forthwith hurled down. For the Apostle
again when instructing Timothy not to be hasty in conferring office on a
neophyte----one, that is, who has but <A NAME="p102"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|102</SPAN></A>
recently been converted to the faith, thus addressed him: <i>Not a neophyte,
lest being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil </i><sup><A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A></sup>;
which, says the Apostle, the devil suffered through being puffed up, and has
hereby clearly shown why he was hurled down, namely, by his being puffed up,
deeming himself to be God, whence also he had the wish to communicate his own
disease to man, saying: <i>Ye shall be as Gods.</i>
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Note.</i>
</p>
<p>When God Almighty had along with the heaven and the earth produced all the
angels, who had not hitherto existed, they stood all of them mute with surprise,
being distinguished by the possession of reason from all around them, and were
at once filled with amazement, and bent on considering who he was, the Creator
who had called themselves and everything with them into existence. For they saw
themselves existing in the midst of these things, and that they did not exist
before them, and further reflected: The Creator of these and those things is
surely one, or each must have had a different creator----or again: Were all
things produced spontaneously of themselves, or who then is greater than the
other? But when they were revolving such thoughts in their minds for the space
of that night (for, as it is written, <i>God called that darkness, night</i>)
God entering into their thoughts, all at once without being visible, said in
clear tones: <i>Let there be light;</i> and the production of the light from
nothing, following instantaneously with the word, struck them all with
astonishment, and at the same time taught them that he who had produced this
light out of nothing had produced also themselves and the things existing with
them out of nothing. Then all bending down worshipped the invisible God, who had
produced themselves and all things out of nothing. This, moreover, divine
scripture declares in Job speaking in the. person of God: <i>When I made the
stars all my angels praised me with a loud voice and celebrated me with hymns,</i><sup><A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A></sup><i>
</i>from one indicating all successively. It must, however, be observed that in
the sight of the angels he called into existence out of non-existence two
substances----the one first <A NAME="p103"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|103</SPAN></A> of all and the other last of all----the one first created being the light,
and the other our soul; the one visible, perceptible and devoid of reason, the
other invisible, intelligent and rational. All other things, however, he
produced from things that are; intending thereby to teach them in turn that he
was the maker of all creatures, both rational and non-rational, both those
discernible by sense and those by intelligence, both those visible and those
invisible----having called them into existence from the state of non-existence.
Nor is it unlikely that they on that day and night, since they possessed reason,
considered with themselves whether he who had produced this light had also
produced the heaven. Then by a further word of command, he made before their
eyes [168] the second heaven, forming it from waters and like in its appearance
to the first heaven. And by this they were once more taught that he is the maker
both of this and of the first heaven----and so he brought to an end the work of
the second day. Then when they were again engaged in thinking and looking to the
things of the earth, he, in like manner [as when making the second heaven]
gathered the water together, and having exposed the dry land itself to view
named it the earth, for, being its lord, he gave it its name just as he also
named the firmament heaven Then he produces from the earth seeds and plants and
green herbs and trees, teaching them that he uses each of his creatures to
effect his purposes, since they were created by him. Then, when on the third day
he had produced plants and seeds, thereafter on the next----that is, on the
fourth day, inasmuch as such productions had need of temperature and
arrangement, he makes out of the light, which he had before produced, the great
luminaries and the stars----and having placed in the firmament of heaven the
host of the invisible powers he directed them to move these bodies in order, on
rational principles, and to make them revolve for the supply of temperature to
the plants and all that would use them, in order that after their setting the
plants might be refreshed by the coolness and motion of the air, and be again
warmed by the presence of the luminaries. Accordingly some of the invisible
powers, having from the beginning remained till now wavering in their mind, and
ungrateful to their maker, entered on the office with which he had entrusted
them in forgetfulness of his goodness, and being inflated with pride in their
natural acumen, and in the power and the reason bestowed on them, and <A NAME="p104"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|104</SPAN></A>
valuing nothing, but even despising the voice and the command which had come
forth from God----yea, not so much as understanding that they had been, like the
other creatures, produced along with the darkness, they were overcome by the
delirium of their folly, and fancied they had of themselves by their own free
act advanced to their high estate. I refer, of course, to the devil, who had
been entrusted with the power of the air, and his associates, who had been
entrusted some with this and others with that office, who having usurped for
themselves the worship and glory due to God, and having been puffed up with
pride and become insubordinate, were promptly----to prevent them misleading the
others----hurled down from on high and from their dignities to go wandering
about the earth. Whence also on the sixth day and after man had been formed,
Satan, who was going about in the earth and envying the great care shown by God
towards man, wished by affecting him with his own disease to drag down man along
with him.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Text.</i>
</p>
<p>On the fifth day again he ordered animals after their kind to issue forth
from the waters----the monsters of the deep and the other sorts of fish, and
along with them the winged fowl of every species that pass through the air. Then
again on the sixth day he made out of the earth all cattle and wild beasts and
creeping things after their kind. And after he had prepared the whole house and
fully furnished and adorned it, then, just as a king, when he has founded a city
and completed it, places there his [169] own image, tinting and embellishing it
with various colours, so also the all-wise God, when he had as it were gathered
together the manifold and diversified works of his hands----the rational and
non-rational----the mortal and the immortal ----the corruptible and the
incorruptible----the sensible and the intelligible----he completed and adorned
one particular animal constituted with every natural quality, namely, Man, and
in the house which had been prepared he installed him in the rank of his own
image which makes <A NAME="p105"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|105</SPAN></A> known that he who is the Creator of all is one. Hence those angels, who are
well-affected towards God, admire his image, and hover as guardians around it,
and minister thereunto. In like manner also the whole creation----the sun on
high shining and making day for man, the moon and stars which impart some light
amid the deepest gloom, accomplish their course by night for man; while all the
months and seasons and tropics and years furnish signs to those who traverse the
open seas or pursue their way through the desert; the air again serves the image
for respiration, coolness and warmth; fire, for baking bread, heating water,
giving light by night, cooking food and for other purposes; water, for drinking,
washing, fermentation, irrigation and many other useful purposes; the earth, for
habitation and the production of all kinds of fruit and for ministering to many
other wants. Then the clean quadrupeds minister to his pleasure and supply him
with clothing, the cattle labour for him and afford him leisure, the wild beasts
contribute the delight and terror of the chase, and so also do the reptiles;
while all things serve for the exercise of his rational powers and supplying
what is useful for man, who is the bond uniting all the creation in
friendship----who walks upon the earth, and yet flies on the wings of thought
and surveys the universe, who is upright of stature and with ease confronts face
to face the heavens as his dwelling-place, who is the king of all things on
earth and reigns along with the Lord Christ in the heavens, and becomes a
fellow-citizen of heavenly beings, and unto whom as the image of God all
creation ministers while it is under subjection to God, and preserves its
affection and gratitude towards its Creator.

<p align="center"><i>Note.</i>
</p>
<p>When on the fifth day again animals were produced from the waters, the angels
were taught that God is the Maker of this water, <A NAME="p106"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|106</SPAN></A>
which was produced simultaneously with themselves. In like manner again when
on the sixth day animals were produced from the earth, they were still more
effectively taught that God is the Maker both of animate and of inanimate
creatures. Accordingly all the angels again looked around them, gazing at all
the things made by God which had sprung into existence before their eyes in the
six days, and concluded that all things were [170] varied, and wonderful, and
fitted to excite astonishment, but among them they did not see anything like
themselves----rational and invisible and intelligent. There was here ground for
suspecting whether after all the Creator of the rational, invisible and
intelligent beings is one person, and the Creator of the objects that are
irrational, perceptible and visible, a different person. God, however, wishing
to remove this supposition of theirs, produced last of all one living being
constituted with all the natural qualities, namely, man----constituted with
reason and sensation and intelligence, and with visibility and invisibility, and
appoints him to serve as his image, which makes known that the Creator of the
universe is one. Whence the angels being lost in wonder were taught by their own
eyes through man the glory and the power and the greatness and the wisdom and
the goodness of the one and only God, and that all the elements and what had
been brought into existence after themselves had been prepared before on account
of man. With alacrity therefore did they obediently serve and minister in moving
everything that conduced to assist the image of God as being themselves members
thereof, whence again they greatly rejoice over the welldoing and the
righteousness of men, but are on the other hand greatly distressed by his
evil-doing and by his sinning, as saith also the Lord himself: <i>For there is
great joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth.</i><sup><A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A></sup>
</p>
<p>It must, however, be here observed that just as God produced first in the
sight of the angels out of non-existence the sensible, visible and non-rational
light, and afterwards that which is rational and intelligible<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> and
invisible, so also in the case of man he <A NAME="p107"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|107</SPAN></A>
made first, according to Moses, his body, and afterwards his soul. Hence it
was possible for some to fancy that if there had been another day after the six
days, God would have made some other things, but since there is not another day
after the six, he would not have been able to produce more. But God to remove
this supposition of theirs, makes also a seventh day over and above, and does no
work therein, thus showing that the world is quite finished and without any
defect left in its structure to be afterwards supplied, for if he had left such
he would have completed on the seventh day what was defective. But since nothing
had been left defective in it, he rested on the seventh day from all his works
which he had undertaken to make. Perhaps again some one will ask: Why did he
make the whole creation not in one, or two, or three, or four, or five, but in
six days? Such an one will learn this to be the truth of the matter----that,
inasmuch as the angels are rational and mutable, one day would not have sufficed
for their instruction if the whole had been produced in one day, for they would
certainly have thought that things had been confusedly brought into existence
like so many phantasms and been produced in disorder. But God Almighty having
set apart one day for each single work, in due order formed the universe in
parts, that it might be discriminated and thus better understood by the angels.
First of all on the first day after they had been produced along with the heaven
and the earth and the elements, he made the light before their eyes. On the
second day he made the firmament: on the third day he gathered together the
waters and produced from the earth trees and green herbs. On the fourth day he
adorned the heaven with the luminaries; on the fifth he produced fish and fowl
from the waters; and on the sixth he made from the earth animals and man, and
accomplished the whole of those works in the six days. On this account therefore
he made the whole world by parts in the six days for the discrimination and
instruction of the angels, who from their acute intelligence were able each day
to discriminate each separate part of the work and the Maker thereof. Whoso
wishes can hence learn that along with the heaven and the earth the angels were
also produced, because as they were present at all his works, God uttered his
voice in their presence for their instruction, saying: Let this and let that be;
but when he created the heaven and the earth he did not utter his voice <A NAME="p108"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|108</SPAN></A>
nor say: Let heaven and earth and the things in them be; for there were none
to hear and be instructed. But since in the case of all the other works, there
were present those who could be instructed, the voice was opportunely uttered.
</p>
<p>Since the angels therefore were produced along with the heaven and the earth,
the historian Moses, inspired by the Holy Spirit began his narrative with them,
as they contained the angels, saying: <i>In the beginning God made the heaven
and the earth</i>.<sup><A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A></sup><i> </i>And further the Apostle, knowing well what
pertains to man and how he is figured, in his Epistle to the Romans has placed
man, as destined in the future for heaven, superior to all, for he says: <i>And
they changed the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of
corruptible man, and of birds, and of four-footed beasts and creeping things;</i><sup><A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A></sup><i>
</i>mentioning man as superior to all, then the birds as inferior to him, then
again the four-footed beasts as inferior to the birds, and as inferior to these
again the creeping things which lurk underneath the earth, mentioning them
according to their rank in the scale of being. But further, of all the quadruped
brutes which walk upon all fours and turn their looks earthward, not one is
capable of observing the heaven with ease. In like manner with regard to
creeping things which with their whole body wriggle along the earth, not one of
these is able to observe the heaven. All birds again, being bipeds, and in
consonance with this having their legs in the middle of their body, direct their
eyes towards the earth when they are high up [172] on the wing; but when they
are standing they find it difficult to turn their eyes upwards unto the heaven.
Man alone, of all the animals on the earth, being rational and destined for
heaven, received from the Creator a figure in congruity with such a destiny. For
he is a biped, being destined to fly away and walk in heaven. In figure he is
erect, as if he were ready and destined to ascend on high.<sup><A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A></sup> And it is
easy for him to behold with his eyes both the earth and the heaven as if he were
hastening to ascend from the earth into heaven, conscious that <A NAME="p109"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|109</SPAN></A>
earthly and heavenly things were bound together through him. Moreover, all
the brute animals copulate without seeing each other face to face, and have
commerce in a brutal and shameless manner. But man alone as rational proceeds to
the act face to face, so that the pair seeing each other may embrace with
reason, modesty, and reverence, and may thankfully sing the praises of their
Maker for his goodness in giving to their nature help and mutual impulse for the
propagation and multiplication of our race. God moreover made the woman from the
man's side, because the two sides bind the whole body close together; for he
neither made her from the front of man lest the woman should exalt herself above
him, nor from his back parts that he might not exalt himself above the woman;
but from his side, as being in her nature his equal, although the man, as the
cause, is first in point of time, but not, however, in his nature itself. And
still further----since the hand always protects and guards the side to which it
belongs, so when he had made the female from the male, and the male from the
earth, God pronounced the two to be one flesh, both from the constitution of the
two sides, and from the fruit that springs from their connection. Wherefore the
fornicator sins by estranging his own flesh and sowing illegitimate progeny;
nay, he that commits adultery is ranked with the homicide, since he divides what
is one flesh, and thus perpetrates murder.
</p>
<p>Some one again may perhaps propose a question and say: Why was it that, while
all the irrational animals were created by God, male and female at the same
time, man alone was not created with the female, but remained quite solitary
until the female was made later on? To this enquirer I shall reply that since
all the animals were created by God without either the gift of reason, or the
capacity of knowing anything, while all the angels, the instant they were
created, were rational and knew the Maker of all things from those things which
had been produced, one by one, that is, in the six days, it was necessary that
man who had been created by God possessed of reason, and as the bond uniting all
the creation, should himself be taught to know the Creator of all; but since, as
he was not the first but the last of all to be produced, he could neither from
the things made before him, nor from himself know God, it was God's pleasure to
produce [173] the female not along with him, but afterwards out of him, that he
might thereby know that he who had taken out from him a <A NAME="p110"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|110</SPAN></A>
being like himself was his Creator. Wherefore also he threw him into a trance<sup><A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A></sup>
and a deep sleep, in order that by taking his rib from him without trouble and
pain as in sleep, he might by the grace of God gain a perception of what had
occurred, and celebrate the praises of his Maker, confessing and saying: <i>This
is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh</i>----<i>she shall be called
woman, because she was taken out of man.</i><sup><A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A></sup> As then the angels had
been created rational, and from the works produced in the six days had been
taught to know him who was the cause of them, so of necessity man also was
taught through the female, and learned that God was the Maker both of himself
and of the universe; but especially as he had beforehand heard God say: <i>Let
us make a helpmeet for him.</i><A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Text.</i>
</p>
<p>Then again on the seventh day, after he had revealed to Moses how the whole
world had been made, and had honoured him with such mystic visions, he then held
converse with him, and having given him the law written with the finger of God
on tables of stone, and instructed him in the knowledge of letters and made his
countenance shine with glory, he let him descend from the mountain.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Note.</i>
</p>
<p>Here men, having first received the Law from God in writing, were taught
letters and communicated them to all the nations.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Text.</i>
</p>
<p>He then afterwards directed him to construct the Tabernacle according to the
pattern which he had seen in the mountain----being a pattern, so to say, of the
whole world. He therefore made the Tabernacle, designing that as far as possible
it should be a copy of the figure of the world, and thus he gave it a length of
thirty cubits and a breadth of <A NAME="p111"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|111</SPAN></A> ten. Then, by interposing inside a veil in the middle of the Tabernacle, he
divided it into two compartments, of which the first was called the Holy Place,
and the second behind the veil the Holy of Holies. Now the outer was a pattern
of this visible world which, according to the divine Apostle, extends from the
earth to the firmament, and in which at its northern side was a table, on which
were twelve loaves, the table thus presenting a symbol of the earth which
supplies all manner of fruits, twelve namely, one as it were for each month of
the year. The table was all round wreathed with a waved moulding symbolic of the
sea which is called the ocean, and all round this again was [174] a border of a
palm's breadth emblematic of the earth beyond the ocean, where lies Paradise
away in the East, and where also the extremities of the first heaven, which is
like a vaulted chamber, are everywhere supported on the extremities of the
earth. Then at the south side he placed the candlestick which shines upon the
earth from the south to the north. In this candlestick, symbolic of the week of
seven days, he set seven lamps, and these lamps are symbolic of all the
luminaries. And the second Tabernacle which is behind the veil and called the
Holy of Holies, as well as the Ark of Testimony, and the Mercy-seat, and above
it the Cherubim of glory shadowing the Mercy-seat, are, according to the
Apostle, a type of the things in heaven from the firmament to the upper heaven,
just as the space from the veil to the wall of the inner Tabernacle constitutes
the inner place.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Note.</i>
</p>
<p>That the first historian in the world was Moses, both Eusebius, <i>the son of
</i>Pamphilus,<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> and Josephus in their writings testify; for
<sup><A NAME="p112"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|112</SPAN></A></sup> they have clearly shown that of all writers Moses was the most ancient.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Text.</i>
</p>
<p>When Moses had accordingly been instructed in letters by God, having with his
very eyes perceived the beginning of all things revealed to him, and when his
countenance had been glorified so that he could not be beheld by his people
without a veil, then as one who could claim belief and who had been glorified by
God, he, the first among men, wrote the Book of Genesis in these words: <i>In
the beginning God made the heaven and the earth</i>,<sup><A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A></sup><i> </i>showing
that when the world was created by God heaven and earth were produced at the
very beginning, comprising as they did all existing things, while all the other
creatures which he made either along with them or after them one by one, were
contained within them. Then having ended his account how all things existing
within heaven and earth had been successively created from the first day onwards
to the sixth, and having then spoken of God as having rested on the seventh day
and made nothing more, because the whole creation had been completed, and
nothing been left defective in the harmony of the world to mar its supreme
beauty, he again adds: <i>This is the book of heaven and earth; </i>thinking
these words sufficient to indicate collectively all things within heaven and
earth. And again in another place he says: <i>For in six days he finished and
rested from all his works which God had begun to make;</i><sup><A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A></sup> always
speaking to the same effect, namely, that all things are contained within heaven
and earth, and that before these seven days [175] he had made nothing whatever,
but began on the first day <A NAME="p113"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|113</SPAN></A> and finished on the sixth, and rested on the seventh without making anything
else, and that he made only two heavens, the first along with the earth, while
placing the second in the middle and preparing two states----the present and the
future----just as in the Tabernacle he had ordered two places to be formed in
imitation of the world, for he says: <i>According to the pattern shown to thee
in the mount</i>;<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A><sup><i> </i></sup>for the Apostle in his Epistle to the
Hebrews explains with regard to this Tabernacle that the outer was a pattern of
this world, and the inner of the heavens.
</p>
<p>When therefore a describer of the world so great and so divine as Moses had
been attested and glorified, in the Old Testament by God and in the New by the
Christ, while other divinely inspired prophets and apostles along with him bear
witness about all things and about the figure of the whole creation as we have
set forth in the preceding book, and they agree with him in every particular
concerning the creation itself, who can be so obtuse, so foolish, and so far led
astray, especially if he calls himself a Christian, as to disbelieve such truth
as this, confirmed by such sacred testimony, and would not rather, bending lowly
to earth, reverence the crowd of testimonies, the selection, the revelations,
the wisdom, the glory, the predictions, the astonishing signs, the great
wonders, the fulfilments of prophecies, the testimony of God himself, who spake
with Moses face to face as a friend with a friend, while in the New Testament
the Lord Christ frequently bears witness to him? In very truth, to express
myself more warmly, I assert that, unless one fights against God, he shall not
find it in his power to gainsay these things. For afterwards repenting he shall
say: the finger of God is in it; and he will confess his defeat, just as the
Egpytian enchanters and sorcerers Jannes and Jambres spoke concerning him. <A NAME="p114"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|114</SPAN></A>
Since therefore according to the great cosmographer Moses, and according to
Paul, that most divine teacher of the Church, in whom the Lord Christ speaks,
two heavens, and two only, were created by God, and not seven or eight, or nine,
how is it possible to listen to the pagans advocating views based on conjecture,
sophistries, and arrogant assumptions, and inventing fables, not from the old
but chiefly from certain recent writers, who, to meet the difficulties of their
own doctrines, have devised apologies more foolish even than the doctrines
themselves. And how can those who listen to these pagans maintain and yet be in
accordance with scripture, that there are waters above the heaven, or that the
first, the second, and the third day passed without the sun, moon and stars
running their course? Or how in the deluge of Noah did the waters cover the
whole earth and again retire? Or how can they say that there will be a final
consummation of the world----that the heavenly bodies falling will cease to run
their courses, and no longer cause the succession of day and night; and that the
present state will altogether end, and that another state will be exhibited
quite strange and far superior to this; and that the righteous will enter into
the upper heaven beyond this the visible heaven, where is the kingdom of the
heavens----the second Tabernacle called the Holy of Holies, of which the inner
place in the Tabernacle was a pattern, into which also the Lord Christ entered,
having been taken up into the heaven above the firmament, having become the
forerunner on our behalf, and having prepared for us a new and living way? Or
how can they say that, after the consummation, the seven or eight or nine
heavens, or the heaven again which is by them called the sphere, will revolve?
For what useful purpose will this revolution be? let them tell us and not grudge
us this information; or how can such persons believe the stupendous miracles of
which we have often spoken, that were wrought in the <A NAME="p115"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|115</SPAN></A>
time of the great Moses? And likewise that miracle wrought in the time of
Joshua, the son of Nun, when he made the sun and moon stand still, and added
greatly to the length of the day, until he put the enemy to rout? And that other
miracle performed in the time of Hezekiah, the going back of the sun ten
degrees, which struck the Babylonian with consternation and induced him to send
an embassy to Hezekiah?
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Note.</i>
</p>
<p>Some have said that up to the present day a feast is celebrated by the
Persians to Mithras, that is, the sun,<A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> in commemoration of the sign
in the time of Hezekiah.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Text.</i>
</p>
<p>Why need I speak of the all-devouring fire in the time of Nebuchodonosor,
which burnt the bonds of the three children, but did not consume so much as a
hair of their head, or any of their garments? Or of the renowned Elijah, who in
a chariot of fire sped his way through heaven, who raised the dead, and who by
his word withheld rain for two and forty months? Or of his disciple Elisha, who
threw the wood into the water and brought back iron, and whose dust raised up
the dead? In like manner why should I speak of the miracles wrought under the
Lord Christ: his marvellous birth from a virgin; the attestation of the Star
that then appeared; the adoration of the Magi; the good tidings brought with joy
to the shepherds by the angels; the doxology of the whole angelic host; the
prayer of Simeon conjoined with the giving of thanks; the confession of Anna;
the first miracle of Christ himself in Cana of Galilee, who at a marriage
miraculously provided a liberal supply of wine for drinking; the giving of sight
to the eyes of the man born blind, by clay wrought with spittle; [177] <A NAME="p116"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|116</SPAN></A>
the restoration to life of Lazarus after he had been four days dead and his
intestines were stinking; the host of opposing demons trembling at his power and
exclaiming: <i>Thou hast come before the time to torment us</i><sup><A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A></sup><i>;</i>
the command and the bridle imposed on the raging sea; the walking upon the
surface of the waves, when he invited Peter to walk with him upon them; and when
Peter was seized with distrust and began to sink and cried out: <i>Lord, save
me! </i><sup><A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A> </sup>his drawing him up from the deep, and his again going with
him and placing him safe and sound in the boat; the eclipse of the sun at the
time of the Passion which continued for three hours, and that too in the
fourteenth day of the moon: an occurrence quite contrary to worldly philosophy,
for according to the adepts therein an eclipse cannot result except at the time
of new moon; the quaking of the earth, the rending of the rocks and of the veil
of the temple? But passing over all the other miracles which cannot now
conveniently be enumerated, I hasten to speak of the resurrection itself, which
is the renovation of men and of all the world; the gift of incorruption,
immortality and immutability bestowed by God upon the whole world; of the ascent
again of men into heaven, into which the first who entered in flesh was the Lord
Christ; of the shadows of the Apostles which gave strength to the weak; of the
rapture of the Apostle Paul even into the third heaven,<sup><A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A> </sup>that is, to
a third of the distance of the height of heaven from the earth----namely, as far
as the firmament; then his rapture into Paradise where he was privileged to be
the <A NAME="p117"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|117</SPAN></A> hearer of the unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
All which things are marvellous and transcend our nature or our state.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Another Note.</i>
</p>
<p>In the days of Joshua, the son of Nun, the sun stood still. In the days of
Hezekiah, through the agency of Isaiah, it went back. At the Passion of the
Christ, contrary to the law of the pagan philosophers, it was altogether
eclipsed. The credentials of the prophets and Apostles and of Christ himself are
great and amazing miracles, and the prophecies; while Plato and Aristotle,
Ptolemy and the others, challenge our belief on the ground of their knowledge of
eclipses of the sun and moon derived from calculations ---- if even thus they
speak what is true.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Text.</i>
</p>
<p>The occurrence of these marvels prepared the men of those days to place
belief in the prophecies also, while the fulfilments of the prophecies prepare
ourselves to believe in the signs and in all things of which the prophets spake,
as was the case also in the time of the Lord Christ, who in those days when he
had come down from the Mount of Olives, and beheld Jerusalem and wept over it as
it lay opposite, said: <i>How often would I have gathered thy children even as a
hen </i>[178] <i>gathereth her chickens under her wing, and ye would not.
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.</i><sup><A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A></sup><i> </i>Then when
he had passed sentence on the temple, his disciples who were still under the
influence of Judaic sentiment were sorrow-struck; and scripture afterwards says:
<i>When descending from the Mount they showed him the building of the temple,</i><sup><A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A></sup><i>
</i>in order no doubt that they might move him to pity, and that he might recall
what he had said with regard to the temple, for they knew and believed that
everything spoken by him would come to pass. But he knowing [what would be] said
to them: <i>Do you see all these things? Verily, I</i> <A NAME="p118"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|118</SPAN></A>
<i>say unto you, there shall not be left here one stone, upon another that
shall not be thrown down.</i><sup><A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A></sup> Then were they possessed with fear,
and remained silent, and said nothing further on this matter. Accordingly
thereafter came the Romans, and levelled with the ground the temple and the
city, and made it an utter desolation, executing as if by compact what had been
commanded by the Lord. And up to this day we see with our very eyes that lo! for
more than five hundred years it has lain so desolate that it cannot be
renovated. Moreover he said to his disciples: <i>Be of good cheer, I have
overcome the world.</i><sup><A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A></sup><i> </i>And again: <i>The gates of hell shall
not prevail against the church;</i><sup><A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A></sup><i> </i>and again he declares
that all the world shall be filled with his doctrine, even as the three measures
of meal, in which the woman hid the leaven, were all leavened throughout and
made one by that leaven. And again: <i>The Gospel shall be preached throughout
the whole world:</i><sup><A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A></sup> and along with it shall the woman too be told
of who did him a kindness----and we see that all these predictions have been
fulfilled. For the Christians who were at one time persecuted by the Greeks and
Jews have conquered, and drawn their persecutors over to their own side. In like
manner we see that the Church has never been destroyed, but that its adherents
have been greatly multiplied, and that similarly the whole earth has been filled
with the doctrine of the Lord Christ, and is still being filled, and that the
gospel is preached throughout all the world. This I avouch to be the veritable
fact, from what I have seen and heard in the many places which I have visited.
</p>
<p>Even in Taproban&ecirc;,<A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A> an island in Further India, where the Indian
sea is, there is a Church of Christians, with clergy <A NAME="p119"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|119</SPAN></A>
and a body of believers, but I know not whether there be any Christians in
the parts beyond it. In the country called Mal&ecirc;,<A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A> where the pepper
grows, there is also a church, and at another place called Calliana<A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
there is moreover a bishop, who is appointed from Persia.<A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A> In the
island, again, called the Island of Dioscorid&ecirc;s,<A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A> which is situated
in the same Indian sea, and where the inhabitants speak Greek, having been
originally colonists sent thither by the Ptolemies who succeeded Alexander the
Macedonian, there [179] are clergy who receive their ordination in Persia, and
are sent on to the island, and there is also a multitude of Christians. I sailed
along the coast of this island, but did not land upon it. I met, however, with
some of its Greek-speaking people who had come over into Ethiopia.<A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
And <A NAME="p120"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|120</SPAN></A> so likewise among the Bactrians and Huns and Persians, and the rest of the
Indians, Persarmenians, and Medes and Elamites, and throughout the whole land of
Persia there is no limit to the number of churches with bishops and very large
communities of Christian people, as well as many martyrs, and monks also living
as hermits. So too in Ethiopia and Ax&ocirc;m, and in all the country about it; among
the people of Happy Arabia----who are now called Homerites----through all Arabia
and Palestine, Phoenicia, and all Syria and Antioch as far as Mesopotamia; among
the Nubians and the Garamantes,<A HREF="#49"><SUP>49</SUP></A> in Egypt, Libya, Pentapolis,<A HREF="#50"><SUP>50</SUP></A>
Africa<A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A> and Mauretania, as far as southern Gadeira,<sup><A HREF="#52"><SUP>52</SUP></A> </sup>there
are everywhere churches of the Christians, and bishops, martyrs, monks and
recluses, where the Gospel of Christ is proclaimed. So likewise again in
Cilicia, Asia, Cappadocia, Lazica<A HREF="#53"><SUP>53</SUP></A> and Pontus, and in the northern
<A NAME="p121"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|121</SPAN></A> countries occupied by the Scythians, Hyrcanians, Heruli,<sup><A HREF="#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A> </sup>Bulgarians,
Greeks<A HREF="#55"><SUP>55</SUP></A> and Illyrians, Dalmatians, Goths, Spaniards, Romans, Franks,
and other nations, as far as Gadeira on the ocean towards the northern parts,
there are believers and preachers of the Gospel confessing the resurrection from
the dead; and so we see the prophecies being fulfilled over the whole world.<A HREF="#56"><SUP>56</SUP></A>
</p>
<p>Among the famous philosophers who flourished among the pagans, which of them,
Socrates, or Pythagoras, or Plato, or Aristotle, or any other, was held worthy
to foretell or announce any thing of such advantage to the world as the
resurrection of the dead, and the free gift to men of the Kingdom of Heaven,
which cannot be shaken? For they can announce nothing except only that, by means
of calculations and secular learning, they declare when eclipses of the sun and
the moon will occur, whereby, even if they predict them truly----as in fact they
do----no benefit will accrue to the world, but rather the evil of pride; while
should they say nothing about them they will do no manner of harm. For what boy
who learns arithmetic will be found ignorant of this knowledge? or what old
woman or country-bred yokel has not an acquaintance with some of the works and
ways of nature? or what nation or what barbarian knows not these
things----astronomy I mean, and geometry and the various practical arts,
medicine, carpentry, stone-cutting, weaving, smithwork, agriculture, and others
of which the Greeks have no conception? or what nation <A NAME="p122"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|122</SPAN></A>
between east and west, between north and south, that believes in Christ, does
not by various methodical calculations fix for many years beforehand when the
Easter festivals are to be celebrated? In fact, they correctly determine the
dates in advance, since they all with one consent, from one end of the earth to
the other, on one and the same day, celebrate Easter according to their
different calculations and methods of computing the time.
</p>
<p>For since God has endowed man with wisdom and reason he has rendered him
capable of finding out whatever mind can attain to, and whatever he can acquire
from education; for such is the nature of that rational animal----man. For when
the men of early times had invented an art, they made many mistakes; but
afterwards either they or their successors rectified these mistakes under the
teaching of experience, time and practice. In like manner those who received the
art from them firmly retained what had been transmitted to them. On the other
hand the divine teachings, be they doctrines or be they arts, are not in this
manner brought to perfection by human intelligence; but being at first given by
God, one receives them with full assurance, even as did those whom God inspired
with wisdom for the preparation of the Tabernacle in the time of Moses, namely,
Besele&ecirc;l himself the son of Urias, the son of &Ocirc;r, of the tribe of Judah, and
Eliab, the son of Achisamach of the tribe of Dan, and all to whom he gave
understanding, and filled with the Spirit of God and knowledge to devise all
manner of workmanship, both of carpentry and of working in gold and silver and
brass----and blue and purple and scarlet thread, and fine twined linen----and
stonework and woodwork, according to all the works which the Lord commanded them
to make for the Tabernacle of testimony, both the Ark of the Covenant and the
Mercy-seat over it, and the furniture of the Tabernacle, its altar and its table
and all its vessels, and the laver and <A NAME="p123"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|123</SPAN></A>
its base, and the official robes of Aaron and his sons when ministering as
priests before God, and the anointing oil and the sacred incense composed of
sweet aromatics, according to all things which God commanded him to make. And
beyond question you will find that up to this very day the most of these arts
are most zealously cultivated among the Jews.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Note.</i>
</p>
<p>When the first man had sinned and had come to a sense of his [181]
transgression, and was fittingly convicted thereof by God and filled with
confusion and shame, he began to consider next by what contrivance he could
cover his nakedness, and being stimulated by God to exert his faculty of reason,
he invented the art of sewing, and with the thorns of shrubs stitched together
for himself leaves of the fig tree. And being at the same time instructed by God
as to the preparation of tunics, he learned to make them from the bark of trees.<A HREF="#57"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
It is attested by scripture that Cain discovered the art or science of
agriculture, and Abel that of the keeping of sheep. Then again, when Cain after
the murder of his brother had been cast out by God, as it is written: <i>Cain
went out from the presence of God and dwelt in the land of Na&iuml;n.</i><A HREF="#58"><SUP>58</SUP></A>
as much as to say, that Cain was cast out by God and banished from his home
to a wretched country, for they thought that Paradise was God's dwelling-place,
as he was wont to go forth therefrom and ofttimes showed himself there. The sons
therefore of S&ecirc;th who lived near Paradise, and were so to speak under God's
care, and ofttimes conversed with him, were always called the sons of God, while
the sons of Cain who were settled somewhere far away from Paradise, and were not
constantly under the care of God, but lived in a wild and wretched country, and
were under their own care rather than God's, were called the sons of men. Since
Cain therefore and his offspring lived in fear, they invented other arts for
their security, as, for instance, carpentry, <A NAME="p124"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|124</SPAN></A>
stone-cutting, metallurgy and music. Carpentry----for making tents and doors
and roofs for the protection of themselves and their cattle; masonry----for
building houses and cities by way of providing for their safety and defence;
metallurgy----for the tilling of the soil, and breaking it up with the
ploughshare, and reaping the crops with hooks, and for making flutes and many
other articles; lastly----music to keep them awake by night with the flute and
the lyre and the singing of songs, and to protect themselves and their cattle
from the attacks of wild beasts. So then they lived on in fear, and in exile
they devised all kinds of expedients to ensure their safety, for scripture thus
speaks of them, saying of Cain: <i>And he built a city and named it Enoch after
the name of his son;</i><A HREF="#59"><SUP>59</SUP></A><i> </i>then of Thobel (Tubal), the son of
Lamech by Ada, it says: <i>He was the father of such as dwell in the tents of
shepherds;</i><A HREF="#60"><SUP>60</SUP></A><i> </i>and of Jubal, the brother of Thobel, it says: <i>It
was he who taught the use of the psaltery and harp.</i><A HREF="#61"><SUP>61</SUP></A> <i>
</i>Scripture
speaks also of metallurgy when it says concerning Thobel whom Sella (Zillah)
bare: <i>He was the forger of cutting instruments of brass and iron.</i><A HREF="#62"><SUP>62</SUP></A>
</p>
<p>[182] God having thus from the first given man ingenuity, fitted him to
invent arts, and while the first men at the outset invented them, their
successors, starting from where they left off, by dint of assiduous practice,
brought them to greater perfection. It will be well therefore if we here take up
an argument against those sophists who say that the world is eternal and without
beginning, and remind them how far they are in error, understanding neither from
the things themselves ----namely, from the arts, that it is not eternal and
without beginning, but of recent production. For if the arts were discovered
gradually, and all human society subsists through art and rational science, how
is it possible for the world to subsist without art and rational science? For
without the art of stone-cutting, how can houses, fortifications and cities be
reared for the protection of men and civic communities? In like manner, without
the art of weaving, whence could men obtain coverings sufficient to protect them
from cold and from frost. In like manner, were there not an art of working in
metals, how would <A NAME="p125"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|125</SPAN></A> it be possible for men to till the soil, and break up the earth with ploughs,
or reap the crops with sickles, in order to provide themselves with food? If
again there was no art of medicine, how could the sufferings to which men are
liable be cured and their illnesses be mitigated?
</p>
<p>From all this it is quite manifest that the world is not eternal, but a
recent production, just like the inventions and the arts and the sciences of
men. For where will they find among astronomers one equal to or greater than
Ptolemy; or among philosophers, than Plato and Aristotle; or what greater
geometricians and arithmeticians will they find than Euclid and Archimedes, who
alone discovered the quadrature of the circle?<sup><A HREF="#63"><SUP>63</SUP></A> </sup>But if these learned
men were more exact than their predecessors, is it not most manifest that the
arts were gradually discovered through the ingenuity which was bestowed by God
upon men? Wherefore also the scripture, referring everything to God, exclaims: <i>All
wisdom is from God.</i><A HREF="#64"><SUP>64</SUP></A> <i> </i>They are therefore either liars or
consummate fools in supposing the world to be eternal, when they are convicted
of being in error by actual facts. But sacred scripture speaks more truly when
it says: <i>In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.</i><A HREF="#65"><SUP>65</SUP></A>
I should like again to put to those wise men this question: since the
hammer, the anvil and the forceps precede the entire art of metallurgy, who was
it prepared these instruments? Let them tell us and not begrudge us a reply.
They, however, not having the sense to take refuge in God, the maker of the
universe, who endowed the race of mankind with wisdom, and gave them the faculty
of invention, but wishing after the ways of their own heart to construct and to
demolish theories, on finding themselves beset with difficulties and the most
formidable perplexities of reasoning, presume next to declare that the world is
eternal and had no beginning, for such assertions show to what straits they are
reduced. How hard, for instance, are they pressed both with respect to man and
bird, since the one is produced from seed and the others from eggs; and if this
opinion of theirs is true, the question arises did men and birds ----the
products respectively of seed and of eggs----exist at the same <A NAME="p126"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|126</SPAN></A>
[183] time with God, or did they not? And if they did exist, the seed and the
eggs will of necessity be found existing before God, and before men and birds;
but if they did not exist they must submit to divine scripture, when it informs
us through Moses: <i>God said, Let us make man in our image, </i>and through the
Apostle at Athens on the Areopagus [tells us what we read in Acts xvii, 24-28].
So then, as has already been said, the sons of Seth, those namely who are called
the sons of God, went in against the will of God but in obedience to their own
self-will, to the daughters of men ----that is, to the women of the race of
Cain----and joined themselves to them in marriage. Wherefore God, taking
occasion from this, made a new dispensation and destroyed those who had sinned
by means of the Deluge, but him that was righteous he preserved by the Ark, and
transferred to this earth of ours, which was a better one and almost equal to
Paradise.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Text.</i>
</p>
<p>But to continue,----the divine doctrines, the structure of the world, and the
prophecies cannot possibly be explained unless one learn them from divine
revelation, or receive them from men divinely inspired, the Prophets themselves,
and the Apostles, and all divinely inspired scripture; for it is impossible to
acquire such learning from conjectures or arrogant assumptions or human wisdom.
But that the structure of the world coincides with the doctrine of the
Christians, the whole of divine scripture, as has been said, proclaims, namely,
Moses and the Prophets, the Lord Christ and the Apostles, as we have repeatedly
explained. For God divided the one place which extends from the earth to the
higher heaven by interposing in the middle the second heaven, and thus made two
places; and to this mortal and mutable state he assigned the lower place, and to
the immortal and immutable state the higher, which is called also the Kingdom of
Heaven, and about which the Lord Christ speaks thus in the Gospel of Matthew: <i>For
in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage,</i> <A NAME="p127"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|127</SPAN></A>
<i>but are as the angels of God in heaven;</i><sup><A HREF="#66"><SUP>66</SUP></A></sup> and again: <i>He
shall to those on the right hand say</i>----<i>Come, ye blessed of my father,
inherit the kingdom prepared for you before the </i>[184] <i>found-ation of the
world,</i><sup><A HREF="#67"><SUP>67</SUP></A></sup><i> </i>as if he should say prepared from that time; [see
also] John xii, 32; Matt, xiv, 40; viii, 11, 12; Heb. iv, 11; Philipp iii, 20;
Rom. viii, 17; Ephes. ii, 6; Philipp. iii, 14; Galat. iv, 26; Heb. iii, I;
Ephes. ii, 19; Heb. xi, 9, 10; <i>Ibid, </i>v, 16; <i>Ibid, </i>xii, 22-24; <i>Ibid,
</i>xiii, 14; Luke xxiv, 51; Acts i, 10, 11; Heb. ix, 24; <i>Ibid.</i>[185]<i> </i>vii,
26; <i>Ibid, </i>vi, 18-20; <i>Ibid, </i>x, 19, 23.
</p>
<p>Can any one then be so infatuated, so lost in misery as to disbelieve such
promises and such true prophecies, which both from the two places created in the
beginning and made ready so to speak by God from the foundation of the world,
and from such preparations are shown to be true and in harmony with the doctrine
of the Christians? And this with regard both to the principles and the ends,
namely, that when God had set apart the present mortal and mutable state of
existence for the exercise of the reasoning faculty, and had led it through its
trial, he at last releases the world from its toil and discipline, and reveals
the future state, graciously bestowing everlasting benefits, exemption from
penury and the sway of the passions, immortality, incorruption, immutability,
perfect knowledge, righteousness, sanctification, redemption and blessedness for
evermore, Amen! For the present state will not remain for ever, as the pagans
are foolish enough to assert, supposing that God delights in evil, or rather
that he is deficient in power or gives grudgingly, so that he is unable to grant
the world release from its struggles and from corruption; yea, that day after
day he adds destruction and sufferings, and death and trials, and is not strong
enough to give the prizes of contests, or to award crowns, <A NAME="p128"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|128</SPAN></A>
or to bring the toils with which men are exercised to an end. For as they
suppose him to be merely the artificer who shapes the material which he has at
his command, so even now they suppose that he is not able to make it better,
disbelieving the resurrection of the body as a thing impossible, and
disbelieving also the whole of divine scripture. Wherefore those miserable men
admit the spherical form of the heaven to be true, disbelieving, yea, rather
execrating, the whole of divine scripture, and turning away from the truth as
from old wives' fables. Far however be it from us to boast except in the whole
of divine scripture, through which the outside world is crucified to us and we
to the outside world. Be it ours, O most [186] pious Father Pamphilus, along
with a good life, to embrace the divine oracles, and to repudiate those of our
adversaries, according to the will of Him that is mighty, and by the help of
Christ the saviour of us all, with whom to the Father, together with his holy
and adorable Spirit, be glory now and evermore, world without end.----Amen!&nbsp;

Abode of Bliss. </i>A description is given of it in c. 30 of the <i>Peripl&ucirc;s </i>of
the Erythraean Sea, which was writtten about the middle of the first century. It
is described as &quot;of great extent but d&eacute;sert, and very moist, and as having
but a scanty population, which was settled on its north side, and consisted of
an intermixture of foreigners----Arabs, Indians, and even Greeks----engaged in
commerce.&quot; The people of the interior are still of distinct race, with
curly hair, Indian complexion, and regular features, while the coast people are
of mixed descent. Abulfeda says the people were Nestorian Christians and
pirates, but the late Sir H. Yule says that &quot;some indications point rather
to a connection of the island's Christianity with the Jacobite or Abyssinian
church. Thus they practised circumcision .... and De Barros calls them Jacobite
Christians of the Abyssinian stock. Barbosa speaks of them .... as Christian
only in name, having neither baptism nor Christian knowledge .... Now not a
trace of former Christianity can be discovered, and the social state of the
people could scarcely be lower.&quot; See his edition of <i>The Book of Ser
