<p align="center"><b>Gregory Thaumaturgus, Homily concerning the Holy Mother of
God.&nbsp; The Expositor 5th series vol.3 (1896) pp.161-173</b></p>
<hr>

<h3 align="center"><i>ON AN ANTE-NICENE HOMILY OF GREGORY THAUMATURGUS.</i></h3>
<h3 align="center"><i>NOTE OF TRANSLATOR </i>(<i>F. C. CONYBEARE</i>).</h3>
<p>[The following Armenian homily of Gregory Thaumaturgus was printed for the
first time in the journal called <i>Ararat, </i>of the convent of Etschmiadzin,
for September, 1895. It is unknown in Greek. The text so printed, and here
translated, is contained in an old book of homilies in the Etschmiadzin library.
It is also found in a MS. of San Lazaro, Djarrentir, No. 3; but apparently
without title.</p>
<p>It is quite in the style of the other homilies ascribed to this father. These
are by some (<i>e.g., </i>Harnack, <i>Altchristliche Literatur bis Eusebius, </i>p.
431) accounted spurious. Why I cannot understand; for they are found, whether in
Greek, or in Syriac, or in Armenian, with the constant ascription to this
Gregory. Why should a later age have forged an entire series of homilies and
ascribed them to him? <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> If they were <i>Tentenzschriften,
i.e., </i>homilies written with a certain and marked doctrinal bias of some
kind, their forgery would be intelligible. But they cannot be accused of being
this. They are just the pious and rather rhetorical outpourings of a devout and
simple mind.</p>
<p>This homily may therefore be accepted as an example of the Pulpit eloquence
of this Gregory. About the middle of the third century it must have stirred some
congregation in Neo-Caesarea. It is very florid, and in its refrains more like a
hymn than a sermon. To a modern reader it must needs appear a rather tawdry
effort. But the image of Christ as Spring in &sect;26 in a measure redeems the whole
piece, and some other thoughts as well are prettily worked out. <A NAME="p162"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|162</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Armenian is often obscure, and contains several compounds not otherwise
known. I have rendered it quite literally. It was made from Greek. For
convenience I have broken it up into sections, adding in square brackets the few
words required here and there to make grammar or sense.----F. C. C]</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Homily of St. Gregory the Wonder-worker, concerning the
Holy Mother of God, ever-virgin.</b></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>1.</SPAN>&nbsp;When I remember the
disobedience of Eve, I weep. But when I view the fruit of Mary, I am again
renewed. Deathless by descent, invisible through beauty, before the ages light
of light; of God the Father wast Thou begotten; being Word and Son of God, Thou
didst take on flesh from Mary Virgin, in order that Thou mightest renew afresh
Adam fashioned by Thy holy hand.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>2.</SPAN>&nbsp;Holy, deathless,
eternal, inaccessible, without change, without turn, True Son of God art Thou
before the ages; yet wast pleased to be conceived and formed in the womb of the
Holy Virgin, in order that Thou mightest make alive once more man first
fashioned by Thy holy hand, but dead through sin.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>3.</SPAN>&nbsp;By the good pleasure
Thou didst issue forth, by the good pleasure and will of the invisible Father.
Wherefore we all invoke Thee, calling Thee King. Be Thou our succour; Thou that
wast born of the Virgin and wrapt in swaddling clothes and laid in the manger,
and wast suckled by Mary; to the end that Thou mightest make alive once more the
first-created Adam that was dead through sin.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>4.</SPAN>&nbsp;Feasted with
knowledge from the Divine knowledge, let us emit like a fountain the sweetly
sounding hymns of praise; let us glorify the sweet powers of the Divine Word.
With sweetly sounding doctrine let us send forth praise worthy of the Divine
grace; forasmuch as earth, and sea, and all created things, visible and
invisible, bless and <A NAME="p163"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|163</SPAN></A> glorify God's
love for man; for that His majesty was among [us]. For being God He appeared in
the flesh, and taking on Himself extreme humility, was born of the Holy Virgin,
to the end that He might renew afresh him that was dead through disobedience.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>5.</SPAN>&nbsp;Turn ye, O
congregations, and come. Let us all praise Him that is born of the Virgin. For
that being the glory and image before the ages of the Godhead, He yet became a
fellow-sufferer with us of poverty. Being the exceeding magnifical power [and]
image of God, He took on the form of a slave. He that putteth on the light as a
garment, consorted with men as one that is vile. He that is hymned by cherubim
and by myriad angels, as a citizen on earth doth He live.<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> He that
being before (all) maketh all creation alive, was born of the Holy Virgin, in
order that He might make alive once more the first created.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C6"></A>6.</SPAN>&nbsp;Christ our God took
on [Himself] to begin life as man (<i>lit. </i>the beginning of humanity), being
yet a sharer of the [life] without beginning of God the Father; in order to lift
up unto the beginningless beginning of the Godhead man that was fallen.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C7"></A>7.</SPAN>&nbsp;And He took the form
of a slave from the Holy Virgin, in order to call us up to the glorified
dominical image. He put on the outward shape made of clay, that He might make
[us] sharers of the heavenly form. He sat in the lap of the Holy Virgin, that He
might place us on the right hand in the intimacy of His Father. In a vile body
was He; and by means of the same He was laid in a tomb, that He might manifest
us heirs of eternal life. In the womb of the Holy Virgin was He, the
incomprehensible (<i>or </i>inaccessible) one, confined; in order that He might
renew the Adam destroyed through sin.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C8"></A>8.</SPAN>&nbsp;Power of the Father
and living font, Christ our God, [He] is the life-fraught mystery, in whom even
through <A NAME="p164"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|164</SPAN></A> [His] living voice we
believed; life without end He freely bestows on those who hope in Him, and with
the Spirit of grace He illumines the races of men. From this fountain, living
and ever-flowing and of sweet taste, whosoever in faith are athirst are filled
and sated.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C9"></A>9.</SPAN>&nbsp;Wherefore even with one voice [let us sing the praises] of God
the Word, that according to the worthiness of each is cause and promoter of
salvation, unto young men and old, and unto children and women. For from Mary,
the divine fountain of the ineffable Godhead, gushes forth grace and free gift
of the Holy Spirit. From a single Holy Virgin the Pearl of much price proceeded,
in order to make alive once more the first-created man that was dead through
sin.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C10"></A>10.</SPAN>&nbsp;He is the Sun of Righteousness, dawning upon earth; and in
the fashion of a man He deigned to come unto our race. Having hidden in the
coarse matter of humanity the effulgent splendour of His Godhead, and having
filled [us] with the Divine Spirit, He hath also made us worthy to sing unto Him
the angelic hymn of praise.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C11"></A>11.</SPAN>&nbsp;Let us twine, as with a wreath, the souls (or selves) [of
them that love the festival and love to hearken] <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> with golden
blossoms, fain to be crowned with wreaths from the unfading gardens; and
offering in our hands the fair-fruited flowers of Christ, let us gather [them].
For the God-like temple of the Holy Virgin is meet to be glorified with such a
crown; because the illumining Pearl cometh forth, to the end that it may raise
up again into the ever-streaming light them that were gone down into darkness
and the shadow of death.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C12"></A>12.</SPAN>&nbsp;Regaled with the medicine (<i>lit. </i>poison) of the Divine
words of Christ unto the grace of the same, let us send up unto Him some worthy
hymn. Let us hasten to gather up <A NAME="p165"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|165</SPAN></A> the fruits of the mystery of immortality. Let us hasten to inhale the perfume
of the God-clad symmetry (<i>or </i>harmony). In [our] language let us luxuriate
in the Divine grace, and let us hasten to drive away from us the foul odour of
sin. Let us rather clothe us in the sweet savour of the works of righteousness.
Having put on ourselves the breastplate of faith, and the garb of a virtuous
life, and the holy and spotless raiment of purity, let us fast (<i>or? </i>keep
guard). For He is excellence, and hath His dwelling with peace, and is
yoke-fellow of love and consorteth [therewith]; a blossom smelling of hope. And
the lambs which in faith browse upon this shoot forth the light-like rod of the
Trinity. But we, O my friends, resorting to the garden of the Saviour, let us
praise the Holy Virgin; saying along with the angels in the language of Divine
grace, &quot;Rejoice thou and be glad.&quot; For from her first shone forth the
eternally radiant light, that lighteth us with its goodness.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C13"></A>13.</SPAN>&nbsp;The Holy Virgin is herself both an honourable temple of God and a shrine
made pure, and a golden altar of whole burnt offerings. By reason of her
surpassing purity [she is] the Divine incense of oblation<i> ( = <span class="Greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03B8;&#x1F73;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span></i>),<i>
</i>and oil of the holy grace, and a precious vase bearing in itself the true
nard; [yea and] the priestly diadem revealing the good pleasure of God, whom she
alone approacheth holy in body and soul. [She is] the door which looks eastward,
and by the comings in and goings forth the whole earth is illuminated. The
fertile olive from which the Holy Spirit took the fleshly slip (<i>or </i>twig)
of the Lord, and saved the suffering race of men. She is the boast of virgins,
and the joy of mothers; the declaration of archangels, even as it was spoken:
&quot;Be thou glad and rejoice, the Lord with thee&quot;; and again, &quot;from
thee&quot;; in order that He may make new once more the dead through sin. <A NAME="p166"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|166</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C14"></A>14.</SPAN>&nbsp;Thou didst allow her to remain a virgin, and wast pleased, O
Lord, to lie in the Virgin's womb, sending in advance the archangel to announce
it [to her]. But he from above, from the ineffable hosts, came unto Mary, and
first heralded to her the tidings: &quot;Be thou glad and rejoice.&quot; And he
also added, &quot;The Lord with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb.&quot; But she was in tumult, and pondered in her mind
what sort of tidings was this. But then in seemly fashion, I ween, the grace
chose out the Holy Virgin; for she was wise in all ways, nor was there her like
among women of all nations.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C15"></A>15.</SPAN>&nbsp;Not as the first virgin did she, being alone in the garden,
with loose and effeminate thought accept the advice of the serpent and destroy
the thought of her heart; through whom came all the toil and sorrow of the
saint. But such was the Holy Virgin that by her the former's transgressions also
were rectified. Nor, like Sarah, when she had good tidings that she would bear a
son, did she rashly laugh; nor like Rebekah, who, with the temper of a deserter,
accepted the ornaments, and willingly gave water to drink unto the camels of her
betrothed. And unlike all other women, she did not accept the grace of greeting
indiscreetly (<i>or </i>without testing it), but only through thought bright and
clear (<i>or </i>through glittering thought).</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C16"></A>16.</SPAN>&nbsp;Whence then dost thou bring with thee to us such a blessing?
and [out] of what treasure-houses has been sent to us the Pearl of the Word? I
would fain know what is the gift, and who is bearer of the Word, or indeed who
is the sender thereof. From heaven thou earnest, the form of man thou
displayest, and dost radiate forth a blaze (<i>or </i>torch) of light.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C17"></A>17.</SPAN>&nbsp;These things in herself the Holy Virgin asked in doubt. But
the angel with such words as these solved her <A NAME="p167"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|167</SPAN></A>
doubts: &quot;The Holy Spirit shall come unto thee, and the power of the Most
High shall overshadow thee. Wherefore thou shalt conceive and shalt bear a Son,
and shalt call His name Jesus, unto the end that He save the race of men from
the death of sin.&quot;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C18"></A>18.</SPAN>&nbsp;The Virgin spake in turn unto the angel: My mind swims in thy
words as in a sea. How shall this be unto me? for I desire not to know an
earthly man, because I have devoted myself to the heavenly Bridegroom. I desire
to remain a virgin. I wish not to betray the honour of my virginity.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C19"></A>19.</SPAN>&nbsp;Again in such words as these the angel confirmed the holy
Virgin: Fear not, Mary. For 'tis not to frighten thee I came, but to dispel all
thought of fear. Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found grace at God's hands. Scan
not too narrowly the grace, since it deigns not to give way to the laws of
nature. The Holy Spirit shall come unto thee; wherefore that which is born of
thee is holy and Son of God, sharer of the form and sharer of the substance, and
sharer of the eternity of the Father; in whom the Father, having acquired all
manifestations, hath the adumbration (? of Himself) face to face,<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
and by means of the light the glory gleameth forth.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C20"></A>20.</SPAN>&nbsp;Great is the mystery. Thou hast learned, O Mary, that which till
now was hidden from angels. Thou hast known that which deaf prophets and
patriarchs heard not; and thou hast heard that which the choirs of the God-clad
were not ever held worthy to hear. David and Isaiah, and all the prophets
foretold in their preaching about the Lord's becoming man. But do thou alone, O
Holy Virgin, receive the mystery unknown by them, and learn and be not perplexed
as to how this shall be unto thee. For He that fashioned man out of virgin soil,
the Selfsame shall even now do as. He will for the salvation of His creature. <A NAME="p168"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|168</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C21"></A>21.</SPAN>&nbsp;New radiance now of eternal light gleams forth for us in the
inspired fitness (<i>or </i>harmony) of these words. Now is it meet and fitting
for me to wonder after the manner of the Holy Virgin, to whom in seemly wise
before all things the angel gave salutation thus: &quot;Be thou glad and
rejoice&quot;; because with her are quickened and live, all the treasures of
grace. Among all nations she alone was both virgin and mother and without
knowledge of man, holy in body and soul. Among all nations she alone was made
worthy to bring forth God; alone she carried in her Him <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
who carries
along all by His word.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C22"></A>22.</SPAN>&nbsp;And not only is it meet to marvel at the beauty of the Holy Mother
of God, but also at the excellence of her spirit. Wherefore were addressed to
her the words: &quot;The Lord with thee&quot;; and again also, &quot;The Lord
from thee.&quot; As if this: &quot; He will save him that is in His image as
being pitiful.&quot; As purse of the Divine mystery the Holy Virgin made herself
ready, in which the Pearl of Life was enveloped in flesh and sealed; and she
also became the receptacle of supramundane and Divine salvation.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C23"></A>23.</SPAN>&nbsp;Therefore let us also come, O my friends, and discharge our debt
according to our ability; and following the voice of the archangel, let us cry
aloud: &quot;Be thou glad and rejoice; the Lord with thee.&quot; Nor any
heavenly bridegroom He, but the very Lord Himself, the Father of purity and the
guardian of virginity, and the Lord of holiness, the creator of inviolability,
and the giver of freedom, overseer of salvation, and ordainer of true wisdom and
bestower thereof----the Lord Himself with thee; for as much as even in thee the
Divine grace reposed [and] upon thee, in order to make alive the race of men
like a compassionate Lord.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C24"></A>24.</SPAN>&nbsp;Not any more doth Adam fear the crafty serpent;
<A NAME="p169"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|169</SPAN></A> because our Lord is come and hath dispersed the host of the enemy. Not any
more doth the race of men fear the craftiness and mad deceit of the serpent,
because the Lord hath bruised the head of the dragon in the water of baptism.
Not any more do I fear to hear the words: Dust thou wast, and unto dust shalt
thou be turned. For the Lord in baptism hath washed away the stain of sin. Not
any more do I weep, nor ever lament, nor ever reckon it again to wretchedness,
when the thorns wound me. For our Lord hath plucked out by the roots the sins
which are our thorns,<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> and hath crowned His head withal. Loosed is
the first curse in which He said: Thorns and thistles shall earth bring forth to
thee, for the thorn is plucked out by the roots, and the thistle withered up;
and from the Holy Virgin hath shot up the tree of life and grace. No more doth
Eva fear the reproach of the pangs of childbirth; for by the Holy Virgin her
transgressions are blotted out and effaced; forasmuch as in her was God born, to
the end that He might make alive him whom He made in His image.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C25"></A>25.</SPAN>&nbsp;A bulwark of imperishable life hath the Holy Virgin become unto us,
and a fountain of light to those who have faith in Christ; a sunrise of the
reasonable light <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> is she found to be. Be thou glad and rejoice. The
Lord with thee and from thee, who in His Godhead and His manhood is perfect, in
whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead: &quot;Be glad and rejoice, the
Lord with thee and from thee&quot; ----with His handmaid the Lord of glory; with
her that is unspotted, He that halloweth all; with the beautiful, He who is
wonderful in beauty above all the sons of men, to the end that He may make alive
him whom He made in His image.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C26"></A>26.</SPAN>&nbsp;In the Divine words of the Teacher we believe and
<A NAME="p170"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|170</SPAN></A> rejoice; for with roses and lilies and fragrant wreaths Christ, our
imperishable Spring, hath come unto us, and hath filled the fair garden of the
churches, even the seed-plots of our hearts, from the paradise of God. So then
with holy heart let us draw nigh, and find the golden faith gleaming wide and
the fruits of immortality smelling sweet therein. For in the desert of Mary the
fair-fruited tree hath shot up, that like one holy and pitiful, He may make
alive His creature.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C27"></A>27.</SPAN>&nbsp;Holy and wise in all things was the all-blessed Virgin; in
all ways peerless among all nations, and unrivalled among women. Not as the
first virgin Eva, who being alone in the garden, was in her weak mind led astray
by the serpent; and so took his advice and brought death into the world; and
because of that hath been all the suffering of saints. But in her alone, in this
Holy Virgin Mary, the Stem of Life hath shot up for us. For she alone was
spotless in soul and body.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C28"></A>28.</SPAN>&nbsp;With intrepid mind she spake to the angel: Whence is this
salutation, and how shall this be unto me? Dost thou desire to learn how the
exceeding magnifical power becomes a fellow-sufferer with us of our poverty? How
He that hath power over the hosts assumes the image of our baseness; and how He
who is God before the ages is about to become a child and be made flesh, He that
putteth on light as a garment and giveth life unto His creature. Grant me, said
the Holy Virgin, to learn such an impenetrable mystery, and I become the vessel
that receives the Divine mystery (or thought), being overshadowed by the Holy
Spirit, and [I am] to receive the truth of His flesh in my flesh, unto the
building by Wisdom of her abode.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C29"></A>29.</SPAN>&nbsp;The Word becometh flesh and dwelleth in us, that is, in the same
flesh, which it took from us; and by the spirit of its native self (<i>or </i>soul)
it spiritualises [itself]. And the unchangeable God accepts the form of a slave,
to the end <A NAME="p171"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|171</SPAN></A> that He be regarded by the faithful as man; but that He may be manifested as
God to the unfaithful, in order to renew the first-created.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C30"></A>30.</SPAN>&nbsp;The element of flesh doth the Son of God take from the Holy Virgin,
for before the ages He is God. He hath deigned to be born, and to be called Son
of man, and to become visible, He the invisible; and for our sake to be poor,
who is all riches; and to suffer as man, He the impassible and deathless. For
with (<i>or </i>in) the flesh in truth He was united, but He was not changed in
spirit. In a mortal body the Invisible One was enveloped, that He might make it
also deathless, making it sharer of His deathlessness through His Godhead; to
the end that He might renew him that was fashioned by His holy hands.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C31"></A>31.</SPAN>&nbsp;Glory and light are come into the world, Christ our God. He
glorifies and illumines with His ever-streaming light, to whom the voice of the
unseen Father bore witness: &quot;Yonder is My Son and Word, who is before the
ages.&quot;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C32"></A>32.</SPAN>&nbsp;But Mary was fortified by the word of the angel; but pondered in
herself the birth of the Lord, confronted with the disparity of human thought.
Now she lifted herself up to the lofty plane of the Divine, now again her mind
was occupied with the lowliness of humanity. And thus as in the scale of
reflection she balances the one and the other; even in that moment she becometh
truly worthy of the design (<i>or </i>mind, <i>or? </i>entrance) of God. For she
(or He) that preserved the treasure of her virginity pure and untarnished, she (<i>or
</i>He) also made the boundaries of her heart inviolate. And the creature is
saved which He made in His image.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C33"></A>33.</SPAN>&nbsp;Christ, Son of God, who was born of the Holy Virgin Mary, hath come
as grace into the world; because by means of grace He hath made us alive, He
that fashioned all things. Now that Christ is born into the world, doth all
creation dance. He giveth in exchange His temptation, <A NAME="p172"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|172</SPAN></A>
the coin of long-suffering, that He may claim (for us) the mansions of the
kingdom. The Holy Virgin was filled with joy because He took from her His flesh,
to the end that He might raise again him that was fallen under sin.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C34"></A>34.</SPAN>&nbsp;Evil thoughts are turned from us, when we sing psalms to
Thee, O heavenly and holy Father; beholding the great light which Thou hast
given to us, Jesus Christ, who was born of the Holy Virgin and wrought by means
of His Godhead wonders; but for our sake accepted sufferings by means of His
flesh. We then <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> also still being in the flesh will hasten in body
and soul to make the Deity propitious to us with angelic hymns, touching with
our hands in figurative wise the divine [element] of the dogma (?), and will sow
in our minds (<i>or </i>in our mysteries) the truth of faith. For the mystery (<i>or
</i>thought) is inaccessible, invisible, unchangeable, not to be circumscribed,
worshipped in its fulness and marvelled at in [our] mind. For even the Holy
Virgin herself had marvelled at the manner of the mystery (<i>or </i>thought).
How could the splendour of light become the offspring of a woman? She embraced
in herself the treasure of life, and pondered in her mind the salutation of the
archangel; until in the completion (of time) she bore the fruit of salvation,
that it might save (<i>or </i>make alive) man.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C35"></A>35.</SPAN>&nbsp;Therefore, O ye fair-fruited and comely branches of Christ's
teaching, ye shall in this place bring to us the <A NAME="p173"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|173</SPAN></A>
fruits of blessing (= <span class="Greek"><i>&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</i></span>). Here, where is all purity and
fragrance, let us offer to God with holy conscience the incense of prayer. Here,
where virginity and temperance dance together, bearing for fruit the life-giving
cluster of grapes. Here, where they . . . unto us the . . . of victorious power
and the treasure of love.<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> Here, where the mystery of the Holy
Trinity was revealed by the archangel to the Holy Virgin according to the
gospel: &quot;The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee and the power of the most
High shall overshadow thee. For Holy is that which is born of thee, Son of
God.&quot; To whom be glory and honour for ever and ever.</p>

Gregory's contemporary, already used it.</p>

<p><A NAME="2"></A>2.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> <span class="Greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x1F7B;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>.</p>
<p><A NAME="3"></A>3.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> These words are added in brackets in the Armenian text.</p>
<p><A NAME="4"></A>4.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> The Armenian is obscure, but this seems to be the sense.</p>
<p><A NAME="5"></A>5.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Or suffered Him who carries. The verb <i>krem, </i>like
<span class="Greek"><i>&#x03B8;&#x1F10;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;</i></span><i> </i>is here used first in one sense, and then in the other.</p>
<p><A NAME="6"></A>6.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp; <i>Lit., </i>of our thorns.</p>
<p><A NAME="7"></A>7.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>i.e. <span class="Greek">&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x03C6;&#x03C9;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="8"></A>8.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> The entire sentence from &quot;we then&quot; to &quot;truth of
faith&quot; is obscure and ungrammatical in the Armenian, and I have only
conjectured its meaning. In Latin it would = &quot;Ergo et nos anima et corpore,
etiam nunc esse in corpore, divinum illud angelicis hymnis propitium esse nobis
solliciti erimus facere, manu tangentes per figuram divinum illud doctrinae
veritatem fidei in cogitationibus nostris seremus.&quot;</p>
<p>Of the words rendered <i>doctrina; </i>and <i>propitium </i>I am not sure.
The word <i>baremnatzo, </i>which I render <i>propitium, </i>is unknown, but
should mean &quot;well-remaining.&quot; I take it to be a misrendering of <span class="Greek"><i>&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x1F75;&#x03C2;</i></span><i>.
</i>The word rendered by <i>cogitatio </i>may also mean &quot;mystery&quot; or
&quot;sacrament&quot;; and possibly the entire passage refers to the continued
existence in the sacrament of the body of Christ.</p>
<p><A NAME="9"></A>9.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> The Armenian MS. is mutilated here.</p>
