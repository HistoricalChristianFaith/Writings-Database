  </UL><P>How far will your mad folly go? How long will you counsel mischief against yourself? How long will you go on rousing me to wrath, and bringing shame on the common order of solitaries? Return. Put confidence in God, and in me, who imitate God's loving-kindness. If I rebuked you like a father, like a father I will forgive you. This is the treatment you shall receive from me, for many others are making supplication in your behalf, and before all the rest your own presbyter, for whose grey hairs and compassionate disposition I feel much respect. Continue longer to hold aloof from me and you have quite fallen from your degree.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4537_1420195">2</A></SUP> You will also fall away from God, for with your songs and your garb<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn45.htm#P4538_1420662">3</A></SUP> you are leading the young women not to God, but to the pit.</P>
