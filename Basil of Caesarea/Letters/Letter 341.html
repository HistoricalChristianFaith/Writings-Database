  </UL><P>You have not yet ceased to be offended with me, and so I tremble as I write. If you have cared, why, my dear sir, do you not write? If you are still offended, a thing alien from any reasonable soul and from your own, why, while you are preaching to others, that they must not keep their anger till sundown,<SUP><A HREF="#P6501_1959718">1</A></SUP> have you kept yours during many suns? Peradventure you have meant to punish me by depriving me of the sound of your sweet voice? Nay; excellent sir, be gentle, and let me enjoy your golden tongue.</P>


<br><br><sup id="P6501_1959718">1</sup>: cf . Eph. iv. 27, and the passage quoted by Alford form Plut., De Am. Frat . 488 B., to the effect that the Pythagoreans, whenever anger had caused unkindly words, shook hands before sundown, and were reconciled.
