  </UL><P>The townsmen of our metropolis have conferred on me a greater favour than they have received, in giving me an opportunity of writing to your excellency. The kindness, to win which they have received this letter from me, was assured them even before I wrote, on account of your wonted land inborn courtesy to all. But I have considered it a very great advantage to have the opportunity of addressing your excellency,praying to the holy God that I may, continue to rejoice, and share in the pleasure of the recipients of your bounty, while yon please Him more and more, and while the splendour of your high place continues to increase. I pray that in due time I may with joy once more welcome those who are delivering this my letter into your hands,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn28.htm#P2832_946484">3</A></SUP> and send them forth praising, as do many, your considerate treatment of them, and I trust that they will have found my. recommendation of them not without use in approaching your exalted excellency.</P>
