<h3 align="center">THE APOLOGY OF ARISTIDES, TRANSLATED FROM THE SYRIAC.</h3>
<p>Again, the apology which Aristides the philosopher made before Hadrian the
king concerning the worship of God.</p>
<p>[To the Emperor] Caesar Titus Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius, from
Marcianus Aristides, a philosopher of Athens.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>I.</SPAN>&nbsp;I, O king, by the
grace of God came into this world; and having contemplated the heavens and the
earth and the seas, and beheld the sun and the rest of the orderly creation, I
was amazed at the arrangement of the world; and I comprehended that the world
and all that is therein are moved by the impulse of another, and I understood
that he that moveth them is God, who is hidden in them and concealed from them:
and this is well known, that that which moveth is more powerful than that which
is moved. And that I should investigate concerning this Mover of all, as to how
He exists&#8212;for this is evident to me, for He is incomprehensible in His
nature&#8212;and that I should dispute concerning the stedfastness of His
government, so as to comprehend it fully, is not profitable for me; for no one
is able perfectly to comprehend it. But I say concerning the Mover of the world,
that He is God of all, who made all for the sake of man; and it is evident to me
that this is expedient, that one should fear God, and not grieve man.</p>
<p>Now I say that God is not begotten, not made; a constant nature, without
beginning and without end; immortal, complete, and incomprehensible: and in
saying that He is complete, I mean this; that there is no deficiency in Him, and
He stands in need of nought, but everything stands in need of Him: and in saying
that He is without beginning, I mean this; that everything which has a beginning
has also an end; and that which has an end is dissoluble. He has no name; for
everything that has a name is associated with the created; He has no likeness,
nor composition of members; for he who possesses this is associated with things <A NAME="p36"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|36</SPAN></A>
fashioned. He is not male, nor is He female: the heavens do not contain Him; but
the heavens and all things visible and invisible are contained in Him. Adversary
He has none; for there is none that is more powerful than He; anger and wrath He
possesses not, for there is nothing that can stand against Him. Error and
forgetfulness are not in His nature, for He is altogether wisdom and
understanding, and in Him consists all that consists. He asks no sacrifice and
no libation, nor any of the things that are visible; He asks not anything from
anyone; but all ask from Him.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>II.</SPAN>&nbsp;Since then it has
been spoken to you by us concerning God, as far as our mind was capable of
discoursing concerning Him, let us now come to the race of men, in order that we
may know which of them hold any part of that truth which we have spoken
concerning Him, and which of them are in error therefrom.</p>
<p>This is plain to you, O king, that there are four races of men in this world;
Barbarians and Greeks, Jews and Christians.</p>
<p>Now the Barbarians reckon the head of the race of their religion from Kronos
and from Rhea and the rest of their gods: but the Greeks from Helenus, who is
said to be from Zeus; and from Helenus was born Aeolus and Xythus, and the rest
of the family from Inachus and Phoroneus, and last of all from Danaus the
Egyptian and from Kadmus and from Dionysus.</p>
<p>Moreover the Jews reckon the head of their race from Abraham, who begat
Isaac, from whom was born Jacob, who begat twelve sons who removed from Syria
and settled in Egypt, and there were called the race of the Hebrews by their
lawgiver: but at last they were named Jews.</p>
<p>The Christians, then, reckon the beginning of their religion from Jesus
Christ, who is named the Son of God most High; and it is said that God came down
from heaven, and from a Hebrew virgin took and clad Himself with flesh, and in a
daughter of man there dwelt the Son of God. This is taught from that Gospel
which a little while ago was spoken among them as being preached; wherein if ye
also will read, ye will comprehend the power that is upon it. This Jesus, then,
was born of the tribe of the Hebrews; and He had twelve disciples, in order that
a certain dispensation of His might be fulfilled. He was <A NAME="p37"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|37</SPAN></A>
pierced by the Jews; and He died and was buried; and they say that after three
days He rose and ascended to heaven; and then these twelve disciples went forth
into the known parts of the world, and taught concerning His greatness with all
humility and sobriety; and on this account those also who to-day believe in this
preaching are called Christians, who are well known. There are then four races
of mankind, as I said before, Barbarians and Greeks, Jews and Christians.</p>
<p>To God then ministers wind, and to angels fire; but to demons water, and to
men earth.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>III.</SPAN>&nbsp;Let us then begin
with the Barbarians, and by degrees we will proceed to the rest of the peoples,
in order that we may understand which of them hold the truth concerning God, and
which of them error.</p>
<p>The Barbarians then, inasmuch as they did not comprehend God, erred with the
elements; and they began to serve created things instead of the Creator of them<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>,
and on this account they made likenesses and they enclosed them in temples; and
lo! they worship them and guard them with great precaution, that their gods may
not be stolen by robbers; and the Barbarians have not understood that whatsoever
watches must be greater than that which is watched; and that whatsoever creates
must be greater than that whatever is created: if so be then that their gods are
too weak for their own salvation, how will they furnish salvation to mankind?
The Barbarians then have erred with a great error in worshipping dead images
which profit them not. And it comes to me to wonder also, O king, at their
philosophers, how they too have erred and have named gods those likenesses which
have been made in honour of the elements; and the wise men have not understood
that these very elements are corruptible and dissoluble; for if a little part of
the element be dissolved or corrupted, all of it is dissolved and corrupted. If
then these elements are dissolved and corrupted, and compelled to be subject to
another harder than themselves, and are not in their nature gods, how can they
call gods those likenesses which are made in their honour? Great then is the
error which their philosophers have brought upon their followers. <A NAME="p38"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|38</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>IV.</SPAN>&nbsp;Let us turn then, O
king, to the elements themselves, in order that we may shew concerning them that
they are not gods, but a creation, corruptible and changeable, which is in the
likeness of man<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>. But God is incorruptible and
unchangeable and invisible, while seeing, turning and changing all things.</p>
<p>Those therefore who think concerning earth that it is God have already erred,
since it is digged and planted and delved; and since it receives the defilement
of the excrement of men and of beasts and of cattle: and since sometimes it
becomes what is useless; for if it be burned it becomes dead, for from baked
clay there springs nothing: and again, if water be collected on it, it becomes
corrupted along with its fruits: and lo! it is trodden on by men and beasts, and
it receives the impurity of the blood of the slain; and it is digged and filled
with the dead and becomes a repository for bodies: none of which things can that
holy and venerable and blessed and incorruptible nature receive. And from this
we have perceived that the earth is not God but a creature of God.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>V.</SPAN>&nbsp;And in like manner
again have those erred who have thought concerning water that it is God. For
water was created for the use of man and in many ways it is made subject to him.
For it is changed, and receives defilement, and is corrupted, and loses its own
nature when cooked with many things, and receives colours which are not its own;
being moreover hardened by the cold and mixed and mingled with the excrement of
men and beasts and with the blood of the slain: and it is compelled by workmen,
by means of the compulsion of channels, to flow and be conducted against its own
will, and to come into gardens and other places, so as to cleanse and carry out
all the filth of men, and wash away all defilement, and supply man's need of
itself. Wherefore it is impossible that water should be God, but it is a work of
God and a part of the world.</p>
<p>So too those have erred not a little who thought concerning fire that it is
God: for it too was created for the need of men: and in many ways it is made
subject to them, in the service of food and in the preparation of ornaments and
the other things of <A NAME="p39"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|39</SPAN></A> which your
majesty is aware: whilst in many ways it is extinguished and destroyed.</p>
<p>And again those who have thought concerning the blast of winds that it is
God, these also have erred: and this is evident to us, that these winds are
subject to another, since sometimes their blast is increased and sometimes it is
diminished and ceases, according to the commandment of Him who subjects them.
Since for the sake of man they were created by God, in order that they might
fulfil the needs of trees and fruits and seeds, and that they might transport
ships upon the sea; those ships which bring to men their necessary things, from
a place where they are found to a place where they are not found; and furnish
the different parts of the world. Since then this wind is sometimes increased
and sometimes diminished, there is one place in which it does good and another
where it does harm, according to the nod of Him who rules it: and even men are
able by means of well-known instruments to catch and coerce it that it may
fulfil for them the necessities which they demand of it: and over itself it has
no power at all; wherefore it is not possible that winds should be called gods,
but a work of God.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C6"></A>VI.</SPAN>&nbsp;So too those have
erred who have thought concerning the sun that he is God. For lo! we see him,
that by the necessity of another he is moved and turned and runs his course; and
he proceeds from degree to degree, rising and setting every day, in order that
he may warm the shoots of plants and shrubs, and may bring forth in the air
which is mingled with him every herb which is on the earth. And in calculation
the sun has a part with the rest of the stars in his course, and although he is
one in his nature, he is mixed with many parts, according to the advantage of
the needs of men: and that not according to his own will, but according to the
will of Him that ruleth him. Wherefore it is not possible that the sun should be
God, but a work of God; and in like manner also the moon and stars.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C7"></A>VII.</SPAN>&nbsp;But those who have
thought concerning men of old, that some of them are gods, these have greatly
erred: as thou, even thou, O king, art aware, that man consists of the four
elements and of soul and spirit, and therefore is he even called World, and
apart from any one of these parts he does not exist. He has <A NAME="p40"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|40</SPAN></A>
beginning and end, and he is born and also suffers corruption. But God, as I
have said, has none of this in His nature, but He is unmade and incorruptible.
On this account, then, it is impossible that we should represent him as God who
is man by nature, one to whom sometimes, when he looketh for joy, grief happens;
and for laughter, and weeping befals him; one that is passionate and jealous,
envious and regretful, along with the rest of the other defects: and in many
ways more corrupted than the elements or even than the beasts.</p>
<p>And thence, O king, it is right for us to understand the error of the
Barbarians, that, whereas they have not investigated concerning the true God,
they have fallen away from the truth and have gone after the desire of their own
mind, in serving elements subject to dissolution, and dead images: and on
account of their error they do not perceive who is the true God.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C8"></A>VIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;Let us return now
to the Greeks in order that we may know what opinion they have concerning the
true God.</p>
<p>The Greeks then because they are wiser than the Barbarians have erred even
more than the Barbarians, in that they have introduced many gods that are made;
and some of them they have represented as male and some of them as female; and
in such a way that some of their gods were found to be adulterers and murderers,
and jealous and envious, and angry and passionate, and murderers of fathers, and
thieves and plunderers. And they say that some of them were lame and maimed; and
some of them wizards, and some of them utterly mad; and some of them played on
harps; and some of them wandered on mountains: and some of them died outright;
and some were struck by lightning, and some were made subject to men, and some
went off in flight, and some were stolen by men; and lo! some of them were wept
and bewailed by men; and some, they say, went down to Hades; and some were
sorely wounded, and some were changed into the likeness of beasts in order that
they might commit adultery with the race of mortal women; and some of them have
been reviled for sleeping with males: and some of them, they say, were in
wedlock with their mothers and sisters and daughters; and they say of their gods
that they committed adultery with the daughters of men, and from them was born a
certain race which was also <A NAME="p41"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|41</SPAN></A> mortal.
And of some of their goddesses they say that they contended about beauty and
came for judgment before men. The Greeks, then, O king, have brought forward
what is wicked, ridiculous and foolish concerning their gods and themselves; in
that they called such like persons gods, who are no gods: and hence men have
taken occasion to commit adultery and fornication, and to plunder and do
everything that is wicked and hateful and abominable. For if those who are
called their gods have done all those things that are written above, how much
more shall men do them who believe in those who have done these things! and from
the wickedness of this error, lo! there have happened to men frequent wars and
mighty famines, and bitter captivity and deprivation of all things: and lo! they
endure them, and all these things befal them from this cause alone: and when
they endure them they do not perceive in their conscience that because of their
error these things happen to them.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C9"></A>IX.</SPAN>&nbsp;Now let us come to
the history of these their gods in order that we may prove accurately concerning
all those things which we have said above.</p>
<p>Before everything else the Greeks introduce as a god Kronos, which is
interpreted Chiun; and the worshippers of this deity sacrifice to him their
children: and some of them they burn while yet living. Concerning him they say
that he took him Rhea to wife; and from her he begat many sons; from whom he
begat also Dios, who is called Zeus; and at the last he went mad and, for fear
of an oracle which was told him, began to eat his children. And from him Zeus
was stolen away, and he did not perceive it: and at the last Zeus bound him and
cut off his genitals and cast them in the sea: whence, as they say in the fable,
was born Aphrodite, who is called Astera: and he cast Kronos bound into
darkness. Great then is the error and scorn which the Greeks have introduced
concerning the head of their gods, in that they have said all these things about
him, O king. It is not possible that God should be bound or amputated; otherwise
it is a great misfortune.</p>
<p>And after Kronos they introduce another god, Zeus; and they say concerning
this one, that he received the headship and became king of all the gods; and
they say concerning him that he was changed into cattle and everything else, in
order that he might <A NAME="p42"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|42</SPAN></A> commit adultery
with mortal women, and might raise up to himself children from them. Since at
one time they say he was changed into a bull on account of his passion for
Europa and for Pasiphae; and again he was changed into the likeness of gold on
account of his passion for Danae: and into a swan, through his passion for Lcda;
and into a man through his passion for Antiope; and into lightning on account of
his passion for the Moon: so that from these he begat many children: for they
say that from Antiope he begat Zethus and Amphion; and from the Moon, Dionysus;
from Alkmena, Herakles; and from Leto, Apollo and Artemis; and from Danae,
Perseus; and from Leda, Castor and Polydeuces and Helene; and from Mnemosyne he
begat nine daughters, those whom he called the Muses; and from Europa, Minos and
Rhadamanthus and Sarpedon. But last of all he was changed into the likeness of
an eagle on account of his passion for Ganymede the shepherd.</p>
<p>Because of these stories, O king, much evil has befallen the race of men who
are at this present day, since they imitate their gods, and commit adultery, and
are defiled with their mothers and sisters, and in sleeping with males: and some
of them have dared to kill even their fathers. For if he, who is said to be the
head and king of their gods, has done these things, how much more shall his
worshippers imitate him! And great is the madness which the Greeks have
introduced into their history concerning him: for it is not possible that a god
should commit adultery or fornication, or should approach to sleep with males,
or that he should be a parricide; otherwise he is much worse than a destructive
demon.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C10"></A>X.</SPAN>&nbsp;And again they
introduce another god, Hephaestus; and they say of him that he is lame and
wearing a cap on his head, and holding in his hand tongs and hammer; and working
in brass in order that therefrom he may find his needed sustenance. Is then this
god so much in need? Whereas it is impossible for a god to be needy or lame:
otherwise he is very weak.</p>
<p>And again they introduce another god and call him Hermes; and they say that
he is a thief, loving avarice and coveting gains, and a magician and maimed and
an athlete and an interpreter of words: whereas it is impossible for a god to be
a magician, or <A NAME="p43"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|43</SPAN></A> avaricious, or
maimed, or coveting anything that is not his, or an athlete: and if it be found
to be otherwise, he is of no use.</p>
<p>And after him they introduce another god, Asclepius; and they say that he is
a physician and prepares medicines and bandages in order that he may satisfy his
need of sustenance. Is then this god in need? And he at last was struck by
lightning by Zeus, on account of Tyndareus the Lacedemonian; and so he died. If
then Asclepius was a god, and when struck by lightning was unable to help
himself, how is it that he was able to help others? Whereas it is an impossible
thing that the divine nature should be in need, or that it should be struck by
lightning.</p>
<p>And again they introduce another god and call him Ares, and they say that he
is a warrior and jealous, and covets sheep and things which do not belong to
him, and acquires possessions through his weapons; and of him they say that at
last he committed adultery with Aphrodite and was bound by a tiny boy Eros, and
by Hephaestus the husband of Aphrodite: whereas it is impossible that a god
should be a warrior or a prisoner or an adulterer.</p>
<p>And again they say of Dionysus that he too is a god, who celebrates festivals
by night and teaches drunkenness, and carries off women that do not belong to
him: and at the last they say that he went mad and left his female attendants
and tied to the wilderness; and in this madness of his he ate serpents; and at
the last he was killed by Titan. If then Dionysus was a god, and when slain was
not able to help himself; how is it that he was able to help others?</p>
<p>Herakles, too, they introduce, and they say of him that he is a god, a hater
of things hateful, a tyrant and a warrior, and a slayer of the wicked: and of
him they say that at the last he went mad and slew his children and cast himself
into the fire and died. If therefore Herakles be a god and in all these evils
was unable to stand up for himself, how was it that others were asking help from
him? Whereas it is impossible that a god should be mad or drunken or a slayer of
his children, or destroyed by fire.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C11"></A>XI.</SPAN>&nbsp;And after him they
introduce another god and call him Apollo: and they say of him that he is
jealous and. changeable; and <A NAME="p44"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|44</SPAN></A>
sometimes he holds a bow and a quiver, and sometimes a lyre and a plectrum; and
he gives oracles to men, in order that he may receive a reward from them. Is
then this god in need of reward? Whereas it is disgraceful that all these things
should be found in a god.</p>
<p>And after him they introduce Artemis a goddess, the sister of Apollo; and
they say that she was a huntress; and she carried a bow and arrows, and went
about on mountains leading dogs, either to hunt the deer or the wild boars.
Whereas it is disgraceful that a maid should go about by herself on mountains
and follow the chase of beasts. And therefore it is not possible that Artemis
should be a goddess.</p>
<p>Again they say of Aphrodite that she forsooth is a goddess; and sometimes
forsooth she dwells with their gods, and sometimes she commits adultery with men;
and sometimes she has Ares for her lover and sometimes Adonis, who is Tammuz:
and sometimes forsooth Aphrodite is wailing and weeping for the death of Tammuz:
and they say that she went down to Hades in order that she might ransom Adonis
from Persephone, who was the daughter of Hades. If then Aphrodite be a goddess
and was unable to help her lover in his death, how is she able to help others?
And this is a thing impossible to be listened to, that the divine nature should
come to weeping and wailing and adultery.</p>
<p>And again they say of Tammuz that he is a god; and he is forsooth a hunter
and an adulterer; and they say that he was killed by a blow from a wild boar,
and was not able to help himself, And if he was not able to help himself, how is
he able to take care of the human race? And this is impossible, that a god
should be an adulterer or a hunter or that he should have died by violence.</p>
<p>And again they say of Rhea that she forsooth is the mother of their gods; and
they say of her that she had at one time a lover Atys, and she was rejoicing in
corruptible men; and at the last she established lamentations, and was bewailing
her lover Atys. If then the mother of their gods was not able to help her lover
and rescue him from death, how is it possible that she should help others? It is
disgraceful then that a goddess should lament and weep, and that she should have
joy over corruptible beings. <A NAME="p45"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|45</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again they bring forward Kore; and they say that she was a goddess and that
she was carried off by Pluto and was not able to help herself. If then she is a
goddess and was not able to help herself, how is she able to help others? For a
goddess who is carried off is extremely weak.</p>
<p>All these things, then, O king, the Greeks have introduced forward about
their gods, and have invented and said concerning them: whence all men have
taken occasion to do all wicked and impure things: and thereby the whole earth
has been corrupted.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C12"></A>XII.</SPAN>&nbsp;Now the Egyptians,
because they arc more evil and ignorant than all peoples upon the earth, have
erred more than all men. For the worship of the Barbarians and the Greeks did
not suffice them, but they introduced also the nature of beasts, and said
concerning it that they were gods: and also of the creeping things which are
found on the dry land and in the waters, and of the plants and herbs they have
said that some of them are gods, and they have become corrupt in all madness and
impurity more than all peoples that are upon the earth. For of old time they
worshipped Isis; and they say that she forsooth is a goddess, who had forsooth a
husband Osiris, her brother; but when forsooth Osiris was killed by his brother
Typhon, Isis fled with her son Horus to Byblos in Syria and was there for a
certain time until that her son was grown: and he contended with his uncle
Typhon and killed him, and thereupon Isis returned and went about with her son
Horus, and was seeking for the body of Osiris her lord, and bitterly bewailing
his death. If therefore Isis be a goddess, and was not able to help Osiris her
brother and lord, how is it possible that she should help others? Whereas it is
impossible that the divine nature should be afraid and flee, or weep and wail.
Otherwise it is a great misfortune.</p>
<p>But of Osiris they say that he is a god, a beneficent one; and he was killed
by Typhon and could not help himself; and it is evident that this cannot be said
of Deity.</p>
<p>And again they say of Typhon, his brother, that he is a god, a fratricide,
and slain by his brother's son and wife since he was unable to help himself. And
how can one who does not help himself be a god?</p>
<p>Now because the Egyptians are more ignorant than the rest of <A NAME="p46"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|46</SPAN></A>
the peoples, these and the like gods did not suffice them, but they also put the
name of gods on the beasts which are merely soulless. For some men among them
worship the sheep, and others the calf; and some of them the pig, and others the
shadfish; and some of them the crocodile, and the hawk, and the cormorant, and
the kite, and the vulture, and the eagle, and the crow; some of them worship the
cat, and others the fish Shibbuta; some of them the dog, and some of them the
serpent, and some the asp, and others the lion, and others garlic, and onions,
and thorns, and others the leopard, and the like.</p>
<p>And the poor wretches do not perceive with regard to all these things that
they are nought; while every day they look upon their gods, who are eaten and
destroyed by men, yea even by their own fellows; and some of them being burned,
and some of them dying and putrifying and becoming refuse; and they do not
understand that they are destroyed in many ways.</p>
<p>And accordingly the Egyptians have not understood that the like of these are
not gods, since their salvation is not within their own power; and if they are
too weak for their own salvation, then as regards the salvation of their
worshippers pray whence will they have the power to help them?</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C13"></A>XIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;The Egyptians
then have erred with a great error, above all peoples that are upon the face of
the earth. But it is a matter of wonder, O king, concerning the Greeks, whereas
they excel all the rest of the peoples in their manners and in their reason, how
thus they have gone astray after dead idols and senseless images: while they see
their gods sawn and polished by their makers, and curtailed and cut and burnt
and shaped and transformed into every shape by them. And when they are grown old
and fail by the length of time, and are melted and broken in pieces, how is it
that they do not understand concerning them that they are not gods? And those
who have not ability for their own preservation, how will they be able to take
care of men? But even the poets and philosophers among them being in error have
introduced concerning them that they are gods, things like these which are made
for the honour of God Almighty; and being in error they seek to make them like
to God as to whom no man has ever seen to whom He is like; nor is <A NAME="p47"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|47</SPAN></A>
he able to see Him<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>; and together with these things
they introduce concerning Deity as if it were that deficiency were found with it;
in that they say that He accepts sacrifice and asks for burnt-offering and
libation and murders of men and temples. But God is not needy, and none of these
things is sought for by Him: and it is clear that men are in error in those
things that they imagine. But their poets and philosophers introduce and say,
that the nature of all their gods is one; but they have not understood of God
our Lord, that while He is one, He is yet in all. They, then, are in error; for
if, while the body of man is many in its parts, no member is afraid of its
fellow, but whilst it is a composite body, all is on an equality with all: so
also God who is one in His nature has a single essence proper to Him, and He is
equal in His nature and His essence, nor is He afraid of Himself. If therefore
the nature of the gods is one, it is not proper that a god should persecute a
god, nor kill nor do him that which is evil.</p>
<p>If then gods were persecuted and transfixed by gods, and some of them were
carried off and some were struck by lightning; it is clear that the nature of
their gods is not one, and hence it is clear, O king, that that is an error
which they speculate about the nature of their gods, and that they reduce them
to one nature. If then it is proper that we should admire a god who is visible
and does not see, how much more is this worthy of admiration that a man should
believe in a nature which is invisible and all-seeing! and if again it is right
that a man should investigate the works of an artificer, how much more is it
right that he should praise the Maker of the artificer! For behold! while the
Greeks have established laws, they have not understood that by their laws they
were condemning their gods; for if their laws are just, their gods are unjust,
who have committed transgression in killing one another and practising sorcery,
committing adultery, plundering, stealing and sleeping with males, along with
the rest of their other doings. But if their gods excellently and as they
describe have done all these things, then the laws of the Greeks are unjust; and
they are not laid down according to the will of the gods; and in this the whole
world has erred. <A NAME="p48"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|48</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For as for the histories of their gods, some of them are myths, some of them
physical, and some hymns and songs: the hymns and songs, then, are empty words
and sound; and as to the physical, if they were done as they say, then they are
not gods, since they have done these things and suffered and endured these
things: and these myths arc flimsy words, altogether devoid of force.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C14"></A>XIV.</SPAN>&nbsp;Let us come now, O
king, also to the history of the Jews and let us see what sort of opinion they
have concerning God. The Jews then say that God is one, Creator of all and
almighty: and that it is not proper for us that anything else should be
worshipped, but this God only: and in this they appear to be much nearer to the
truth than all the peoples, in that they worship God more exceedingly and not
His works; and they imitate God by reason of the love which they have for man;
for they have compassion on the poor and ransom the captive and bury the dead,
and do things of a similar nature to these: things which are acceptable to God
and are well-pleasing also to men, things which they have received from their
fathers of old. Nevertheless they too have gone astray from accurate knowledge,
and they suppose in their minds that they are serving God, but in the methods of
their actions their service is to angels and not to God, in that they observe
sabbaths and new moons and the passover and the great fast, and the fast, and
circumcision, and cleanness of meats: which things not even thus have they
perfectly observed.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C15"></A>XV.</SPAN>&nbsp;Now the Christians,
O king, by going about and seeking have found the truth, and as we have
comprehended from their writings they are nearer to the truth and to exact
knowledge than the rest of the peoples. For they know and believe in God, the
Maker of heaven and earth, in whom are all things and from whom are all things:
He who has no other god as His fellow: from whom they have received those
commandments which they have engraved on their minds, which they keep in the
hope and expectation of the world to come; so that on this account they do not
commit adultery nor fornication, they do not bear false witness, they do not
deny a deposit, nor covet what is not theirs: they honour father and mother;
they do good to those who are their neighbours, and when they are judges they
judge uprightly; and they do not worship idols in the form of man; and whatever
they do not <A NAME="p49"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|49</SPAN></A> wish that others should
do to them, they do not practise towards any one<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>,
and they do not eat of the meats of idol sacrifices, for they are undefiled: and
those who grieve them they comfort, and make them their friends; and they do
good to their enemies: and their wives, O king, are pure as virgins, and their
daughters modest: and their men abstain from all unlawful wedlock and from all
impurity, in the hope of the recompense that is to come in another world: but as
for their servants or handmaids, or their children if any of them have any, they
persuade them to become Christians for the love that they have towards them; and
when they have become so, they call them without distinction brethren: they do
not worship strange gods: and they walk in all humility and kindness, and
falsehood is not found among them, and they love one another: and from the
widows they do not turn away their countenance: and they rescue the orphan from
him who does him violence: and he who has gives to him who has not, without
grudging; and when they see the stranger they bring him to their dwellings, and
rejoice over him as over a true brother; for they do not call brothers those who
are after the flesh, but those who are in the spirit and in God: but when one of
their poor passes away from the world, and any of them sees him, then he
provides for his burial according to his ability; and if they hear that any of
their number is imprisoned or oppressed for the name of their Messiah, all of
them provide for his needs, and if it is possible that he may be delivered, they
deliver him.</p>
<p>And if there is among them a man that is poor or needy, and they have not an
abundance of necessaries, they fast two or three days that they may supply the
needy with their necessary food. And they observe scrupulously the commandments
of their Messiah: they live honestly and soberly, as the Lord their God
commanded them: every morning and at all hours on account of the goodnesses of
God toward them they praise and laud Him: and over their food and over their
drink they render Him thanks. And if any righteous person of their number passes
away from the world they rejoice and give thanks to God, and they follow his
body, as if he were moving from one place to another: and when a child is born
to any one of them, they praise God, and if again <A NAME="p50"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|50</SPAN></A>
it chance to die in its infancy, they praise God mightily, as for one who has
passed through the world without sins. And if again they see that one of their
number has died in his iniquity or in his sins, over this one they weep bitterly
and sigh, as over one who is about to go to punishment: such is the ordinance of
the law of the Christians, O king, and such their conduct.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C16"></A>XVI.</SPAN>&nbsp;As men who know
God, they ask from Him petitions which are proper for Him to give and for them
to receive: and thus they accomplish the course of their lives. And because they
acknowledge the goodnesses of God towards them, lo! on account of them there
flows forth the beauty that is in the world. And truly they are of the number of
those that have found the truth by going about and seeking it, and as far as we
have comprehended, we have understood that they only are near to the knowledge
of the truth.</p>
<p>But the good deeds which they do, they do not proclaim in the ears of the
multitude, and they take care that no one shall perceive them, and hide their
gift, as he who has found a treasure and hides it<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>.
And they labour to become righteous as those that expect to see their Messiah
and receive from Him the promises made to them with great glory.</p>
<p>But their sayings and their ordinances, O king, and the glory of their
service, and the expectation of their recompense of reward, according to the
doing of each one of them, which they expect in another world, thou art able to
know from their writings. It sufficeth for us that we have briefly made known to
your majesty concerning the conversation and the truth of the Christians. For
truly great and wonderful is their teaching to him that is willing to examine
and understand it. And truly this people is a new people, and there is something
divine mingled with it. Take now their writings and read in them, and lo! ye
will find that not of myself have I brought these things forward nor as their
advocate have I said them, but as I have read in their writings, these things I
firmly believe, and those things also that are to come. And therefore I was
constrained to set forth the truth to them that take pleasure therein and seek
after the world to come.</p>
<p>And I have no doubt that the world stands by reason of <A NAME="p51"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|51</SPAN></A>
the intercession of Christians. But the rest of the peoples are deceived and
deceivers, rolling themselves before the elements of the world, according as the
sight of their understanding is unwilling to pass by them; and they grope as if
in the dark, because they are unwilling to know the truth, and like drunken men
they stagger and thrust one another and fall down.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C17"></A>XVII.</SPAN>&nbsp;Thus far, O king,
it is I that have spoken. For as to what remains, as was said above, there are
found in their other writings words which are difficult to speak, or that one
should repeat them; things which are not only said, but actually done.</p>
<p>The Greeks, then, O king, because they practise foul things in sleeping with
males, and with mother and sister and daughter, turn the ridicule of their
foulness upon the Christians; but the Christians are honest and pious, and the
truth is set before their eyes, and they are long-suffering; and therefore while
they know their error and are buffeted by them, they endure and suffer them: and
more exceedingly do they pity them as men who are destitute of knowledge: and in
their behalf they offer up prayers that they may turn from their error. And when
it chances that one of them turns, he is ashamed before the Christians of the
deeds that are done by him: and he confesses to God, saying, In ignorance I did
these things: and he cleanses his heart, and his sins are forgiven him, because
he did them in ignorance in former time, when he was blaspheming and reviling
the true knowledge of the Christians. And truly blessed is the race of the
Christians, more than all men that are upon the face of the earth.</p>
<p>Let the tongues of those now be silenced who talk vanity, and who oppress the
Christians, and let them now speak the truth. For it is better that they should
worship the true God rather than that they should worship a sound without
intelligence; and truly divine is that which is spoken by the mouth of the
Christians, and their teaching is the gateway of light. Let all those then
approach thereunto who do not know God, and let them receive incorruptible
words, those which are so always and from eternity: let them, therefore,
anticipate the dread judgment which is to come by Jesus the Messiah upon the
whole race of men.</p>
