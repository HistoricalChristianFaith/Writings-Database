concerned with or cite copious quantities of the Syriac text.&nbsp; This page

readers]</p>
<p>p. 35, 1. 7. The demonstration of Divine Providence from the contemplation of
the heavenly bodies is common to all forms of Theistic teaching: consequently it
occurs freely in Christian Apologetics. We may compare the following passages:</p>
<p>Melito, <i>Oration to Antoninus Caesar </i>(Cureton, <i>Spic. Syr, </i>p.
46). &quot;He hath set before thee the heavens, and He has placed in them the
stars. He hath set before thee the sun and the moon, and they every day fulfil
their course therein... He hath set before thee the clouds which by ordinance
bring water from above and satisfy the earth: that from these things thou
mightest understand, that He who moveth these is greater than they all, [Syriac]
and that thou mightest accept the goodness of Him who hath given to thee a mind
by which thou mayest distinguish these things.&quot;</p>
<p>Origen, <i>De Principiis, </i>II. 1. 5. &quot;But that we may believe on the
authority of Holy Scripture, that such is the case, hear how in the books of
Maccabees, <A NAME="p53"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|53</SPAN></A> where the mother of the
seven martyrs exhorts her son to endure torture, this truth is confirmed: for
she says, ' I ask of thee, my son, to look at the heaven and earth, and at all
things which are in them, and beholding them, to know that God made all these
things when they did not exist.'&quot; [2 Macc. vii. 28.]</p>
<p><i>Id. </i>iv. 1. 7. &quot;The artistic plan of a providential Ruler is not
so evident in matters belonging to the earth, as in the case of the sun, moon
and stars.&quot;</p>
<p>l. 11. Cf. Melito, <i>Oration </i>p. 50. &quot;He made the lights that His
works might behold one another, and <i>lie concealcth Himself </i>in His might <i>from
all His works.&quot;</i></p>
<p>ll. 14, 15. A comparison with the Armenian suggests that something has fallen
out here. The Syriac cannot be translated as it stands. The Greek unfortunately
fails us at this point.</p>
<p>1. 19 (r^ 19). The early Christian teachers emphasised strongly this belief
that the world was made for the sake of man: consequently we must not assume, if
we find the same statement in Justin Martyr, that the idea was borrowed from
Aristides, for it is a part of the regular second -century teaching. The
following parallels may be quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Justin, <i>Apol. </i>I. 10. [Greek]</p>
  <p><i>Dial. </i>41. [Greek]<i>.</i></p>
  <p>Ps. Justin, <i>Ep. ad Diogn. </i>10. [Greek]<i>.</i></p>
  <p>i. 23. Cf. Philo, <i>Fragments, </i>p. 70: [Greek]</p>
  <p>Id. <i>de Fortitudine </i>&sect; 3. [Greek] <A NAME="p54"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|54</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><i>Acta Mar Kardaghi </i>(ed. Abbeloos, p. 30): [Syriac]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>l. 28. The same philosophical opinion will be found almost in the same words
in Eustathius <i>contra Arianos </i>quoted in John of Damascus, <i>Parallels </i>p.
314, [Greek]&nbsp;</p>
<p>l. 30. We may compare the following passages from Justin and from the Epistle
to Diognetus, in view of Jerome's statement that Justin imitated Aristides, and
the modern theory of Doulcet as to the authorship of the anonymous epistle to
Diognctus.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Justin, <i>Apol. </i>I. 9.&nbsp; [Greek]&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Justin, <i>Apol. </i>II. 6.[Greek]</p>
  <p>Justin, <i>Dial. </i>4. [Greek]</p>
  <p>Justin, <i>Apol. </i>I. 10. [Greek]</p>
  <p><i>Ep. ad Diogn. </i>3. [Greek]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>p.36, l. 18. 'The head of the race of their religion.' This seems to be a
conflation of the two phrases which occur lower down: ' the head of their race,'
and ' the beginning of their religion.' It should be simply ' the head of their
race,' as we see from the Greek.]</p>
<p>l. 23. The Armenian has ' Kadmus the Sidonian and Dionysus the Theban.' Cf.
Herod. II. 91 [Greek]. But Kadmus is a Sidonian in Eur. <i>Bacch. </i>171 and
Ovid, <i>Met. </i>iv. 571.</p>
<p>[l. 27. The statement that the people received the name of ' Hebrews ' from
Moses is peculiar to the Syr. and Arm. translations.]</p>
<p>l. 29. The writer not only deduces the name of the Christians from the title
of their founder, but he is also ready, like Justin and other <A NAME="p55"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|55</SPAN></A>
fathers, to compare the name with the Greek word <font face="SPIonic">xrhsto&amp;j</font>,
as we shall see in the closing chapter. The following parallels may be noted in
Justin. Justin, <i>Apol. </i>I. 12. [Greek] ; <i>Dial. </i>63. [Greek]; <i>Ibid.
</i>138. [Greek]</p>
<p>l. 32. With the closing words of this sentence we may compare the Syriac <i>Acts
of John </i>(ed. Wright), p. 37, [Syriac] where we should correct the text so as
to read &quot;and when formed as a child in the womb He was. with His
Father.&quot;</p>
<p>l. 34 . The Gospel is clearly a written one, and not the general message (<font face="SPIonic">eu)agge/lion</font>).
In c. xvi. we again find Aristides offering the Emperor the Christian
Scriptures.</p>
<p>p. 37, l. 1. Another instance of the formula 'He was crucified by the Jews,'
beyond those to which we have already drawn attention, may be found in a
fragment of Melito preserved by Anastasius Sinaita; [Greek] for which the Syriac
rendering is given by Cureton, <i>Spic. Syr.</i></p>
<p>In later times we may expect to find similar language, though the expression
itself disappears from the Creed. In <i>Acta Mar Kardaghi </i>p. 37 we have the
following (loquitur Satanas), [Syriac] and again in p. 74 [Syriac]. The idea of
the Jews being the special agents of Satan in the Crucifixion <A NAME="p56"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|56</SPAN></A>
comes out also in an unpublished <font face="SPIonic">a)ntilogia&amp;</font>
between the Devil and Christ, which is preserved in a MS. at Jerusalem (Cod. 66,
S. Sep.), where we read [Greek].&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Compare also the Letter of Pilate in the Acts of Peter and Paul &sect; 42 (Tisch.
<i>Acta Apocr., </i>Lips. 1851, p. 17): [Greek]]</p>
<p>l. 20. The injunction to have a care that your gods be not stolen is not
uncommon with the early Christians, and it is not improbable that they were able
to refer to special and notable cases of violation of temples and mutilation of
images. We may refer, at all events, to the following parallels: Justin, <i>Apol.
</i>I. 9. [Greek]; <i>Ep. ad Diogn. </i>2. [Greek]</p>
<p>l. 26. Compare c. vii. From the &quot;Teaching of the Apostles&quot; (c. vi.
3) onwards, idolatry is known as a 'worship of dead gods': e.g. Melito, <i>Oration
</i>p. 43, &quot;But I affirm that also the Sibyl has said respecting them, that
it is the images of kings, who are dead, they worship.&quot;</p>
<p>p. 38, l. 1 (co 19). The writer now proceeds to discuss the views of those
who either sought the First Principle in one of the elements or imagined it to
be located in one of the heavenly bodies. And it is common for the early
Christian writers to demolish the philosophic schools in detail according as
they found them referring the origin of all things to water, as Tha&iuml;es; or air,
as Anaximenes; or fire, as Heraclitus; or earth, as Pherecydes and Xenophanes.
We may compare Plutarch <i>De placitis philosophorum </i>i. 3, and then notice
how the Christian apologists deal with the matter. The writer of the Epistle to
Diognetus thinks that, if a god is to be found amongst the elements, one element
or created thing is as good as another: <i>Ep. ad Diogn. </i>8. [Greek]<i>.</i></p>
<p>Melito deals even more shortly with the matter, and in a rude common-sense
manner says that we may call a creature God without making it to be divine:</p>
<p><i>Oration, </i>p. 42. &quot;And if, therefore, a man...say that there is
another God, it is found from his own words that he calleth some created thing
God. For if a man call fire God, it is not God, because it is fire; and if a man
call the waters God, they are not God, because they are waters; and if this
earth which we tread upon, and if those heavens which are seen by us, and if the
sun, or the moon, or one of those stars which run their course by <A NAME="p57"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|57</SPAN></A>
ordinance and rest not, nor proceed by their own will&#8212;and if a man call gold
and silver gods: are not these things that we use as we please?&quot;</p>
<p>It will be seen that their treatment of the subject was superficial, no other
treatment being, in fact, necessary. Aristides, however, takes the matter more
seriously and examines each case in detail by the light of his previously stated
axioms concerning the divine nature.</p>
<p>p. 39, l. 1 This phrase, 'your majesty,' does not in any way suggest that
more than one person is addressed.</p>
<p>l. 25 He is referring to Apollo, Poseidon and Asklepios: cf. Tertullian, <i>Apol.
</i>14, Hic Apollinem Admeto regi pascendis pecoribus addicit, ille Nepturii
structorias operas Laomedonti locat. Est et illis de lyricis (Pindarum dico) qui
Aescolapium canit avaritiae merito, quia medicinam nocenter exercebat, fulmine
iudicatum. <A NAME="p58"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|58</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>l. 21. The translator gives the Syriac name for Saturn, [Syriac] . In the <i>Classical
Review </i>for June 1890, p. 259, Prof. Margoliouth reviewing Budge's <i>Pseudo-Callisthenes
</i>remarks as follows, &quot;On p. 9 after the name of each planet we are told
what the Persian for it is: surely this implies that the book which the
translator had before him was in Persian. I will quote one of these, because Mr
Budge has by accident missed the truth. The name of <i>Saturn </i>is omitted
from the list, but instead we read, <i>the colour </i>[Syriac] <i>of a black
stone, and the horoscopus of helani which is called in Persian Farn&uuml;g'. </i>Mr
Budge would emend Farn&uuml;g', but it is a Persian word signifying Saturn ......
Hence [Syriac] 'colour' must stand for a word signifying <i>Saturn; </i>and this
will be the Persian [Persian] which the translator has read [Persian] 'colour'.&quot;
It would seem to be a more direct process simply to emend the Syriac into [Syriac].</p>
<p>p. 42, l. 2. The amours of the gods are, as might have been expected, the
staple of early Christian apologetics. A few references may be given in
illustration of the scornful summary of Olympic history given by Aristides.&nbsp;
Justin, <i>Apol. </i>I. 21. [Greek]; Justin, <i>Apol. </i>I. 25. [Greek]; <i>Recog.
Cl&eacute;ment, </i>x. 22. &quot;Antiopen Nyctei versus in Satyrum corrupit: ex qua
nascuntur Amphion et Zethus; Alcmenam, mutatus in virum eius Amphitryonem; ex
qua nascitur Hercules: Aeginam Asopi, mutatus in aquilam, ex qua nascitur Aeacus.
Sed et Ganymedem Dardani mutatus nihilominus in aquilam stuprat; Mantheam Phoci,
mutatus in ursum; ex qua nascitur Arctos: Danaen Acrisii, mutatus in aurum; ex
qua nascitur Perseus: Europen Phoenicis, mutatus in taurum; ex qua nascitur
Minos, et Rhadamanthus Sarpedonque: Eurymedusam Achelai, mutatus in formicam; <A NAME="p59"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|59</SPAN></A>
ex qua nascitur Myrmidon: Thaliam Aetnam nympham, mutatus in vulturem; ex qua
nascuntur apud Siciliam Palixi: Imandram Geneani apxid Rhodum, mutatus in imbrem:
Cassiopiam, mutatus in virum eins Phoenicem; ex qua nascitur Anchinos: Ledam
Thesti, mutatus in cycnum; ex qua nascitur Helena: et iterum eandem, mutatus in
stellam; ex qua nascuntur Castor et Pollux: Lamiam, mutatus in upupam:
Mnemosynen, mutatus in pastorem; ex qua nascuntur Musae novem: Nemesin, mutatus
in anserem: Semelen Cadmiam mutatus in ignem; ex qua nascitur Dionysus,&quot;
etc.</p>
<p>See also Ps. Justin, <i>Oratio ad Gentiles = </i>Ambrose, <i>Hypomnemata </i>(Cureton,
<i>Spic. Syr. </i>pp. 63, 64) for a similar sketch to that of Aristides.</p>
<p>[l. 4. Pasiphae is an erroneous insertion in the Syriac.</p>
<p>l. 11. 'Castor and Polydeuces and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne and Paludus.' This last word is a <i>vox
nihili; </i>and the confusion has arisen in the following manner. The Greek has
'Castor and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne and Polydeuces.' The Syriac scribe has written Polydeuces
in its more obvious position immediately after Castor, and then the second
Polydeuces has suffered corruption.]</p>
<p>l. 31. For the ornaments made by Hephaestus, and sarcastic Christian remarks
thereon, we may cite: Tatian, <i>Oratio ad Graecos, </i>c. viii.[Greek] <A NAME="p60"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|60</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>p.44, l. 31. [The paragraph on Rhea and the following one on Proserpine are
not in the Greek.] The Fathers not infrequently allude to the myth of Rhea and
Atys. [Cf. Tatian, <i>ad Gfraecos, </i>8, [Greek]]</p>
<p>The story is apparently Phrygian in origin, though very similar in its
details to forms from the further East. Lucian <i>(De dea Syra, </i>33)
describing the three images in the temple at Hierapolis says that the first two
are Zeus and Hera, and the third [Greek]<i>. </i>Baethgen <i>(Beitr&auml;ge zur
Semitischen Religionsgesckichte) </i>p. 73 most ingeniously conjectures this to
be a misunderstanding of Lucian's; [Greek] which last stands for <i>Atti </i>or <i>Atys:
</i>the name appearing in a variety of forms, sometimes alone, sometimes
combined with other deities, and sometimes as a factor in proper names: o.g. in
Bardesanes <i>De Fato </i>we are told that the men of Edessa down to the time of
Abgar used to sacrifice their foreskins to Tharatha: this seems to be a late
form [Hebrew]; or Istar + Atta.</p>
<p>As to the establishment of dances in honour of Atys, these are a
characteristic feature of Semitic orgiastic worship. One of the best
illustrations is the temple of Baal-Marcod, which stands on a spur of the
Lebanon above Beyrout, and where there are many inscriptions from the ancient
temple built into the walls of a modern convent. The name implies <i>Lord of
Dances </i>and in one inscription given by Waddington (Inscr. Syr. No. 1855) is
directly paraphrased as <font face="SPIonic">koi/rane kw&amp;mwn</font>.</p>
<p>p. 45, l. 22. According to our apologist Isis fled to Byblos in Syria; and
this agrees with Plutarch <i>De Iside et Osiride, </i>that Byblos was a
sanctuary of Isis; now we know from Lucian <i>De Dea Syra </i>c. 6 that the
great sanctuary at Byblos was a sanctuary of Aphrodite <font face="SPIonic">Bubli/n</font><i>
</i>(cf. Strabo xvi. 2, p. 362).<i> </i>We should therefore have to assume that <A NAME="p61"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|61</SPAN></A>
Byblos was the centre at once of an Isis-cult and an Aphrodite-cult which is the
same thing as an Astarte-cult, for our apologist tells us to equate the Greek
Aphrodite to the Syrian Astera. We must then assume either that the two forms of
worship existed side by side, or that there had been a fusion of the two cults,
the latter hypothesis being favoured by the similarity between the case of
Aphrodite weeping for Tammuz and Isis lamenting Osiris. Moreover the confusion
extends to the personalities of Osiris and Adonis: and Movers quotes from
Stephanus of Byzantium as follows: [Greek]</p>
<p>Whether, then, we pay attention to the dead gods or the wailing goddesses,
there is a great similarity in the matter of the two religions. And we have
suggested that in the sanctuary at Byblos the two cults may have been carried on
side by side. One other question suggests itself, viz. whether they may not both
be modifications of some earlier worship. We have some reason for believing that
the original Byblos-worship was that of the Assyrian Baaltis, for Philo Byblius
says that this city was the gift of Cronos to Baaltis. Now this Baaltis, the
Assyrian mother of the gods, appears in the west in a Greek form, first under
the name of Mylitta by a common change in the pronunciation of <i>b </i>and <i>m.
</i>But this Mylitta is affirmed by Herodotus to be capable of equation with
Aphrodite (i. 131 [Greek]) and this would lead us to recognize in the sanctuary
at Byblos an original sanctuary of Mylitta.</p>
<p>p.46, l. 3. The local variation in the Egyptian worship appears in Herodotus
and is alluded to by the Christian fathers: Herod. II. 69. [Greek]; Justin, <i>Apol.
</i>I. 24.[Greek]; <i>Recog. Clement, </i>v. 20. &quot; Nam alii eorum bovem qui
Apis dicitur colendum tradidere, alii hircum; alii gattas; nonnulli ibin; quidam
serpentera; piscem quoque, et caepas et cloacas, crepitus ventris, pro numinibus
habendos esse docuerunt: et alia innumerabilia quae pudet etiam nominare.&quot;</p>
<p>[See Mayor's notes to Juv. <i>Sat. </i>xv., for a storehouse of references on
this point.]</p>
<p>Of the objects of worship mentioned by Aristides, some are rather difficult
to identify. The first question that arises is with regard to the animal denoted
by [Syriac]. In the Dublin MS. of the Fables of Syntipas, Fable 45, we find [Syriac].
The word therefore stands for a cat. The fable to which we have referred is <A NAME="p62"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|62</SPAN></A>
No. 40 in Landsberger's <i>Fabeln des Sophos. </i>The Syriac reference is due to
Prof. Bensly.</p>
<p>l. 27. Here the language may be illustrated by a reference to Justin, <i>Apol.
</i>I. 9, [Greek];<i> </i>and <i>Ep. ad Diogn. </i>2, [Greek]</p>
<p>p. 49, l. 1. The description given of the Christians in this chapter recalls
in many points the &quot; Teaching of the Apostles.&quot; To begin with, we have
the golden rule in a negative form, which may be compared with the first chapter
of the Teaching, and with a similar Syriac sentence <A NAME="p63"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|63</SPAN></A>
given as a saying of Menander in Land, <i>Anecdota </i>i. 69, from Cod. Mus.
Britt. 14658, fol. 166 <i>r, </i>as follows: [Syriac]which is a very different
rendering from that of Aristides, and may be suspected from its ascription to
Menander to be a translation of some metrical form of the golden rule.</p>
<p>The version in Aristides, from its setting in the text of the Apology,
between two precepts against idolatry, viz. idols in the form of man, and meats
offered to idols, reminds one of the Codex Bezae which completes the rule of the
Council at Jerusalem (Acts xv. 29) by adding the words [Greek]. But whether the
sentence stood in this connexion in the primitive Didascalia, we cannot
say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other parallels will suggest themselves, as when Aristides describes
Christian practice in words that seem to answer to [Greek] which does not differ
much from c. ii. of the Teaching. The parallelisms, however, are only just
sufficient to suggest an acquaintance with the Teaching on the part of Aristides;
and his whole presentation of Christian ethics is vastly superior to anything in
the Didach&eacute;, and can only be paralleled for beauty and spirituality in the
pages of Tertullian.</p>
<p>p. 50, l. 37. The belief that the world stands by reason of the Christians
occurs also in the following passages: Justin, <i>Apol. </i>I. 45. [Greek];
Justin, <i>Apol. </i>II. 7. [Greek]; <i>Ep. ad Diogn. </i>6. [Greek]</p>
<p>The extract from the Epistle to Diognetus is nearer to the idea of Aristides
than the passages quoted from Justin.</p>
<p>p. 51, l. 2. The expression [Syriac] which we have rendered &quot; rolling
themselves,&quot; occurs again in Melito, <i>Oration </i>(Cureton, <i>Spic. Syr.
</i>p. [Syriac], 25), <A NAME="p64"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|64</SPAN></A> (&quot; Why
rollest thou thyself upon the earth, and offerest supplication to things which
are without perception?&quot;)</p>
<p>l. 36. The concluding words may be compared with Justin <i>Dial. </i>58,
[Greek].</p>
<p>It will be seen that we have given especial attention to the illustrations
furnished to the text of our author by the undoubted writings of Justin and by
the Epistle to Diognetus. We have not, however, been able to agree with the
opinion of Doulcet in reference to the latter writing, nor with the tradition of
Jerome in reference to Justin's imitation of Aristides. It may, however, be
taken for granted, from the parallels adduced, that Justin and Aristides are
nearly contemporary.</p>
