<h3 align="center">THE ORIGINAL GREEK OF THE APOLOGY OF ARISTIDES.</h3>
<p>While Mr Harris was passing the preceding pages through the press, he kindly
allowed me to read the proof sheets of his translation of the Syriac. Shortly
afterwards as I was turning over Latin Passionals at Vienna in a fruitless
search for a lost MS. of the Passion of S. Perpetua, I happened to be reading
portions of the Latin Version of the 'Life of Barlaam and Josaphat,' and
presently I stumbled across words which recalled the manner and the thought of
Aristides. Turning back to the beginning of a long speech, I found the words:
'Ego, rex, providentia Dei veni in mundum; et considerans celum et terram, mare
et solem et lunam, et cetera, admiratus sum ornatum eorum.' The Greek text of 'Barlaam
and Josaphat ' is printed in Migne's edition of the works of S. John of Damascus:
and it was not long before I was reading the actual words of the Apologist
himself: <i>[Greek] </i>It was with some impatience that I waited for my return
to Cambridge, in order to examine the proof sheets again, and so to discover by
a comparison of the Syriac Version how much of our author was really in our
hands in the original tongue.</p>
<p>To what extent then does the Greek speech in 'Barlaam and Josaphat'
correspond to the Syriac Version of the Apology of Aristides? In other words:
How far may we claim to have recovered the original Apology in the language in
which it was written?</p>
<p>The circumstances under which the Greek has been preserved at all demand
first a brief notice. 'The Life of Barlaam and <A NAME="p68"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|68</SPAN></A>
Joasaph (or Josaphat)' is the title of a religious romance, which, by a
tradition dating at the latest from the 11th century, has been connected with
the name of S. John of Damascus. It is true that SS. Barlaam and Josaphat find a
place in the Calendars of both the Eastern and Western Churches: but it has long
been recognised that their 'Life' is a working up of the Indian legend of Sakya
Mouni, or Buddha; and a number of the apologues scattered over the piece have
also been identified as Eastern stories of a very early date.</p>
<p>The popularity of the book has rarely been equalled in the history of
literature. Before the 13th century it had been translated into almost every
known language of the world; an Icelandic Version was made about the year 1200
by the order of a Norwegian king; and there is an early English rendering in
metre.</p>
<p>It has lately been argued, and I think with success, by Zotenberg<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>,
that the book is much earlier than the time of S. John of Damascus; and that the
matter which it has in common with several of his works is drawn from previous
writers such as Gregory Nazianzen and Nemesius. This being so, it may well go
back to the 6th century, or perhaps earlier still.</p>
<p>The outline of the story is as follows. An Eastern king, named Abenner,
persecutes the Christians, and especially the monks, whom he expels from India.
He is childless; but at length the young prince Josaphat is born, and the
astrologers, as in the case of Buddha, predict for him an extraordinary
greatness. They add however that he will become a Christian. This his father
determines to prevent. He encloses him in a magnificent palace; allows none but
young and beautiful attendants to approach him; and forbids the mention of
sorrow, disease and death, and above all of Christianity. When the prince is
grown to man's estate he asks his father to give him liberty. His entreaties are
at length successful, as it seems that otherwise his life will be saddened, and
the first step will have been taken towards his reception of the forbidden
faith. He is allowed to drive out, but the way is carefully prepared beforehand,
and guarded from the <A NAME="p69"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|69</SPAN></A> intrusion of
sad sights and sounds. At last precaution fails, and he sees one day a lame man
and a blind man, and another day a man wrinkled and tottering with age. He
inquires whether accidents may befal any man, and whether every man must come at
last to miserable old age or death. There is but one answer: and the joy has
fled from his life.</p>
<p>A monk of the desert, Barlaam by name, is divinely warned of the prince's
condition; and comes disguised as a merchant, and obtains entrance to the prince
to shew him a most goodly pearl. In a long discourse, into which Gospel parables
and Eastern apologues are skilfully woven, he expounds to him the vanity of the
world and the Christian hope of the life to come. In the end the prince is
baptized, and Barlaam disappears into the desert. The king, distracted with rage
on the one hand and love for his son on the other, casts about for means to
shake his faith. A wily<i> </i>counsellor propounds a plan. An old man, who
closely resembles Barlaam and who is an admirable actor, is to defend the cause
of Christianity in an open debate. He is to make a lame speech, and be easily
refuted by the rhetoricians. The prince, seeing his instructor baffled, will
renounce his newly accepted faith.</p>
<p>The day comes, and Nachor, for this is the old man's name, appears to
personate Barlaam. Josaphat addresses him in vigorous terms, reminding him of
the difficulties in which his instructions have involved him, and promising him
a miserable fate if he fails to prove his point. Nachor is not reassured by this
mode of address; but after some preliminary fencing on the part of the
rhetoricians he begins to speak. Such, says our author, was the providence of
God, that like Balaam of old he had come to curse, but he ended by blessing with
manifold blessings. Or, as he says again, lowering his metaphor; 'He beckoned to
the multitude to keep silence, and he opened his mouth, and like Balaam's ass he
spake that which he had not purposed to speak; and he said to the king: I, O
king, by the providence of God came into the world...'</p>
<p>The Apology of Aristides carried the day: and, to cut the long story short,
Nachor himself and finally the king and his people were converted: and at last
Josaphat, who in due course succeeds <A NAME="p70"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|70</SPAN></A>
his father, resigns his kingdom and retires to spend his days with Barlaam in
the desert<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>What modifications then were required to fit the Apology for its new
surroundings? Surprisingly few.</p>
<p>(1) The king is of course addressed throughout: but this is so in the
original piece. Only a short sentence at the end praises the wise choice of the
king's son.</p>
<p>(2) The fourfold division of mankind into Barbarians and Greeks, Jews and
Christians, was out of place in an Indian court. We find in its stead a triple
division----Worshippers of false gods, Jews and Christians: and the first class
is subdivided into Chaldeans, Greeks and Egyptians, as being the ringleaders and
teachers of heathenism to the rest of the world<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>(3) A short passage at the close, in which the Christians are defended from
the foul charges so often brought against them in the first days, was out of
date and consequently has disappeared.</p>
<p>(4) If we add to this that there are traces of compression here and there,
and that the description of the Christians at the close is considerably
curtailed, we have exhausted the list of substantial modifications which can
with certainty be detected.</p>
<p>The substance of the Apology then is for the most part faithfully preserved:
but can we say that with the exceptions already named we have the actual Greek
words of Aristides himself?</p>
<p>The first and most obvious test to apply is that of comparative length. The
Syriac is, speaking roughly, half as long again as the Greek: and this
difference is not fully accounted for by the combination in the latter of the
preliminary statements about the Jews and the Christians with the fuller
descriptions of them given later on, and by the omission of nearly two pages at
the close. <A NAME="p71"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|71</SPAN></A> The fact is that the
Syriac has a large number of repetitions and not a few additional details which
are absent from the Greek. Thus at the end of each description of the several
gods and goddesses of the heathen, the Syriac Version points the moral and
drives home the inevitable conclusion: and again such histories as those of
Kronos and of Isis and Osiris are somewhat more elaborately told in this form of
the Apology.</p>
<p>Are we then to conclude that the Syriac translator has enlarged upon his
original, and supplemented it here and there from his own resources? Or must we
say that the author of 'Barlaam and Josaphat' found the Apology too long for his
purpose, and pruned away unnecessary details?</p>
<p>The second hypothesis has a <i>prima facie </i>probability, and the general
reputation for faithfulness of Syriac translators might point us in the same
direction. On the other side it is to be observed that, even when read in the
light of the Syriac Version, the Greek form is still felt to be a harmonious and
consistent whole: and it certainly does not convey the impression of serious
mutilation. The genius of the author, in so framing his plot as perfectly to
suit the Apology which he intended to introduce, needs no further praise than is
involved in the fact that hitherto no one has had the remotest suspicion that he
did not write the speech of Nachor himself. If anything could make his genius
appear more extraordinary still, it would be the proof that he had consistently
compressed the original document in almost every alternate sentence without
leaving any traces of rough handling: but such proof is at present not
forthcoming. In the absence of further documents, the question must be decided
largely by internal evidence and the minute investigation of the points of
difference. But there are two external sources from which light may be thrown
upon the problem.</p>
<p>(1) In 1855 Cureton published in his <i>Spicilegium Syriacum </i>a treatise
bearing the title: 'Hypomnemata, which Ambrose, a chief man of Greece, wrote;'
and commencing with the words: 'Do not suppose, men and Greeks, that without fit
and just cause is my separation from your customs.' These words are the literal
translation of the opening sentence of the <i>Oratio ad</i> <A NAME="p72"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|72</SPAN></A>
<i>Gentiles </i>traditionally ascribed to Justin Martyr: [Greek]</p>
<p>When we compare the original Greek with the Syriac Version of this document,
we find that in point of length they stand to one another exactly as do the
Greek and Syriac forms of the Apology of Aristides: that is to say, in either
case the Syriac is about half as long again as the Greek. Moreover, as in the
case of our Apology, the variation begins to shew itself immediately after the
first sentence, which I have quoted. For the Greek continues thus: [Greek]<i>. </i>But
the Syriac replaces this by the following, as Cureton renders it: 'For I have
investigated the whole of your wisdom of poetry, and rhetoric, and philosophy;
and when I found not anything right or worthy of the Deity, I was desirous of
investigating the wisdom of the Christians also, and of learning and seeing who
they are, and when, and what is this its recent and strange production, or on
what good things they rely who follow this wisdom, so as to speak the truth. Men
and Greeks, when I had made the enquiry I found not any folly, as in the famous
Homer, who says respecting the wars of the two rivals, &quot;for the sake of
Helen many of the Greeks perished at Troy, far from their beloved home.&quot;
For first they say respecting Agamemnon,' &amp;c.</p>
<p>Here then we have a similar problem to that of the Apology of Aristides; and
in this case we are not hampered by the consideration that the Greek may
possibly have been abbreviated to fit it for incorporation into a religious
novel. Few will be disposed to challenge the verdict of Otto<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>,
that the Syriac translator has so altered and amplified his original as almost
to have produced a new work.</p>
<p>We may give one more illustration of the manner in which the translator has
proceeded. We have seen already that he has paraded at the outset his
independent acquaintance with Homer. <A NAME="p73"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|73</SPAN></A>
Where Ulysses is alluded to, later on, the Greek has a sentence full of satire
and liable to be misunderstood. [Greek]<i>. </i>Corresponding to this we find in
the Syriac Version: 'But respecting the guile of Odysseus, son of Laertes, and
his murders, who shall tell? For to a hundred and ten suitors in one day his
house was a grave, and was filled with dead bodies and blood. And he it is that
by his wickedness purchased praises, because by the excellence of his wisdom he
was concealed: and he it is that, as ye say, sailed over the sea, and heard the
voice of the Sirens, because he stopped his ears with wax.'</p>
<p>The translator then has first supplemented his author by introducing fresh
details about Ulysses: and then he has totally missed the meaning of the Greek.
He has obviously read it as if it were [Greek],<i> ' </i>through the excellence
of his wisdom he kept himself in the dark.' Then not seeing the point of [Greek],<i>
</i>he simply tells us that ' he stopped his ears with wax.' This of
course&quot; the hero did not do: and the translator has got the Homeric story
wrong: nor shall we mend matters much by inserting with Cureton the word 'not'
after 'and heard.' We see at any rate plainly enough what was this Syrian's
conception of a translator's function when his author seemed obscure.</p>
<p>The parallel between the two Apologies is the more striking, because the line
of argument in these <i>Hypomnemata </i>vividly recalls parts of Aristides, and
the same illustrations of the misdemeanours of the gods frequently reappear in
almost the same language. The satire of the so-called Ambrosius is a much keener
weapon than the simple narrative of Aristides: but there is not the same
intensity of moral earnestness. It is quite credible that the later Apologist
had the work of Aristides before him when he wrote, and endeavoured to reproduce
the same arguments in what he thought was a more telling manner. Thus he says:
[Greek]<i> </i>(cf. infra p. 109, 1. 7). And again: [Greek]. <A NAME="p74"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|74</SPAN></A>
(cf. p. 106, 1. 24). And once more: [Greek] (cf. p. 105, 1. 18).</p>
<p>Enough then has been said to shew that a Syriac translator, finding an early
Greek Apology and desiring to reproduce it in his own language, might have no
scruple whatever in dealing very freely with his author, in expunging sentences
which he was not able or did not care to translate, and in supplementing the
original here and there out of his own resources. The Syriac translator of the <i>Oratio
ad Gentiles </i>has clearly so treated his unknown author; and this fact removes
any <i>a priori </i>objection to the supposition that the Syriac translator of
Aristides has acted in a similar way.</p>
<p>(2) We are fortunate in having an additional source of evidence in the
Armenian fragment which contains the opening sentences of the Apology. The
Armenian translator has clearly done what we have had some reason to suspect in
the case of the Syriac translator. He has dealt freely with his original, adding
words and even sentences, and introducing the stock phrases of a later theology.
.But this, while it diminishes very considerably the amount of the evidence
which can be produced from his version, does not materially affect its value as
far as it goes. Phrases which are only found in the Armenian, or only found in
the Syriac, may be dismissed as possibly the inventions of the respective
translators: but there remains a considerable quantity of matter common to the
two Versions, which therefore presupposes a Greek original. The question we have
to ask is: What is the relation of this common matter to the Greek text now in
our hands <i>1</i></p>
<p>A preliminary point however demands attention: Is the Armenian translated
from the Syriac, or is it an independent translation made directly or indirectly
from the Greek itself?</p>
<p>A few instances in which the Armenian corresponds with the Greek against the
Syriac will suffice to shew that it cannot come from the Syriac as we now have
it.</p>
<p>In the opening sentence we have [Greek] and ' providentia ' (Arm.) against
'goodness' (Syr.). Immediately afterwards [Greek] and ' luna ' (Arm.), which the
Syriac omits. Lower down ' rectorem' <A NAME="p75"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|75</SPAN></A>
three times corresponds to parts of [Greek]<i>, </i>but there is nothing to
answer to these in the Syriac. In the Christological passage near the end of the
fragment, <i>' </i>una cum Spiritu Sancto ' (Arm.) answers to&nbsp; [Greek]<i>: </i>and
here again the Syriac has no equivalent.</p>
<p>Moreover in the description of the Divine nature the Armenian Version says: '
Ei neque colores sunt neque forma,' or as Mr Conybeare renders it <i>' </i>Colour
and form of Him there is not.' This corresponds to the Syriac phrase: ' He has
no likeness, nor composition of members.' The Greek fails us here: but we may
suppose that the -Greek word which has been variously rendered ' colour ' and '
likeness ' was&nbsp; [Greek]<i>, </i>as in the passage quoted by Mr Harris from
Justin (supra p. 54):&nbsp; [Greek]<i>.</i></p>
<p>We may conclude then that the Armenian Version is not made from the Syriac
Version in its present form<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>: and similar arguments
could be adduced, if there were any necessity, to shew that the Syriac Version
is independent of the Armenian.</p>
<p>I have mentioned already almost all the cases in which the Syriac fails to
reproduce in any form matter which is common to the Greek and the Armenian. They
scarcely make up between them more than a dozen words. The additional matter
found only in the Syriac Version is more considerable.</p>
<p>First, there is the second title which introduces the name of Antoninus Pius,
and so conflicts with the first which has the support of the Armenian<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>Then we have the following phrases:</p>
<p>(a) Who is hidden in them and concealed from them: and this is well known,
that... <A NAME="p76"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|76</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) And in saying that He is complete, I mean that there is no deficiency in
Him.</p>
<p>(c) And that which has an end is dissoluble.</p>
<p>(d) From man He asks nothing.</p>
<p>(e) Who begat...from whom was born...who begat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(f) Of their religion (bis).</p>
<p>(g) And it is said that (in the Christological statement)... and clad Himself
with...and they say that...who are well known.</p>
<p>I have taken no account of the many places in which the two Versions wander
far from each other, and yet seem to have some common basis. Here the Armenian
is obviously the worst offender, and its interpolations are far more numerous.</p>
<p>We now turn to the Greek itself in the passage covered by the Armenian
fragment, in order to see first of all to what extent what we actually have
faithfully represents the Greek words which underlie the Syriac and Armenian
Versions.</p>
<p>(1) The first sentence which bears the appearance of compression is the
following: [Greek]. This seems to bring together several more expanded phrases
witnessed to by the two Versions, which however do not agree with one another
sufficiently closely to allow us to make a certain reconstruction.</p>
<p>(2) In the sentence,&nbsp; [Greek], a word, corresponding to ' praefatas '
(Arm.) and ' which we have spoken concerning Him ' (Syr.), has dropped out
before&nbsp; [Greek]: and instead of&nbsp; [Greek] there must have been a verb
in the original; ' ab eis erraverint ' (Arm.), ' have erred therefrom ' (Syr.).
The difference is of course exceedingly slight in itself: but it is important
from a critical point of view, when we are testing the faithfulness with which
the author of 'Barlaam and Josaphat' has preserved to us the original Apology.
We may probably trace in this sentence the influence of an almost identical one,
which comes later on, after the preliminary descriptions of the four races have
been given. As the Greek combines these descriptions with the fuller <A NAME="p77"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|77</SPAN></A>
accounts afterwards given, it brings the parallel sentences close together.</p>
<p>(3) The division of mankind into three races, and not four, has been already
noticed<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>.</p>
<p>(4) It is just at this point that the most serious divergence is found: viz.,
the omission of the preliminary descriptions of the races, as noted above. This
was perhaps the result of the change in the method of their division, which
rendered unsuitable the sentences which immediately followed.</p>
<p>Once more, we have to ask how much is there which can be shewn, by the united
testimony of the Versions, to have stood in the original Greek, and which yet
finds no place in the Greek which has survived.</p>
<p>(1) In the first line both Versions have 'into this world,' while the Greek
has&nbsp; [Greek]<i>: </i>but the demonstrative may perhaps only be an attempt
to represent the Greek article. The first real gap is eight lines lower down,
where the Versions are very divergent<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>, but yet
point- to some common original. It is probable that the Greek text at this point
was difficult or corrupt, and so was omitted altogether by the author of '
Barlaam and Josaphat.' The topic is the difficulty and uselessness of elaborate
investigation concerning the Divine nature: and the conclusion is drawn ' that
one should fear God and not grieve man ' (Syr.), ' utpote unum Deum nos adorare
oportet: unumquemque autem nostrum proximum suum sicut semetipsum diligere '
(Arm.). To this the Greek has nothing to correspond.</p>
<p>(2) For the list of properties of the Divine nature we have in the Greek
merely the compressed sentence, part of which was quoted above. The Versions
agree in telling us more fully that ' God is not begotten, not made '; ' without
beginning, because that which has a beginning has also an end'; 'without name,
because that which has a name belongs to the created'; 'without likeness (Arm. '
colores,' implying&nbsp; [Greek]<i> </i>in the Greek) and composition of members
(Arm. ' forma '), for he who possesses this is associated with things created'
(Arm. 'mensurabilis est, <A NAME="p78"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|78</SPAN></A>
limitibusque cogitur'); 'neither male nor female' (Arm. adds 'quia cupiditatibus
agitatur qui huic est distinctioni obnoxius '); ' the heavens do not contain Him:
but the heavens and all things visible and invisible are contained in Him '; '
He has no adversary ' (in the reason for this there is fresh discrepancy); ' He
is altogether wisdom and understanding.' After this the Greek, as we have it, is
again, for the next seven lines, obviously the same as that which lay before the
translators.</p>
<p>(3) Now comes the new division of mankind, and the Greek has omitted the
following: ' Now the Barbarians reckon---- and from Dionysus,' about six lines.</p>
<p>(4) The preliminary accounts of the Jews and the Christians are found in the
Greek later on, where they are amalgamated with the fuller descriptions. The
account of the Jews agrees fairly well with that given in the Versions,
especially in the Armenian. The additions in the Greek will be noticed
presently. It adds at the close: [Greek]<i>.</i></p>
<p>(5) The Christological passage which follows is so important that it will be
an advantage to have the three forms side by side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;[Greek]</p>
<p><i>The Christians then reckon the beginning </i>of their religion <i>from
Jesns Christ, Who is named the Son of God most High; </i>and it is said that God
<i>came down from Jieaven, and from a Hebrew virgin toot: </i>and clad Himself
with <i>flesh; </i>and there dwelt in a daughter <i>of man the Son of God.</i></p>
<p><i>Christianorum tandem gentil a Domino Jesn Christo oritur. Ipse Dei
altissimi est Filius, </i>et una cum <i>Spiritu Sancto </i>reuelatus est nobis: <i>de
coelis descendit, ex Hebraea uirgine natus, </i>ex uirgine <i>carnem assumpsit, </i>assumpta-qne
<i>humana </i>natura <i>semet-ipsum Dei Filium reuelauit.</i></p>
<p>Here I have distinguished by spaced type or by italics every word, which
having a double testimony may be referred to the original Greek. As regards
omissions, the Greek omits only the epithet ' Hebrew ', which it replaces by the
epithet <i>agia, </i>and the second reference to 'the Son of God,' where however
there is a discrepancy between the two Versions. The Syriac omits&nbsp; [Greek]<i>,
<A NAME="p79"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|79</SPAN></A> </i>The Armenian has no omission
that can be certainly traced. The additions in each case may be seen at a
glance. The Armenian has practically none; though a few lines further down the
epithet corresponding to <i>theotokos </i>is applied to the Virgin. The most
serious change is that in the Syriac, where the word ' God ' is inserted as the
subject of the verbs which follow. The passage is one which was more likely than
any other in the whole piece to tempt later writers to make changes of their
own. It is to be noted that here the Greek in spite of its additions represents
the original Apology much more faithfully than the Syriac does.</p>
<p>(6) In the words which follow next the Versions do not agree either with one
another, or with the Greek, which has displaced the sentence and gives it a
little lower down. But both the Greek and the Syriac appeal to a written Gospel,
which the king might read if he chose.</p>
<p>(7) The repetition of the fourfold division of mankind is of course not found
in the Greek, and with it has disappeared the problematical sentence: ' To God
then ministers wind, and to angels fire; but to demons water, and to men earth.'
At this point the Armenian fragment ends.</p>
<p>What then is the result of our investigation of this opening passage, in
which alone we have a triple testimony to the contents of the original Apology?</p>
<p>(1) There is one serious modification (if, indeed, we have not here the
original) in the Greek, as it is preserved to us; but it was necessitated by the
conditions of its reproduction in its new surroundings.</p>
<p>(2) There is one serious displacement in the Greek; but this was almost
necessitated by the modification just mentioned.</p>
<p>(3) The description of the Divine nature is very much abbreviated in the
Greek; but no word occurs in it which has not the support of the Versions.</p>
<p>(4) In the Christological passage which we examined in detail the Greek was
seen to preserve the original statements, though with the addition of the later
phrase <A NAME="p80"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|80</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(5) The Syriac Version is often loose and inaccurate: it drops a phrase here
and there; and it makes insertions by way of explanation or of supplement, and
sometimes in such a way as to convey a wholly false conception of the original.</p>
<p>We learn then to expect for the remainder of the Apology that the Greek, as
we have it, will as a rule give us the actual words of Aristides, except in the
very few places in which modification was obviously needed. Where the Syriac
presents us with matter which has no counterpart whatever in the Greek, we shall
hesitate to pronounce that the Greek is defective, unless we are able to suggest
a good reason for the omission, or to authenticate the Syriac from some external
source<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>.</p>
<p align="center"><i>The Greek Text of 'Barlaam and Josaphat.'</i></p>
<p>It is remarkable that this work, which at one time enjoyed such extraordinary
popularity, should not have found its way into print in its original language
before the present century. The Latin Version wrongly attributed to Georgius
Trapezuntius, but really, as the MSS. of it prove, of a much earlier date, was
printed, together with various works of S. John of Damascus, at Basel in 1539:
but it was reserved to Boissonade to publish the Greek Text for the first time
in the fourth volume of his <i>Anecdota, </i>which appeared at Paris in 1832.</p>
<p>Boissonade apologises for the meagreness of his <i>apparatus criticus </i>on
the ground that an edition was expected almost immediately from Schmidt and
Kopitar the librarian of the Imperial Library at Vienna. This edition, however,
never appeared. Out. of seventeen MSS. preserved in the Library at Paris,
Boissonade used throughout but two, 903 and 1128, which he refers to as A and C.
He gives occasional readings from two others, 904 and 907, which he names B and
D. In the portion of the book which specially concerns us, viz. the speech of
Nachor, C is defective for about 10 of Boissonade's pages, and the testimony of
D is frequently <A NAME="p81"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|81</SPAN></A> recorded. From time
to time readings are also quoted from the Latin Version.</p>
<p>This very inadequate text has been reprinted in Migne's <i>Patrologia Graeca,
</i>tom. 96, in the third volume of the works of S. John of Damascus: but we
have gained nothing by the reproduction except new blunders.</p>
<p>In the <i>Wiener Jahrb&uuml;cher f&uuml;r Deutsche Literatur </i>(lxxii. 274, lxxiii.
176) Schubart has given some description of the Vienna MSS., and a list of the
principal variants contained in them.</p>
<p>Lastly, Zotenberg<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> has made a useful list of
about 60 MSS., and has constructed a critical text of certain passages of
special interest. Nothing however has been attempted as yet in the way of a
genealogical classification of the MSS.; a work which will involve great labour,
but which is essential to the production of a satisfactory edition.</p>
<p>In editing the Remains of the Apology of Aristides I have used three MSS.,
which were kindly placed at my disposal in Cambridge. I have recorded their
variants with a greater completeness than is necessary for my present purpose,
in order to aid a future editor of the whole treatise in assigning them without
further trouble to their proper families.</p>
<p>(1) I have to thank Miss Algerina Peckover of Wisbech for kindly sending to
the University Library a MS. in her possession, which apparently belongs to the
beginning of the eleventh century. This Codex is specially interesting for the
pictures which a later hand has drawn in the margin, sometimes in ink and
sometimes in colours. It is unfortunately defective at the beginning and at the
end. It commences with the words [Greek]<i> </i>(Bois. p. 48), and ends
with&nbsp; [Greek]<i>&nbsp;</i> (Bois. p. 357). Unhappily it has been corrected
very largely throughout, and it is frequently impossible to discover the
original readings: those which are obviously by a later hand I have marked as W<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>(2) The authorities of Magdalen College, Oxford, with a like generosity
allowed me to use their codex, Gr. 4, side by side with <A NAME="p82"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|82</SPAN></A>
the Wisbech MS. in our Library. This bears the date 1064. It contains besides: a
Life of S. Basil, a tract on Images, the Martyrdom of SS. Galaction and
Episteme, a tract on Penalties, and a work of Anastasius Sinaiticus. It has
remained for the most part uncorrected.</p>
<p>(3) In the Library of Pembroke College, Cambridge, there is a MS. of the 17th
century, the readings of which are of sufficient interest to be recorded for the
present in spite of its late date;</p>
<p>In my <i>apparatus criticvs </i>these MSS. are referred to by the letters W,
M and P respectively. I have now and then recorded readings from the Vienna MSS.
collated by Schubart, using the signs V<sub>21</sub>, V<sub>102</sub>, &amp;c.,
where the figures correspond with Schubart's numbers. Wherever I have differed
from the text of Boissonade, I have recorded his readings, and sometimes I have
expressly mentioned his MSS., A, C and D. I have given in the margin of the
Greek text the reference to Boissonade's pages. Where it seemed desirable I have
recorded readings of the Latin Version, taking them from the Basel edition of
1539 mentioned above.</p>
<p align="center"><i>The Bearing of the Apology on the Canon.</i></p>
<p>There are but few references to the Books of Scripture in the Apology of
Aristides, which thus stands in striking contrast with the works of Justin. On
two occasions the Emperor is referred to Christian writings. In the first case a
written Gospel is distinctly implied, as the matter in hand is the outline of
our Lord's Life; the words in the Greek are <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>:
[Greek]<i> </i>(p. 110, 1. 21). The second reference is more general, and
possibly includes Books outside the Canon: [Greek]<i> </i>(p. 111, l. 24; cf.
Syr. supra p. 50 fin.). There are no direct quotations from the New Testament,
although the Apologist's diction is undoubtedly coloured at times by the
language of the Apostolic writers.</p>
<p>(1) The opening sentence recalls the words of 2 Macc. vii. 28: [Greek] <A NAME="p83"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|83</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) p. 100, l. 11. [Greek]<i>. </i>Cf. Col. i. 17,&nbsp; [Greek] (cf.&nbsp;
[Greek]<i> </i>in i. 16).</p>
<p>(3) p. 101, l. 6.&nbsp; [Greek]<i>. </i>This is clearly based on Rom. i, 25:&nbsp;
[Greek]<i>. </i>The addition of&nbsp; [Greek] is interesting. The Syriac
translator renders:<i> ' </i>and they began to serve created things instead of
the Creator of them'; he is probably led to make the change by the recollection
of the Syriac Version (Pesh.) in this passage, where the word ' Creator ' has
the suffix of the fem. plural.</p>
<p>(4) p. 104, l. 2.&nbsp; [Greek]<i>. </i>Cf. Rom. i. 22:&nbsp; [Greek]<i>.</i></p>
<p>(5) p. 107, l. 12.&nbsp; [Greek]<i>. </i>These words are a kind of echo,
although in a different sense, of Rom. vii. 8:&nbsp; [Greek]<i>.</i></p>
<p>(6) p. 109, l. 12.&nbsp; [Greek]<i>. </i>H&egrave;re again we seem to feel the
influence of the same chapter; Rom. vii. 12, 16,&nbsp; [Greek] (cf. 1 Tim. i.
8).</p>
<p>(7) p. 109, l. 26.&nbsp; [Greek]<i>. </i>The first part of this sentence has
affinities with Heb. xi. 8, 9,&nbsp; [Greek]<i>. </i>And the whole may be
compared with Acts xiii. 17,&nbsp; [Greek]<i>. </i>The second part of the phrase
however is not attested by the Syr. and Arm. Versions, and may possibly have
been introduced by the author of 'Barlaam and Josaph.it' from Ps. cxxxvi. 11,
12.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(8) p. 110, l. 2.&nbsp; [Greek]<i>. </i>This is a combination of words found
in S. Matt. xiii. 17,&nbsp; [Greek], and S. Matt, xxiii. <A NAME="p84"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|84</SPAN></A>
37 (cf. S. Luke xiii. 34)&nbsp; [Greek]<i>. </i>But here again we cannot be sure
that we have the words of Aristides himself. This last remark applies also to
the phrase,&nbsp; [Greek]<i> </i>(p. 110, 1. 9), which comes from Rom. x. 2.</p>
<p>(9) p. 110, l. 19.&nbsp; [Greek]<i> </i>clearly comes from Heb. ii. 9; but
the Syr. simply has 'He died,' and the Arm. has nothing at all to correspond.
Hence we cannot be certain that these are the words of Aristides. They probably
have replaced the statement preserved in the Syr. ' He was pierced by the Jews.'
Throughout this great Christological passage it is worth noting how the actual
phrases of the N. T. are not introduced.</p>
<p>(10) p. 111, l. 30.&nbsp; [Greek]<i>. </i>With this we may perhaps compare 1
Thess. ii. 13,&nbsp; [Greek]</p>
<p align="center"><i>The Apology and the Didach&eacute;.</i></p>
<p>A source from which our author has drawn part of his description of the life
and conduct of the Christians is the Two Ways, though it may well be doubted
whether he knew it in the form preserved to us in the Didach&eacute;. [...] <A NAME="p85"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|85</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we turn to the Epistle of Barnabas we find there the same parallels
which have been quoted from the Didach&eacute;, [...] <A NAME="p86"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|86</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible then that here we have a witness to the earlier Two Ways,
which has been variously embodied in the Didach&eacute; and the Epistle of Barnabas.</p>
<p>Some support may be given to this view when we observe that the wording of
the negative form of the Golden Rule in our Apology has a greater affinity to
the. famous interpolations in Codex Bczae than to the clause in the Didach&eacute;.
This appears partly from the position of the first negative, and partly from the
use of&nbsp; [Greek] rather than&nbsp; [Greek].</p>
<p>Let us bring the various texts together: [...]</p>
<p>It is hardly possible therefore to believe that Aristides can have drawn this
precept directly from the Didach&eacute; in the form in which we know it.</p>
<p align="center"><i>The Apology and the Preaching of Peter.</i></p>
<p>At the close of the Apology Aristides challenges the Emperor 'to examine the
writings of the Christians, from which he declares that the materials for his
defence are drawn: p. 111, l. 23:&nbsp; [Greek]:<i> </i>or, as it is more fully
said in the Syriac Version: ' Take now their writings and read in them, and lo !
ye will find that not of myself have I brought these things forward nor as their
advocate have I said them, but as I have read in their writings, these things I
firmly believe,' &amp;c.</p>
<p>We have seen already that he refers to a written Gospel for his statements as
to the life and work of our Lord. We have also seen that he has drawn part of
his description of the conduct of the Christians from the ' Two Ways.' Moreover
the Book of <A NAME="p87"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|87</SPAN></A> Wisdom seems to have
influenced his method and his language, in several parts of his work.</p>
<p>The following investigation will tend to shew that he owes a still greater
debt to a work now lost, which exercised a considerable influence upon the
writings of the second century.</p>
<p>The Preaching of Peter <i>(</i> [Greek]<i>) </i>is classed by Eusebius <i>(H
. E. </i>in. 3) together with his Acts, his Gospel and his Apocalypse as outside
the Canon of writings accepted by the universal Church ( [Greek]<i>). </i>He
goes on to say of these four books that none of the early writers or of his
contemporaries used quotations from them. This statement is however incorrect:
for Clement of Alexandria again and again quotes from both the Preaching and the
Apocalypse, as authoritative works. The Preaching of Peter then was one of those
books which, like the Didach&eacute;, the Epistle of Barnabas and the Shepherd of
Hennas, at one time claimed a place in the Canon; though its claim was
disallowed, even more emphatically perhaps than the claims of these other
competitors.</p>
<p>We must in the first instance gather together all the fragments which can be
assigned with certainty to this work<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>. For the
sake of clearness I have arranged them in the order in which it will be most
easy to compare them with our Apology.</p>
<p>Clem. Al. Strom. VI. 39 ff.&nbsp; [Greek] <A NAME="p88"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|88</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb>
<A NAME="p89">|89</A>&nbsp;</SPAN></p>
<p>Ibid. 48.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ibid. 43.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ibid. 128. <A NAME="p90"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|90</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have given above in full (with one exception; Clem. Strom. i. 182, [Greek])
all the indisputable fragments of the Preaching of Peter<sup>1</sup>: and the
parallels adduced from the Apology of Aristides shew that there is an intimate
connexion between the two documents.</p>
<p>Before going further into the interesting problem of the reconstruction of
the Preaching, let us inquire what light these parallels throw upon the relation
of the Syriac Version to the Greek text of the Apology.</p>
<p>(1) Several passages of the Syriac Version, quoted above in the notes, which
are wanting in the Greek as we now have it, are authenticated by their
similarity to portions of the Preaching.</p>
<p>Of these the most important are: <i>(a) </i>the worship of angels attributed
to the Jews; <i>(b) </i>the description of the Christians as a ' new people ';
(c) the confession of the converted heathen; <i>(d) </i>the attribution of our
Lord's sufferings to the Jews, Especially valuable are <i>(a) </i>and (c), as
giving us ground for believing that the great closing section of the Syriac
Version, which is so curtailed in the Greek, is substantially the writing of
Aristides himself.</p>
<p>(2) On the other hand, the division into three races, which we find in the
Greek, has the support of the famous&nbsp; [Greek] of the Preaching. The
fourfold division of the Syriac and Armenian Versions (Barbarians and Greeks,
Jews and Christians) comes therefore under grave suspicion: and the more we
examine it, the less primitive it appears. For to the Greek mind the Jews were
themselves Barbarians: see, for example, Clem. Strom, vi. 44,&nbsp; [Greek]<i>: </i>and
Orig. c. Cels. i. 2,&nbsp; [Greek]. Moreover there seems to be no parallel to
this fourfold classification of races in early Christian literature.</p>
<p>The Preaching of Peter is quoted by Heracleon (Orig. Comm. in Joan. xiii.
17), and we shall see that possibly it was used by <A NAME="p91"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|91</SPAN></A>
Celsus. It seems also to have been in the hands of the unknown writer of the
Epistle to Diognetus. Moreover in the Sibylline Oracles we have several passages
which seem to be based on it. Some of these are especially interesting, as
shewing coincidences with our Apology, though not with the existing fragments of
the Preaching <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A><i>.</i></p>
<p>Now if three or four extant works can be shewn to have drawn materials from a
document, which is known to us now only by a few fragments, there is obviously a
possibility that the lost document may be to some extent critically
reconstructed by a consideration of common matter found in any two of the works,
which may accordingly have been taken from the document in question. To attempt
to do this fully for the Preaching of Peter would be beyond our present scope:
but we may fairly consider here what contributions to such a reconstruction are
afforded by our Apology, which has apparently made so free a use of it.</p>
<p>Let us begin with those passages which either the Preaching or the Apology
have in common with <i>the Sibylline Oracles. </i>I shall not attempt a.
discrimination between the various writings which are gathered under the name of
the Sibyl, but shall simply give references to Alexandre 's edition of 1869.
Prooem. 7 ff. [...] <A NAME="p92"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|92</SPAN></A> <A NAME="p93"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|93</SPAN></A>
<A NAME="p94"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|94</SPAN></A> <A NAME="p95"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|95</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regard to the second passage, there is a still more striking parallel in
c. xvii., preserved to us only in the Syriac Version. <i>' </i>The Greeks then,
O king, because they practise foul things in sleeping with males, and with
mother and sister and daughter, turn the ridicule of their foulness upon the
Christians; but the Christians are honest and pious,' etc.</p>
<p>These coincidences are worth noting even if we are not prepared, with our
present knowledge, to suppose that they send us back for their explanation to
the Preaching of Peter.</p>
<p>Next let us turn to <i>the Epistle to Diognetus. </i>As soon as the Armenian
fragment of Aristides was discovered, it was observed that it had points in
common with this anonymous Epistle. The coincidences have multiplied greatly
with our larger knowledge of the Apology. Several of them have been quoted by Mr
Harris in his notes, but it is necessary for our present purpose to bring them
together again under one view. I shall do this in the briefest possible form,
giving in the footnotes references to such parallels in the Apology as have not
already been quoted above. [...] <A NAME="p96"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|96</SPAN></A> <A NAME="p97"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|97</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cannot account for these parallels by merely supposing that Aristides had
the Epistle to Diognetus before him: for there are many points in common between
Aristides and the Preaching of Peter, such as the worship of angels ascribed to
the Jews, which do not appear in the Epistle. Nor will the converse hypothesis
hold good. For, to take one instance out of several, the phrase in the Epistle
[Greek]<i> </i>is directly parallel to [Greek]<i> </i>in the Preaching; but it
has no counterpart in form in the Apology.</p>
<p>Here again then we are guided to the hypothesis that the Preaching lies
behind both of these works. Can we gain anything further in the way of its
reconstruction? [...] <A NAME="p98"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|98</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Harris has collected (pp. 23 ff.) several instances of contact between the
Apology of Aristides and <i>the True Word of Celsus; </i>and he has suggested
that Celsus may have had the Apology in his hands when he wrote his attack upon
Christianity. We are now in a position to see that most of the coincidences
which have been pointed out would be accounted for by the supposition that it
was the Preaching of Peter itself, and not our Apology, which, like ' Jason and
Papiscus ' and other apocryphal writings, supplied the materials of his attack.</p>
<p>It will be more satisfactory to present the evidence in full as we have done
in the previous cases, even at the risk of some repetition. I shall follow the
order of Origen's reply. [...] <A NAME="p99"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|99</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not easy on the evidence here collected to say whether it was the
Preaching of Peter or the Apology of Aristides which lay before Celsus, but we
can hardly doubt that it must have been one or the other. The statement that the
world was made for the sake of man does not find a place in the recognised
fragments of the Preaching; but we have given good reasons for believing that it
was contained in it. On the other hand, the Apology gives no starting point for
the attack of Celsus on Jewish prophecies about the Messiah, whereas the
Preaching laid great stress on this point (see above, p. 89).&nbsp;</p>
