          <FONT SIZE="3"><b>I.</b> I, O King, by the grace of God came into this<BR>
          world; and when I had considered the heaven and the<BR>
          earth and the seas, and had surveyed the sun and<BR>
          the rest of creation, I marvelled at the beauty of the <br>
          world. And I perceived that the world and all that<BR>
          is therein are moved by the power of another; and<BR>
          I understood that he who moves them is God, who</FONT><BR>
          <FONT SIZE="3">is hidden in them, and veiled by them. And it is<BR>
          manifest that that which causes motion is more<BR>
          powerful than that which is moved. But that I<BR>
          should make search concerning this same mover of<BR>
          all, as to what is his nature (for it seems to me,<BR>
          he is indeed unsearchable in his nature), and that<BR>
          I should argue as to the constancy of his government, <br>
          so as to grasp it fully,----this is a vain effort<BR>
          for me; for it is not possible that a man should fully<BR>
          comprehend it. I say, however, concerning this<BR>
          mover of the world, that he is God of all, who made<BR>
          all things for the sake of mankind. And it seems to<BR>
          me that this is reasonable, that one should fear God<BR>
          and should not oppress man.</FONT></P>
        <P> 
          <FONT SIZE="3">I say, then, that God is not born, not made, an<BR>
          ever-abiding nature without beginning and without<br>
        end, immortal, perfect, and incomprehensible.<BR>
  Now when I say that he is &quot;perfect,&quot; this means<BR>
  that there is not in him any defect, and he is not in<BR>
  need of anything but all things are in need of him.<BR>
  And when I say that he is &quot;without beginning,&quot; this<BR>
  means that everything which has beginning has also<BR>
  an end, and that which has an end may be brought<BR>
  to an end. He has no name, for everything which<BR>
  has a name is kindred to things created. Form he<BR>
        has none, nor yet any union of members; for whatsoever <br>
        possesses these is kindred to things fashioned.<BR>
  He is neither male nor female.<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> The heavens do<BR>
  not limit him, but the heavens and all things, visible<BR>
  and invisible, receive their bounds from him. <br>
        Adversary he has none, for there exists not any stronger<BR>
  than he. Wrath and indignation he possesses not,<BR>
  for there is nothing which is able to stand against<BR>
  him. Ignorance and forgetfulness are not in his<BR>
  nature, for he is altogether wisdom and understanding; <br>
        and in Him stands fast all that exists. <br>
        He requires not sacrifice and libation, nor even one of<BR>

Further they who pay homage <br>
to many gods are themselves divided <br>
into three classes, Chaldaeans<BR>

  God, so far as our discourse can bear upon him, let<BR>
  us now come to the race of men, that we may know<BR>
  which of them participate in the truth of which we<BR>

</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">This is clear to you, O King, that there are four<BR>
  classes of men in this world:----Barbarians and Greeks,<BR>
  Jews and Christians. The Barbarians, indeed, trace<BR>
  the origin of their kind of religion from Kronos and<BR>
  from Rhea and their other gods; the Greeks, however, <br>
from Helenos, who is said to be sprung from<BR>
  Zeus. And by Helenos there were born Aiolos and<BR>
  Xuthos; and there were others descended from<BR>
  Inachos and Phoroneus, and lastly from the Egyptian<BR>
  Danaos and from Kadmos and from Dionysos.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">The Jews, again, trace the origin of their race from<BR>
  Abraham, who begat Isaac, of whom was born Jacob.<BR>
  And he begat twelve sons who migrated from Syria<BR>
  to Egypt; and there they were called the nation of<BR>
  the Hebrews, by him who made their laws; and at<BR>
  length they were named Jews.</FONT><BR>

<P> <FONT SIZE="3">The Christians, then, trace the beginning of their<BR>
  religion from Jesus the Messiah; and he is named<BR>
  the Son of God Most High. And it is said that God<BR>
  came down from heaven, and from a Hebrew virgin<BR>
  assumed and clothed himself with flesh; and the Son<BR>
  of God lived in a daughter of man. This is taught<BR>
  in the gospel, as it is called, which a short time ago<BR>
  was preached among them; and you also if you will<BR>
  read therein, may perceive the power which belongs<BR>
  to it. This Jesus, then, was born of the race of the<BR>
  Hebrews; and he had twelve disciples in order that<BR>
  the purpose of his incarnation <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> might in time be 
<br>
accomplished. But he himself was pierced by the Jews,<BR>
  and he died and was buried; and they say that after<BR>
  three days he rose and ascended to heaven. Thereupon <br>
these twelve disciples went forth throughout<BR>
  the known parts of the world, and kept showing his<BR>
  greatness with all modesty and uprightness. And<BR>
  hence also those of the present day who believe that<BR>
  preaching are called Christians, and they are become<BR>
  famous.</FONT><BR>

<P> <FONT SIZE="3">The Chaldaeans, then, not knowing <br>
God went astray after the elements <br>
and began to worship the<BR>
  creation more than their Creator.<BR>
  And of these they formed certain<BR>
  shapes and styled them a representation <br>
of the heaven and the earth and<BR>
  the sea, of the sun too and the moon<BR>
  and the other primal bodies or<BR>
  luminaries. And they shut them up<BR>
  together in shrines, and worship<BR>
  them, calling them gods, even though<BR>
  they have to guard them securely<BR>
  for fear they should be stolen by<BR>
  robbers. And they did not perceive<BR>
  that anything which acts as guard<BR>
  is greater than that which is guarded,<BR>
  and that he who makes is greater<BR>
  than that which is made. For if<BR>
  their gods are unfit to look after<BR>
  their own safety, how shall they <br>
bestow protection upon others? <br>
Great then is the error into which the <br>
Chaldaeans wandered in adoring <br>
lifeless
  and good-for-nothing images.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">And it occurs to me as surprising,<BR>
  O King, how it is that their so-called<BR>
  philosophers have quite failed to <br>
observe that the elements themselves<BR>
  are perishable. And if the elements<BR>
  are perishable and subject to necessity, <br>
how are they gods? And if the<BR>

  to be gods?</FONT><BR>

<P> <FONT SIZE="3">The Barbarians, then, as they did not apprehend<BR>
  God, went astray among the elements, and began to<BR>

  up in shrines, and lo! they worship them, guarding<BR>
  them the while with much care, lest their gods be<BR>
  stolen by robbers. And the Barbarians did not observe <br>
that that which acts as guard is greater than<BR>
  that which is guarded, and that every one who<BR>
  creates is greater than that which is created. If<BR>
  it be, then, that their gods are too feeble to see to<BR>
  their own safety, how will they take thought for the<BR>
  safety of men? Great then is the error into which<BR>
  the Barbarians wandered in worshipping lifeless<BR>
  images which can do nothing to help them. And<BR>
  I am led to wonder, O King, at their philosophers,<BR>
  how that even they went astray, and gave the name<BR>
  of gods to images which were made in honour of<BR>
  the elements; and that their sages did not perceive<BR>
  that the elements also are dissoluble and perishable.<BR>
  For if a small part of an element is dissolved or destroyed, <br>
the whole of it may be dissolved and destroyed. <br>
If then the elements themselves are dissolved <br>
and destroyed and forced to be subject to another <br>
that is more stubborn than they, and if they are<BR>
  not in their nature gods, why, forsooth, do they call<BR>
  the images which are made in their honour, God?<BR>

  the sky with its luminaries moves<BR>

others rising, they traverse their<BR>

  fails and ceases at the command of him who controls<BR>

<P> <FONT SIZE="3"><b>IX. </b>&nbsp;Let us proceed further to their account of<BR>
  their gods that we may carefully demonstrate all that<BR>
  is said above. First of all, the Greeks bring forward<BR>
  as a god Kronos, that is to say Chiun <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> (Saturn).<BR>
  And his worshippers sacrifice their children to him,<BR>
  and they burn some of them alive in his honour.<BR>
  And they say that he took to him among his wives<BR>
  Rhea, and begat many children by her. By her too<BR>
  he begat Dios, who is called Zeus. And at length he<BR>
  (Kronos) went mad, and through fear of an oracle<BR>
  that had been made known to him, he began to devour <br>
his sons. And from him Zeus was stolen away<BR>
  without his knowledge; and at length Zeus bound<BR>
  him, and mutilated the signs of his manhood, and<BR>
  flung them into the sea. And hence, as they say in<BR>
  fable, there was engendered Aphrodite, who is called<BR>
  Astarte. And he (Zeus) cast out Kronos fettered<br>
into darkness. Great then is the error and ignominy<BR>
  which the Greeks have brought forward about the<BR>
  first of their gods, in that they have said all this<BR>
  about him, O King. It is impossible that a god<BR>
  should be bound or mutilated; and if it be otherwise, <br>
he is indeed miserable.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">And after Kronos they bring forward another god<BR>
  Zeus. And they say of him that he assumed the<BR>
  sovereignty, and was king over all the gods. And<BR>
  they say that he changed himself into a beast and<BR>
  other shapes in order to seduce mortal women, and to<BR>
  raise up by them children for himself. Once, they<BR>
  say, he changed himself into a bull through love of<BR>
  Europe and Pasiphae.<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> And again he changed himself 
<br>
into the likeness of gold through love of Danae,<BR>
  and to a swan through love of Leda, and to a man<BR>
  through love of Antiope, and to lightning through<BR>
  love of Luna,<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> and so by these he begat many children. 
<br>
For by Antiope, they say, that he begat Zethus <br>
and Amphion, and by Luna Dionysos, by Alcmena <br>
Hercules, and by Leto, Apollo and Artemis, and<BR>
  by Danae, Perseus, and by Leda, Castor and Polydeuces, <br>
and Helene and Paludus,<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> and by Mnemosyne<BR>
  he begat nine daughters whom they styled the Muses,<BR>
  and by Europe, Minos and Rhadamanthos and Sarpedon. <br>

of an eagle through his passion for Ganydemos<BR>
  (Ganymede) the shepherd.</FONT><BR>

<P> <FONT SIZE="3">By reason of these tales, O King, much evil has<BR>
  arisen among men, who to this day are imitators of<BR>
  their gods, and practise adultery and defile them- <BR>

  lying with males, and some make bold to slay even<BR>
  their parents. For if he who, is said to be the chief<BR>
  and king of their gods do these things how much<BR>
  more should his worshippers imitate him? And<BR>
  great is the folly which the Greeks have brought <br>
forward in their narrative concerning him. For it is<BR>

  but at other times she is a neighbour to men. And<BR>
  once she had Ares as a lover, and again Adonis who<BR>
  is Tammuz. Once also, Aphrodite was wailing and<BR>
  weeping for the death of Tammuz, and they say that<BR>
  she went down to Sheol that she might redeem<BR>
  Adonis from Persephone, who is the daughter of<BR>
  Sheol (Hades). If then Aphrodite is a goddess and<BR>
  was unable to help her lover at his death, how will<BR>
  she find it possible to help others? And this cannot<BR>
  be listened to, that a divine nature should come to<BR>
  weeping and wailing and adultery.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">And again they say of Tammuz that he is a god.<BR>
  And he is, forsooth! a hunter and an adulterer. And<BR>
  they say that he was killed by a wound from a wild<BR>
  boar, without being able to help himself. And if he<BR>
  could not help himself, how can he take thought for<BR>
  the human race? But that a god should be an adulterer <br>
or a hunter or should die by violence is <br>
impossible.</FONT><BR>

<P> <FONT SIZE="3">Again they say of Rhea that she is the mother of<BR>
  their gods. And they say that she had once a lover<BR>
  Atys, and that she used to delight in depraved men.<BR>
  And at last she raised a lamentation and mourned<BR>
  for Atys her lover. If then the mother of their gods<BR>
  was unable to help her lover and deliver him from<BR>
  death, how can she help others? So it is disgraceful<BR>
  that a goddess should lament and weep and take <br>
delight in depraved men.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">Again they introduce Kore and say that she is a<BR>
  goddess, and she was stolen away by Pluto, and could<BR>
  not help herself. If then she is a goddess and was<BR>
  unable to help herself how will she find means to<BR>
  help others? For a god who is stolen away is very<BR>
  powerless.</FONT><BR>

  did not suffice for them, but they introduced some<BR>
  also of the nature of the animals, and said thereof<BR>
  that they were gods, and likewise of creeping things<BR>
  which are found on the dry land and in the waters.<BR>
  And of plants and herbs they said that some of them<BR>

  of delusion and defilement more than every people</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">that is on the earth. For from ancient times they<BR>
  worshipped Isis, and they say that she is a goddess<BR>
  whose husband was Osiris her brother. And when<BR>
  Osiris was killed by Typhon his brother, Isis fled with<BR>
  Horos her son to Byblus in Syria, and was there for a<BR>
  certain time till her son was grown. And he contended <br>
with Typhon his uncle, and killed him. And<BR>
  then Isis returned and went about with Horos her son<BR>
  and sought for the dead body of Osiris her lord, <br>
bitterly lamenting his death. If then Isis be a goddess,<BR>
  and could not help Osiris her brother and lord, how<BR>
  can she help another? But it is impossible that a<BR>
  divine nature should be afraid, and flee for safety, or<BR>
  should weep and wail; or else it is very miserable.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">And of Osiris also they say that he is a serviceable<BR>
  god. And he was killed by Typhon and was unable<BR>
  to help himself. But it is well known that this<BR>
  cannot be asserted of divinity. And further, they say<BR>
  of his brother Typhon that he is a god, who killed his<BR>
  brother and was killed by his brother's son and by his<BR>
  bride, being unable to help himself. And how, pray,<BR>
  is he a god who does not save himself?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">As the Egyptians, then, were more stupid than the<BR>

<P> <FONT SIZE="3"><b>XIII. </b>&nbsp;So the Egyptians and the<BR>
  Chaldaeans and the Greeks made a<BR>

  beings as gods, and in making images<BR>
  of them, and in deifying dumb and<BR>
  senseless idols.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">And I wonder how they saw their<BR>

  docked by the workmen, and besides<BR>
  aging with time and falling to<BR>

  and yet did not discern concerning<BR>

<P> <FONT SIZE="3">For when they have no power to<BR>

  take forethought for men?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">But further, the poets and philosophers, <br>
alike of the Chaldaeans and<BR>
  the Greeks and the Egyptians, while<BR>
  they desired by their poems and<BR>
  writings to magnify the gods of their<BR>
  countries, rather revealed their<BR>
  shame, and laid it bare before all</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">men. For if the body of man while<BR>
  consisting of many parts does not cast<BR>
  off any of its own members, but <br>
preserving an unbroken unity in all its<BR>
  members, is harmonious with itself,<BR>
  how shall variance and discord be<BR>
  so great in the nature of God?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">For if there had been a unity of<BR>
  nature among the gods, then one<BR>
  god ought not to have pursued or<BR>
  slain or injured another. And if<BR>
  the gods were pursued by gods, and<BR>
  slain, and kidnapped and struck<BR>
  with lightning by them, then there is<BR>
  no longer any unity of nature, but<br>
divided counsels, all mischievous.<BR>
  So that not one of them is a god.<BR>
  It is clear then, O King, that all<BR>
  their discourse on the nature of the<BR>
  gods is an error.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">But how did the wise and erudite<BR>
  men of the Greeks not observe that<BR>
  inasmuch as they make laws for<BR>
  themselves they are judged by their<BR>
  own laws? For if the laws are<BR>
  righteous, their gods are altogether<BR>
  unrighteous, as they have committed<BR>
  transgressions of laws, in slaying<BR>
  one another, and practising sorceries, <br>
and adultery and thefts and<BR>
  intercourse with males. If they<BR>
  were right in doing these things,<BR>
  then the laws are unrighteous, being<BR>
  framed contrary to the gods. Whereas <br>
in fact, the laws are good and<BR>
  just, commending what is good and<BR>
  forbidding what is bad. But the<BR>
  deeds of their gods are contrary to<BR>
  law. Their gods, therefore, are<BR>
  lawbreakers, and all liable to the<BR>
  punishment of death; and they are<BR>
  impious men who introduce such<BR>
  gods. For if the stories about them<BR>
  be mythical, the gods are nothing<BR>
  more than mere names; and if the<BR>
  stories be founded on nature, still<BR>
  they who did and suffered these<BR>
  things are no longer gods; and if<BR>
  the stories be allegorical, they are<BR>
  myths and nothing more.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">It has been shown then, O King,<BR>
  that all these polytheistic objects of<BR>
  worship are the works of error and<BR>
  perdition. For it is not right to give<BR>
  the name of gods to beings which<BR>
  may be seen but cannot see; but one<BR>
  ought to reverence the invisible and<BR>
  all-seeing and all-creating God.</FONT><BR>

<P> <FONT SIZE="3"><b>XIII</b>.&nbsp; But it is a marvel, O King, with regard to<BR>
  the Greeks, who surpass all other peoples in their <br>
manner of life and reasoning, how they have gone astray <br>
after dead idols and lifeless images. And yet they see<BR>
  their gods in the hands of their artificers being sawn<BR>
  out, and planed and docked, and hacked short, and<BR>
  charred, and ornamented, and being altered by them<BR>
  in every kind of way. And when they grow old, and<BR>
  are worn away through lapse of time, and when they<BR>
  are molten and crushed to powder, how, I wonder,<BR>
  did they not perceive concerning them, that they are<BR>
  not gods? And as for those who did not find deliverance <br>
for themselves, how can they serve the distress of men?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">But even the writers and philosophers among them<BR>
  have wrongly alleged that the gods are such as are<BR>
  made in honour of God Almighty. And they err in<BR>
  seeking to liken (them) to God whom man has not at<BR>
  any time seen nor can see unto what He is like.<BR>
  Herein, too (they err) in asserting of deity that any<BR>
  such thing as deficiency can be present to it; as when<BR>
  they say that He receives sacrifice and requires burnt-<BR>
  offering and libation and immolations of men, and<BR>
  temples. But God is not in need, and none of these<BR>
  things is necessary to Him; and it is clear that men<BR>
  err in these things they imagine.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">Further their writers and their philosophers represent <br>
and declare that the nature of all their gods<BR>
  is one. And they have not apprehended God our<BR>
  Lord who while He is one, is in all. They err<BR>
  therefore. For if the body of a man while it is many<BR>
  in its parts is not in dread, one member of another,<BR>
  but, since it is a united body, wholly agrees with <br>
itself; even so also God is one in His nature. A<BR>
  single essence is proper to Him, since He is uniform<BR>
  in His nature and His essence; and He is not afraid</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="3">of Himself. If then the nature of the gods is one,<BR>
  it is not proper that a god should either pursue or slay<BR>
  or harm a god. If, then, gods be pursued and wounded<BR>
  by gods, and some be kidnapped and some struck<BR>
  dead by lightning, it is obvious that the nature of<BR>
  their gods is not one. And hence it is known, O<BR>
  King, that it is a mistake when they reckon and<BR>
  bring the natures of their gods under a single<br>
nature. If then it becomes us to admire a god<BR>
  which is seen and does not see, how much more<BR>
  praiseworthy is it that one should believe in a nature<BR>
  which is invisible and all-seeing? And if further it<BR>
  is fitting that one should approve the handiworks of<BR>
  a craftsman, how much more is it fitting that one<BR>
  should glorify the Creator of the craftsman?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">For behold! when the Greeks made laws they did<BR>
  not perceive that by their laws they condemn their<BR>
  gods. For if their laws are righteous, their gods<BR>
  are unrighteous, since they transgressed the law in<BR>
  killing one another, and practising sorcery, and<BR>
  committing adultery, and in robbing and stealing,<BR>
  and in lying with males, and by their other practises <br>
as well. For if their gods were right in doing<BR>
  all these things as they are described, then the laws<BR>
  of the Greeks are unrighteous in not being made <br>
according to the will of their gods. And in that case<BR>
  the whole world is gone astray.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P> <FONT SIZE="3">For the narratives about their gods are some of<BR>
  them myths, and some of them nature-poems (lit:<BR>
  natural----<font face="SPIonic">fusikai/</font>), and some of them hymns and<BR>
  elegies. The hymns indeed and elegies are empty<BR>
  words and noise. But these nature-poems, even if<BR>
  they be made as they say, still those are not gods who<BR>
  do such things and suffer and endure such things.<BR>
  And those myths are shallow tales with no depth<BR>
  whatever in them.</FONT><BR>

  food. They observe the precepts of their Messiah<BR>
  with much care, living justly and soberly as the Lord<BR>
  their God commanded them. Every morning<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> and<BR>
  every hour they give thanks and praise to God for<BR>
  His loving-kindnesses toward them; and for their food<BR>
  and their drink they offer thanksgiving to Him.<BR>
  And if any righteous man among them passes from<BR>
  the world, they rejoice and offer thanks to God; and<BR>
  they escort his body as if he were setting out from<BR>
  one place to another near. And when a child has<BR>
  been born to one of them, they give thanks to God;<br>
      and if moreover it happen to die in childhood, they<BR>
  give thanks to God the more, as for one who has<BR>
  passed through the world without sins. And further<BR>
  if they see that any one of them dies in his ungodliness <br>
      or in his sins, for him they grieve bitterly, and<BR>
  sorrow as for one who goes to meet his doom.</FONT><BR>

  And verily, they are those who found the truth when<BR>

though they know the error of these (the

it; and for the most part they have compassion <br>

committed them in ignorance in the former time, when<BR>

<P> <A NAME="#1"></A>1.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> The superscription seems to be duplicate in the Syriac. It is 
  absent from the Greek as we have it; the Armenian has &quot; To the Emperor 
  Caesar Hadrian trom Aristides.&quot; Various explanations are offered, </P>
<P> (a) Both emperors, as colleagues, may be meant. In support of this the Syriac 
  adjectives for &quot;venerable and merciful&quot; are marked plural; the phrase 
  &quot;Your majesty&quot; occurring later has a plural suffix; and two Imperatives, 
  &quot;Take and read,&quot; are plural. On the other hand &quot;O King&quot; 
  occurs constantly in the singular; and the emperors were colleagues only for 
  a few months in the year A.D. 138.</P>
<P> (b) The longer heading is the true one----the shorter being due perhaps to 
  a scribe who had a collection of works to copy. In that case the word &quot;Hadrian&quot; 
  has been selected from the full title of Antonine, and the two adjectives &quot;venerable 
  and merciful&quot; are proper names, Augustus Pius. (Harris.)</P>
<P> (c) The shorter heading has the support of Eusebius and the Armenian version; 
  and the translator into Syriac may have amplified. </P>
<P>[Syriac] Almighty is separated from the word for &quot;God&quot; by a pause, and is 
  not an attribute which a Christian would care to apply to a Roman emperor. <font face="SPIonic"> pantokra&amp;twr</font><I> 
  </I>may have been confounded with <font face="SPIonic"> au)tokra&amp;wr</font>. Raabe supplies [Syriac] 
  giving the sense &quot;qui Imperium (poetatem) habet,&quot; as an epithet of 
  Caesar. If ... [Syriac] =&quot;Renewed, or dedicated again to. . . Antoninus 
  Pius,&quot; could be read, both headings might be retained.</P>
<P> <A NAME="#2"></A>2.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> The Greek might be rendered, &quot;so far as there was room for 
  me to speak of Him,&quot; i.e., the attributes of the Deity are not further
  relevant to the discussion----as the translator into Syriac takes it. The Armenian 
  adopts the other meaning, viz., the theme is beyond
  man's power to discuss. As translated by F. C. Conybeare, the Armenian is in 
  these words: &quot;Now by the grace of God it was given
  me to speak wisely concerning Him. So far as I have received the faculty I will 
  speak, yet not according to the measure of the
  inscrutability of His greatness shall I be able to do so, but by faith alone 
  do I glorify and adore Him.&quot;</P>
<P> <A NAME="#3"></A>3.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> The &quot;King&quot; in the Greek is Abenner, the father of Josaphat; 
  in the Syriac, as in the Greek originally, he is the Roman Emperor. Hadrian.</P>
<P> <A NAME="#4"></A>4.&nbsp;<SUP>3</SUP> The Armenian and Syriac agree to giving four races, which was 
  probably the original division. To a Greek, men were either
  Greeks or Barbarians: to a Greek Christian it would seem necessary to add two 
  new peoples, Jews and Christians. The Greek calls
  the Barbarians &quot;Chaldaeans.&quot; This change of classification is probably 
  the cause of the omission in the Greek of the preliminary
  accounts of the four classes. The Greek blends the summaries with the fuller 
  accounts.</P>
<P> <A NAME="#5"></A>5.&nbsp;<SUP>4</SUP> The Armenian adds, &quot;For that which is subject to this distinction 
  is moved by passions.&quot;
</P>
<P> <A NAME="#6"></A>6.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Literally: &quot;a certain dispensation of his.&quot; The Greek 
  term <font face="SPIonic">oi0konomi/a</font>, &quot;dispensation,&quot; suggests to the translator into 
  Syriac
  the idea of the Incarnation, familiar, as it seems, by his time. Professor Sachau 
  reads the equivalent of <font face="SPIonic">qaumasth&amp;</font> instead of [Syriac] (<font face="SPIonic">tij</font>). In the translation given [Syriac] is taken adverbially=aliquamdiu.</P>
<P> <A NAME="#7"></A>7.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> This irrelevant sentence is found in the Armenian version also, 
  and therefore was probably in the original Greek. It seems
  to be an <I>obiter dictum. </I>Men fall into four groups, and, by the way, so 
  do the elements, air, fire, earth, and water; and the powers
  that govern them. One quaternion suggests others.</P>
<P> <A NAME="#8"></A>8.&nbsp;<SUP>3</SUP> Cf. Rom. i. 25 and Col. ii. 8.
</P>
<P> <A NAME="#9"></A>9.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> &quot;I do not think it out of place here to mention Antinous 
  of our day [a slave of the Emperor Hadrian], whom all, not- <BR>
  withstanding they knew who and whence he was, yet affected to worship as a god.&quot;----Justin 
  Martyr quoted in Eusebius Hist.<BR>
  Bk. IV., c. 8.</P>
<P> <A NAME="#10"></A>10.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> Or &quot;and hence the world also gets its name 
<font face="SPIonic">ko&amp;smoj</font>.&quot; 
  The Syriac is the equivalent of the Greek &quot;<font face="SPIonic">dio_ kai\ ko&amp;smoj kalei=tai</font>,',<BR>
  which occurs (Chap. IV.) in discussing the supposed divinity of the sky or heaven.
</P>
<P> <A NAME="#11"></A>11.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> The passage in brackets occurs earlier in &quot;Barlaam and Josaphat,&quot;

  43.<BR>
</P>
<P> <A NAME="#14"></A>14.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Pasiphae's unnatural passion for Taurus is not in the Greek mythology 
  charged to Zeus.</P>
<P> <A NAME="#15"></A>15.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> The visit of Zeus to Semele (not Selene) is evidently referred 
  to. <font face="SPIonic">Selh&amp;nh</font> Luna would give the Syriac [Syriac]</P>
<P> <A NAME="#16"></A>16.&nbsp;<SUP>3</SUP> Professor Rendel Harris pronounces &quot;Paludus&quot; a <I>vox 
  nihili, </I>and explains its presence as due to a corrupt repetition of the 
  pre- <BR>
  ceding Polydeuces. The Syriac word in the text suggests Pollux----the Latin 
  equivalent of Polydeuces. Clytemnestra is the name re- <BR>
  quired.

<P> <A NAME="#18"></A>18.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> Tyrant,&quot; [Syriac] seems out of place when connected with 
  Herakles. Perhaps [Syriac] =ebrius, which occurs at the close of<BR>
  the paragraph, should be read here. Cf. also the Greek.
</P>
<P> <A NAME="#19"></A>19.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> This, the &quot;Christological&quot; passage, occurs earlier

<P> <A NAME="#20"></A>20.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> The same two words are used of Isis. The Christians are unlike

</P>
<P> <A NAME="#21"></A>21.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> The Armenian agrees with the Greek against the Syriac. &quot;Una 
  cum Spiritu Sancto &quot; Arm.</P>
<P> <A NAME="#22"></A>22.&nbsp;<SUP>2</SUP> Cf. Pliny's letter to the Emperor Trajan, A.D. 112, &quot; The 
  Christians are wont to meet at dawn on an appointed day, and to sing a<BR>
  hymn to Christ as God.&quot;
</P>
<P> <A NAME="#23"></A>23.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> The reference is to Josaphat, son of Abenner, who was taught 
  to be a Christian by the monk Barlaam.
</P>
<P> <A NAME="#24"></A>24.&nbsp;<SUP>1</SUP> The Christian Scriptures are previously referred to as a source 
  of information, not as containing difficulties. cf 2 Peter iii. 16.</P>
<P> <A NAME="#25"></A>25.&nbsp;<SUP>2 </SUP>Nachor, the fictitious monk who represented Barlaam, intended 
  to make a weak defence of Christianity, but, according<BR>
  to the story, he was constrained to speak what he had not intended. It is evidently 
  the author's intention to make it an instance of<BR>
  &quot;suggestio verborum&quot; or plenary inspiration, in the case of the fictitious 
  monk.
