<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter I.-We Ought to Think Highly of Christ.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Brethren, it is fitting that you should think of Jesus Christ as of God,-as the Judge of the living and the dead. And it does not become us<SUP><A HREF="#P7664_2518033">2</A></SUP> to think lightly<SUP><A HREF="#P7665_2518204">3</A></SUP> of our salvation; for if we think little<SUP><A HREF="#P7666_2518307">4</A></SUP> of Him, we shall also hope but to obtain little <I>from Him</I>. And those of us<SUP><A HREF="#P7667_2518443">5</A></SUP> who hear carelessly of these things, as if they were of small importance, commit sin, not knowing whence we have been called, and by whom, and to what place, and how much Jesus Christ submitted to suffer for our sakes. What return, then, shall we make to Him? or what fruit that shall be worthy of that which He has given to us? For,<SUP><A HREF="#P7668_2518998">6</A></SUP> indeed, how great are the benefits<SUP><A HREF="#P7669_2519145">7</A></SUP> which we owe to Him! He has graciously given us light; as a Father, He has called us sons; He has saved us when we were ready to perish. What praise, then, shall we give to Him, or what return shall we make for the things which we have received?<SUP><A HREF="#P7670_2519420">8</A></SUP> We were deficient<SUP><A HREF="#P7671_2519461">9</A></SUP> in understanding, worshipping stones and wood, and gold, and silver, and brass, the works of men's hand;<SUP><A HREF="#P7672_2519589">10</A></SUP> and our whole life was nothing else than death. Involved in blindness, and with such darkness<SUP><A HREF="#P7673_2519745">11</A></SUP> before our eyes, we have received sight, and through His will have laid aside that cloud by which we were enveloped. For He had compassion on us, and mercifully saved us, observing the many errors in which we were entangled, as well as the destruction to which we were exposed,<SUP><A HREF="#P7674_2520083">12</A></SUP> and that we had<SUP><A HREF="#P7675_2520165">13</A></SUP> no hope of salvation except it came to us from Him. For He called us when we were not,<SUP><A HREF="#P7676_2520382">14</A></SUP> and willed that out of nothing we should attain a real existence.<SUP><A HREF="#P7677_2520493">15</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P7679_2520564"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter II.-The Church, Formerly Barren, is Now Fruitful.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>"Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for she that is desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband."<SUP><A HREF="#P7681_2520790">16</A></SUP> In that He said, "Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not," He referred to us, for our Church was barren before that children were given to her. But when He said, "Cry out, thou that travailest not," He means this, that we should sincerely offer up our prayers to God, and should not, like women in travail, show signs of weakness.<SUP><A HREF="#P7682_2521178">17</A></SUP> And in that He said, "For she that is desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband," <I>He means</I> that<SUP><A HREF="#P7683_2521495">18</A></SUP> our people seemed to be outcast from God, but now, through believing, have become more numerous than those who are reckoned to possess God.<SUP><A HREF="#P7684_2521710">19</A></SUP> And another Scripture saith, "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."<SUP><A HREF="#P7685_2521861">20</A></SUP> This means that those who are perishing must be saved. For it is indeed a great and admirable thing to establish, not the things which are standing, but these that are falling. Thus also did Christ desire<SUP><A HREF="#P7686_2522199">21</A></SUP> to save the things which were perishing,<SUP><A HREF="#P7687_2522300">22</A></SUP> and has saved many by coming and calling us when hastening to destruction.<SUP><A HREF="#P7688_2522422">23</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P7690_2522474"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter III.-The Duty of Confessing Christ.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Since, then, He has displayed so great mercy towards us, and especially in this respect, that we who are living should not offer sacrifices to gods that are dead, or pay them worship, but should attain through Him to the knowledge of the true Father,<SUP><A HREF="#P7692_2522769">24</A></SUP> whereby shall we show that we do indeed know Him,<SUP><A HREF="#P7693_2522905">25</A></SUP> but by not denying Him through whom this knowledge has been attained? For He Himself declares,<SUP><A HREF="#P7694_2523225">26</A></SUP> "Whosoever shall confess Me before men, him will I confess before My Father."<SUP><A HREF="#P7695_2523373">27</A></SUP> This, then, is our reward if we shall confess Him by whom we have been saved. But in what way shall we confess Him? By doing what He says, and not transgressing His commandments, and by honouring Him not with our lips only, but with all our heart and all our mind.<SUP><A HREF="#P7696_2523656">28</A></SUP> For He says<SUP><A HREF="#P7697_2523695">29</A></SUP> in Isaiah, "This people honoureth Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me."<SUP><A HREF="#P7698_2523813">30</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P7700_2523832"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter IV.-True Confession of Christ.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Let us, then, not only call Him Lord, for that will not save us. For He saith, "Not every one that saith to Me, Lord, Lord, shall be saved, but he that worketh righteousness."<SUP><A HREF="#P7702_2524047">31</A></SUP> Wherefore, brethren, let us confess Him by<SUP><A HREF="#P7703_2524126">32</A></SUP> our works, by loving one another, by not committing adultery, or speaking evil of one another, or cherishing envy; but being continent, compassionate, and good. We ought also to sympathize with one another, and not be avaricious. By such<SUP><A HREF="#P7704_2524391">33</A></SUP> works let us confess Him,<SUP><A HREF="#P7705_2524498">34</A></SUP> and not by those that are of an opposite kind. And it is not fitting that we should fear men, but rather God. For this reason, if we should do such <I>wicked</I> things, the Lord hath said, "Even though ye were gathered together to Me<SUP><A HREF="#P7706_2524771">35</A></SUP> in My very bosom, yet if ye were not to keep My commandments, I would cast you off, and say unto you, Depart from Me; I know you not whence ye are, ye workers of iniquity."<SUP><A HREF="#P7707_2525019">36</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P7709_2525216"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter V.-This World Should Be Despised.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Wherefore, brethren, leaving <I>willingly</I> our sojourn in this present world, let us do the will of Him that called us, and not fear to depart out of this world. For the Lord saith, "Ye shall be as lambs in the midst of wolves."<SUP><A HREF="#P7711_2525483">37</A></SUP> And Peter answered and said unto Him,<SUP><A HREF="#P7712_2525539">38</A></SUP> "What, then, if the wolves shall tear in pieces the lambs? "Jesus said unto Peter, "The lambs have no cause after they are dead to fear<SUP><A HREF="#P7713_2525747">39</A></SUP> the wolves; and in like manner, fear not ye them that kill you, and can do nothing more unto you; but fear Him who, after you are dead, has power over both soul and body to cast them into hell-fire."<SUP><A HREF="#P7714_2525982">40</A></SUP> And consider,<SUP><A HREF="#P7715_2526030">41</A></SUP> brethren, that the sojourning in the flesh in this world is but brief and transient, but the promise of Christ is great and wonderful, even the rest of the kingdom to come, and of life everlasting.<SUP><A HREF="#P7716_2526245">42</A></SUP> By what course of conduct, then, shall we attain these things, but by leading a holy and righteous life, and by deeming these worldly things as not belonging to us, and not fixing our desires upon them? For if we desire to possess them, we fall away from the path of righteousness.<SUP><A HREF="#P7717_2526655">43</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P7719_2526727"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VI.-The Present and Future Worlds are Enemies to Each Other.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Now the Lord declares, "No servant can serve two masters."<SUP><A HREF="#P7721_2526855">44</A></SUP> If we desire, then, to Serve both God and mammon, it will be unprofitable for us. "For what will it profit if a man gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? "<SUP><A HREF="#P7722_2527051">45</A></SUP> This world and the next are two enemies. The one urges to<SUP><A HREF="#P7723_2527316">46</A></SUP> adultery and corruption, avarice and deceit; the other bids farewell to these things. We cannot therefore be the friends of both; and it behoves us, by renouncing the one, to make sure<SUP><A HREF="#P7724_2527549">47</A></SUP> of the other. Let us reckon<SUP><A HREF="#P7725_2527749">48</A></SUP> that it is better to hate the things present, since they are trifling, and transient, and corruptible; and to love those <I>which are to come</I>, as being good and incorruptible. For if we do the will of Christ, we shall find rest; otherwise, nothing shall deliver us from eternal punishment, if we disobey His commandments. For thus also saith the Scripture in Ezekiel, "If Noah, Job, and Daniel should rise up, they should not deliver their children in captivity."<SUP><A HREF="#P7726_2528297">49</A></SUP> Now, if men so eminently righteous<SUP><A HREF="#P7727_2528357">50</A></SUP> are not able by their righteousness to deliver their children, how can we hope to<SUP><A HREF="#P7728_2528494">51</A></SUP> enter into the royal residence<SUP><A HREF="#P7729_2528574">52</A></SUP> of God unless we keep our baptism holy and undefiled? Or who shall be our advocate, unless we be found possessed of works of holiness and righteousness?<SUP><A HREF="#P7730_2528908">53</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P7732_2528956"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VII.-We Must Strive in Order to Be Crowned.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Wherefore, then, my brethren, let us struggle<SUP><A HREF="#P7734_2529054">54</A></SUP> with all earnestness, knowing that the contest is <I>in our case</I> close at hand, and that many undertake long voyages to strive for a corruptible reward;<SUP><A HREF="#P7735_2529262">55</A></SUP> yet all are not crowned, but those only that have laboured hard and striven gloriously, Let us therefore so strive, that we may all be crowned, Let us run the straight<SUP><A HREF="#P7736_2529552">56</A></SUP> course, even the race that is incorruptible; and let us in great numbers set out<SUP><A HREF="#P7737_2529868">57</A></SUP> for it, and strive that we may be crowned, And should we not all be able to obtain the crown, let us at least come near to it, We must remember<SUP><A HREF="#P7738_2530033">58</A></SUP> that he who strives in the corruptible contest, if he be found acting unfairly,<SUP><A HREF="#P7739_2530137">59</A></SUP> is taken away and scourged, and cast forth from the lists. What then think ye? If one does anything unseemly in the incorruptible contest, what shall he have to bear? For of those who do not preserve the seal"<SUP><A HREF="#P7740_2530391">60</A></SUP> <I>unbroken, the Scripture</I> saith,<SUP><A HREF="#P7741_2530488">61</A></SUP> "Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh."<SUP><A HREF="#P7742_2530653">62</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P7744_2530672"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VIII.-The Necessity of Repentance While We are on Earth.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>As long, therefore, as we are upon earth, let us practise repentance, for we are as clay in the hand of the artificer. For as the potter, if he make a vessel, and it be distorted or broken in his hands, fashions it over again; but if he have before this cast it into the furnace of fire, can no longer find any help for it: so let us also, while we are in this world, repent with our whole heart of the evil deeds we have done in the flesh, that we may be saved by the Lord, while we have yet an opportunity of repentance. For after we have gone out of the world, no further power of confessing or repenting will there belong to us. Wherefore, brethren, by doing the will of the Father, and keeping the flesh holy, and observing the commandments of the Lord, we shall obtain eternal life. For the Lord saith in the Gospel, "If ye have not kept that which was small, who will commit to you the great? For I say unto you, that he that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much."<SUP><A HREF="#P7746_2531733">63</A></SUP> This, then, is what He means: "Keep the flesh holy and the seal undefiled, that ye<SUP><A HREF="#P7747_2531844">64</A></SUP> may receive eternal life."<SUP><A HREF="#P7748_2532146">65</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P7750_2532277"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter IX.-We Shall Be Judged in the Flesh.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>And let no one of you say that this very flesh shall not be judged, nor rise again. Consider ye<SUP><A HREF="#P7752_2532418">66</A></SUP> in what <I>state</I> ye were saved, in what ye received sight,<SUP><A HREF="#P7753_2532729">67</A></SUP> if not while ye were in this flesh. We must therefore preserve the flesh as the temple of God. For as ye were called in the flesh, ye shall also come <I>to be judged</I> in the flesh. As Christ<SUP><A HREF="#P7754_2533002">68</A></SUP> the Lord who saved us, though He was first a Spirit,<SUP><A HREF="#P7755_2533216">69</A></SUP> became flesh, and thus called us, so shall we also receive the reward in this flesh. Let us therefore love one another, that we may all attain to the kingdom of God. While we have an opportunity of being healed, let us yield ourselves to God that healeth us, and give to Him a recompense. Of what sort? Repentance out of a sincere heart; for He knows all things beforehand, and is acquainted with what is in our hearts. Let us therefore give Him praise,<SUP><A HREF="#P7756_2533773">70</A></SUP> not with the mouth only, but also with the heart, that He may accept us as sons. For the Lord has said, "Those are My brethren who do the will of My Father."<SUP><A HREF="#P7757_2534036">71</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P7759_2534055"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter X.-Vice is to Be Forsaken, and Virtue Followed.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Wherefore, my brethren, let us do the will of the Father who called us, that we may live; and let us earnestly<SUP><A HREF="#P7761_2534222">72</A></SUP> follow after virtue, but forsake every wicked tendency<SUP><A HREF="#P7762_2534304">73</A></SUP> which would lead into transgression; and flee from ungodliness, lest evils overtake us. For if we are diligent in doing good, peace will follow us. On this account, such men cannot find it, i.e., <I>peace</I>, as are<SUP><A HREF="#P7763_2534607">74</A></SUP> influenced by human terrors, and prefer rather present enjoyment to the promise which shall afterwards be fulfilled. For they know not what torment present enjoyment incurs, or what felicity is involved in the future promise. And if, indeed, they themselves only did such things, it would be <I>the more</I> tolerable; but now they persist in imbuing innocent souls with their pernicious doctrines,<SUP><A HREF="#P7764_2536269">75</A></SUP> not knowing that they shall receive a double condemnation, both they and those that hear them.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P7766_2536456"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XI.-We Ought to Serve God, Trusting in His Promises.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Let us therefore serve God with a pure heart, and we shall be righteous; but if we do not serve Him, because we believe not the promise of God, we shall be miserable. For the prophetic word also declares, "Wretched are those of a double mind, and who doubt in their heart, who say, All these things have we heard even in the times of our fathers; but though we have waited day by day, we have seen none of them <I>accomplished</I>. Ye fools! compare yourselves to a tree; take, for instance, the vine. First of all it sheds its leaves, then the bud appears; after that the sour grape, and then the fully-ripened fruit. So, likewise, my people have borne disturbances and afflictions, but afterwards shall they receive their good things."<SUP><A HREF="#P7768_2537248">76</A></SUP> Wherefore, my brethren, let us not be of a double mind, but let us hope and endure, that we also may obtain the reward. For He is faithful who has promised that He will bestow on every one a reward according to his works. If, therefore, we shall do righteousness in the sight of God, we shall enter into His kingdom, and shall receive the promises, "which ear hath not heard, nor eye seen, neither have entered into the heart of man."<SUP><A HREF="#P7769_2537750">77</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P7771_2537768"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XII.-We are Constantly to Look for the Kingdom of God.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Let us expect, therefore, hour by hour, the kingdom of God in love and righteousness, since we know not the day of the appearing of God. For the Lord Himself, being asked by one when His kingdom would come, replied, "When two shall be one, and that which is without as that which is within, and the male with the female, neither male nor female."<SUP><A HREF="#P7773_2538178">78</A></SUP> Now, two are one when we speak the truth one to another, and there is unfeignedly one soul in two bodies. And "that which is without as that which is within" meaneth this: He calls the soul "that which is within," and the body "that which is without." As, then, thy body is visible to sight, so also let thy soul be manifest by good works. And "the male with the female, neither male nor female," this<SUP><A HREF="#P7774_2538704">79</A></SUP> ...</P>

<P> [The newly recovered portion follows: ]<SUP><A HREF="#P7777_2538832">80</A></SUP> -</P>

<P>... meaneth,<SUP><A HREF="#P7779_2538935">81</A></SUP> that a brother seeing a sister should think nothing<SUP><A HREF="#P7780_2539055">82</A></SUP> about her as of a female, nor <I>she</I><SUP><A HREF="#P7781_2539345">83</A></SUP> think anything about him as of a male. If ye do these things, saith He,<SUP><A HREF="#P7782_2539557">84</A></SUP> the kingdom of my Father shall come.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XIII.-Disobedience Causeth God's Name to Be Blasphemed.<SUP><A HREF="#P7785_2539782">85</A></SUP> </FONT></P>

</UL><P>Therefore, brethren,<SUP><A HREF="#P7787_2539953">86</A></SUP> let us now at length repent; let us be sober unto what is good; for we are full of much folly and wickedness.

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XIV.-The Living Church is the Body of Christ.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Wherefore,<SUP><A HREF="#P7802_2542893">98</A></SUP> brethren, if we do the will of God our Father, we shall be of the first Church, that is, spiritual, that hath been created before the sun and moon;<SUP><A HREF="#P7803_2543092">99</A></SUP> but if we do not the will of the Lord, we shall be of the scripture that saith, "My house was made a den of robbers."<SUP><A HREF="#P7804_2543254">100</A></SUP> So then let us choose to be of the Church of life,<SUP><A HREF="#P7805_2543374">101</A></SUP> that we may be saved. I do not, however, suppose ye are ignorant that the living Church is the body of Christ;<SUP><A HREF="#P7806_2543707">102</A></SUP> for the Scripture saith, "God made man, male and female."<SUP><A HREF="#P7807_2543816">103</A></SUP> The male is Christ, the female is the Church. And the Books<SUP><A HREF="#P7808_2543916">104</A></SUP> and the Apostles <I>plainly declare</I><SUP><A HREF="#P7809_2544152">105</A></SUP> that the Church is not of the present, but from the beginning.<SUP><A HREF="#P7810_2544616">106</A></SUP> For she was spiritual, as our Jesus also was, but was manifested In the last days that He<SUP><A HREF="#P7811_2544796">107</A></SUP> might save us. Now the Church, being spiritual, was manifested in the flesh of Christ, <I>thus</I> signifying to us that, if any of us keep<SUP><A HREF="#P7812_2544995">108</A></SUP> her in the flesh and do not corrupt her, he shall receive her again<SUP><A HREF="#P7813_2545161">109</A></SUP> in the Holy Spirit: for this flesh is the copy of the spirit. No one then who corrupts the copy, shall partake of the original.<SUP><A HREF="#P7814_2545363">110</A></SUP> This then is what He meaneth, "Keep the flesh,<SUP><A HREF="#P7815_2545637">111</A></SUP> that ye may partake of the spirit." But if we say that the flesh is the Church and the spirit Christ,<SUP><A HREF="#P7816_2545777">112</A></SUP> then he that hath shamefully used the flesh hath shamefully used the Church. Such a one then shall not partake of the spirit, which is Christ. Such life and incorruption this flesh<SUP><A HREF="#P7817_2546186">113</A></SUP> can partake of, when the Holy Spirit is joined to it. No one can utter or speak "what the Lord hath prepared" for His elect.<SUP><A HREF="#P7818_2546371">114</A></SUP> </P>

For if we renounce<SUP><A HREF="#P7833_2548402">123</A></SUP> these enjoyments and conquer our soul in not doing these its evil desires, we shall partake of the mercy of Jesus. But ye know that the day of judgment even now "cometh as a burning oven,"<SUP><A HREF="#P7834_2548648">124</A></SUP> and some "of the heavens shall melt," and all the earth <I>shall be</I> as lead melting on the fire,<SUP><A HREF="#P7835_2548767">125</A></SUP> and then the hidden and open works of men shall appear. Almsgiving therefore is a good thing, as repentance from sin; fasting is better than prayer, but almsgiving than both;<SUP><A HREF="#P7836_2549284">126</A></SUP> "but love covereth a multitude of sins."<SUP><A HREF="#P7837_2549580">127</A></SUP> But prayer out of a good conscience delivereth from death.

But the righteous who have done well and endured torments and hated the enjoyments of the soul, when they shall behold those that have gone astray and denied Jesus through their words or through their works, how that they are punished with grievous torments in unquenchable fire, shall be giving glory to God, saying, There will be hope for him that hath served God with his whole heart.</P>

And let us not, unwise ones that we are, be affronted and sore displeased, whenever some one admonisheth and turneth us from iniquity unto righteousness. For sometimes while we are practising evil things we do not perceive it on account of the double-mindedness and unbelief that is in our breasts, and we are "darkened in our understanding"<SUP><A HREF="#P7869_2556847">150</A></SUP> by our vain lusts.

<br><br><sup id="P7756_2533773">70</sup>: [A reads "eternal," and C, S, "praise;" Lightfoot and others combine the two, "eternal praise,"-R.]
<br><br><sup id="P7757_2534036">71</sup>: Matt. xii. 50.
<br><br><sup id="P7761_2534222">72</sup>: Literally, "rather."
<br><br><sup id="P7762_2534304">73</sup>: Literally, "malice, as it were, the precursor of our sins." Some deem the text corrupt.
<br><br><sup id="P7763_2534607">74</sup>: Literally, according to the ms., "it is not possible that a man should find it who are "-the passage being evidently corrupt. [The evidence of C and S does not clear up the difficulty here, the reading of these authorities being substantially that of A. Lightfoot renders: "For for this cause is a man unable to attain happiness, seeing that they call in the fears of men," etc. Hilgenfeld (2d ed.) assumes here a considerable gap in all the authorities, and inserts two paragraphs, cited in other authors as from Clement. The first and longer passage is from John of Damascus, and it may be accounted for as a loose citation from chap. xx. in the recovered portion of this Epistle. The other is from pseudo-Justin ( Questions to the Orthodox , 74) This was formerly assigned by both Hilgenfeld and Lightfoot (against Harnack) to the First Epistle of Clement , lviii., in that portion wanting in A. But the recovered chapters (lviii.-lxiii.) contain, according to C and S, no such passage. Lightfoot thinks the reference in pseudo-Justin is to chap. xvi. of this homily, and that the mention of the Sibyl in the same author is not necessarily part of the citation from Clement. Comp. Lightfoot, pp. 308, 447, 448, 458, 459, and Hilgenfeld, 2d ed., pp. xlviii., 77.-R.]
<br><br><sup id="P7764_2536269">75</sup>: [Lightfoot, more literally, "but now they continue teaching evil to innocent souls."-R.]
<br><br><sup id="P7768_2537248">76</sup>: The same words occur in Clement's first epistle, chap. xxiii.
<br><br><sup id="P7769_2537750">77</sup>: 1 Cor. ii. 9.
<br><br><sup id="P7773_2538178">78</sup>: These words are quoted (Clem. Alex., Strom. , iii. 9, 13) from the Gospel according to the Egyptians, no longer extant.
<br><br><sup id="P7774_2538704">79</sup>: Thus ends the ms., but what followed will be found in Clem. Alex. as just cited.
<br><br><sup id="P7777_2538832">80</sup>: For details respecting the version here given, see Introductory Notice, pp. 514, 515.
<br><br><sup id="P7779_2538935">81</sup>: Or, more correctly, both here and above, "by this He meaneth."
<br><br><sup id="P7780_2539055">82</sup>: All editors read ou0de\n fronh= , but C has fronei= which is ungrammatical. In this clause, after i#na we would expect mhden ; butas Lightfoot suggests, ou0se\n may be combined as a substantive idea with qhluko/n ; comp. the use of ou0 with participles.
<br><br><sup id="P7781_2539345">83</sup>: For mhde/ (so C) Gebhardt would substitute mhd' h#de , while S supplies in full, quum soror videbit fratrem , an obvious interpretament.
<br><br><sup id="P7782_2539557">84</sup>: This seems to be an explanation of the saying above referred to, and not a citation; similar cases occur in the homily.
<br><br><sup id="P7785_2539782">85</sup>: The headings to the chapters have been supplied by the editor, but in so rambling a discourse they are in some cases necessarily unsatisfactory.
<br><br><sup id="P7787_2539953">86</sup>: Hilgenfeld reads mou instead of ou[n ; so S apparently. The chapters are usually introduced with ou[n (nine times) or wste (five times).
<br><br><sup id="P7788_2540312">87</sup>: gimw/meqa ; Lightfoot, "be found."
<br><br><sup id="P7789_2540411">88</sup>: Literally, "ourselves," e9autoi=j ; but the reciprocal sense is common in Hellenistic Greek, and is here required by the context.
<br><br><sup id="P7790_2540616">89</sup>: Comp. Acts v. 41, where the correct text omits au\tou= . The Revised Version properly capitalizes "Name" in that passage.
<br><br><sup id="P7791_2540779">90</sup>: C here, and in many other cases, reads u9ma=j ; comparison of mss. shows that it is a correction of the scribe.
<br><br><sup id="P7792_2540932">91</sup>: Lightfoot renders dia\ panto/j , "every way;" but the temporal sense is common in Hellenistic Greek, and here required by the Hebrew.
<br><br><sup id="P7793_2541117">92</sup>: Isa. lii. 5, with pasi=n inserted.
<br><br><sup id="P7794_2541173">93</sup>: Lightfoot reads, kai\ pa/lin Ou0ai/ , following the Syriac. C has kai Dio/ . There is difficulty in identifying this second quotation: comp. Ezek. xxxvi. 20-23. Lightfoot thinks it probable that the preacher used two different forms of Isa. lii. 5.
<br><br><sup id="P7795_2541534">94</sup>: This sentence is not part of the citation, but an explanation, the words being used as if spoken by God. The Syriac text seeks to avoid this difficulty by reading, "by our not doing what we say."
<br><br><sup id="P7796_2541803">95</sup>: Here ta\ lo/gia to= Qeou= is used of the Scriptures, and with distinct reference to the New Testament; see next note.
<br><br><sup id="P7797_2542179">96</sup>: In view of the connection, this must mean "God in His oracles;" a significant testimony to the early belief in the inspiration of the Gospels.
<br><br><sup id="P7798_2542466">97</sup>: Luke vi. 27, 32, freely combined; comp. Matt. v. 44, 46. The use of xa/rij u0min shows that the quotation is from the former Gospel.
<br><br><sup id="P7802_2542893">98</sup>: w#ste , as at the beginning of chaps. vii., x.
<br><br><sup id="P7803_2543092">99</sup>: Comp. Ps. lxxii.. (LXX. lxxi.) 5, 17.
<br><br><sup id="P7804_2543254">100</sup>: Jer. vii. 11. Comp. Matt. xxi. 13; Mark xi. 17; Luke xix. 46.
<br><br><sup id="P7805_2543374">101</sup>: Harnack says "The Jewish synagogue is the church of death." Lightfoot, more correctly, accepts a contrast "between mere external membership in the visible body and spiritual communion in the celestial counterpart."
<br><br><sup id="P7806_2543707">102</sup>: Comp. Eph. i. 23 and many similar passages.
<br><br><sup id="P7807_2543816">103</sup>: Gen. 1. 27; comp. Eph. v. 31-33.
<br><br><sup id="P7808_2543916">104</sup>: The reference here is probably to the Old-Testament "books," while the term "Apostles" may mean the New Testament in whole or part. The more direct reference probably is to Genesis and Ephesians.
<br><br><sup id="P7809_2544152">105</sup>: Lightfoot inserts in brackets le/gousin, dh=lon , rendering as above. Hilgenfeld suggests fasi\n oi#date , "Ye know that the books, etc., say that." Bryennios joins this sentence to the preceding, taking the whole as dependent on a/gnoei=n . Ropes renders accordingly, making a parenthesis from "for the Scripture" to "the Church." In any case a verb of saying must be supplied, as in the Syriac.
<br><br><sup id="P7810_2544616">106</sup>: a!nwqen has a local and a temporal sense; the latter is obviously preferable here.
<br><br><sup id="P7811_2544796">107</sup>: "Jesus" is the subject of the latter part of the sentence.
<br><br><sup id="P7812_2544995">108</sup>: "Keep her pure;" comp. chap. viii. Lightfoot renders threi=n , "guard," here and elsewhere.
<br><br><sup id="P7813_2545161">109</sup>: The verb corresponds with that rendered "partake" in what follows.
<br><br><sup id="P7814_2545363">110</sup>: "Copy," a!ti/tupoj, a0nti/tupon . Comp. Heb. ix. 24; 1 Pet iii. 21. Our use of "antitype" is different. The antithesis here is auu/qentiko/n , the original, or archetype. This mystical interpretation has a Platonic basis.
<br><br><sup id="P7815_2545637">111</sup>: Comp. the close of chap. viii.
<br><br><sup id="P7816_2545777">112</sup>: Lightfoot calls attention to the confusion of metaphors; but there is also evidence of that false exegesis which made "flesh" and "spirit" equivalent to "body" and "soul,"-an error which always leads to further mistakes.
<br><br><sup id="P7817_2546186">113</sup>: Here the word "flesh" is used in an ambiguous sense.
<br><br><sup id="P7818_2546371">114</sup>: 1 Cor. ii. 9.
<br><br><sup id="P7822_2546523">115</sup>: peri\ e0gkpatei/aj , "temperance" in the wide New-Testament sense. Lightfoot, "continence;" in these days the prominent danger was from libidinous sins.
<br><br><sup id="P7823_2546875">116</sup>: Comp. Jas. v. 19, 20, with which our passage has many verbal correspondences.
<br><br><sup id="P7824_2546987">117</sup>: "A favorite word with our author, especially in this connection."-Lightfoot.
<br><br><sup id="P7825_2547373">118</sup>: Isa. lviii. 9, LXX.
<br><br><sup id="P7826_2547536">119</sup>: ei/j to\ dido/nai tou= ai/tou=ntoj ; the sense of the elliptical construction is obviously as above.
<br><br><sup id="P7827_2547729">120</sup>: e0autoi=j . Here again in the reciprocal sense; comp. chap. xiii.
<br><br><sup id="P7831_2548101">121</sup>: a0formhn labo/ntej , as in Rom. vii. 8, 11.
<br><br><sup id="P7832_2548198">122</sup>: kairo\n e!xontej , "seeing that we have time" (Lightfoot). But "opportunity" is more exact.
<br><br><sup id="P7833_2548402">123</sup>: a0potacw/meqa , "bid farewell to;" comp. chap. vi.
<br><br><sup id="P7834_2548648">124</sup>: Comp. Mal. iv. 1.
<br><br><sup id="P7835_2548767">125</sup>: Comp. Isa. xxxiv. 4, which resembles the former clause, and 2 Pet. iii. 7, 10, where the same figures occur. The text seems to be corrupt: tinej ("some") is sustained by both the Greek and the Syriac, but this limitation is so peculiar as to awaken suspicion; still, the notion of several heavens might have been in the author's mind.
<br><br><sup id="P7836_2549284">126</sup>: Comp. Tobit xii. 8, 9; but the position given to almsgiving seems to be contradicted by the next sentence. Lightfoot seems to suspect a corruption of text here also, but in the early Church there was often an undue emphasis placed upon almsgiving.
<br><br><sup id="P7837_2549580">127</sup>: 1 Pet. iv. 8. Comp. Prov. x. 12; Jas. v. 20.
<br><br><sup id="P7838_2549787">128</sup>: Literally, "becometh a lightener ( kou/fisma ) of sin;" comp. Ecclus. iii. 30.
<br><br><sup id="P7842_2550057">129</sup>: Lightfoot, with Syriac, reads i!na kai\ tou=to pra/sswmen . Comits i!na , and reads pra/ssomen , "If we have commandments and practice this."
<br><br><sup id="P7843_2550404">130</sup>: Here Lightfoot thinks a verb has probably fallen out of the text.
<br><br><sup id="P7844_2550554">131</sup>: Bryennios thus connects: "in order that all may be saved, and may convert," etc.
<br><br><sup id="P7845_2550778">132</sup>: "This clearly shows that the work before us is a sermon delivered in church"(Lightfoot). The preacher is himself one of "the presbyters;" comp. chap. xix. It is possible, but cannot be proven, that he was the head of the presbyters, the parochial bishop.
<br><br><sup id="P7846_2551069">133</sup>: e0ntalma/twn , not the technical word for the commandments of the Decalogue ( e0ntolai ).
<br><br><sup id="P7847_2551236">134</sup>: Syriac, "praying," which Lightfoot thinks may be correct; but proserxo/menoi might very easily be mistaken for proseuxo/menoi . The former means coming in worship: comp. Heb. x. 1, 22.
<br><br><sup id="P7848_2551543">135</sup>: 2 Cor. xiii. 11; Phil. ii. 2.
<br><br><sup id="P7849_2551704">136</sup>: Isa. lxvi. 18. But "tribes" is inserted; comp. Dan. iii. 7. The phrase "shall see His glory" is from the passage in Isaiah, The language seems to be put into the mouth of Christ by the preacher.
<br><br><sup id="P7850_2552019">137</sup>: This implies various degrees of reward among these redeemed.
<br><br><sup id="P7851_2552206">138</sup>: to\ basi/leion ; not exactly "the kingdom," rather "the kingly rule." e0n tw= 'Ihsou= is rightly explained by Lightfoot, "in the hands, in the power, of Jesus;" cenisqhontai is rendered above "shall think it strange," as in 1 Pet. iv. 4, 12.
<br><br><sup id="P7852_2552512">139</sup>: "He" is properly supplied as frequently in the Gospels. There seems to be a reminiscence of John viii. 24 and similar passages.
<br><br><sup id="P7853_2552886">140</sup>: Isa. lxvi. 24; comp. chap. vii. above.
<br><br><sup id="P7854_2553004">141</sup>: C reads u9min , as often, for h9mi=n , Syriac, accepted by all editors.
<br><br><sup id="P7858_2553773">142</sup>: panqamartolo/j ; occurring only here; but a similar word, parqama/rthtoj , occurs in the Teaching , v. 2, Apostolical Constitutions , vii. 18, and Barnabas , xx.
<br><br><sup id="P7859_2554018">143</sup>: toi=j o0rga/noij ; comp. Ignat., Rom. , iv., Ante-Nicene Fathers , i. p. 75, where the word is rendered "instruments," and applied to the teeth of the wild beasts in the amphitheatre. Here Lightfoot renders "engines," regarding the metaphor as military.
<br><br><sup id="P7860_2554384">144</sup>: The phrase ka@n au0th=j implies a doubt of attaining the aim, in accord with the tone of humility which obtains in this chapter.
<br><br><sup id="P7864_2554625">145</sup>: Comp. the opening sentence of Barnabas , "Sons and daughters," Ante-Nicene Fathers , i. p. 137; see also chap. xx.
<br><br><sup id="P7865_2554785">146</sup>: If any doubt remained as to the character of this writing, it would be removed by this sentence. The passage is elliptical, meta\ to\n qeo\n tnj= a0lnqei/aj , but there is no doubt as to the meaning. The Scripture was read, and listening to it was regarded as hearing the voice of God, whose words of truth were read. Then followed the sermon or exhortation; comp. Justin, First Apology , chap. lxvii. (vol. i. p. 186). That lessons from some at least of the New Testament were included at the date of this homily, seems quite certain; comp. the references to the New Testament in chaps. ii., iii., iv., and elsewhere. It is here implied that this homily was written and "read."
<br><br><sup id="P7866_2555495">147</sup>: The word e@nteuzij , here used, means intercession, or supplication, to God (comp. 1 Tim. ii. 1, iv. 5) in early Christian literature: but the classical sense is "entreaty:" so in the opening sentence of Justin, First Apology (vol. i. p. 163, where it is rendered "petition").
<br><br><sup id="P7867_2556056">148</sup>: Lightfoot, with Syriac and most editors, reads skopo/n ; but C has konpon , so Bryennios.
<br><br><sup id="P7868_2556194">149</sup>: C had originally filosofei=n (accepted by Hilgenfeld), but was corrected to filoponei=n . The latter is confirmed by the Syriac, and now generally accepted, though Hilgenfeld uses the other reading to support his view that Clement of Alexandria was the author.
<br><br><sup id="P7869_2556847">150</sup>: Eph. iv. 18.
<br><br><sup id="P7870_2557058">151</sup>: C inserts tou/tw ; so Bryennios, Hilgenfeld, and others. Lightfoot omits, with Syriac. The punctuation above given is that of Bryennios and Lightfoot. Hilgenfeld joins this clause with what precedes.
<br><br><sup id="P7874_2557785">152</sup>: pei=ran a0qlou=men ; the construction is classical, and the figure common in all Greek literature.
<br><br><sup id="P7875_2558390">153</sup>: The verbs here are aorists, and have been rendered by the English past tense; the present participle ( mh\ o@n di/kaion ) describing the character of the "spirit" must, according to English usage, conform to the main verbs. Lightfoot says, "The aorist here has its common gnomic sense;" and he therefore interprets the passage as a general statement: "Sordid motives bring their own punishment in a judicial blindness." But this gnomic sense of the aorist is not common. C reads desmo/j , which yields this sense: "and a chain weighed upon him. " Hilgenfeld refers the passage to those Christians who suffered persecution for other causes than those of righteousness. Harnack thinks the author has in mind Satan, as the prince of avarice, and regards him as already loaded with chains. If the aorist is taken in its usual sense, this is the preferable explanation; but the meaning is obscure.
<br><br><sup id="P7877_2559313">154</sup>: 1 Tim. i. 17.
<br><br><sup id="P7878_2559416">155</sup>: Acts iii. 15, v. 31; comp. Heb. ii. 10.
<br><br><sup id="P7879_2559579">156</sup>: The doxology is interesting, as indicating the early custom of thus closing a homily. The practice, fitting in itself, naturally followed the examples in the Epistles.
