Synopsis:

The text aims to prove that John the Baptist and Christ were conceived at the yearâ€™s two equinoxes and born at the two solstices. This is done using two main texts, Exodus 23 and Zechariah 8.19. Additionally, the author assumes that Zechariah father of John the Baptist was the same as the priest mentioned in Isaiah 8, and as the author of the biblical book of Zechariah. He is taken to be High Priest, and the day when he saw the angel Gabriel (Lk. 1) was when he was offering the once yearly sacrifice for the Day of Atonement or Yom Kippur.
