  <UL><P>I. The Priest:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn81.htm#P8127_2593938">1</A></SUP>  O sovereign Lord our God, condemn me not, defiled with a multitude of sins: for, behold, I have come to this Thy divine and heavenly mystery, not as being worthy; but looking only to Thy goodness, I direct my voice to Thee: God be merciful to me, a sinner; I have sinned against Heaven, and before Thee, and am unworthy to come into the presence of this Thy holy and spiritual table, upon which Thy only-begotten Son, and our Lord Jesus Christ, is mystically set forth as a sacrifice for me, a sinner, and stained with every spot. Wherefore I present to Thee this supplication and thanksgiving, that Thy Spirit the Comforter may be sent down upon me, strengthening and fitting me for this service; and count me worthy to make known without condemnation the word, delivered from Thee by me to the people, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom Thou art blessed, together with Thy all-holy, and good, and quickening, and consubstantial<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn81.htm#P8128_2594937">2</A></SUP> Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen.</P>

  <P>II. Prayer of the standing beside the altar: Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, the triune light of the Godhead, which is unity subsisting in trinity, divided, yet indivisible: for the Trinity is the one God Almighty, whose glory the heavens declare, and the earth His dominion, and the sea His might, and every sentient and intellectual creature at all times proclaims His majesty: for all glory becomes Him, and honour and might, greatness and magnificence, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen.</P>

  <P>III. Prayer of the incense at the beginning:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn81.htm#P8131_2595622">3</A></SUP>  Sovereign Lord Jesus Christ, O Word of God, who didst freely offer Thyself a blameless sacrifice upon the cross to God even the Father, the coal of double nature, that didst touch the lips of the prophet with the tongs, and didst take away his sins, touch also the hearts of us sinners, and purify us from every stain, and present us holy beside Thy holy altar, that we may offer Thee a sacrifice of praise: and accept from us, Thy unprofitable servants, this incense as an odour of a sweet smell, and make fragrant the evil odour of our soul and body, and purify us with the sanctifying power of Thy all-holy Spirit: for Thou alone art holy, who sanctifiest, and art communicated to the faithful; and glory becomes Thee, with Thy eternal Father, and Thy all-holy, and good, and quickening Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen.</P>

  <P>IV. Prayer of the commencement: O beneficent King eternal, and Creator of the universe, receive Thy Church, coming unto Thee through Thy Christ: fulfil to each what is profitable; lead all to perfection, and make us perfectly worthy of the grace of Thy sanctification, gathering us together within Thy holy Church, which Thou hast purchased by the precious blood of Thy only-begotten Son, and our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, with whom Thou art blessed and glorified, together with Thy all-holy, and good, and quickening Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen.</P>

  <P>V. The Deacon: Let us again pray to the Lord.</P>

  <P>The Priest, prayer of the incense at the entrance of the congregation: God, who didst accept the gifts of Abel, the sacrifice of Noah and of Abram, the incense of Aaron and of Zacharias, accept also from the hand of us sinners this incense for an odour of a sweet smell, and for remission of our sins, and those of all Thy people; for blessed art Thou, and glory becomes Thee, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, now and ever.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Sir, pronounce the blessing.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn81.htm#P8136_2597674">4</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>The Priest prays: Our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, who through exceeding goodness and love not to be restrained wast crucified, and didst not refuse to be pierced by the spear and nails; who didst provide this mysterious and awful service as an everlasting memorial for us perpetually: bless Thy ministry in Christ the God, and bless our entrance, and fully complete the presentation of this our service by Thy unutterable compassion, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen.</P>

  <P>VI. The responsive prayer from the Deacon: The Lord bless us, and make us worthy seraphically to offer gifts, and to sing the oft-sung hymn of the divine Trisagion, by the fulness and exceeding abundance of all the perfection of holiness, now and ever.</P>

  <P>Then the Deacon begins to sing in the entrance:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn81.htm#P8140_2598562">5</A></SUP>  Thou who art the only-begotten Son and Word of God, immortal; who didst submit for our salvation to become flesh of the holy God-mother,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn81.htm#P8141_2598748">6</A></SUP> and ever-virgin Mary; who didst immutably become man and wast crucified, O Christ our God and didst by Thy death tread death underfoot; who art one of the Holy Trinity glorified together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, save us.</P>

  <P>VII. The Priest says this prayer from the gates to the altar: God Almighty, Lord great in glory, who hast given to us an entrance into the Holy of Holies, through the sojourning among men of Thy only-begotten Son, our Lord, and God, and Saviour Jesus Christ, we supplicate and invoke Thy goodness, since we are fearful and trembling when about to stand at Thy holy altar; send forth upon us, O God, Thy good grace, and sanctify our souls, and bodies, and spirits, and turn our thoughts to piety, in order that with a pure conscience we may bring unto Thee gifts, offerings, and fruits for the remission of our transgressions, and for the propitiation of all Thy people, by the grace and mercies and loving-kindness of Thy only-begotten Son, with whom Thou art blessed to all eternity. Amen.</P>

  <P>VIII. After the approach to the altar, the Priest says: Peace be to all.</P>

  <P>The People: And to thy spirit.</P>

  <P>The Priest: The Lord bless us all, and sanctify us for the entrance and celebration of the divine and pure mysteries, giving rest to the blessed souls among the good and just, by His grace and loving-kindness, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen.</P>

  <P>IX. Then the Deacon says the bidding prayer:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn81.htm#P8147_2600246">7</A></SUP> </P>

    <UL><P>In peace let us beseech the Lord.</P>

    <P>For the peace that is from above, and for God's love to man, and for the salvation of our souls, let us beseech the Lord.</P>

    <P>For the peace of the whole world, for the unity of all the holy churches of God, let us beseech the Lord.</P>

    <P>For the remission of our sins, and forgiveness of our transgressions, and for our deliverance from all tribulation, wrath, danger, and distress, and from the uprising of our enemies, let us beseech the Lord.</P>

  </UL><P>Then the Singers sing the Trisagion Hymn: Holy God, holy mighty, holy immortal, have mercy upon us.</P>

  <P>X. Then the Priest prays, bowing: O compassionate and merciful, long-suffering, and very gracious and true God, look from Thy prepared dwelling-place, and hear us Thy suppliants, and deliver us from every temptation of the devil and of man; withhold not Thy aid from us, nor bring on us chastisements too heavy for our strength: for we are unable to overcome what is opposed to us; but Thou art able, Lord, to save us from everything that is against us. Save us, O God, from the difficulties of this world, according to Thy goodness, in order that, having drawn nigh with a pure conscience to Thy holy altar, we may send up to Thee without condemnation the blessed hymn Trisagion, together with the heavenly powers, and that, having performed the service, well pleasing to Thee and divine, we may be counted worthy of eternal life.</P>

  <P>(Aloud.) Because Thou art holy, Lord our God, and dwellest and abidest in holy places, we send up the praise and the hymn Trisagion to Thee, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity. </P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>XI. The Priest: Peace be to all.</P>

  <P>The People: And to thy spirit.</P>

  <P>The Singers: Alleluia.</P>

</UL><P><I>Then there are read in order</I><SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn81.htm#P8160_2602122">8</A></SUP><I> the holy oracles of the Old Testament, and of the prophets; and the incarnation of the Son of God is set forth, and His sufferings and resurrection from the dead, His ascension into heaven, and His second appearing with glory; and this takes place daily in the holy and divine service.</I><SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn81.htm#P8161_2602478">9</A></SUP><I> </I></P>

  <UL><P>XII. After the reading and instruction the Deacon says: Let us all say, Lord, be merciful.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn81.htm#P8163_2602684">10</A></SUP> </P>

    <UL><P>Lord Almighty, the God of our fathers;</P>

    <P>We beseech Thee, hear us.</P>

    <P>For the peace which is from above, and for the salvation of our souls;</P>

    <P>Let us beseech the Lord.</P>

    <P>For the peace of the whole world, and the unity of all the holy churches of God;</P>

    <P>Let us beseech the Lord.</P>

    <P>For the salvation and help of all the Christ-loving people;</P>

    <P>We beseech Thee, hear us.</P>

    <P>For our deliverance from all tribulation, wrath, danger, distress, from captivity, bitter death, and from our iniquities;</P>

    <P>We beseech Thee, hear us.</P>

    <P>For the people standing round, and waiting for the rich and plenteous mercy that is from Thee;</P>

    <P>We beseech Thee, be merciful and gracious.</P>

    <P>Save Thy people, O Lord, and bless Thine inheritance.</P>

    <P>Visit Thy world in mercy and compassion.</P>

    <P>Exalt the horn of Christians by the power of the precious and quickening cross.</P>

    <P>We beseech Thee, most merciful Lord, hear us praying to Thee, and have mercy upon us.</P>

  </UL><P>The People (thrice): Lord, have mercy upon us.</P>

  <P>XIII. The Deacon: For the remission of our sins, and forgiveness of our transgressions, and for our deliverance from all tribulation, wrath, danger, and distress, let us beseech the Lord.</P>

    <UL><P>Let us all entreat from the Lord, that we may pass the whole day, perfect, holy, peaceful, and without sin.</P>

    <P>Let us entreat from the Lord a messenger of peace, a faithful guide, a guardian of our souls and bodies.</P>

    <P>Let us entreat from the Lord forgiveness and remission of our sins and transgressions.</P>

    <P>Let us entreat from the Lord the things which are good and proper for our souls, and peace for the world.</P>

    <P>Let us entreat from the Lord, that we may spend the remaining period of our life in peace and health.</P>

    <P>Let us entreat that the close of our lives may be Christian, without pain and without shame, and a good plea at the dread and awful judgment-seat of Christ.</P>

  </UL><P>XIV. The Priest: For Thou art the gospel and the light, Saviour and keeper of our souls and bodies, God, and Thy only-begotten Son, and Thy all-holy Spirit, now and ever.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn81.htm#P8190_2604690">11</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>The Priest: God, who hast taught us Thy divine and saving oracles, enlighten the souls of us sinners for the comprehension of the things which have been before spoken, so that we may not only be seen to be hearers of spiritual things, but also doers of good deeds, striving after guileless faith, blameless life, and pure conversation.</P>

  <P>(Aloud.) In Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom Thou art blessed, together with Thy all-holy, good, and quickening Spirit, now and always, and for ever.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>XV. The Priest: Peace be to all. </P>

  <P>The People: And to Thy spirit.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Let us bow our heads to the Lord.</P>

  <P>The People: To Thee, Lord.</P>

  <P>The Priest prays, saying: O Sovereign giver of life, and provider of good things, who didst give to mankind the blessed hope of eternal life, our Lord Jesus Christ, count us worthy in holiness, and perfect this Thy divine service to the enjoyment of future blessedness.</P>

  <P>(Aloud.) So that, guarded by Thy power at all times, and led into the light of truth, we may send up the praise and the thanksgiving to Thee, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, now and ever.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

</UL><P>XVI. The Deacon: Let none remain of the catechumens, none of the unbaptized, none of those who are unable to join with us in prayer. Look at one another.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8202_2606300">12</A></SUP> The door.All erect:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8203_2606377">13</A></SUP> let us again pray to the Lord.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="P8205_2606546"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>II<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8206_2606550">14</A></SUP> </FONT></P>

  <UL><P>The Priest says the prayer of incense: Sovereign Almighty, King of Glory, who knowest all things before their creation, manifest Thyself to us calling upon Thee at this holy hour, and redeem us from the shame of our transgressions; cleanse our mind and our thoughts from impure desires, from worldly deceit, from all influence of the devil; and accept from the bands of us sinners this incense, as Thou didst accept the offering of Abel, and Noah, and Aaron, and Samuel, and of all Thy saints, guarding us from everything evil, and preserving us for continually pleasing, and worshipping, and glorifying Thee, the Father, and Thy only-begotten Son, and Thy all-holy Spirit, now and always, and for ever.</P>

  <P>And the Readers begin the Cherubic Hymn:</P>

    <UL><P>Let all mortal flesh be silent, and stand with fear and trembling, and meditate nothing earthly within itself:-</P>

    <P>For the King of kings and Lord of lords, Christ our God, comes forward to be sacrificed, and to be given for food to the faithful; and the bands of angels go before Him with every power and dominion, the many-eyed cherubim, and the six-winged seraphim, covering their faces, and crying aloud the hymn, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.</P>

  </UL><P>XVII. The Priest, bringing in the holy gifts,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8212_2607829">15</A></SUP> says this prayer: O God, our God, who didst send forth the heavenly bread, the food of the whole world, our Lord Jesus Christ, to be a Saviour, and Redeemer, and Benefactor, blessing and sanctifying us, do Thou Thyself bless this offering, and graciously receive it to Thy altar above the skies:</P>

</UL><P>Remember in Thy goodness and love those who have brought it, and those for whom they have brought it, and preserve us without condemnation in the service of Thy divine mysteries: for hollowed and glorified is Thy all-honoured and great name, Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity.</P>

  <UL><P>The Priest: Peace be to all.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Sir, pronounce the blessing.</P>

  <P>The Priest: Blessed be God, who blesseth and sanctifieth us all at the presentation of the divine and pure mysteries, and giveth rest to the blessed souls among the holy and just, now and always, and to all eternity.</P>

  <P>XVIII. The Deacon: Let us attend in wisdom.</P>

  <P>The Priest begins: I believe in one God, Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God: <I>and the rest of the Creed.</I></P>

  <P>XIX. Then he prays, bowing his neck: God and Sovereign of all, make us, who are unworthy, worthy of this hour, lover of mankind; that being pure from all deceit and all hypocrisy, we may be united with one another by the bond of peace and love, being confirmed by the sanctification of Thy divine knowledge through Thine only-begotten Son, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, with whom Thou art blessed, together with Thy all-holy, and good, and quickening Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen. </P>

  <P>XX. The Deacon: Let us stand well, let us stand reverently, let us stand in the fear of God, and with compunction of heart. In peace let us pray to the Lord.</P>

  <P>The Priest: For God of peace, mercy, love, compassion, and loving-kindness art Thou, and Thine only-begotten Son, and Thine all-holy Spirit, now and ever.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>The Priest: Peace be to all.</P>

  <P>The People: And to thy spirit.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Let us salute one another with an holy kiss.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8226_2610111">16</A></SUP> Let us bow our heads to the Lord.</P>

  <P>XXI. The Priest bows, saying this prayer: Only Lord and merciful God, on those who are bowing their necks before Thy holy altar, and seeking the spiritual gifts that come from Thee, send forth Thy good grace; and bless us all with every spiritual blessing, that cannot be taken from us, Thou, who dwellest on high, and hast regard unto things that are lowly.</P>

  <P>(Aloud.) For worthy of praise and worship and most glorious is Thy all-holy name, Father and Son and Holy Spirit, now and always, and to all eternity.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Sir, pronounce the blessing.</P>

  <P>The Priest: The Lord will bless us, and minister with us all by His grace and loving-kindness.</P>

  <P>And again: The Lord will bless us, and make us worthy to stand at His holy altar, at all times, now and always, and for ever.</P>

  <P>And again: Blessed be God, who blesseth and sanctifieth us all in our attendance upon, and service of, His pure mysteries, now and always, and for ever.</P>

  <P>XXII. The Deacon makes the Universal Litany: In peace let us pray to the Lord.</P>

  <P>The People: O Lord, have mercy.</P>

</UL><P>The Deacon: Save us, have mercy upon us, pity and keep us, O God, by Thy grace.</P>

<P>For the peace that is from above, and the loving-kindness of God, and the salvation of our souls;</P>

<P>Let us beseech the Lord.</P>

<P>For the peace of the whole world, and the unity of all the holy churches of God;</P>

<P>Let us beseech the Lord.</P>

<P>For those who bear fruit, and labour honourably in the holy churches of God; for those who remember the poor, the widows and the orphans, the strangers and needy ones; and for those who have requested us to mention them in our prayers;</P>

<P>Let us beseech the Lord.</P>

<P>For those who are in old age and infirmity, for the sick and suffering, and those who are troubled by unclean spirits, for their speedy cure from God and their salvation;</P>

<P>Let us beseech the Lord.</P>

<P>For those who are passing their days in virginity, and celibacy, and discipline, and for those in holy matrimony; and for the holy fathers and brethren agonizing in mountains,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8245_2612467">17</A></SUP> and dens, and caves of the earth;</P>

<P>Let us beseech the Lord.</P>

<P>For Christians sailing, travelling, living among strangers, and for our brethren in captivity, in exile, in prison, and in bitter slavery, their peaceful return;</P>

<P>Let us beseech the Lord.</P>

<P>For the remission of our sins, and forgiveness of our transgressions, and for our deliverance from all tribulation, wrath, danger, and constraint, and uprising against us of enemies;</P>

<P>Let us beseech the Lord.</P>

<P>For favourable weather, peaceful showers, beneficent dews, abundance of fruits, the perfect close of a good season, and for the crown of the year;</P>

<P>Let us beseech the Lord.</P>

<P>For our fathers and brethren present, and praying with us in this holy hour, and at every season, their zeal, labour, and earnestness;</P>

<P>Let us beseech the Lord. </P>

<P>For every Christian soul in tribulation and distress, and needing the mercy and succour of God; for the return of the erring, the health of the sick, the deliverance of the captives, the rest of the fathers and brethren that have fallen asleep aforetime;</P>

<P>Let us beseech the Lord.</P>

<P>For the hearing and acceptance of our prayer before God, and the sending down on us His rich mercies and compassion.</P>

<P>Let us beseech the Lord.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8259_2613746">18</A></SUP> </P>

<P>And for the offered, precious, heavenly, unutterable, pure, glorious, dread, awful, divine gifts, and the salvation of the priest who stands by and offers them;</P>

<P>Let us offer supplication to God the Lord.</P>

  <UL><P>The People (thrice): O Lord, have mercy.</P>

</UL><P>XXIII. Then the Priest makes the sign of the cross on the gifts,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8264_2614387">19</A></SUP> and, standing, speaks separately thus: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will among men, etc. (Thrice.)</P>

<P>Lord, Thou wilt open my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Thy praise. (Thrice.)</P>

<P>Let my mouth be filled with Thy praise, O Lord, that I may tell of Thy glory, of Thy majesty, all the day. (Thrice.)</P>

<P>Of the Father. Amen. And of the Son. Amen. And of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Now and always, and to all eternity. Amen.</P>

  <UL><P>XXIV. And bowing to this side and to that,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8269_2615039">20</A></SUP> he says: Magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together.</P>

  <P>And they answer, bowing: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8271_2615264">21</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>Then the Priest, at great length: O Sovereign Lord, who hast visited us in compassion and mercies, and bast freely given to us, Thy humble and sinful and unworthy servants, boldness to stand at Thy holy altar, and to offer to Thee this dread and bloodless sacrifice for our sins, and for the errors of the people, look upon me Thy unprofitable servant, and blot out my transgressions for Thy compassion's sake; and purify my lips and heart from all pollution of flesh and spirit; and remove from me every shameful and foolish thought, and fit me by the power of Thy all-holy Spirit for this service; and receive me graciously by Thy goodness as I draw nigh to Thy altar.</P>

<P>And be pleased, O Lord, that these gifts brought by our hands may be acceptable, stooping to my weakness; and cast me not away from Thy presence, and abhor not my unworthiness; but pity me according to Thy great mercy, and according to the multitude of Thy mercies pass by my transgressions, that, having come before Thy glory without condemnation, I may be counted worthy of the protection of Thy only-begotten Son, and of the illumination of Thy all-holy Spirit, that I may not be as a slave of sin cast out, but as Thy servant may find grace and mercy and forgiveness of sins before Thee, both in the world that now is and in that which is to come.</P>

<P>I beseech Thee, Almighty Sovereign, all-powerful Lord, hear my prayer; for Thou art He who workest all in all, and we all seek in all things the help and succour that come from Thee and Thy only-begotten Son, and the good and quickening and consubstantial Spirit, now and ever.</P>

<P>XXV. O God, who through Thy great and unspeakable love didst send forth Thy only-begot-ten Son into the world, in order that He might turn back the lost sheep, turn not away us sinners, laying hold of Thee by this dread and bloodless sacrifice; for we trust not in our own righteousness, but in Thy good mercy, by which Thou purchasest our race.</P>

<P>We entreat and beseech Thy goodness that it may not be for condemnation to Thy people that this mystery for salvation has been administered by us, but for remission of sins, for renewal of souls and bodies, for the well-pleasing of Thee, God and Father, in the mercy and love of Thy only-begotten Son, with whom Thou art blessed, together with Thy all-holy and good and quickening Spirit, now and always, and for ever.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8277_2617677">22</A></SUP> </P>

<P>XXVI. O Lord God, who didst create us, and bring us into life, who hast shown to us ways to salvation, who hast granted to us a revelation of heavenly mysteries, and hast appointed us to this ministry in the power of Thy all-holy Spirit, grant, O Sovereign, that we may become servants of Thy new testament, ministers of Thy pure mysteries, and receive us as we draw near to Thy holy altar, according to the greatness of Thy mercy, that we may become worthy of offering to Thee girls and sacrifices for our transgressions and for those of the people; and grant to us, O Lord, with all fear and a pure conscience to offer to Thee this spiritual and bloodless sacrifice, and graciously receiving it unto Thy holy and spiritual altar above the skies for an odour of a sweet spiritual smell, send down in answer on us the grace of Thy all-holy Spirit.</P>

<P>And, O God, look upon us, and have regard to this our reasonable service, and accept it, as Thou didst accept the gifts of Abel, the sacrifices of Noah, the priestly offices of Moses and Aaron, the peace-offerings of Samuel, the repentance of David, the incense of Zacharias. As Thou didst accept from the hand of Thy apostles this true service, so accept also in Thy goodness from the hands of us sinners these offered gifts; and grant that our offering may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit, as a propitiation<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8280_2619096">23</A></SUP> for our transgressions and the errors of the people; and for the rest of the souls<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8281_2619215">24</A></SUP> that have fallen asleep aforetime; that we also, Thy humble, sinful, and unworthy servants, being counted worthy without guile to serve Thy holy altar, may receive the reward of faithful and wise stewards, and may find grace and mercy in the terrible day of Thy just and good retribution.</P>

<P>XXVII. Prayer of the veil:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8283_2619562">25</A></SUP>  We thank Thee, O Lord our God, that Thou hast given us boldness for the entrance of Thy holy places, which Thou hast renewed to us as a new and living way through the veil of the flesh<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8284_2619883">26</A></SUP> of Thy Christ. We therefore, being counted worthy to enter into the place of the tabernacle of Thy glory, and to be within the veil, and to behold the Holy of Holies, cast ourselves down before Thy goodness:</P>

<P>Lord, have mercy on us: since we are full of fear and trembling, when about to stand at Thy holy altar, and to offer this dread and bloodless sacrifice for our own sins and for the errors of the people:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8286_2620402">27</A></SUP> send forth, O God, Thy good grace, and sanctify our souls, and bodies, and spirits; and turn our thoughts to holiness, that with a pure conscience we may bring to Thee a peace-offering, the sacrifice of praise:</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>The Priest: Peace be to all.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Let us stand reverently, let us stand in the fear of God, and with contrition: let us attend to the holy communion service, to offer peace to God.</P>

</UL><P>The People: The offering of peace, the sacrifice of praise.</P>

<P>[A veil is now withdrawn from the oblation of bread and wine.]</P>

<P>The Priest: And, uncovering the veils that darkly invest in symbol<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn82.htm#P8294_2621204">28</A></SUP> this sacred ceremonial, do Thou reveal it clearly to us: fill our intellectual vision with absolute light, and having purified our poverty from every pollution of flesh and spirit, make it worthy of this dread and awful approach: for Thou art an all-merciful and gracious God, and we send up the praise and the. thanksgiving to Thee, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now, and always, and for ever.</P>

  <P>The People: And with thy spirit.</P>

  <P>The Priest: Let us lift up our minds and our hearts.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8300_2621906">29</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>The People: It is becoming and right.</P>

  <P>Then the Priest prays: Verily it is becoming and right, proper and due to praise Thee, to sing of Thee, to bless Thee, to worship Thee, to glorify Thee, to give Thee thanks, Maker of every creature visible and invisible, the treasure of eternal good things, the fountain of life and immortality, God and Lord of all:</P>

</UL><P>Whom the heavens of heavens praise, and all the host of them; the sun, and the moon, and all the choir of the stars; earth, sea, and all that is in them; Jerusalem, the heavenly assembly, and church of the first-born that are written in heaven; spirits of just men and of prophets; souls of martyrs and of apostles; angels, archangels, thrones, dominions, principalities, and authorities, and dread powers; and the many-eyed cherubim, and the six-winged seraphim, which cover their faces with two wings, their feet with two, and with two they fly, crying one to another with unresting lips, with unceasing praises:</P>

  <UL><P>(Aloud.) With loud voice singing the victorious hymn of Thy majestic glory, crying aloud, praising, shouting, and saying:-</P>

  <P>The People: Holy, holy, holy, O Lord of Sabaoth, the heaven and the earth are full of Thy glory. Hosanna in the highest; blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8306_2623241">30</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>XXIX. The Priest, making the sign of the cross<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8308_2623348">31</A></SUP> on the gifts, says: Holy art Thou, King of eternity, and Lord and giver of all holiness; holy also Thy only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom Thou hast made all things; holy also Thy Holy Spirit, which searches all things, even Thy deep things, O God: holy art Thou, almighty, all-powerful, good, dread, merciful, most compassionate to Thy creatures; who didst make man from earth after Thine own image and likeness; who didst give him the joy of paradise; and when he transgressed Thy commandment, and fell away, didst not disregard nor desert him, O Good One, but didst chasten him as at merciful father, call him by the law, instruct him by the prophets; and afterwards didst send forth Thine only-begotten Son Himself, our Lord Jesus Christ, into the world, that He by His coming might renew and restore Thy image;</P>

<P>Who, having descended from heaven, and become flesh of the Holy Spirit and Virgin Godmother<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8310_2624330">32</A></SUP> Mary, and having sojourned among men, fulfilled the dispensation for the salvation of our race; and being about to endure His voluntary and life-giving death by the cross, He the sinless for us the sinners, in the night in which He was betrayed, nay, rather delivered Himself up for the life and salvation of the world,</P>

  <UL><P>XXX. Then the Priest holds the bread in his hand, and says: Having taken the bread in His holy and pure and blameless and immortal hands, lifting up His eyes to heaven, and showing it to Thee, His God and Father, He gave thanks, and hallowed, and brake, and gave it to us,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8312_2624987">33</A></SUP> His disciples and apostles, saying:-</P>

  <P>The Deacons say:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8314_2625181">34</A></SUP>  For the remission of sins and life everlasting.</P>

  <P>Then he says aloud: Take, eat: this is my body, broken for you, and given for remission of sins.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>Then he takes the cup, and says: In like manner, after supper, He took the cup, and having mixed wine and water, lifting up His eyes to heaven, and presenting it to Thee, His God and Father, He gave thanks, and hollowed and blessed it, and filled it with the Holy Spirit, and gave it to us His disciples, saying, Drink ye all of it; this is my blood of the new testament shed for you and many, and distributed for the remission of sins.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>The Priest: This do in remembrance of me; for as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show forth the Lord's death, and confess His resurrection, till He come.</P>

  <P>The Deacons say: We believe and confess:</P>

  <P>The People: We show forth Thy death, O Lord, and confess Thy resurrection.</P>

</UL><P>XXXI. The Priest (Oblation): Remembering, therefore, His life-giving sufferings, His saving cross, His death and His burial, and resurrection from the dead on the third day, and His ascension into heaven, and sitting at the right hand of Thee, our God and Father, and His second glorious and awful appearing, when He shall come with glory to judge the quick and the dead, and render to every one according to His works; even we, sinful men, offer unto Thee, O Lord, this dread and bloodless sacrifice, praying that Thou wilt not deal with us after our sins, nor reward us according to our iniquities;</P>

<P>But that Thou, according to Thy mercy and Thy unspeakable loving-kindness, passing by and blotting out the handwriting against us Thy suppliants, wilt grant to us Thy heavenly and eternal gifts (which eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, and which have not entered into the heart of man<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8324_2627111">35</A></SUP> ) that thou hast prepared, O God, for those who love Thee; and reject not, O loving Lord, the people for my sake, or for my sin's sake:</P>

  <UL><P>Then he says, thrice: For Thy people and Thy Church supplicate Thee.</P>

  <P>The People: Have mercy on us, O Lord our God, Father Almighty.</P>

  <P>XXXII. Again the Priest says (Invocation): Have mercy upon us, O God Almighty. Have mercy upon us, O God our Saviour. Have mercy upon us, O God, according to Thy great mercy, and send forth on us, and on these offered gifts, Thy all-holy Spirit.</P>

  <P>Then, bowing his neck, he says: The sovereign and quickening Spirit, that sits upon the throne with Thee, our God and Father, and with Thy only-begotten Son, reigning with Thee; the consubstantial<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8329_2627887">36</A></SUP> and co-eternal; that spoke in the law and in the prophets, and in Thy New Testament; that descended in the form of a dove on our Lord Jesus Christ at the river Jordan, and abode on Him; that descended on Thy apostles in the form of tongues of fire in the upper room of the holy and glorious Zion on the day of Pentecost: this Thine all-holy Spirit, send down, O Lord, upon us, and upon these offered holy gifts;</P>

  <P>And rising up, he says aloud: That coming, by His holy and good and glorious appearing, He may sanctify this bread, and make it the holy body of Thy Christ.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8331_2628491">37</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>The Priest: And this cup the precious blood of Thy Christ.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>XXXIII. The Priest by himself standing: That they may be to all that partake of them for remission of sins, and for life everlasting, for the sanctification of souls and of bodies, for bearing the fruit of good works, for the stablishing of Thy Holy Catholic Church, which Thou hast founded on the Rock of Faith,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8336_2629081">38</A></SUP> that the gates of hell may not prevail against it; delivering it from all heresy and scandals, and from those who work iniquity, keeping it till the fulness of the time.</P>

</UL><P>XXXIV. And having bowed, he says: We present them to Thee also, O Lord, for the holy places, which Thou hast glorified by the divine appearing of Thy Christ, and by the visitation of Thy all-holy Spirit; especially for the glorious Zion, the mother of all the churches;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8338_2629564">39</A></SUP> and for Thy Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church throughout the world: even now, O Lord, bestow upon her the rich gifts of Thy all-holy Spirit.</P>

<P>Remember also, O Lord, our holy fathers and brethren in it, and the bishops in all the world, who rightly divide the word of Thy truth.</P>

<P>Remember also, O Lord, every city and country, and those of the true faith dwelling in them, their peace and security.</P>

<P>Remember, O Lord, Christians sailing, travelling, sojourning in strange lands; our fathers and brethren, who are in bonds, prison, captivity, and exile; who are in mines, and under torture, and in bitter slavery.Remember, O Lord, the sick and afflicted, and those troubled by unclean spirits, their speedy healing from Thee, O God, and their salvation.</P>

<P>Remember, O Lord, every Christian soul in affliction and distress, needing Thy mercy and succour, O God; and the return of the erring.</P>

<P>Remember, O Lord, our fathers and brethren, toiling hard, and ministering unto us, for Thy holy name's sake.</P>

<P>Remember all, O Lord, for good: have mercy on all, O Lord, be reconciled to us all: give peace to the multitudes of Thy people: put away scandals: bring wars to an end: make the uprising of heresies to cease: grant Thy peace and Thy love to us, O God our Saviour, the hope of all the ends of the earth.</P>

<P>Remember, O Lord, favourable weather, peaceful showers, beneficent dews, abundance of fruits, and to crown the year with Thy goodness; for the eyes of all wait on Thee, and Thou givest their food in due season: thou openest Thy hand, and fillest every living thing with gladness.</P>

<P>Remember, O Lord, those who bear fruit, and labour honourably in the holy<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8347_2631331">40</A></SUP> of Thy Church; and those who forget not the poor, the widows, the orphans, the strangers, and the needy; and all who have desired us to remember them in our prayers.</P>

<P>Moreover, O Lord, be pleased to remember those who have brought these offerings this day to Thy holy altar, and for what each one has brought them or with what mind, and those persons who have just now been mentioned to Thee.</P>

<P>Remember, O Lord, according to the multitude of Thy mercy and compassion, me also, Thy humble and unprofitable servant; and the deacons who surround Thy holy altar, and graciously give them a blameless life, keep their ministry undefiled, and purchase for them a good degree, that we may find mercy and grace, with all the saints that have been well pleasing to Thee since the world began, to generation and generation-grandsires, sires, patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, confessors, teachers, saints, and every just spirit made perfect in the faith of Thy Christ.</P>

<P>XXXV.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8351_2632369">41</A></SUP> Hail, Mary, highly favoured: the Lord is with Thee; blessed art thou among women, and blessed the fruit of thy womb, for thou didst bear the Saviour of our souls.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8352_2632640">42</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P>XXXVI. The Deacons: Remember us, O Lord God.</P>

</UL><P>The Priest, bowing, says: Remember, O Lord God, the spirits and all flesh, of whom we have made mention, and of whom we have not made mention, who are of the true faith, from righteous Abel unto this day: unto them do Thou give rest there in the land of the living, in Thy kingdom, in the joy of paradise, in the bosom of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, our holy fathers; whence pain, and grief, and lamentation have fled: there the light of Thy countenance looks upon them, and enlightens them for ever.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8355_2634074">43</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Make the end of our lives Christian, acceptable, blameless, and peaceful, O Lord, gathering us together, O Lord, under the feet of Thine elect, when Thou wilt, and as Thou wilt; only without shame and transgressions, through Thy only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ: for He is the only sinless one who hath appeared on the earth.</P>

<P>The Deacon: And let us pray:-</P>

<P>For the peace and establishing of the whole world, and of the holy churches of God, and for the purposes for which each one made his offering, or according to the desire he has: and for the people standing round, and for all men, and all women:</P>

  <UL><P>The People: And for all men and all women. (<I>Amen.</I>)</P>

  <P>The Priest says aloud: Wherefore, both to them and to us, do Thou in Thy goodness and love:</P>

  <P>The People: Forgive, remit, pardon, O God, our transgressions, voluntary and involuntary: in deed and in word: in knowledge and in ignorance: by night and by day: in thought and intent: in Thy goodness and love, forgive us them all.</P>

  <P>The Priest: Through the grace and compassion and love of Thy only-begotten Son, with whom Thou art blessed and glorified, together with the all-holy, and good, and quickening Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>XXXVII. The Priest: Peace be to all:</P>

  <P>The People: And to thy spirit.</P>

</UL><P>The Deacon: Again, and continually, in peace let us pray to the Lord.</P>

<P>For the gifts to the Lord God presented and sanctified, precious, heavenly, unspeakable, pure, glorious, dread, awful, divine;</P>

<P>Let us pray.</P>

<P>That the Lord our God, having graciously received them to His altar that is holy and above the heavens, rational and spiritual, for the odour of a sweet spiritual savour, may send down in answer upon us the divine grace and the gift of the all-holy Spirit;</P>

<P>Let us pray. </P>

<P>Having prayed for the unity of the faith, and the communion of His all-holy and adorable Spirit;</P>

<P>Let us commend ourselves and one another, and our whole life, to Christ our God:</P>

  <UL><P>The People: Amen.</P>

</UL><P>XXXVIII. The Priest prays: God and Father of our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ, the glorious Lord, the blessed essence, the bounteous goodness, the God and Sovereign of all, who art blessed to all eternity, who sittest upon the cherubim, and art glorified by the seraphim, before whom stand thousand thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand hosts of angels and archangels: Thou hast accepted the gifts, offerings, and fruits brought unto Thee as an odour of a sweet spiritual smell, and hast been pleased to sanctify them, and make them perfect, O good One, by the grace of Thy Christ, and by the presence of Thy all-holy Spirit.</P>

<P>Sanctify also, O Lord, our souls, and bodies, and spirits, and touch our understandings, and search our consciences, and cast out from us every evil imagination, every impure feeling, every base desire, every unbecoming thought, all envy, and vanity, and hypocrisy, all lying, all deceit, every worldly affection, all covetousness, all vainglory, all indifference, all vice, all passion, all anger, all malice, all blasphemy, every motion of the flesh and spirit that is not in accordance with Thy holy will:</P>

  <UL><P> (Aloud.) And count us worthy, O loving Lord, with boldness, without condemnation, in a pure heart, with a contrite spirit, with unshamed face, with sanctified lips, to dare to call upon Thee, the holy God, Father in heaven, and to say,</P>

  <P>The People: Our Father, which art in heaven: hollowed be Thy name; <I>and so on to the doxology.</I></P>

  <P>The Priest, bowing, says (the Embolism<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8379_2637672">44</A></SUP> ): And lead us not into temptation, Lord, Lord of Hosts, who knowest our frailty, but deliver us from the evil one and his works, and from all his malice and craftiness, for the sake of Thy holy name, which has been placed upon our humility:</P>

  <P> (Aloud.) For Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and for ever.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>XXXIX. The Priest: Peace be to all.</P>

  <P>The People: And to thy spirit.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Let us bow our heads to the Lord.</P>

  <P>The People: To Thee, O Lord.</P>

</UL><P>The Priest prays, speaking thus: To Thee, O Lord, we Thy servants have bowed our heads before Thy holy altar, waiting for the rich mercies that are from Thee.</P>

<P>Send forth upon us, O Lord, Thy plenteous grace and Thy blessing; and sanctify our souls, bodies, and spirits, that we may become worthy communicants and partakers of Thy holy mysteries, to the forgiveness of sins and life everlasting:</P>

  <UL><P> (Aloud.) For adorable and glorified art Thou, our God, and Thy only-begotten Son, and Thy all-holy Spirit, now and ever.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>The Priest says aloud: And the grace and the mercies of the holy and consubstantial, and uncreated, and adorable Trinity, shall be with us all.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8391_2639030">45</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>The People: And with thy spirit.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: In the fear of God, let us attend.</P>

  <P>The Priest says secretly:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn83.htm#P8395_2639192">46</A></SUP>  O holy Lord, that abidest in holy places, sanctify us by the word of Thy grace, and by the visitation of Thy all-holy Spirit: for Thou, O Lord, hast said, Ye will be holy, for I am holy. O Lord our God, incomprehensible Word of God, one in substance with the Father and the Holy Spirit, co-eternal and indivisible, accept the pure hymn, in Thy holy and bloodless sacrifices; with the cherubim, and seraphim, and from me, a sinful man, crying and saying:-</P>

  <P>XL. He takes up the gifts and saith aloud: The holy things unto holy. </P>

  <P>The People: One <I>only is holy, one Lord Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the Father, to whom be glory to all eternity.</I></P>

</UL><P>XLI. The Deacon: For the remission of our sins, and the propitiation of our souls, and for every soul in tribulation and distress, needing the mercy and succour of God, and for the return of the erring, the healing of the sick, the deliverance of the captives, the rest of our fathers and brethren who have fallen asleep aforetime;</P>

<P>Let us all say fervently, Lord, have mercy:</P>

  <UL><P>The People (twelve times): Lord, have mercy.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8401_2640346">47</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>Then the Priest breaks the bread, and holds the half in his right hand, and the half in his left, and dips that in his right hand in the chalice, saying: The union of the all-holy body and precious blood of our Lord and God and Saviour, Jesus Christ.</P>

  <P>Then he makes the sign of the cross on that in his left hand: then with that which has been signed the other half: then forthwith he begins to divide, and before all to give to each chalice a single piece, saying: It has been made one, and sanctified, and perfected, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever.</P>

  <P>And when he makes the sign of the cross on the bread, he says: Behold the Lamb of God, the Son of the Father, that taketh away the sin of the world, sacrificed for the life and salvation of the world.</P>

  <P>And when he gives a single piece to each chalice he says: A holy portion of Christ, full of grace and truth, of the Father, and of the Holy Spirit, to whom be the glory and the power to all eternity.</P>

  <P>XLII. Then he begins to divide, and to say: The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want. In green pastures, <I>and so on.</I><SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8407_2641600">48</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>Then, I will bless the Lord at all times, <I>and so on.</I><SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8409_2641669">49</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>Then, I will extol Thee, my God, O King, <I>and so on.</I><SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8411_2641737">50</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>Then, O praise the Lord, all ye nations, <I>and so on.</I><SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8413_2641804">51</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>The Deacon: Sir, pronounce the blessing.</P>

  <P>The Priest: The Lord will bless us, and keep us without condemnation for the communion of His pure gifts, now and always, and for ever.</P>

  <P>And when they have filled,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8417_2642022">52</A></SUP> the Deacon says: Sir, pronounce the blessing.</P>

  <P>The Priest says: The Lord will bless us, and make us worthy with the pure touchings of our fingers to take the live coal, and place it upon the mouths of the faithful for the purification and renewal of their souls and bodies, now and always.</P>

  <P>Then, O taste and see that the Lord is good; who is parted and not divided; distributed to the faithful and not expended; for the remission of sins, and the life everlasting; now and always, and for ever.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: In the peace of Christ, let us sing:</P>

  <P>The Singers: O taste and see that the Lord is good.</P>

  <P>The Priest says the prayer before the communion: O Lord our God, the heavenly bread, the life of the universe, I have sinned against Heaven, and before Thee, and am not worthy to partake of Thy pure mysteries; but as a merciful God, make me worthy by Thy grace, without condemnation to partake of Thy holy body and precious blood, for the remission of sins, and life everlasting.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8423_2643045">53</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>XLIII. Then he distributes to the clergy; and when the deacons take the disks<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8425_2643159">54</A></SUP> and the chalices for distribution to the people, the Deacon, who takes the first disk, says: Sir, pronounce the blessing.</P>

  <P>The Priest replies: Glory to God who has sanctified and is sanctifying us all.</P>

  <P>The Deacon says: Be Thou exalted, O God, over the heavens, and Thy glory over all the earth, and Thy kingdom endureth to all eternity.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8428_2643509">55</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>And when the Deacon is about to put it on the side-table<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8430_2643670">56</A></SUP> the Priest says: Blessed be the name of the Lord our God for ever.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: In the fear of God, and in faith and love, draw nigh.</P>

  <P>The People: Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8433_2643899">57</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>And again, when he sets down the disk upon the side-table, he says: Sir, pronounce the blessing.</P>

  <P>The Priest: Save Thy people, O God, and bless Thine inheritance.</P>

  <P>The Priest again.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8437_2644117">58</A></SUP>  Glory to our God, who has sanctified us all.</P>

  <P>And when he has put the chalice back an the holy table, the Priest says: Blessed be the name of the Lord to all eternity.</P>

  <P>The Deacons and the People say: Fill our mouths with Thy praise, O Lord, and fill our lips with joy, that we may sing of Thy glory, of Thy greatness all the day.</P>

  <P>And again: We render thanks to Thee, Christ our God, that Thou hast made us worthy to partake of Thy body and blood, for the remission of sins, and for life everlasting. Do Thou, in Thy goodness and love, keep us, we pray Thee, without condemnation.</P>

  <P>XLIV. The prayer of incense at the last entrance: We render thanks to Thee, the Saviour and God of all, for all the good things Thou hast given us, and for the participation of Thy holy and pure mysteries, and we offer to Thee this incense, praying: Keep us under the shadow of Thy wings, and count us worthy till our last breath to partake of Thy holy rites for the sanctification of our souls and bodies, for the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven: for Thou, O God, art our sanctification, and we send up praise and thanksgiving to Thee, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</P>

  <P>The Deacon begins in the entrance: Glory to Thee, glory to Thee, glory to Thee, O Christ the King, only-begotten Word of the Father, that Thou hast counted us, Thy sinful and unworthy servants, worthy to enjoy thy pure mysteries for the remission of sins, and for life everlasting: glory to Thee.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8443_2645614">59</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>XLV. And when he has made the entrance, the Deacon begins to speak thus: Again and again, and at all times, in peace, let us beseech the Lord.</P>

<P>That the participation of His Holy rites may be to us for the turning away from every wicked thing, for our support on the journey to life everlasting, for the communion and gift of the Holy Spirit;</P>

<P>Let us pray.</P>

  <UL><P>The Priest prays: Commemorating our all-holy, pure, most glorious, blessed Lady, the God-Mother and Ever-Virgin Mary,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8448_2646158">60</A></SUP> and all the saints that have been well-pleasing to Thee since the world began, let us devote ourselves, and one another, and our whole life, to Christ our God:</P>

  <P>The People: To Thee, O Lord.</P>

  <P>XLVI. The Priest: O God, who through Thy great and unspeakable love didst condescend to the weakness of Thy servants, and hast counted us worthy to partake of this heavenly table, condemn not us sinners for the participation of Thy pure mysteries; but keep us, O good One, in the sanctification of Thy Holy Spirit, that being made holy, we may find part and inheritance with all Thy saints that have been well-pleasing to Thee since the world began, in the light of Thy countenance, through the mercy of Thy only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ, with whom Thou art blessed, together with Thy all-holy, and good, and quickening Spirit: for blessed and glorified is Thy all-precious and glorious name, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity.</P>

  <P>Dismission prayer, spoken by the Deacon: Going on from glory to glory, we praise Thee, the Saviour of our souls. Glory to Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit now and ever, and to all eternity. We praise Thee, the Saviour of our souls.</P>

  <P>XLIX. The Priest says a prayer from the altar to the sacristy: Going on from strength to strength, and having fulfilled all the divine service in Thy temple, even now we beseech Thee, O Lord our God, make us worthy of perfect loving-kindness; make straight our path: root us in Thy fear, and make us worthy of the heavenly kingdom, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom Thou art blessed, together with Thy all-holy, and good, and quickening Spirit, now and always, and for ever.</P>

  <P>L. The Deacon: Again and again, and at all times, in peace let us beseech the Lord.</P>

  <P>Prayer said in the sacristy after the dismissal: Thou hast given unto us, O Lord, sanctification in the communion of the all-holy body and precious blood of Thy only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ; give unto us also the grace of Thy good Spirit, and keep us blameless in the faith, lead us unto perfect adoption and redemption, and to the coming joys of eternity; for Thou art our sanctification and light, O God, and Thy only-begotten Son, and Thy all-holy Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: In the peace of Christ let us keep watch.</P>

  <P>The Priest: Blessed is God, who blesseth and sanctifieth through the communion of the holy, and quickening, and pure mysteries, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen.</P>

</UL><P>Then the prayer of propitiation: O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, Lamb and Shepherd, who takest away the sin of the world, who didst freely forgive their debt to the two debtors, and gavest remission of her sins to the woman that was a sinner, who gavest healing to the paralytic, with the remission of his sins; forgive, remit, pardon, O God, our offences, voluntary and involuntary, in knowledge and in ignorance, by transgression and by disobedience, which Thy all-holy Spirit knows better than Thy servants do:</P>

<P>And if men, carnal and dwelling in this world, have in aught erred from Thy commandments, either moved by the devil, whether in word or in deed, or if they have come under a curse, or by reason of some special vow, I entreat and beseech Thy unspeakable loving-kindness, that they may be set free from their word, and released from the oath and the special vow, according to Thy goodness.</P>

<P>Verily, O Sovereign Lord, hear my supplication on behalf of Thy servants, and do Thou pass by all their errors, remembering them no more; forgive them every transgression, voluntary and involuntary; deliver them from everlasting punishment: for Thou art He that hast commanded us, saying, Whatsoever things ye bind upon earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever things ye loose upon earth, shall be loosed in heaven: for, thou art our God, a God able to pity, and to save and to forgive sins; and glory is due unto Thee, with the eternal Father, and the quickening Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen. </P>
