to the online edition</b></p>
<hr>

<p>This important and interesting work was discovered only in 1904, in an
Armenian translation, and the first English translation was published in London
and New York in 1920.&nbsp; This is the translation that follows.&nbsp; The
translator was J. Armitage Robinson.&nbsp; A modern translation, which is highly
recommended, exists in the Ancient Christian Writers series.&nbsp; Robinson
titled his version, &quot;Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching&quot; but the
ACW uses the title &quot;Proof of the Apostolic Preaching&quot;, which has been
adopted here.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ccel.org">CCEL</a> began to scan this volume a long
time ago, but few seem to have been aware of it and progress has apparently
stopped.&nbsp; Furthermore the format of the version that they are making breaks
the text up into a multitude of pages, making it hard to read or
reference.&nbsp; I have therefore scanned the text with abbreviated notes and
placed it here, in order to promote interest in this little known
work.*&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have omitted the long introductory essay by the translator on the doctrine
of the Holy Spirit in Justin and Irenaeus.&nbsp; I have also omitted most of the
footnotes.&nbsp; The majority of these indicate passages in the <i>Adversus
Haereses</i> where Irenaeus quotes the same passage of scripture.&nbsp; The
manuscript text was in Armenian.&nbsp; None of the footnotes include any of this
-- no doubt SPCK's compositors wisely objected -- but Robinson compensates by
quoting the <i>AH</i> in Latin, and at least one chunk of Greek on every page,
usually from the Old Testament.&nbsp; All this I have omitted, leaving a series
of dots where the Greek was.&nbsp; Finally I have moved the marginal scripture
references into the footnotes, and omitted the indices.&nbsp; No doubt all these
things will be present in the CCEL edition.</p>

<p align="left">* Postscript, 4th October 2003.&nbsp; I've had a note from my
friends at the CCEL to the effect that their version has been updated, and the
table of contents can be accessed <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/irenaeus/demonstr.toc.html">here</a>.&nbsp;
The main text, together with the latter part of the introduction, is <a href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/irenaeus/demonstr.iv.iii.html">here</a>,
and the myriad little pages seem to have gone.&nbsp; The new version appears to
include all the material.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I think the format I have here
will still be useful.</p>
