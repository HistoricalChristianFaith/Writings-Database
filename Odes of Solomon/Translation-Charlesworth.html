      ... I am putting on the love of the Lord.
    <LI>
      And His members are with Him, and I am dependent on them; and He loves me.
    <LI>
      For I should not have known how to love the Lord, if He had not continuously
      loved me.
    <LI>
      Who is able to distinguish love, except him who is loved?
    <LI>
      I love the Beloved and I myself love Him, and where His rest is, there also
      am I.
    <LI>
      And I shall be no stranger, because there is no jealousy with the Lord Most
      High and Merciful.
    <LI>
      I have been united to Him, because the lover has found the Beloved, because
      I love Him that is the Son, I shall become a son.
    <LI>
      Indeed he who is joined to Him who is immortal, truly shall be immortal.
    <LI>
      And he who delights in the Life will become living.

      No man can pervert Your holy place, O my God; nor can he change it, and put
      it in another place.

      Because he has no power over it; for Your sanctuary You designed before You
      made special places.

      The ancient one shall not be perverted by those which are inferior to it.
      You have given Your heart, O Lord, to Your believers.
    <LI>
      Never will You be idle, nor will You be without fruits;
    <LI>
      For one hour of Your faith is more excellent than all days and years.
    <LI>
      For who shall put on Your grace and be rejected?
    <LI>
      Because Your seal is known; and Your creatures are known to it.

      And Your hosts possess it, and the elect archangels are clothed with it.

      You have given to us Your fellowship, not that You were in need of us, but
      that we are always in need of You.

      Shower upon us Your gentle rain, and open Your bountiful springs which abundantly
      supply us with milk and honey.

      have promised;

      For that which You gave, You gave freely, so that no longer will You draw
      back and take them again.

      For all was manifest to You as God, and was set in order from the beginning

      For thus it was from the beginning, and will be until the end.
    <LI>
      So that nothing shall be contrary, and nothing shall rise up against Him.
    <LI>
      The Lord has multiplied his knowledge, and He was zealous that those things
      should be known which through His grace have been given to us.
    <LI>
      And His praise He gave us on account of His name, our spirits praise His
      Holy Spirit.
    <LI>
      For there went forth a stream, and it became a river great and broad; indeed
      it carried away everything, and it shattered and brought it to the Temple.
    <LI>
      And the barriers which were built by men were not able to restrain it, nor
      even the arts of them who habitually restrain water.
    <LI>
      For it spread over the surface of all the earth, and it filled everything.

      Then all the thirsty upon the earth drank, and thirst was relieved and quenched;

      Blessed, therefore, are the ministers of that drink, who have been entrusted

      They have refreshed the parched lips, and have aroused the paralyzed will.

      Even living persons who were about to expire, they have held back from death.

      My joy is the Lord and my course is towards Him, this path of mine is beautiful.

      For there is a Helper for me, the Lord. He has generously shown Himself to
      me in His simplicity, because His kindness has diminished His dreadfulness.
    <LI>
      He became like me, that I might receive Him. In form He was considered like
      me, that I might put Him on.

      And I trembled not when I saw Him, because He was gracious to me.
    <LI>
      Like my nature He became, that I might understand Him. And like my form,
      that I might not turn away from Him.
    <LI>
      The Father of knowledge is the Word of knowledge.
    <LI>
      He who created wisdom is wiser than His works.
    <LI>
      And He who created me when yet I was not knew what I would do when I came
      into being.
    <LI>
      On account of this He was gracious to me in His abundant grace, and allowed
      me to ask from Him and to benefit from His sacrifice.
    <LI>
      For He it is who is incorrupt, the perfection of the worlds and their Father.
    <LI>
      He has allowed Him to appear to them that are His own; in order that they
      may recognize Him that made them, and not suppose that they came of themselves.
    <LI>
      For towards knowledge He has set His way, he has widened it and lengthened
      it and brought it to complete perfection.
    <LI>
      And has set over it the traces of His light, and it proceeded from the beginning
      until the end.
    <LI>
      For by Him He was served, and He was pleased by the Son.
    <LI>
      And because of his salvation He will possess everything. And the Most High
      will be known by His holy ones:
    <LI>
      To announce to those who have songs of the coming of the Lord, that they
      may go forth to meet Him and may sing to Him, with joy and with the harp
      of many tones.
    <LI>
      The Seers shall go before Him, and they shall be seen before Him.
    <LI>
      And they shall praise the Lord in His love, because He is near and does see.
    <LI>
      And hatred shall be removed from the earth, and with jealousy it shall be
      drowned.

      For ignorance was destroyed upon it, because the knowledge of the Lord arrived

      Let the singers sing the grace of the Lord Most High, and let them bring

      And let there not be anyone who breathes that is without knowledge or voice.

      As the occupation of the ploughman is the ploughshare, and the occupation
      of the helmsman is the steering of the ship, so also my occupation is the
      psalm of the Lord by His hymns.
    <LI>
      My art and my service are in His hymns, because His love has nourished my

      For I am strengthened by His praises, and I have faith in Him.

      I will open my mouth, and His Spirit will speak through me the glory of the

      The work of His hands, and the labor of His fingers;

      It is He who made the earth broad, and placed the waters in the sea.

      He expanded the heaven, and fixed the stars.

      And the hosts are subject to His Word.
    <LI>
      The reservoir of light is the sun, and the reservoir of darkness is the night.

      My chains were cut off by His hands, I received the face and likeness of
