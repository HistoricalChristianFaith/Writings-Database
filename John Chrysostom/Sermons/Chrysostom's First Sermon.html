<p align="center"><b>John Chrysostom, First Sermon (2010)</b></p>
<hr>

<h3 align=center>Homily given by
St. John Chrysostom on the day that he was ordained priest.&nbsp;</h3>

<p align=center><b>Foreword.</b></p>

<p align=justify>John was called to the priesthood and ordained by Flavian, bishop of Antioch, early in the year 386. &nbsp;So this is the date of his first discourse: he
had not yet descended into the lists, as he himself puts it.&nbsp; In this essay, his modesty shines no less
than his eloquence: he frequently calls himself <i> a little boy</i> <span class=greek>&#956;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#8055;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span>; although,
as his birth dated back at least to the year 347, he was then about forty years
old. This shows that the terms, <i> childhood, old age</i>, and the like, so often used
by the speaker, provide no data when it comes to working out the dates of his
life. This point we have already made and solidly proven in the famous discourse
on his mother.</p>

<hr>

<h3 align=center>HOMILY.</h3>

<p align=center><i>St. John Chrysostom speaks of himself, the bishop
and the people.</i></p>

<p align=justify>1. &nbsp;Is what has happened to us true? &nbsp;Is what strikes us reality? Are we not in&nbsp; the grip of an illusion? Are these
hallucinations of the night and of dreams, or the clear sight of day, and are we
all awake at this hour? Who can persuade himself that in broad daylight, when
men have all their intelligence and all their activity, a
poor child, without any merit, is vested with such power and such an honour? That
this might happen in a dream is not a wonder: awkward people, men so poor they
do not have even necessary food, they sometimes dream that they take on
strength and beauty, that they are seated at a royal table, but this alas! is just an effect of sleep, a trick of the imagination; we
know that dream is a skilled craftsman of errors and wonders; it likes to trick
us, it delights in a world of strange phantoms. Daytime is another matter, and
nothing similar takes place in the world of realities. It is impossible, nevertheless,
to doubt &nbsp;it: this is all too certain,
everything is done, done, done before your eyes; the wonders of the dream are
overwhelmed by the simple truth, and I see here now this great city, so many
people, this astonishing multitude, who direct their eager eyes to my littleness,
as if something remarkable and beautiful must come out of my mouth.</p>

<p align=justify>Well! even if my words could
flow with the fullness and majesty of the great rivers, and I had in me the waves
of eloquence, the sight of the crowd gathered to listen would stop them suddenly
in there course and make them flow back to their source. And when we are so far
from such an abundance, where our words can not even compare with the slightest
rain, how could they not be withered by fear to some degree? How is it that the
same phenomenon does not happen in the soul as in the body? What can I say? Does
it not often happen that we seem to be afraid of the things that we have before
us and that we have a firm grasp of, as if our nerves were paralyzed and our powers
destroyed. This is what I fear at the moment: the thoughts that I have gathered
with much trouble, although they are basically irrelevant and worthless, I
tremble to see them escape my memory, fade and vanish, leaving my soul in a vacuum. I beseech you all, you who command, and you whom I
must obey, the agony in which you have thrown me by your willingness to come
and hear me: change it, by your fervent prayers, into a holy boldness; inspire
me with the strength by your representations to He who fills intrepid pioneers
of truth with his word (<i>Psalm</i>., 67:12),
to put His discourses on my lips. <i>Ephes</i>., vi, 19.
This will not be difficult for you, numerous as you are, and having so many
merits to present to God, to strengthen a soul which is lacking experience and frozen
with fear. In fact you will satisfy a duty of justice by fulfilling our wishes:
for you and your charity, we will face up to the chances of a most violent and
most tyrannical game, in addressing, despite our inability, the Ministry of the
word, in coming to tread the burning arena of intellect, we who have never
attempted
this noble exercise, and always kept silent in the ranks of listeners.&nbsp;</p>

<p align=justify>What sort of man would be so cold, so insensitive as to
remain silent in the face of such a meeting, even if he was not speaking to
brothers whose sympathy is equal to their pious impatience, and if he was the
most incompetent of men to speak in public? I promised myself, opening my mouth
for the first time in church, to devote to God the first fruits of my word,
this gift that comes to us from him. It must be so: if the first-fruits of the crops
and the wine-press are owed to him, still more are those of the word: to him,
thus, our first flowers! The more the fruits are blessed for us, the more they
are acceptable to Him. The grape and the ear of corn grow from of the bosom of
the earth, nourished by the waters of heaven and the labors of man: the sacred
hymn of devotion born of the soul is nourished by a pure conscience, and God
receives it into the heavenly granaries. As the soul is superior to the earth,
so the latter result outweighs the first. As one of
the prophets, a man eminent and sublime, Hosea, speaking to sinners who wanted
to appease the wrath of God, advised them to make an offering, not whole herds
of cattle, nor abundant measures of wheat, nor a turtle-dove, or pigeon, or anything similar, finally, and
what then? what does he say? &quot;Bring words with
you.&quot; <i>Hos</i>. xiv, 3. &mdash; What
kind of sacrifice is that? you may ask. &mdash; The greatest
of all, O my beloved! the most beautiful, most
perfect. Who says so? A man deeply versed in the science of religion, the
famous, the magnanimous David. Rendering thanks to God one day for a victory he
had won, he said: &quot;I will praise the name of my God through a song, and I will
honour him by my praises.&quot; <i>Psalm</i>.,
68:31. And to show the excellence of this sacrifice, he immediately adds:
&quot;And this tribute will be more pleasing to God than the sacrifice of a young bull whose horns and nails have begun to grow.&quot;
<i>&nbsp;Ibid</i>.,
32.</p>

<p align=justify>And I too wanted to sacrifice some victims on this
day, to water the spiritual altar&nbsp; with streams
of mystical blood. But, alas! a wise man closes my
mouth and stops me with these words: &quot;Praise loses its beauty on the lips
of a sinner.&quot; <i>&nbsp;Eccli</i>., xv, 9.&nbsp; Although a garland may be priceless, it is
not enough that the flowers are pure, pure also must be the hand that has woven
it.&nbsp; Likewise, although an anthem may be worthy
of God, the devotion of the words must be united to the piety of the soul who offers
them. And mine has no purity, no confidence, it is full of sins. Under these
provisions, silence is not only commanded by this law, there is a still more
ancient law that the prophet who spoke to us earlier of sacrifices gives: &quot;Praise
the Lord in the heavens, praise him on the highest peaks;&quot; and further on:
&quot;Praise the Lord upon the earth.&quot; <i>Psalm</i>.,
148:1 and 7.&nbsp; In calling for the same
purpose the two types of creatures, those of the upper world and those of the
underworld, things visible and invisible, those who fall within our senses and
those that are perceived by the intelligence, in forming a single choir of
heaven and earth to celebrate the King of the universe, David does not accept
the sinner, he obviously excludes him from this divine harmony.</p>

<p align=justify>2. &nbsp;So that the
truth is put in its true light, let us return to the main features of this
psalm. Having said: &quot;Praise the Lord in the heavens, praise him on the
highest peaks,&quot; the Psalmist continues: &quot;All you angels of the Lord,
all ye Virtues of God, set forth his praises.&quot; You see the angels who
praise the Creator, you see the archangels, you see the cherubim and seraphim,
the supreme virtues. In this last word, all the people in heaven are included.
Do you see the sinner? And let no one say: How could we see a sinner in heaven?
&nbsp;&mdash;Well, descend to earth, pass to another
part of the choir, the sinner is no more visible: &quot;Praise the Lord,
inhabitants of the earth, sea-monsters, and all who people the depths, beasts
of the field, and cattle, reptiles, and birds that go through the air on your
wings.&quot;</p>

<p align=justify>It was not without reason that I stopped once more, in
repeating these words: confusion reigned in my thoughts, I could not restrain
my tears, and I was about to burst into tears. What could be conceived more
appalling, tell me? The scorpions, reptiles and dragons are called by the
Prophet to praise him who gave them life: the sinner alone is excluded from the
sacred choir. And nothing is more just.&nbsp; It
is a perverse and cruel beast, sin; it works its malice, not on the body, its
slave, but even on the glory of God, &quot;Because of you, says the Lord, my
name is blasphemed among the nations.&quot;<i>
Isa</i>., 52:5.&nbsp; That is why the
Prophet banishes the sinner from the concert of creatures, like a bad citizen is
exiled from his homeland. A skilled musician removes from his lute a string
that makes inharmonic sounds, so that it does not destroy the effect of the
instrument; a doctor versed in his art does not hesitate to cut off a
gangrenous limb, lest the evil is communicated to the healthy part of the
body:&nbsp; the Prophet does the same, and makes
dissent and decay disappear from the universe.</p>

<p align=justify>What conduct should we adopt? Expelled, cut off as we
are, we should, it seems, condemn ourselves to silence. So we should not
mention ourselves, I ask? Is it not permissible to celebrate the Lord by our
hymns? Have we have in vain solicited the help of your prayers, called for the
protection of your charity? I think not: I perceive, I have adopted another way
to glorify God. Your prayers illuminate my perplexity like lightning in the
darkness: I will praise those who serve the same God as myself. Yes, I can praise
them, and these praises, directed to servants, turn to the honour of our common
Master. It is impossible to doubt it, because the Saviour said: &quot;Let your
light shine before men, so that they shall see your good works and glorify your
Father who is in heaven.&quot; <i>&nbsp;Matth</i>., 5:16.&nbsp; See then another kind of glorification which
the sinner himself can use without violating the law.</p>

<p align=justify>3. But which of the servants of our God may we praise?
And who else but our spiritual father, the minister of the Gospel charged with instructing
the our land, and through our land the world? From him you have learned how to
remain faithful to the truth unto death, and under his inspiration, you have
taught the rest of mankind to give up life rather than piety. Would you like us
to braid a garland for him, after that? This also was my desire, but I have
before me a vast ocean of merits, and I fear that my feeble voice, once engaged
in these depths, would no longer be able to return to the surface. It is
necessary here to talk of brilliant deeds that are already long ago, of perilous
journeys and long vigils, of dedicated care and judgments full of wisdom, of noble
battles, victories added to victories, trophies to trophies: all things which
are beyond the power not only of my tongue, but of human language, and which,
to be celebrated with dignity, demand the voice and zeal of an apostle able to
say and teach everything. But we will leave this difficult subject to deal with
another that presents fewer dangers, a sea in which a
small boat can venture. Let us talk simply of the austerity of his manners, his
rigid temperance, his utter contempt for material well-being, the admirable
simplicity of his table, and do not forget the grandeur and luxury that
surrounded him in childhood. It is no wonder, indeed, that a man brought up in
poverty as a practical way of life, is resigned to such harsh deprivation. &nbsp;Poverty itself, the constant companion of his
pilgrimage, makes every day the burden lighter. But anyone who has been master
of much wealth does not readily disengage himself from it, such is the swarm of
many passions that have enveloped his soul.&nbsp;
On the eyes of his intelligence weighs a cloud so thick of disordered
appetite, that he can no longer see the heavens, that constantly he has his head
and heart inclined towards the earth. Nothing blocks our rise towards heaven
like riches and the evils of which they are the source.&nbsp;</p>

<p align=justify>It is
not I who say this. Christ himself pronounced this sentence: &quot;A camel will
pass more easily through the eye of a needle than a rich man will enter the
kingdom of heaven.&quot; &nbsp;<i>Matth</i>., 19:24. However a thing so difficult, or rather,
impossible, offers only more difficulty. What Peter doubted in the presence of
his Master, the problem that demanded a solution, we have now amply witnessed by
experience. Not only do the rich go into heaven, but he has also led in an
entire people. &nbsp;And that, despite his
wealth and other obstacles that are not inferior to that one: youth, a
premature independence as a result the death of his parents, things are so full
of charms and so fruitful in poisons. Our father has triumphed over all, he has
somehow taken possession of heaven, embracing the heavenly philosophy. No, he
did not allow himself to be seduced by the splendour of this life, he has not
turned his eyes to the glory of his ancestors. I am wrong, however; the glory
of his ancestors, he has always had present to his mind. Not those to whom
nature had united him by ties beyond his control, but those he himself chose in
religion, and it is these that he has followed in his life.</p>

<p align=justify>He
considered the patriarch Abraham, and the great Moses who, although high in the
royal palace, accustomed from childhood to lavish meals, having lived among the
parties of the Egyptians &mdash; &nbsp;and you know
what were the manners of those barbarians, to what degree they heaped up pomp
and pride &mdash; &nbsp;repulsed all these benefits to
go knead clay, aspiring to become a slave, himself the son of his king and
already sharing in the honours of the throne. Soon he reappeared, invested with
a higher power than that of which he had deprived. After the exile, the
servitude with his stepfather, the weariness of distance, he was on his return
made the master, or rather the god of the king himself. &nbsp;&quot;I have made you the god of
Pharaoh.&quot; <i>&nbsp;Exod</i>.,
vii, 1. Without wearing the diadem, without wearing purple, or driving in a
chariot of gold, trampling all this regal pomp underfoot, he eclipsed the
splendours of royalty, &quot;All the glory of the daughter of the king came
from within.&quot; <i>Psalm</i>. 45:14. We
saw him sceptre in hand, for he commanded, not only men, but also heaven, earth,
sea, the very essence of air and water, lakes, springs, and rivers. The
elements were transformed at Moses' command, nature obeyed his will, and it
seemed a docile servant, eager, who, seeing the friend of its master, shows him
its submission and renders him the duty that would be obtained by the master
himself. This is the model on which he whom we are praising formed himself.&nbsp; He imitated it from his youth, if ever he was
young. Myself, I do not think so, since the maturity of his intellect dates
even from the cradle. Still young in the number of years, he embraced all the
teachings of the divine philosophy. &nbsp;Scarcely had he understood that human nature
is like a wild and uncultivated soil than he set vigorously to work, he cut
short all the diseases of the soul. &nbsp;The
word of piety for him was like a sickle to cut off all weeds, and his soul was just
like pure earth ready to receive the divine seed; this seed, he buried deeply,
so that it was neither withered by the rays of the sun, nor suffocated by the
thorns.</p>

<p align=justify>This is how he has treated his soul. As for the flesh,
he has checked its leanings by the remedies of temperance; seeing it as an
impetuous horse, he pull on the reins by fasting, not afraid to bloody the
mouth of the passions in order to master them and lead them to his goal. All
the same he did so with a wise moderation, and was careful not to exhaust the
body, lest, after having ruined the powers of the horse, he rendered it
unserviceable. &nbsp;But he kept it no less
from getting overweight and exuberant, so that it would not rise against
reason, when responsible for his conduct; he did not want it either weak or
recalcitrant. As he was in youth, so he showed himself later; and now that his
age protects him against the storms of life, his vigilance is still the same. Youth,
indeed, is like a sea of angry waves, constantly agitated by the winds, while
old age is a quiet haven in which happy sailors whose
courage has merited this noble repose enjoy profound security. Although, as I
said, quietly sitting in the harbour, he watches with equal care. And this holy
terror he received from Paul, who was transported into heaven, and on touching
the earth again, exclaimed: &quot;I fear that after having preached the Gospel
to others, I myself may be reproved.&quot; &nbsp;I<i> Cor</i>. 9:27.&nbsp; Thus he keeps himself in perpetual fear, so
as to be in perpetual security. He is always there at the helm, constantly
observing, not the movement of the stars nor the rocks hidden beneath the
waves, nor the dangers that threaten the ship, but the attacks of demons and
the wiles of the devil, the struggles of the spirit and the tempests of the
heart, looking out at all his army in order to make it invincible. It is not
enough for him that the ship does not sink. He has left nothing undone so
sedition or pirates cannot seize any of his traveling companions. Thanks to his
care, thanks to his prudence, we pursue in peace the course of our voyage, setting
out all our sails in the wind.</p>

<p align=justify>4. Certainly when we had lost the father that we had
before, and who had formed himself for us, our state seemed deplorable to us,
and we gave out inconsolable wailing, hoping that this throne would be occupied
by a man like him, but as soon as his successor appeared among us, all this
sadness vanished, our troubles vanished like clouds under the sun, and that not
in a slow and gradual way, but with as much rapidity as if the blessed pontiff,
rousing in the tomb, was back on his throne. What am I doing, though, what
imprudence is mine? In my love for our father, in my admiration for his
virtues, I have let myself be dragged beyond the limits, not of my subject, but
those limits imposed on me by my youth; because I do not think that I have
spoken an eulogy when I consider the merits which need celebration. No matter; let
us bring our boat back into the port and confine ourselves to a respectful
silence. It is not without regret, however, that my speech will stop. I long to
take it further, and I feel a bitter pain to leave it incomplete. Children, it
is impossible to appease our hunger.&nbsp; Let
us cease to pursue what we never reach, and let us content ourselves with what
we have said. When we have in our hands a rare and precious perfume, it is not
just pouring it in the bowl, it's by dipping your fingertips in it that you
change the air around you and anoint those present. This is what is happening
to us right now, not by the powers of our eloquence, but the living emanations
of his virtues.</p>

<p align=justify>Enough. Let
us turn to prayer. Let us ask God that our common mother remains unshaken and
unsullied, and that we shall long have this father, this pastor, this master,
this pilot. I dare not speak to you about myself. &nbsp;I can hardly count myself among the priests,
an abortion should not be counted among the children on whom nature has
lavished all his gifts. But if you deign to remember me, as we remembers a
miserable and wretched being, pray that a superabundant power comes on me from
on high. I needed protection while I was living for myself, free from all other
cares, and now I am obliged to appear in the church &mdash; is it by the favour of
man, is it by the will of God? &nbsp;I have
not said it to him, I should not discuss this matter before you, lest I be
accused of hiding my thoughts &mdash; now that I belong to the people, and I submit,
never more to shake off this heavy yoke, the more I need you all to extend a
helping hand to me, that all pray for me so that I may restore intact to the
Divine Master the deposit that he gave me. On that day each custodian will
appear before the Supreme Court and give an account of his administration. Yes,
pray that I do not experience the fate of those who were loaded with chains and
plunged into the outer darkness, that I am counted with those to whom will be
shown mercy by the grace and love of Jesus Christ Our Lord, to whom glory,
empire, and adoration belongs, for the ages of ages. &nbsp;Amen.</p>
