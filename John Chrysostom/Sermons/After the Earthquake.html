<h3 align=center>John Chrysostom,
Homily after the Earthquake.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><b>[1]</b></a></span></h3>

<p align=center>[Translated by Bryson Sewell]</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [M.
713] Even if feebleness hindered us<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>
from celebrating with you<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>
</span>the spiritual
chorus, nevertheless the labor of your journey did not make you faint. For even
if that effort led you, dripping with much sweat, to this place,<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> nevertheless the lesson
of the sermon changed our feebleness into health, and, through the singing of
psalms, it eased your labor. For this reason, I, though unwell, did not bind my
tongue in silence, nor did you, though weary, remove yourselves from hearing.
However, as soon as the sermon appeared, your labor receded; as soon as the
teaching appeared, your weariness fled. For, while illness and labor belong to
the body, instruction is the perfection and healing of the soul. And to the
degree that the soul is better than the body, by so much are its<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> achievements more
valuable. And so for this reason, not only with illness hindering me, but also
in the face of countless other obstacles, I did not withdraw from being
entwined in your love, I was not deprived, not today, of this good celebration.
But while we<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>
were, until just now, fixed to our bed, God did not permit that we should be
destroyed completely by the famine. For just as it is a famine for you not to
hear, so for me it is a famine not to speak. In this way, too, a mother, though
she is often sick, would prefer that her breast be stretched by her child,
rather than to see him wasting away because of a famine. May my body also be
strained! For who would not gladly shed even his own blood for you, men so
ardent in piety, so ardent in observance, who have shown such repentance in a
small space of time.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a>
You do not know day and night, but you make both times into day, not by
dismissing the gloom, but by enlightening the nights with vigils; your nights
are sleepless, and the tyranny of sleep has been destroyed. For yearning for
Christ has overcome the inferiority of nature. You were released from being
human in your bodies by mimicking powers, exhibiting sleeplessness, earnest
fasting, great labor because of your journey, labor with respect to nature,
[but] relaxation with respect to choice. This is the fruit of fears, this is
the advancement of the earthquake, an advancement that is never spent up, an
advancement that makes even the poor rich, and enriches the wealthy. It does
not know poverty, it does not know wealth. The earthquake came, and it did away
with the unevenness of life. Where, now, are those who wear silken robes? Where
is the gold? All of those things have gone away, and they were torn asunder
more easily than a spider's web, and they disappeared<a href="#_ftn8"
name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> more [quickly] than
spring-time flowers. But since I see that your mind is prepared, I wish to set
before you a more plentiful table. I see your bodies worn down, but your soul
renewed. The fountains of sweat are many, but they wipe the conscience clean.
For if athletes drip with blood for the sake of leaves of laurel, which is
given today and tomorrow withers away, how much more ought you, who enter into
the trial of virtuous actions, not to surrender in the labors for virtue, nor
to grow soft. You as my audience are my crown, [M. 714] and one of you as a
hearer is equivalent to the city. For some, on the one hand, crowned
mixing-bowls, while others convened satanic symposiums, and still others
prepared a sumptuous table. But you completed so great a vigil, and you
cleansed all the city by the stepping of your holy feet, having measured out
the market-place with your walking, and having made the air holy. For the air
becomes holy from the singing of psalms, just as today you heard God saying to
Moses, "The place where you are standing is holy ground."<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a> You sanctified the
ground, the market-place, you made our city a church.<a href="#_ftn10"
name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> And just as a flowing
torrent, carried by a great stream, overturns all things - in this way also the
spiritual torrent, the river of God, which gladdens the city of God, was filled
with water, and cleansed away the mire of impiety. No one is licentious, or
rather, if someone is licentious, he is changed. He hears the voice, and his
mind is reformed, the melody comes in, and his impiety is changed, he flees the
passions of greediness. For even if he does not flee, but just as beasts in
winter lurk in dens, so his impious mind is buried in the earth, and just as
serpents, when frost stiffens their bodies, enter the lower regions, so too
these passions, servile and slavish, are thus covered up as if into some abyss.
And of course those who carry them<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a>
are ashamed. For on the one hand they carry them, yet [the passions are] dead.
For in place of winter, your melody comes to them. The voice comes into the
hearing of greedy men, and even if he does not cast the passion out, yet the
passion dies. [The voice] comes into the hearing of the licentious and the
arrogant man, and even if he does not put to death his licentiousness and
arrogance, he buries his licentiousness and arrogance. It is not a small
[matter] not to speak wickedness boldly. I also said yesterday that the fruit
from the earthquakes is great. Do you see the love for humanity of the Master<a
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a> who shakes [the] city
and who makes [the] mind firm? He who rocks [the] foundations, and strengthens
[our] thoughts? He who makes the city cracked, and makes our judgment strong?
Set your minds on His love for humanity. He shook for a little while, He
strengthened continuously. The earthquake [lasted] for two days, but let piety
remain into all time. You were distressed for a little while, but you were
rooted continuously. For I well know that, by the fear of God, your piety took
root; and if an abatement should occur, the fruit remains. No longer are the
thorn plants choking, nor an over-whelming rain washing away: the fear
cultivated you well, it became an ally to my words. I am silent and the foundations
send forth a sound; I remain silent and the earthquake sends forth a voice more
sonorous than a trumpet, saying this: "The Lord is compassionate and merciful,
patient and rich in mercy."<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a>
I was present, not in order to overwhelm you, but in order to strengthen you."
The earthquake says these things, and sends forth a voice: "I scared you, not
in order to grieve [you], but to make you more exact. Pay exact attention to
the sermon. Since the sermon was too ineffectual, help called out; since the instruction
grew weary, [M. 715] fear fought as an ally. I come speaking those things to
you only for a short time, and I do my part. Whenever I bind you tight, then I
give you to the sermon, lest the sermon should come to no effect; finding
stones and thorn bushes springing up, I make the land clean, so that the sermon
may scatter its seeds with a liberal hand."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How
were you harmed by being grieved for a short time? You became angels instead of
humans. You were moved toward heaven, even if not in place, at least in
character. And as to the fact that I do not say these things in flattery, the
facts give testimony. For in which respect did you fall short with regard to
the sermon of repentance? You cast out envy, you got rid of your slavish
passions. You planted virtue, you endured the whole night through with your
holy vigils, great love, and eager disposition. No one remembers interest, no
one speaks about greediness,<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a>
nor are the hands alone pure from sins, but the tongue, too, is freed from
lawlessness and abuse. No one assaults his neighbor, no one goes off to satanic
symposiums. The houses are pure, the marketplace has been cleansed. Evening
arrives, and nowhere are there choruses of young men singing the songs of the
theater. Yet there are choruses, though not of licentiousness; choruses, but of
virtues. And it is possible to hear the singing of psalms in the marketplace,
and [to hear] those sitting at home, one singing psalms, another hymning. Night
arrives, and all [run] to the church, the waveless harbor, the calm that has
been freed of waves. I was thinking that, after the first or second day,
sleeplessness had overcome your bodies. But as it is, your yearning increases
to the degree that your sleeplessness is strained. Those who were singing
psalms to you grew weary, and you are renewed. Those singing psalms to you grew
exhausted, and you were strengthened. Tell me: where now are the wealthy? Let
them learn the philosophy of the poor. For they<a href="#_ftn15"
name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a> sleep, but the poor do
not sleep on the ground, but bend their knees, mimicking Paul and Silas. But
[M. 716] they sung psalms and shook the prison; you sung psalms, and made the
city that was shaken firm. The outcomes<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"
title="">[16]</a>
are contrary to the circumstances, yet both are for the glory of God. For he
shook the prison, in order to shake the mind of the unfaithful, in order to
loosen the jailor, in order to proclaim the Word of God. You yourselves made
the city firm, in order to undo God's wrath. Both those affairs and these were
administered differently. But nevertheless I rejoice, not because the city was
made firm, but because it was through your prayers that it was made firm,
because your singing of psalms became [the] foundations. The wrath is from
above, your voice from below. The voice, sent up from below, restrained the
wrath, flowing from above. The heavens were opened, and a judgment<a
href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a> was brought down, the
whetted sword. The city [is] on the earth, the wrath is inevitable. We have
need of nothing but repentance, tears and lamentations, and all things were
dissolved. God appeared, and we dissolved his wrath. One would not err should
he call you the caretakers and saviors of the city. Where are the rulers? Where
are the great saviors? Of the city you are the truly the towers, the wall, and
its security. For they,<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a>
on the one hand, through their own wickedness allowed the city to rot, but you,
through your own virtue, made the city firm. And if someone should be asked why
the city was shaken, even if he wouldn't say [it], it has been agreed<a
href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a> that it was because of
sins, because of acts of greed, because of injustices, because of acts of
lawlessness, because of acts of arrogance, because of pleasures, because of
deceit. Whose? The rich. Again, if someone should be asked why the city was
made firm, it is agreed that it is because of the singing of psalms, because of
the prayers, because of the vigils. Whose are these? The poor's.&nbsp; The reasons
that shook the city belong to them,<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a>
while the reasons that made the city firm are yours - and so you became the
saviors and the caretakers. But let us end the sermon here, remaining in our
vigils, our singing of psalms, sending glory up to the Father and the Son and
the Holy Spirit, now and always, and into eternity.<a href="#_ftn21"

	Sever J. Voicu on the other hand, has long argued that this homily is not 
	authentic Chrysostom and has challenged Mayer's claims in &quot;Un errore di

The problem is that, in this context, "they were tested more than spring-time
flowers" makes little sense. The point might be that gold, which has been
tested (i.e. with fire), offers no lasting security, but, like flowers in
spring time, it too passes away. </div>
