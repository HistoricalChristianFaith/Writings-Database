  <P(1) 
  HAVE YOU HAD ENOUGH of the fight against the Jews? Or do you wish me to take 
  up the same topic today? Even if I have already had much to say on it, I still 
  think you want to hear the same thing again. The man who does not have enough 
  of loving Christ will never have enough of fighting against those who hate 
  Christ. Besides, there is another reason which makes a discourse on this theme 
  necessary. These feasts of theirs are not yet over; some traces still 
  remain.&nbsp;</P>
</p>
  <P>
  (1) Have you had enough of the fight against the Jews? Or do you wish me to 
	take up the same topic today? Even if I have already had much to say on it, 
	I still think you want to hear the same thing again. The man who does not 
	have enough of loving Christ will never have enough of fighting against 
	those who hate Christ. Besides, there is another reason which makes a 
	discourse on this theme necessary. These feasts of theirs are not yet over; 
	some traces still remain.</P>
<P>
  (2) Their trumpets 
  were a greater outrage than those heard in the theaters; their fasts were more 
  disgraceful than any drunken revel. So, too, the tents which at this moment 
  are pitched among them are no better than the inns where harlots and flute 
  girls ply their trades. Let no one condemn me for the boldness of my words; it 
  is the height of boldness and outrage not to suspect the Jews of these 
  excesses. Since they stubbornly fight against GOD and resist the HOLY SPIRIT, 
  how can we avoid the necessity of passing such sentence upon them?</P>
  <P>
  (3) This festival 
  used to be a holy one when it was observed according to the Law and at God's 
  command. But this is no longer true. All its dignity has been destroyed 
  because it is observed against God's will. Those who, above all others, treat 
  the Law and the ancient festivals with the least respect are the very ones who 
  are ready today to observe the Law and festivals more than anyone else. But we 
  are the one who honor the Law above all others, even if we let it rest like a 
  man who has grown old and infirm, even if we do not drag it, gray with age, to 
  the arena, even if we do not force it to enter the contests which are not 
  suited to its years. In my past discourses I gave adequate proof that today is 
  not the day of the Law nor of the old commonwealth and the old way of 
  life.</P>
  <P>
  (4) But come now, let 
  me investigate what remains to be discussed. I did enough to complete my task 
  when I proved from all the prophets that any such observance of ritual outside 
  Jerusalem is transgression of the Law and sacrilege. But they never stop 
  whispering in everybody's ear and bragging that they will get their city back 
  again. Even if this were true, they could not escape the charge of 
  transgressing the Law. But I gave you abundant evidence to prove that the city 
  will not be restored nor will they get back their old commonwealth and way of 
  life.</P>
  <P>
  (5) Once that has 
  been proved, there is no room for disagreement on any of the other points. For 
  example, neither the form of sacrifice, nor of the holocaust, nor the binding 
  force of the Law, nor any other aspect of their old commonwealth and way of 
  life can stand. To begin with, the Law commanded that three times each year 
  every male go up to the temple. But they could not do this once the temple was 
  destroyed. Then, too, the Law commanded that sacrifices be offered by the man 
  afflicted with gonorrhea, the leper, the woman in her menstrual period, the 
  woman who had given birth to a child. But this is impossible since the place 
  no longer exists nor is there an altar to be seen. The Law commanded them to 
  sing sacred hymns but, as I showed before, the place they were living in 
  prevented them; the prophets condemned them and said (917) they were reading 
  the Law and making their confession of praise to God in a foreign land. Since 
  they could not even read the Law outside Jerusalem, how could they observe it 
  outside Jerusalem?</P>
  <P>
  (6) This is why God 
  threatened them and said: 'I shall not visit your daughters when they commit 
  fornication nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery.' What does 
  this mean? First, I shall read to you the old Law and then I shall try to make 
  his meaning clearer. What, then, does the Law say? 'If a woman transgresses 
  against her husband, disdaining and disregarding him, and if someone sleeps 
  with her the sleep of intercourse, and if she escapes the eye of her husband 
  and there is no witness against her, nor is she caught in the act, nor if a 
  spirit of jealousy comes over her husband when she has not been 
  defiled...'</P>
  <P>
  (7) This is what the 
  Law means. If a woman commits adultery and her husband suspects it, or if he 
  suspects her when she has not committed adultery, but there is no witness nor 
  conception to prove the suspicion, 'he will bring her to the priest and take 
  along barley meal as an offering for her.' Why, I ask, must it be barley meal 
  rather than fine flour or the meal of wheat? Since what happened was a source 
  of pain, accusation, and wicked suspicion, the form of the sacrifice imitated 
  a household disaster. This is why the Lord said: 'You will not pour oil on it 
  nor put frankincense over it.' ''Then'' (for I must cut the account short) 
  ''The priest shall lead her forward and will take pure water in an earthen 
  vessel; he will pick up some of the dust which is on the floor and throw it 
  into the water; he will make the woman stand, will make her swear an oath, and 
  he will say to her: 'If you did not transgress so as to become defiled for 
  your husband, be immune from the water of reproof. But if you did transgress 
  and you are defiled, if someone other than your husband did have intercourse 
  with you, may the Lord make of you an execration and a curse among your 
  people.'</P>
  <P>
  (8) What is the 
  meaning of 'an execration and a curse'? As the saying goes; May what happened 
  to that poor woman not happen to me! 'By the Lord causing your belly to swell 
  and the water that brings a curse will enter your belly to make it swell.' And 
  the woman will say: 'Amen, Amen'. And it will come to pass, if the woman is 
  defiled, that the water of the curse will enter her belly to make it swell, 
  and the woman will be an execration. If she is not defiled, she will be 
  unharmed and will conceive offspring.' Once the Jews had gone off into 
  bondage, none of these things could be done because there was no temple, no 
  altar, no Meeting Tent, no sacrifice to be offered. Because this was the case, 
  when God threatened them, he said: 'I shall not visit your daughters when they 
  commit fornication nor your daughters-in-law when they commit 
  adultery.'</P>
  <P>
  II</P>
  <P>
  (1) Do you see that 
  the Law takes its force from the place? And since the city is gone, there can 
  no longer be a priesthood. There can be no emperor if there are no armies, no 
  crown, no purple robe, none of the other things which weld together an empire. 
  So, too, there can be no priesthood if sacrifice has been destroyed, if 
  offerings are forbidden, if the sanctuary has been trampled into the dust, if 
  everything which constituted it has disappeared. For the priesthood depend on 
  all these things.&nbsp;</P>
  <P>
  (2) As I said before, 
  it was enough for my purpose to prove that neither the sacrifices, nor the 
  holocausts, nor the other purifications, nor any other part of the (918) 
  Jewish commonwealth and way of life would return. It was enough, finally, to 
  prove that the temple will never rise again. Now that it is no more, 
  everything has been taken away; if something ritualistic seems to be going on, 
  it is against the Law and a reckless crime. In the same way, once I have 
  proved that the temple will never be restored to its former state, I have at 
  the same time also proved that the rest of the ritual of worship will not 
  return to its former condition, that there will be no priest, there will be no 
  king. If not even a commoner of Jewish blood was allowed to be a servant to 
  foreigners, it would be all the more forbidden for their king himself to be 
  subject to others.&nbsp;</P>
  <P>
  (3) But since my 
  effort and zeal are here devoted not only to stopping up the mouths of the 
  Jews but also to instructing your loving assembly, come now and let me take 
  another authority and prove this same point. Let me prove that both the 
  sacrifices of the Jews and their priesthood have completely ended that day 
  will never again return to their former status.&nbsp;</P>
  <P>
  (4) Who says this? 
  That great and wonderful prophet, David. He made it clear that the one kind of 
  sacrifice would be abolished and another brought in to take its place when he 
  said: 'Many are the wondrous works you have done. O Lord my God: and in your 
  thoughts there is no one like to you. I have declared and I have spoken.' See 
  how wise the prophet is. He said: 'Many are the wondrous works you have done,' 
  and he stood aghast at God's power to work miracles. But he did not go on to 
  tell us about the creation of the things we see of heaven, earth, and ocean, 
  of water and fire; he did not tell us of those strange marvels which happened 
  in Egypt, or of any other miracles like those. What did he say were wondrous 
  works? 'Sacrifice and oblation you did not desire.'&nbsp;</P>
  <P>
  (5) What do you mean, 
  David? Is this a strange marvel? No, he said. For this was not the only thing 
  he saw. Inspired by heaven, he saw with prophetic eyes how God would lead the 
  nations to him; he saw how those who were nailed to their gods, who worshipped 
  stones, who were worse off than brute beasts suddenly looked up and recognized 
  the Master of all creation; he saw how these men put aside their foul worship 
  of demons and gave pure and bloodless worship to God. At the same time he saw 
  that the Jews, too, who were even more imperfect than the pagans, would put 
  aside their worship through sacrifices, holocausts, and other material things 
  and be led to our way of life. And he pondered on God's ineffable 
  loving-kindness which surpasses all understanding; he stood aghast at how 
  greatly things had changed, how God had reshaped them, how he had made men 
  from demons into angels, and how he had introduced a commonwealth and way of 
  life worthy of heaven.</P>
  <P>
  (6) All this was to 
  take place after the old sacrifice had been abolished and after God had 
  brought into its place the new sacrifice through the body of Christ. This is 
  why David stood aghast and marveled and said: 'Many are the wondrous works you 
  have done, O Lord my God.' To show that he made this whole prophetic 
  prediction in behalf of Christ when he said: 'Sacrifice and oblation you did 
  not desire,' David went on to say: 'But a body you have fitted to me.' By this 
  he meant the Lord's body which became the common sacrifice for the whole 
  world, the sacrifice which cleansed our soul, canceled our sin, put down 
  death, opened heaven, gave us many great hopes, and made ready all the other 
  things which Paul knew well and spoke of when he exclaimed: 'Oh, the depth of 
  the riches and of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible 
  are his judgments and how unsearchable are his ways.'</P>
  <P>
  (7) David, then, 
  foresaw all this when he said: 'Many are the wondrous work you have done, O 
  Lord my God.' He went to say, speaking in the person of Christ: 'In holocausts 
  and sin offerings you had no pleasure, and then continued: 'Then I said, 
  Behold I came.' When was 'then'? When the time was ripe for more perfect 
  instructions. We had to learn the less perfect lessons through his servants, 
  but the loftier lessons which surpass the nature of man we had to learn from 
  the Lawgiver himself.&nbsp;</P>
  <P>
  (8) This is why Paul 
  said: 'God, who at sundry times and in varied ways spoke in times past to the 
  fathers by the prophets, last of all in these days has spoken to us by his 
  Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world.' 
  And again, John said: 'For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth 
  came through Jesus Christ.' And this is the highest panegyric for the Law, 
  namely that it prepared human nature for the Teacher.</P>
  <P>
  (9) But he did not 
  want you to look on him as a new God or any kind of innovation. Hear what he 
  said: 'In the head of the book it is written of me.' What he meant was this: 
  'Long ago the prophets foretold my coming and at the beginning of the 
  Scriptures they opened them a little to give men a glimpse of the knowledge 
  that I am God.'</P>
  <P>
  III</P>
  <P>
  (1) An so, at the 
  beginning of creation, when God said: 'Let us make mankind in our image and 
  likeness,' he was revealing to us in a rather obscure way the divinity of his 
  Son, to whom he was then speaking. Later on the Psalmist showed that this new 
  religious way of life did not contradict the old, but that it was God's will 
  that the old sacrifice be abolished and the new sacrifice replace the old. The 
  new was an extension of the right way of worship; it did not oppose or fight 
  with the old. He showed this when he said: 'In the head of the book it is 
  written of me,' and added: 'That I should do your will, O my God; I have 
  desired it and your law in the mist of my heart.' And when he explained what 
  God's will was, he made no mention of sacrifice or holocausts or offerings or 
  toil and sweat, but said: 'I have declared your justice in a great 
  assembly.'</P>
  <P>
  (2) What does he mean 
  when he says: 'I have declared your justice?' He did not simply say: 'I have 
  given,' 'I have declared.' What does this mean? That he has justified our race 
  not by right actions, nor by toils, not by barter and exchange, but by grace 
  alone. Paul, too, made this clear when he said: 'But now the justice of God 
  has been made manifest independently of the Law.' But the justice of God comes 
  through faith in Jesus Christ and not through any labor and suffering. And 
  Paul took up again the testimony of this Psalm when he spoke as follows: 'For 
  the Law, having but a shadow of the good things to came, and not the exact 
  image of the objects, is never able by the sacrifices which they offer 
  continually, year after year the same, to perfect those who draw near. 
  Therefore in coming into the world, he says: 'Sacrifice and oblation you 
  wished not, but a body you have fitted to me.' By this he meant the entrance 
  into the world of the Only-begotten, the dispensation through the flesh. For 
  this is the way he came to us. He did not change place-how could he since he 
  is every-where and fills all things-but he was made visible to us through the 
  flesh.</P>
  <P>
  (3) Here we are 
  fighting not only against the Jews but also against the pagans and many 
  heretics. So let me uncover for you the deeper meaning here; let me search out 
  the reason why Paul mentioned this text when he had countless testimonies to 
  show that the Law and the old commonwealth and way of life are no longer 
  productive. He did not cite this simply by chance but he did it with good 
  reason and ineffable wisdom. Everybody would agree that he had on this subject 
  other testimonies, both of greater length and more vehement, if he had wished 
  to bring them forward.</P>
  <P>
  (4) For example, 
  Isaiah said: 'I have no pleasure in you. I have had enough of whole-burnt 
  rams. I desire not fat of fatlings and blood of bulls and goats, not even if 
  you come into my sight. Who required these things at your hands? If you offer 
  me wheaten flour, it is in vain. Incense is an abomination to me.' And again, 
  in another place: 'I did not call you now, Jacob, nor, Israel, did I make you 
  weary. You did not honor me with sacrifices nor did you worship me with your 
  gifts; I did not weary you with frankincense, nor did you get incense for me 
  with silver.' And Jeremiah said: 'Why do you bring me incense from Sheba and 
  cinnamon from a far country? Your holocausts have not pleased me.' And again: 
  'Heap up your holocausts upon your sacrifices and eat up the flesh.' And 
  another prophet said: 'Take away from me the sound of your songs: I will not 
  hear the canticle of your harps.' And again, there was another text, where the 
  Jews were saying: 'Will the Lord receive it in place of holocausts if I give 
  my first-born for my wickedness, the fruit of my body for the sin of my 
  souls?' And the prophet reproved them and said: 'It has been announced to you 
  what is good and what the Lord God requires of you, that you love mercy, do 
  judgment and justice, and be ready to walk behind your God.' David also spoke 
  in the same vein when he said: 'I will not take calves from your house nor 
  goats from your flocks.'</P>
  <P>
  (5) When Paul had so 
  many testimonies in which God surely rejects those sacrifices, the times of 
  the new moon, the Sabbaths, 
  the festivals, why did he omit all these and mention just that one text? Many 
  of the infidels and many of the Jews themselves who are now doing battle with 
  me maintain that their 
  commonwealth and way of life was not abolished because it was imperfect or its 
  place taken by a greater way of life-I mean ours-but because of the sinfulness 
  of those who offered the sacrifices in those days. And Isaiah certainly did 
  say: 'If you stretch out your hands, I will turn away my eyes from you: and if 
  you multiply your prayers, I will not hear.' Then, to give the reason for 
  this, he went on to say: 'For your hands are full of blood.' These words are 
  not an accusation made against the sacrifices; they are an indictment of the 
  sinfulness of those who offered them. God rejected their sacrifices because 
  they offered them with bloodstained hands.</P>
  <P>
  (6) Again, when David 
  said: 'I will not take calves from your house nor goats from your flocks,' he 
  went on to add: 'But to the 
  sinner God said: 'Why do you declare my justices and take my covenant in your 
  mouth? You hated discipline and cast my words behind you. If you saw a thief, 
  you ran along with him and you threw in your lot with adulterers. Your mouth 
  abounded with injustice and your tongue wrapped up deceits in your words. You 
  sat down and spoke slander against your brother and set a stumbling-block for 
  your mother's son.' This makes it clear that in this instance God did not 
  simply reject sacrifices, but that he rejected them because those who offered 
  them were adulterers and thieves and plotted against theirs brothers. So these 
  enemies of mine maintain that, since each prophet accuses those who offer the 
  sacrifices, his prophecy is saying that this is the reason why God rejected 
  their sacrifices.&nbsp;</P>
  <P>
  IV</P>
  <P>
  (1) This is what my 
  opponents say to me. But Paul dealt them a knockout blow and said enough to 
  shut their shameless mouths when he cited as his witness the text I have 
  discussed. When Paul wished to prove that God had rejected the old 
  commonwealth and way of life, because it was imperfect, and that he had 
  rendered it inoperative, he took as testimony that text in which no accusation 
  is made against those who offered the sacrifices. He used a text which makes 
  it clear that the sacrifice was in itself imperfect. For the prophet David 
  made no accusation against the Jews; he simply said: 'Sacrifice and oblation 
  you did not desire, but a body you fitted to me: in holocausts and sin 
  offerings you had no pleasure.'</P>
  <P>
  (2) In explanation of 
  this text Paul said: ' He annuls the first covenant in order to establish the 
  second.' If David had said: 'Sacrifice and oblation you did not desire,' and 
  than said no more, their argument would have some place to defend itself. But 
  since he also said: 'But a body you fitted to me,' and showed that another 
  sacrifice was brought in to replace it, he left no hope for the future that 
  the old sacrifice would return. And in explaining this, Paul said: 'Through 
  this offering we have been sanctified in the will of Christ;' and also: 'If 
  the blood of bulls and goats and the sprinkled ashes of a heifer sanctify the 
  unclean for the cleansing of the flesh, how much more will the blood of 
  Christ, who through the Holy Spirit offered himself unblemished, cleanse our 
  conscience from dead works? This gives us abundant proof, then, that those old 
  rituals have stopped, that a new rite has been brought forward to replace 
  them, and that the old will not hereafter be restored.</P>
  <P>
  (3) What is left to 
  discuss now? For some time I have been anxious to prove to you that their kind 
  of priesthood has disappeared and will never return. Let me make this 
  expressly clear from the Scriptures themselves. First I must preface this with 
  a few remarks, so that my explanation of the scriptures say may be even more 
  obvious.</P>
  <P>
  (4) On his return 
  from Persia, Abraham begot Isaac; Isaac then begot Jacob; Jacob begot the 
  twelve patriarchs from whom arose the twelve tribes-or, rather, the thirteen, 
  because, in Joseph's place, his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, became leaders 
  of tribes. A tribe was named after each of Jacob's sons: for example, the 
  tribe of Ruben, of Simeon, of Levi, of Judah, of Naphthali, of Gad, of Asher, 
  of Benjamin. So also in Joseph's case, his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, 
  gave their names to two tribes; one was called the tribe of Ephraim and the 
  other the tribe of Manasseh. Of these thirteen tribes all but one had fields 
  and large incomes, all but one tilled the fields and devoted themselves to all 
  the other secular pursuits. But the tribe of Levi was honored with the 
  priesthood; it alone was freed from secular work. They did not till the farms, 
  nor do anything else of the sort, but devoted their attention exclusively to 
  the priesthood. Form all the people they received tithes of wine and wheat and 
  barley and everything else; all gave them tithes and this was their income. No 
  one from any other tribe could ever become a priest. From this tribe-I mean 
  the tribe of Levi-came Aaron, and by succession, his descendants received the 
  priesthood; no one from another tribe ever becomes a priest. And so these 
  Levites received tithes from the rest and, in this way, supported 
  themselves.</P>
  <P>
  (5) But in the time 
  of Abraham, before the day of Jacob and Isaac, before the coming of Moses, 
  when the Law had not yet been written, when the priesthood did not clearly to 
  the Levites, when there was no Meeting Tent or Temple, before the division of 
  the people into tribes, before Jerusalem existed, before anyone at all had yet 
  taken control of the government among the Jews, there was a man named 
  Melchizedek, a priest of the Most High God. This Melchizedek was at the same 
  time both priest and king; he was to be a type of Christ, and Scripture makes 
  clear mention of this. For Abraham attacked the Persians, rescued his nephew 
  Lot from their hands, seized all the spoils, and was returning from his mighty 
  victory over his foes. After describing those events the Scripture had this to 
  say about Melchizedek. 'Melchizedek, the king of Salem, brought out bread and 
  wine, for he was a priest of the Most High God. He blessed Abraham and said, 
  'Blessed by the Most High God, creator of heaven and earth: blessed be the 
  Most High God who has delivered your enemies into your hand.' Then Abraham 
  gave him a tenth of everything.'</P>
  <P>
  (6) If, then, any 
  prophet clearly says that after Aaron, after that priesthood, after those 
  sacrifices and oblations, there will rise up another priest, not from Levi's 
  tribe but from another tribe from which no one ever became a priest, a priest 
  not according to the order of Aaron but according to the order of Melchizedek, 
  it is just as clear that the old priesthood has ceased to exist and another, a 
  new priesthood has been brought in to take its place. If the old priesthood 
  were going to remain effective, it would have to be called a priesthood 
  according to the order of Aaron and not according to the order of Melchizedek. 
  Did any prophet speak of this new priesthood? Yes, that same prophet who 
  before spoke about the sacrifices and who was speaking of Christ when he said: 
  'The Lord said to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand.'</P>
  <P>
  V</P>
  <P>
  (1) To prevent anyone 
  from suspecting that this was said about some ordinary man, it was not Isaiah 
  nor Jeremiah, nor any prophet who was a common man that said it, but King 
  David himself. But a king cannot call any man his Lord; it is God alone whom 
  he can call Lord. If David were a common man, perhaps one of those shameless 
  people would have said that he was talking about a mere human being. But now, 
  since David was a king, he would not have called a man his Lord. If David were 
  talking about some ordinary person, how could he have said that this person 
  sat at the right hand of that ineffable and mighty Majesty? That would have 
  been impossible. But of this person said: 'The Lord said to my Lord: 'Sit at 
  my right hand till I make your enemies your footstool.'</P>
  <P>
  (2) Then, to keep you 
  from thinking that this person was weak and powerless, David went on to say: 
  'With you is the principality in the day of your strength.' And he made it 
  still clearer when he said: 'From the whom before the daystar I begot you.' 
  But no mere man was begotter before the daystar. 'You are a priest forever, 
  according to the order of Melchizedek.' He did not say: 'According to the 
  order of Aaron.' So ask the Jews why David brought in another priest, 
  according to the order of Melchizedek, if the old priesthood was not going to 
  be abolish.</P>
  <P>
  (3) At any rate, see 
  how Paul made this clearer when he came to this text. After Paul said of 
  Christ: 'As he (David) says also in another place. 'You are a priest forever 
  according to the order of Melchizedek,' the Apostle went on to say: 'On this 
  point we have much to say, and it is difficult to explain it.' After he 
  reproved his disciples-but I must cut the account short-he went on to tell 
  them who Melchizedek was and to tell the story. 'He met Abraham returning from 
  the slaughter of the kings and blessed him; to whom Abraham divided the tithes 
  of all.' Then, to give some insight into Melchizedek, the type, he said: 'Now 
  consider how great this man is, to whom even Abraham the patriarch gave tithes 
  of all.' He did not say this for no purpose but because he wanted to show that 
  our priesthood is much greater than the Jewish priesthood. And the excellence 
  of the realities is shown beforehand in the very types which foreshadow 
  them.</P>
  <P>
  (4) Abraham was the 
  father of Isaac, the grandfather of Jacob, and the ancestor of Levi, for Levi 
  was Jacob's son. The priesthood among the Jews began with Levi. So this man 
  Abraham was the ancestor of the Levites and the Jewish priests. But in the 
  time if Melchizedek, who is the type of our priesthood, Abraham had the rank 
  of a layman. Two things make this clear. First, he gave tithes to Melchizedek, 
  and it is the laymen who give tithes to the priests. Second, he was blessed by 
  Melchizedek, and laymen are blessed by priests.</P>
  <P>
  (5) We again see the 
  excellence of our priesthood when we find Abraham, the patriarch of the Jews, 
  the ancestor of the Levites, receiving a blessing from Melchizedek and giving 
  tithes to him. Surely the Old Testament says that Melchizedek blessed Abraham 
  and exacted a tenth part from him. And Paul brought these very points to the 
  fore and said: 'Consider how great this man is.' Who is 'this man'? Paul told 
  us. Melchizedek, 'to whom even Abraham their patriarch gave tithes from the 
  best portion of the spoils.' 'And indeed they who are of the priestly sons of 
  Levi have a commandment to take tithes from the people, that is, from their 
  brethren, though these also have come from the loins of Abraham.'</P>
  <P>
  (6) What Paul means 
  in this. He said that the Levites, who were priests among the Jews, received a 
  commandment, according to the Law, to take tithes from the other Jews. 
  Although they all were descended from Abraham, both the Levites and the rest 
  of the people, nonetheless the Levites took tithes from their brothers. But 
  Melchizedek, who was not of their descent, because he was not a descendant of 
  Abraham, and who was not of the tribe of Levi but from another nation, exacted 
  a tenth part from Abraham, that is, he took tithes from him.</P>
  <P>
  (7) Not only this, 
  but he did something further. What is that? He again blessed Abraham, even 
  though it was Abraham who had received the promises. What does this show? That 
  Abraham was much inferior to Melchizedek. How can this be? 'Beyond all 
  contradiction, that which is less is blessed by the superior, ' so that, 
  unless Abraham, the ancestor of the Levites, were inferior to Melchizedek, 
  Melchizedek would not have blessed him, nor would Abraham have given tithes to 
  Melchizedek. But Paul wished to show that, because of the excellence of 
  Melchizedek, that inferiority might have continued, so he went on to say: 
  'Even Levi, the receiver of tithes, was also, so to speak, made subject to 
  tithes, though Abraham.'</P>
  <P>
  (8) What does he mean 
  by 'was made subject to tithes'? Although Levi was not yet born, through his 
  father, he, too, gave tithes to Melchizedek. As Paul said: 'He was still in 
  the loins of his father when Melchizedek meet him.' This is why Paul was 
  careful to say: 'So to speak.' He went on to tell why he said this. 'If the 
  perfection was by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received 
  the Law), what further need was there that another priest should rise, 
  according to the order of Melchizedek, and said not to be according of 
  Aaron?'</P>
  <P>
  (9) What is it that 
  Paul Meant? He meant this. If the Jewish religion was perfect, if the Law was 
  not a foreshadowing of future blessing but had been efficacious in every 
  respect, if it was not going to yield to another Law, if the old priesthood 
  was not going to disappear and make way for another priesthood, why did the 
  prophet say: 'You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek?' 
  He should have said: 'according to the order of Aaron.' This is why Paul said: 
  'If then perfection was by the Levitical priesthood, what further need was 
  there that another priest should rise, according the order of Melchizedek, and 
  said not to be according to the order of Aaron.'</P>
  <P>
  (10) This surely made 
  it clear that the old priesthood was ended and that another much better and 
  more sublime priesthood has been brought in to replace it. When we admit this, 
  we would also agree that another way of life suited to the new priesthood will 
  be brought in and another Law given, and clearly this is ours. Paul prepared 
  us for this when he said: 'When the priesthood is changed, it is necessary 
  that a change of law be made also, for the author of these is one.'</P>
  <P>
  (11) Many of the 
  prescriptions of the Law were devoted to the ministries of the priesthood, and 
  the old priesthood has been abolished. Since another priesthood was brought in 
  to replace the old, it is clear also that a greater Law had to be brought in 
  to replace the old. To make clear who it was of whom these words were spoken, 
  Paul said: 'For he of whom these things are said is from another tribe, from 
  which no one has ever done service at the altar. For it is evident that our 
  Lord has sprung out of Judah, and Moses spoke nothing at all about priests 
  when referring to this tribe.'</P>
  <P>
  (12) Christ clearly 
  is sprung from that tribe, namely the tribe of Judah; Christ surely is a 
  priest according to the order of Melchizedek; Melchizedek is surely much more 
  venerable than Abraham. Then we must also admit from every angle that one 
  priesthood is being brought in to replace another and that it is much more 
  sublime than the old priesthood. If the type was such, if it was more 
  magnificent than the Jewish priesthood, the reality which it foreshadowed is 
  itself still much more magnificent. This is the point which Paul was making 
  when he said: 'And it is yet far more evident if there arise another priest, 
  according to the likeness of Melchizedek, who has become so not according to 
  the Law of carnal commandment, but according to a life that cannot 
  end.'</P>
  <P>
  (13) What did Paul 
  mean when he said: 'Not according to the Law of carnal commandment, but 
  according to a life that cannot end'? He meant that none of Christ's 
  commandments are carnal commandments. He did not order the sacrifice of sheep 
  and calves; he ordered us to worship God through the virtue of our lives; as 
  our reward for this, he set the prize of a life that cannot end. And again, 
  after he had died as the price of our sins, he came and raised us up; he saved 
  us by freeing us from a double death: the death from sin and the death of the 
  flesh. Since he came bringing us such gifts, Paul said: 'Not according to the 
  Law of carnal commandment, but according to a life that cannot 
end.'</P>
  <P>
  VI</P>
  <P>
  (1) I have, 
  therefore, now proved what was left to be proved. I have proved that, because 
  the priesthood was changed, it was reasonable and necessary that there also be 
  a change of Law. And again I was able to prove this very point by bringing 
  forward as my witnesses the prophets. They testified that the Law will be 
  changed, that the old commonwealth and way of life will be transformed for the 
  better, and that never again will a king arise for the Jews.</P>
  <P>
  (2) But I must say 
  only as much as my audience can listen to and heed; I must not crowd 
  everything together and say it all at once. Therefore, I will store up the 
  rest for another occasion and, for the present, I will stop my instruction at 
  this point. But let me first exhort you loving assembly to keep in mind what I 
  have said and to connect it up with what I said before. And what I asked you 
  before, I shall now ask you again. Rescue your brothers and show great concern 
  for our members who have grown negligent. I do not undertake this great task 
  just to hear myself talk or to enjoy the tumult of your applause; I do it to 
  bring those who have been cut off back to the path of truth.</P>
  <P>
  (3) Let no one say to 
  me: 'I have nothing in common with him, I would be lucky to manage well my own 
  affairs.' No one can manage his own affairs if he does not love his neighbor 
  and work for his salvation. This is what Paul meant when he said: 'Let no one 
  seek his own interest, but those of his neighbor.' He knew that your own 
  interests lie in what benefits your neighbor. You are in good health, but your 
  brother is sick. So then, if you are in your right mind, you will be 
  distressed over him who is in distress and you will, in this matter, follow 
  the example of that blessed soul who said: 'Who is weak, and I am not weak? 
  Who is made to stumble, and I am not inflamed?'</P>
  <P>
  (4) If we find joy in 
  tossing down a couple of obols and spending a little money on the poor, what 
  great pleasure will we reap if we can save men's souls? What recompense will 
  we enjoy in the life to come? Certainly, in this world, as often as we run 
  into these men, we will derive great pleasure from meeting them, because we 
  recall the good turn we did for them. When we see them in the next world 
  before the dread tribunal of judgment, we will experience a great confidence. 
  When the unjust, the greedy, the plunderers, and those who have inflicted 
  countless evils on their neighbors go before this tribunal and see their 
  victims-and they surely will see them, as Christ says, and as is clear from 
  the story of the rich man and Lazarus - they will not be able to open their 
  mouths nor to say a word in their own defense. They will be overwhelmed with 
  the great shame of their condemnation and will be swept off from the sight of 
  their victims into the rivers of flame.</P>
  <P>
  (5) But when those 
  who taught and instructed their neighbors in this life stand before the 
  tribunal, they will see those whom they saved pleading in their behalf. And 
  they will be filled with great confidence and trust. Paul made this clear when 
  he said: 'We are your boast, as you will also be ours.' Tell me, when will 
  this be? 'In the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.'</P>
  <P>
  (6) And, again, 
  Christ gave good counsel when he said: 'Make friend for yourselves with the 
  mammon of wickedness, so that when you fail they may receive you into the 
  everlasting dwellings.' You see that much confidence will come to us from 
  those to whom we have done good in this life. But if there are so many prizes, 
  such great recompense, such ample repayment for the money we spent on others, 
  how will we fail to gain many great blessing when we help a soul? Tabitha 
  clothed widows and aided the poor and came back to life from the dead. If the 
  tears of those to whom she did good brought her departed soul back to her 
  body-and this before the day of resurrection-will not the tears of those whom 
  you rescued and saved do something to help you? The widows who stood around 
  Tabitha's corps pointed out that she who had died was alive. In the same way, 
  those whom you saved in this life will stand around you on the day of 
  judgment. They will snatch you from the fire of Gehenna and to it that you 
  enjoy His loving-kindness in abundance.</P>
  <P>
  (7) Knowing, then, 
  what we now know, let us not be roused to fervor only for the present hour; 
  fan the fire you now have, go forth, and spread salvation over the city; even 
  if you do not know them, get busy and find those who have this sickness. I 
  shall be all the more eager to speak to you when I have found out from your 
  very deeds that I did not scatter my seed on rocky ground. And you yourselves 
  will be more eager to practice virtue. In money matters, the man who has made 
  a profit of two gold pieces gets a greater enthusiasm to collect and amass a 
  profit of ten or twenty pieces. This happens, too, in the matter of virtue. 
  The man who has succeeded in doing a good deed gets some encouragement and 
  motivation from doing this right action. The result is that he will undertake 
  other good deeds.</P>
  <P>
  (8) Let us, then, 
  rescue our brothers and store up beforehand pardon for our sins. Much more, 
  let us first store up abundant confidence and, before all else, let us see to 
  it that God's name is glorified. To do this, let us take our wives, children, 
  and households and go out after this game and quarry. Let us from the snares 
  of the devil those whom he has made captive to his will. And let us not stop 
  until we have done everything in our power to rescue them, whether they heed 
  or reject our words. But it would be impossible, if they are Christians, for 
  them not to heed us.</P>
  <P>
  (9) Still, I do not 
  want you to have even the excuse that they would not heed you. Let me say 
  this. If you pour out many words and do everything in your power and still see 
  that he refuses to heed you, then bring him to the priests. By the help of 
  God's grace the priests will surely overcome their quarry. But it will all be 
  your doing, because is was you who took him by the hand and led him to us. Let 
  husbands talk to their wives and wives to their husbands, fathers to their 
  children and friends to friends.</P>
  <P>
  (10) Let the Jews 
  learn how we feel. Let it also become known to those who side with the Jews, 
  even though they pretend to be ranked with us. We have an eager and vigilant 
  concern for our brothers who have deserted over the Jewish side. When the Jews 
  find this out, it will be they, rather than we, who thrust out those of our 
  number who frequent their synagogue. I should say, there will be no one 
  hereafter who will dare to flee to them, and the body of the Church will be 
  unsullied and pure.</P>
