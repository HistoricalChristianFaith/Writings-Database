<p align="center"><b>John Chrysostom, Against the Jews.&nbsp; Homily 1</b></p>
<hr>

<p align="center"><BIG><STRONG>HOMILY I</STRONG></BIG><STRONG>&nbsp;</p>

</STRONG>
  <P>(1) TODAY I HAD INTENDED to complete my discussion on the topic on 
  which I spoke to you a few days ago; I wished to present you with even clearer 
  proof that God's nature is more than our minds can grasp. Last Sunday I spoke 
  on this at great length and I brought forward as my witnesses Isaiah, David, 
  and Paul. For it was Isaiah who exclaimed: "Who shall declare his generation?" 
  David knew God was beyond his comprehension and so he gave thanks to him and 
  said: "I will praise you for you are fearfully magnified: wonderful are your 
  works". And again it was David who said: "The knowledge of you is to wonderful 
  for me, a height to which my mind cannot attain". Paul did not search and pry 
  into God's very essence, but only into his providence; I should say rather 
  that he looked only on the small portion of divine providence which God had 
  made manifest when he called the gentiles. And Paul saw this small part as a 
  vast and incomprehensible sea when he exclaimed: "O the depth of the riches 
  and of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his 
  judgments, and how unsearchable his ways!"</P>
  <P>(2) These three witnesses gave us proof enough, but I was not satisfied 
  with prophets nor did I settle for apostles. I mounted to the heavens and gave 
  you as proof the chorus of angels as they sang: "Glory to God in the highest, 
  and on earth peace, good will among men". Again, you heard the Seraphim as 
  they shuddered and cried out in astonishment: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God of hosts, all the earth is filled with his 
  glory".&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P> And I gave you also the cherubim who exclaimed:&nbsp;</P>
<blockquote>
  <P> "Blessed be his glory 
  in his dwelling".</P>
</blockquote>
  <P>(3) So there were three witnesses on earth and three in Heaven who made it 
  clear that God's glory cannot be approached. For the rest, the proof was 
  beyond dispute; there was great applause, the audience warmed with enthusiasm, 
  you assembly came aflame. I did rejoice at this, yet my joy was not because 
  praise was coming to me but because glory was coming to my Master. For that 
  applause and praise showed the love you have for God in your souls. If a 
  servant loves his master and hears someone speak in praise of that master, his 
  heart comes aflame with a love for him who speaks. This is because the servant 
  loves his master. You acted just that way when I spoke: by the abundance of 
  your applause you showed clearly your abundant love for the Master.</P>
  <P>(4) And so I wanted again today to engage in that contest. For if the 
  enemies of the truth never have enough of blaspheming our Benefactor, we must 
  be all the more tireless in praising the God of all. But what am I to do? 
  Another very serious illness calls for any cure my words can bring, an illness 
  which has become implanted in the body of the Church. We must first root this 
  ailment out and then take thought for matters outside; we must first cure our 
  own and then be concerned for others who are strangers. </P>
  <P>(5) What is this disease? The festivals of the pitiful and miserable Jews 
  are soon to march upon us one after the other and in quick succession: the 
  feast of Trumpets, the feast of Tabernacles, the fasts. There are many in our 
  ranks who say they think as we do. Yet some of these are going to watch the 
  festivals and others will join the Jews in keeping their feasts and observing 
  their fasts. I wish to drive this perverse custom from the Church right now. 
  My homilies against the Anomians can be put off to another time, and the 
  postponement would cause no harm. But now that the Jewish festivals are close 
  by and at the very door, if I should fail to cure those who are sick with the 
  Judaizing disease. I am afraid that, because of their ill-suited association 
  and deep ignorance, some Christians may partake in the Jews' transgressions; 
  once they have done so, I fear my homilies on these transgressions will be in 
  vain. For if they hear no word from me today, they will then join the Jews in 
  their fasts; once they have committed this sin it will be useless for me to 
  apply the remedy. </P>
  <P>(6) And so it is that I hasten to anticipate this danger and prevent it. 
  This is what physicians do. They first check the diseases which are most 
  urgent and acute. But the danger from this sickness is very closely related to 
  the danger from the other; since the Anomians impiety is akin to that of the 
  Jews, my present conflict is akin to my former one. And there is a kingship 
  because the Jews and the Anomians make the same accusation. And what charges 
  do the Jews make? That He called God His own Father and so made Himself equal 
  to God. The Anomians also make this charge-I should not say they make this a 
  charge; they even blot out the phrase "equal to God" and what it connotes, by 
  their resolve to reject it even if they do not physically erase it.</P>
  <P>II</P>
  <P>But do not be surprised that I called the Jews pitiable. They really are 
  pitiable and miserable. When so many blessings from heaven came into their 
  hands, they thrust them aside and were at great pains to reject them. The 
  morning Sun of Justice arose for them, but they thrust aside its rays and 
  still sit in darkness. We, who were nurtured by darkness, drew the light to 
  ourselves and were freed from the gloom of their error. They were the branches 
  of that holy root, but those branches were broken. We had no share in the 
  root, but we did reap the fruit of godliness. From their childhood they read 
  the prophets, but they crucified him whom the prophets had foretold. We did 
  not hear the divine prophecies but we did worship him of whom they prophesied. 
  And so they are pitiful because they rejected the blessings which were sent to 
  them, while others seized hold of these blessing and drew them to themselves. 
  Although those Jews had been called to the adoption of sons, they fell to 
  kinship with dogs; we who were dogs received the strength, through God's 
  grace, to put aside the irrational nature which was ours and to rise to the 
  honor of sons. How do I prove this? Christ said: "It is no fair to take the 
  children's bread and to cast it to the dogs". Christ was speaking to the 
  Canaanite woman when He called the Jews children and the Gentiles dogs.</P>
  <P>(2) But see how thereafter the order was changed about: they became dogs, 
  and we became the children. Paul said of the Jews: "Beware of the dogs, beware 
  of the evil workers, beware of the mutilation. For we are the circumcision". 
  Do you see how those who at first were children became dogs? Do you wish to 
  find out how we, who at first were dogs, became children? "But to as many as 
  received him, he gave the power of becoming sons of God".</P>
  <P>(3) Nothing is more miserable than those people who never failed to attack 
  their own salvation. When there was need to observe the Law, they trampled it 
  under foot. Now that the Law has ceased to bind, they obstinately strive to 
  observe it. What could be more pitiable that those who provoke God not only by 
  transgressing the Law but also by keeping it? On this account Stephen said: 
  "You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart, you always resist the Holy 
  Spirit", not only by transgressing the Law but also by wishing to observe it 
  at the wrong time.</P>
  <P>(4) Stephen was right in calling them stiff-necked. For they failed to take 
  up the yoke of Christ, although it was sweet and had nothing about it which 
  was either burdensome or oppressive. For he said: "Learn from me for I am meek 
  and humble of heart", and "Take my yoke upon you, for my yoke is sweet and my 
  burden light". Nonetheless they failed to take up the yoke because of the 
  stiffness of their necks. Not only did they fail to take it up but they broke 
  it and destroyed it. For Jeremiah said: "Long ago you broke your yoke and 
  burst your bonds". It was not Paul who said this but the voice of the prophet 
  speaking loud and clear. When he spoke of the yoke and the bonds, he meant the 
  symbols of rule, because the Jews rejected the rule of Christ when they said: 
  "We have no king but Caesar". You Jews broke the yoke, you burst the bonds, 
  you cast yourselves out of the kingdom of heaven, and you made yourselves 
  subject to the rule of men. Please consider with me how accurately the prophet 
  hinted that their hearts were uncontrolled. He did not say: "You set aside the 
  yoke", but "You broke the yoke" and this is the crime of untamed beasts, who 
  are uncontrolled and reject rule.</P>
  <P>(5) But what is the source of this hardness? It come from gluttony and 
  drunkenness. Who say so? Moses himself. "Israel ate and was filled and the 
  darling grew fat and frisky". When brute animals feed from a full manger, they 
  grow plump and become more obstinate and hard to hold in check; they endure 
  neither the yoke, the reins, nor the hand of the charioteer. Just so the 
  Jewish people were driven by their drunkenness and plumpness to the ultimate 
  evil; they kicked about, they failed to accept the yoke of Christ, nor did 
  they pull the plow of his teaching. Another prophet hinted at this when he 
  said: "Israel is as obstinate as a stubborn heifer". And still another called 
  the Jews "an untamed calf".</P>
  <P>(6) Although such beasts are unfit for work, they are fit for killing. And 
  this is what happened to the Jews: while they were making themselves unfit for 
  work, they grew fit for slaughter. This is why Christ said: "But as for these 
  my enemies, who did not want me to be king over them, bring them here and slay 
  them". You Jews should have fasted then, when drunkenness was doing those 
  terrible things to you, when your gluttony was giving birth to your 
  ungodliness-not now. Now your fasting is untimely and an abomination. Who said 
  so? Isaiah himself when he called out in a loud voice: "I did not choose this 
  fast, say the Lord". Why? "You quarrel and squabble when you fast and strike 
  those subject to you with your fists". But if you fasting was an abomination 
  when you were striking your fellow slaves, does it become acceptable now that 
  you have slain your Master? How could that be right?</P>
  <P>(7) The man who fast should be properly restrained, contrite, humbled-not 
  drunk with anger. But do you strike your fellow slaves? In Isaiah's day they 
  quarreled and squabbled when they fasted; now when fast, they go in for 
  excesses and the ultimate licentiousness, dancing with bare feet in the 
  marketplace. The pretext is that they are fasting, but they act like men who 
  are drunk. Hear how the prophet bit them to fast. "Sanctify a fast", he said. 
  He did not say: "Make a parade of your fasting", but "call an assembly; gather 
  together the ancients". But these Jews are gathering choruses of effeminates 
  and a great rubbish heap of harlots; they drag into the synagogue the whole 
  theater, actors and all. For there is no difference between the theater and 
  the synagogue. I know that some suspect me of rashness because I said there is 
  no difference between the theater and the synagogue; but I suspect them of 
  rashness if they do not think that this is so. If my declaration that the two 
  are the same rests on my own authority, then charge me with rashness. But if 
  the words I speak are the words of the prophet, then accept his decision.</P>
  <P>III</P>
  <P>Many, I know, respect the Jews and think that their present way of life is 
  a venerable one. This is why I hasten to uproot and tear out this deadly 
  opinion. I said that the synagogue is no better than a theater and I bring 
  forward a prophet as my witness. Surely the Jews are not more deserving of 
  belief than their prophets. "You had a harlot's brow; you became shameless 
  before all". Where a harlot has set herself up, that place is a brothel. But 
  the synagogue is not only a brothel and a theater; it also is a den of robbers 
  and a lodging for wild beasts. Jeremiah said: "Your house has become for me 
  the den of a hyena". He does not simply say "of wild beast", but "of a filthy 
  wild beast", and again: "I have abandoned my house, I have cast off my 
  inheritance". But when God forsakes a people, what hope of salvation is left? 
  When God forsakes a place, that place becomes the dwelling of demons.</P>
  <P>(2) But at any rate the Jews say that they, too, adore God. God forbid that 
  I say that. No Jew adores God! Who say so? The Son of God say so. For he said: 
  "If you were to know my Father, you would also know me. But you neither know 
  me nor do you know my Father". Could I produce a witness more trustworthy than 
  the Son of God?</P>
  <P>(3) If, then, the Jews fail to know the Father, if they crucified the Son, 
  if they thrust off the help of the Spirit, who should not make bold to declare 
  plainly that the synagogue is a dwelling of demons? God is not worshipped 
  there. Heaven forbid! From now on it remains a place of idolatry. But still 
  some people pay it honor as a holy place.</P>
  <P>(4) Let me tell you this, not from guesswork but from my own experience. 
  Three days ago-believe me, I am not lying-I saw a free woman of good bearing, 
  modest, and a believer. A brutal, unfeeling man, reputed to be a Christian 
  (for I would not call a person who would dare to do such a thing a sincere 
  Christian) was forcing her to enter the shrine of the Hebrews and to swear 
  there an oath about some matters under dispute with him. She came up to me and 
  asked for help; she begged me to prevent this lawless violence-for it was 
  forbidden to her, who had shared in the divine mysteries, to enter that place. 
  I was fired with indignation, I became angry, I rose up, I refused to let her 
  be dragged into that transgression, I snatched her from the hands of her 
  abductor. I asked him if were a Christian, and he said he was. Then I set upon 
  him vigorously, charging him with lack of feeling and the worst stupidity; I 
  told him he was no better off than a mule if he, who professed to worship 
  Christ, would drag someone off to the dens of the Jews who had crucified him. 
  I talked to him a long time, drawing my lesson from the Holy Gospels; I told 
  him first that it was altogether forbidden to swear and that it was wrong to 
  impose the necessity of swearing on anyone. I then told him that he most not 
  subject a baptize believer to this necessity. In fact, he must not force even 
  an unbaptized person to swear an oath.</P>
  <P>(5) After I talked with him at great length and had driven the folly of his 
  error from his soul, I asked him why he rejected the Church and dragged the 
  woman to the place where the Hebrews assembled. He answered that many people 
  had told him that oaths sworn there were more to be feared. His words made me 
  groan, then I grew angry, and finally I began to smile. When I saw the devil's 
  wickedness, I groaned because he had the power to seduce men; I grew angry 
  when I considered how careless were those who were deceived; when I saw the 
  extent and depth of the folly of those who were deceived, I smiled.</P>
  <P>(6) I told you this story because you are savage and ruthless in your 
  attitude toward those who do such things and undergo these experiences. If you 
  see one of your brothers falling into such transgressions, you consider that 
  it is someone else's misfortune, not your own; you think you have defended 
  yourselves against your accusers when you say: "What concern of mine is it? 
  What do I have in common with that man"? When you say that, your words 
  manifest the utmost hatred for mankind and a cruelty which benefits the devil. 
  What are you saying? You are a man and share the same nature. Why speak of a 
  common nature when you have but a single head, Christ? Do you dare to say you 
  have nothing in common with your own members? In what sense do you admit that 
  Christ is the head of the Church? For certainly it is the function of the head 
  to join all the limbs together, to order them carefully to each other, and to 
  bind them into one nature. But if you have nothing in common with your 
  members, then you have nothing in common with your brother, nor do you have 
  Christ as your head.</P>
  <P>(7) The Jews frighten you as if you were little children, and you do not 
  see it. Many wicked slaves show frightening and ridiculous masks to 
  youngsters-the masks are not frightening by their nature, but they seem so to 
  the children's simple minds-and in this way they stir up many a laugh. This is 
  the way the Jews frighten the simpler-minded Christians with the bugbears and 
  hobgoblins of their shrines. Yet how could their ridiculous and disgraceful 
  synagogues frighten you? Are they not the shrines of men who have been 
  rejected, dishonored, and condemned?</P>
  <P>IV</P>
  <P>Our churches are not like that; they are truly frightening and filled with 
  fear. God's presence makes a place frightening because he has power over life 
  and death. In our churches we hear countless homilies on eternal punishments, 
  on rivers of fire, on the venomous worm, on bonds that cannot be burst, or 
  exterior darkness. But the Jews neither know nor dream of these things. They 
  live for their bellies, they gape for the things of this world, their 
  condition is not better than that of pigs or goats because of their wanton 
  ways and excessive gluttony. They know but one thing: to fill their bellies 
  and be drunk, to get all cut and bruised, to be hurt and wounded while 
  fighting for their favorite charioteers.</P>
  <P>(2) Tell me, then, are their shrines awful and frightening? Who would say 
  so? what reasons do we have for thinking that they are frightening unless 
  someone should tell us that dishonored slaves, who have no right to speak and 
  who have been driven from their Master's home, should frighten us, who have 
  been given honor and the freedom to speak? Certainly this is not the case. 
  Inns are not more august then royal palaces. Indeed the synagogue is less 
  deserving of honor than any inn. It is not merely a lodging place for robbers 
  and cheats but also for demons. This is true not only of the synagogues but 
  also of the souls of the Jews, as I shall try to prove at the end of my 
  homily.</P>
  <P>(3) I urge you to keep my words in your minds in a special way. For I am 
  not now speaking for show or applause but to cure your souls. And what else is 
  left for me to say when some of you are still sick although there are so many 
  physicians to effect a cure?</P>
  <P>(4) There were twelve apostles and they drew the whole world to themselves. 
  The greater portion of the city is Christian, yet some are still sick with the 
  Judaizing disease. And what could we, who are healthy, say in our own defense? 
  Surely those who are sick deserve to be accused. But we are not free from 
  blame, because we have neglected them in their hour of illness; if we had 
  shown great concern for them and they had the benefit of this care, they could 
  not possibly still be sick.</P>
  <P>(5) Let me get the start on you by saying this now, so that each of you may 
  win over his brother. Even if you must impose restraint, even if you must use 
  force, even if you must treat him ill and obstinately, do everything to save 
  him from the devil's snare and to free him from fellowship with those who slew 
  Christ. </P>
  <P>(6) Tell me this. Suppose you were to see a man who had been justly 
  condemned being led to execution through the marketplace. Suppose it were in 
  your power to save him from the hands of the public executioner. Would you not 
  do all you could to keep him from being dragged off? But now you see your own 
  brother being dragged off unjustly to the depth of destruction. And it is not 
  the executioner who drags him of, but the devil. Would you be so bold as not 
  to do your part toward rescuing him from his transgression? If you don't help 
  him, what excuse would you find? But your brother is stronger and more 
  powerful than you. Show him to me. If he will stand fast in his obstinate 
  resolve, I shall choose to risk my life rather than let him enter the doors of 
  the synagogue.</P>
  <P>(7) I shall say to him: What fellowship do you have with the free 
  Jerusalem, with the Jerusalem above? You chose the one below; be a slave with 
  that earthly Jerusalem which, according to the word of the Apostle, is a slave 
  together with her children. Do you fast with the Jews? Then take off your 
  shoes with the Jews, and walk barefoot in the marketplace, and share with them 
  in their indecency and laughter. But you would not chose to do this because 
  you are ashamed and apt to blush. Are you ashamed to share with them in 
  outward appearance but unashamed to share in their impiety? What excuse will 
  you have, you who are only half a Christian?</P>
  <P>(8) Believe me, I shall risk my life before I would neglect any one who is 
  sick with this disease-if I see him. If I fail to see him, surely God will 
  grant me pardon. And let each one of you consider this matter; let him not 
  think it is something of secondary importance. Do you take no notice of what 
  the deacon continuously calls out in the mysteries? "Recognize one another", 
  he says. Do you not see how he entrusts to you the careful examination of your 
  brothers? Do this in the case of Judaizers, too. When you observe someone 
  Judaizing, take hold of him, show him what he is doing, so that you may not 
  yourself be an accessory to the risk he runs.</P>
  <P>(9) If any Roman soldier serving overseas is caught favoring the barbarians 
  and the Persians, not only is he in danger but so also is everyone who was 
  aware of how this felt and failed to make this fact known to the general. 
  Since you are the army of Christ, be overly careful in searching to see if 
  anyone favoring an alien faith has mingled among you, and make his presence 
  know-not so that we may put him to death as those generals did, nor that we 
  may punish him or take our vengeance upon him, but that we may free him from 
  his error and ungodliness and make him entirely our own.</P>
  <P>(10) If you are unwilling to do this, if you know of such a person but 
  conceal him, be sure that both you and he will be subject to the same penalty. 
  For Paul subjects to chastisement and punishment not only those who commit 
  acts of wickedness but also those who approve what they have done. The 
  prophet, too, brings to the same judgment not only thieves but also who run 
  with the thieves. And this is quite reasonable. For if a man is aware of a 
  criminal's actions but covers them up and conceals them, he is providing a 
  stronger basis for the criminal to be careless of the law and making him less 
  afraid in his career of crime.</P>
  <P>V</P>
  <P>But I must get back again to those who are sick. Consider, then, with whom 
  they are sharing their fasts. It is with those who shouted: "Crucify him, 
  Crucify him", with those who said: "His blood be upon us and upon our 
  children". If some men had been caught in rebellion against their ruler and 
  were condemned, would you have dared to go up to them and to speak with them? 
  I think not. Is it not foolish, then, to show such readiness to flee from 
  those who have sinned against a man, but to enter into fellowship with those 
  who have committed outrages against God himself? Is it not strange that those 
  who worship the Crucified keep common festival with those who crucified him? 
  Is it not a sign of folly and the worst madness?</P>
  <P>(2) Since there are some who think of the synagogue as a holy place, I must 
  say a few words to them. Why do you reverence that place? Must you not despise 
  it, hold it in abomination, run away from it? They answer that the Law and the 
  books of the prophets are kept there. What is this? Will any place where these 
  books are be a holy place? By no means! This is the reason above all others 
  why I hate the synagogue and abhor it. They have the prophets but not believe 
  them; they read the sacred writings but reject their witness-and this is a 
  mark of men guilty of the greatest outrage.</P>
  <P>(3) Tell me this. If you were to see a venerable man, illustrious and 
  renowned, dragged off into a tavern or den of robbers; if you were to see him 
  outraged, beaten, and subjected there to the worst violence, would you have 
  held that tavern or den in high esteem because that great and esteemed man had 
  been inside it while undergoing that violent treatment? I think not. Rather, 
  for this very reason you would have hated and abhorred the place.</P>
  <P>(4) Let that be your judgment about the synagogue, too. For they brought 
  the books of Moses and the prophets along with them into the synagogue, not to 
  honor them but to outrage them with dishonor. When they say that Moses and the 
  prophets knew not Christ and said nothing about his coming, what greater 
  outrage could they do to those holy men than to accuse them of failing to 
  recognize their Master, than to say that those saintly prophets are partners 
  of their impiety? And so it is that we must hate both them and their synagogue 
  all the more because of their offensive treatment of those holy men.</P>
  <P>(5) Why do I speak about the books and the synagogues? In time of 
  persecution, the public executioners lay hold of the bodies of the martyrs, 
  they scourge them, and tear them to pieces. Does it make the executioners' 
  hands holy because they lay hold of the body of holy men? Heaven forbid! The 
  hands which grasped and held the bodies of the holy ones still stay unholy. 
  Why? Because those executioners did a wicked thing when they laid their hands 
  upon the holy. And will those who handle and outrage the writings of the holy 
  ones be any more venerable for this than those who executed the martyrs? Would 
  that not be the ultimate foolishness? If the maltreated bodies of the martyrs 
  do not sanctify those who maltreated them but even add to their blood-guilt, 
  much less could the Scriptures, if read without belief, ever help those who 
  read without believing. The very act of deliberately choosing to maltreat the 
  Scriptures convicts them of greater godlessness.</P>
  <P>(6) If they did not have the prophets, they would not deserve such 
  punishment; if they had not read the sacred books, they would not be so 
  unclean and so unholy. But, as it is, they have been stripped of all excuse. 
  They do have the heralds of the truth but, with hostile heart, they set 
  themselves against the prophets and the truth they speak. So it is for this 
  reason that they would be all the more profane and blood-guilty: they have the 
  prophets, but they treat them with hostile hearts.</P>
  <P>(7) So it is that I exhort you to flee and shun their gatherings. The harm 
  they bring to our weaker brothers is not slight; they offer no slight excuse 
  to sustain to the folly of the Jews. For when they see that you, who worship 
  the Christ whom they crucified, are reverently following their rituals, how 
  can they fail to think that the rites they have performed are the best and 
  that our ceremonies are worthless? For after you worship and adore at our 
  mysteries, you run to the very men who destroy our rites. Paul said: "If a man 
  sees you that have knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not his 
  conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed 
  to idols"? And let me say: If a man sees you that have knowledge come into the 
  synagogue and participate in the festival of the Trumpets, shall not his 
  conscience, being weak, be emboldened to admire what the Jews do? He who falls 
  not only pays the penalty for his own fall, but he is also punished because he 
  trips others as well. But the man who has stood firm is rewarded not only 
  because of his own virtue but people admire him for leading others to desire 
  the same things. </P>
  <P>(8) Therefore, flee the gatherings and holy places of the Jews. Let no man 
  venerate the synagogue because of the holy books; let him hate and avoid it 
  because the Jews outrage and maltreat the holy ones, because they refuse to 
  believe their words, because they accuse them of the ultimate impiety.</P>
  <P>VI</P>
  <P>That you may know that the sacred books do not make a place holy but that 
  the purpose of those who frequent a place does make it profane, I shall tell 
  an old story. Ptolemy Philadelphus had collected books from all over the 
  world. When he learned that the Jews had writings which treated of God and the 
  ideal state, he sent for men from Judea and had them translate those books, 
  which he then had deposited in the temple of Serapis, for he was a pagan. Up 
  to the present day the translated books remain there in the temple. But will 
  the temple of Serapis be holy because of the holy books? Heaven forbid! 
  Although the books have their own holiness, they do not give a share of it to 
  the place because those who frequent the place are defiled.</P>
  <P>(2) You must apply the same argument to the synagogue. Even if there is no 
  idol there, still demons do inhabit the place. And I say this not only about 
  the synagogue here in town but about the one in Daphne as well; for at Daphne 
  you have a more wicked place of perdition which they call Matrona's. I have 
  heard that many of the faithful go up there and sleep beside the place.</P>
  <P>(3) But heaven forbid that I call these people faithful. For to me the 
  shrine of Matrona and the temple of Apollo are equally profane. If anyone 
  charges me with boldness, I will in turn charge him with the utmost madness. 
  For, tell me, is not the dwelling place of demons a place of impiety even if 
  no god's statue stands there? Here the slayers of Christ gather together, here 
  the cross is driven out, here God is blasphemed, here the Father is ignored, 
  here the Son is outraged, here the grace of the Spirit is rejected. Does not 
  greater harm come from this place since the Jews themselves are demons? In the 
  pagan temple the impiety is naked and obvious; it would not be ease to deceive 
  a man of sound and prudent mind or entice him to go there. But in the 
  synagogue there are men who say they worship God and abhor idols, men who say 
  they have prophets and pay them honor. But by their words they make ready an 
  abundance of bait to catch in their nets the simpler souls who are so foolish 
  as to be caught of guard.</P>
  <P>(4) So the godlessness of the Jews and the pagans is on a par. But the Jews 
  practice a deceit which is more dangerous. In their synagogue stands an 
  invisible altar of deceit on which they sacrifice not sheep and calves but the 
  souls of men.</P>
  <P>(5) Finally, if the ceremonies of the Jews move you to admiration, what do 
  you have in common with us? If the Jewish ceremonies are venerable and great, 
  our are lies. But if ours are true, as they are true, theirs are filled with 
  deceit. I am not speaking of the Scriptures. Heaven forbid! It was the 
  Scriptures which took me by the hand and led me to Christ. But I am talking 
  about the ungodliness and present madness of the Jews.</P>
  <P>(6) Certainly it is the time for me to show that demons dwell in the 
  synagogue, not only in the place itself but also in the souls of the Jews. As 
  Christ said: "When an unclean spirit is gone out, he walks through dry places 
  seeking rest. If he does not find it he says: I shall return to my house. And 
  coming he finds it empty, swept, and garnished. Then he goes and takes with 
  him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter into him and 
  the last state of that man is made worse than the first. So shall it be also 
  to this generations".</P>
  <P>(7) Do you see that demons dwell in their souls and that these demons are 
  more dangerous than the ones of old? And this is very reasonable. In the old 
  days the Jews acted impiously toward the prophets; now they outrage the Master 
  of the prophets. Tell me this. Do you not shudder to come into the same place 
  with men possessed, who have so many unclean spirits, who have been reared 
  amid slaughter and bloodshed? Must you share a greeting with them and exchange 
  a bare word? Must you not turn away from them since they are the common 
  disgrace and infection of the whole world? Have they not come to every form of 
  wickedness? Have not all the prophets spent themselves making many and long 
  speeches of accusation against them? What tragedy, what manner of lawlessness 
  have they not eclipsed by their blood-guiltiness? They sacrificed their own 
  sons and daughters to demons. They refused to recognize nature, they forgot 
  the pangs, of birth, they trod underfoot the rearing of their children, they 
  overturned from their foundations the laws of kingship, they became more 
  savage than any wild beast.</P>
  <P>(8) Wild beasts oftentimes lay down their lives and scorn their own safety 
  to protect their young. No necessity forced the Jews when they slew their own 
  children with their own hands to pay honor to the avenging demons, the foes of 
  our life. What deed of theirs should strike us with greater astonishment? 
  Their ungodliness or their cruelty or their inhumanity? That they sacrificed 
  their children or that they sacrificed them to demons? Because of their 
  licentiousness, did they not show a lust beyond that of irrational animals? 
  Hear what the prophet says of their excesses. "They are become as amorous 
  stallions. Every one neighed after his neighbor's wife". He did not say: 
  "Everyone lusted after his neighbor's wife", but he expressed the madness 
  which came from their licentiousness with the greatest clarity by speaking of 
  it as the neighing of brute beasts.</P>
  <P>VII</P>
  <P>What else do you wish me to tell you? Shall I tell you of their plundering, 
  their covetousness, their abandonment of the poor, their thefts, their 
  cheating in trade? the whole day long will not be enough to give you an 
  account of these things. But do their festivals have something solemn and 
  great about them? They have shown that these, too, are impure. Listen to the 
  prophets; rather, listen to God and with how strong a statement he turns his 
  back on them: "I have found your festivals hateful, I have thrust them away 
  from myself".</P>
  <P>(2) Does God hate their festivals and do you share in them? He did not say 
  this or that festival, but all of them together. Do you wish to see that God 
  hates the worship paid with kettledrums, with lyres, with harps, and other 
  instruments? God said: "Take away from me the sound of your songs and I will 
  not hear the canticle of you harps". If God said: "Take them away from me", do 
  you run to listen to the trumpets? Are these sacrifices and offerings not an 
  abomination? "If you bring me the finest wheaten flour, it is in vain: incense 
  is an abomination to me". The incense is an abomination. Is not the place also 
  an abomination? Before they committed the crime of crimes, before they killed 
  their Master, before the cross, before the slaying of Christ, it was an 
  abomination. Is it not now all the more an abomination? And yet what is more 
  fragrant than incense? But God looks not to the nature of the gifts but to the 
  intention of those who bring them; it is this intention that he judges their 
  offerings. </P>
  <P>(3) He paid heed to Abel and then to his gifts. He looked at Cain and then 
  turned away from his offering. For Scripture says: "For Cain and his offerings 
  he had no regard". Noah offered to God sacrifices of sheep and calves and 
  birds. The Scripture say: "And the Lord smelled a sweet odor", that is, he 
  accepted the offerings. For God has no nostrils but is a bodiless spirit. Yet 
  what is carried up from the altar is the odor and smoke from burning bodies, 
  and nothing is more malodorous than such a savor. But that you may learn that 
  God attends to the intention of the one offering the sacrifice and then 
  accepts or rejects it, Scripture calls the odor and the smoke a sweet savor; 
  but it calls the incense an abomination because the intention of those 
  offering it reeked with a great stench.</P>
  <P>(4) Do you wish to learn that, together with the sacrifices and the musical 
  instruments and the festivals and the incense, God also rejects the temple 
  because of those who enter it? He showed this mostly by his deeds, when he 
  gave it over to barbarian hands, and later when he utterly destroyed it. But 
  even before its destruction, through his prophet he shouted aloud and said: 
  "Put not your trust in deceitful words for it will not help you when you say: 
  "This is the temple of the Lord! The temple of the Lord"! What the prophet 
  says is that the temple does not make holy those who gather there, but those 
  who gather there make the temple holy. If the temple did not help at a time 
  when the Cherubim and the Ark were there, much less will it help now that all 
  those things are gone, now that God's rejection is complete, now that there is 
  greater ground for enmity. How great an act of madness and derangement would 
  it be to take as your partners in the festivals those who have been 
  dishonored, those whom God has forsaken, those who angered the Master?</P>
  <P>(5) Tell me this. If a man were to have slain your son, would you endure to 
  look upon him, or accept his greeting? Would you not shun him as a wicked 
  demon, as the devil himself? They slew the Son of your Lord; do you have the 
  boldness to enter with them under the same roof? After he was slain he heaped 
  such honor upon you that he made you his brother and coheir. But you dishonor 
  him so much that you pay honor to those who slew him on the cross, that you 
  observe with them the fellowship of the festivals, that you go to their 
  profane places, enter their unclean doors, and share in the tables of demons. 
  For I am persuaded to call the fasting of the Jews a table of demons because 
  they slew God. If the Jews are acting against God, must they not be serving 
  the demons? Are you looking for demons to cure you? When Christ allowed the 
  demons to enter into the swine, straightway they plunged into the sea. Will 
  these demons spare the bodies of men? I wish they would not kill men's bodies, 
  that they would not plot against them. But they will. The demons cast men from 
  Paradise and deprived them the honor from above. Will they cure their bodies? 
  That is ridiculous, mere stories. The demons know how to plot and do harm, not 
  to cure. They do not spare souls. Tell me, then, will they spare bodies? They 
  try to drive men from the Kingdom. Will they choose to free them from disease? 
  </P>
  <P>(6) Did you not hear what the prophet said? Rather, did you hear what God 
  said through the prophet? He said that the demons can do neither good nor 
  evil. Even if they could cure and wanted to do so-which is impossible-you must 
  not take an indestructible and unending punishment in exchange for a slight 
  benefit which can soon be destroyed. Will you cure your body and destroy your 
  soul? You are making a poor exchange. Are you angering God who made your body, 
  and are you calling to your aid the demon who plots against you?</P>
  <P>(7) If any demon-fearing pagan has medical knowledge, will he also find it 
  easy to win you over to worship the pagan gods? Those pagans, too, have their 
  skill. They, too, have often cured many diseases and brought the sick back to 
  health. Are we going to share in their godlessness on this account? Heaven 
  forbid! Hear what Moses said to the Jews. "If there arise in the midst of you 
  a prophet or one that says he has dreamed a dream and he foretell a sign and a 
  wonder, and that sign or wonder which he spoke come to pass, and he say to 
  you: "Let us go and serve strange gods whom our fathers did not know, you 
  shall not hear the words of that prophet or dreamer".</P>
  <P>(8) What Moses means is this. If some prophet rises up, he says, and 
  performs a sign, by either raising a dead man or cleansing a leper, or curing 
  a maimed man, and after working the wonder calls you to impiety, do not heed 
  him just because his sign comes to pass. Why? "The Lord your God is trying you 
  to see whether you love him with all your heart and all your soul". From this 
  it is clear that demons do not cure. If ever God should permit demons to cure, 
  as he might permit a man to do, his permission is given to test you-not 
  because God does not know what you are, but that he may teach you to reject 
  even the demons who do cure.</P>
  <P>(9) And why do I speak of bodily cures? If any man threatens you with 
  Gehenna unless you deny Christ, do not heed his words. If someone should 
  promise you a kingdom to revolt from the only-begotten Son of God, turn away 
  from him and hate him. Be a disciple of Paul and emulate those words which his 
  blessed and noble soul exclaimed when he said: "I am sure that neither death 
  nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor 
  things to come, no height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to 
  separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ our Lord".</P>
  <P>(10) No angels, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor any 
  other creature separated Paul from the love of Christ. Do you revolt to cure 
  your body? And what excuse could we find? Certainly we must fear Christ more 
  than Gehenna and desire him more than a kingdom. Even if we be sick, it is 
  better to remain in ill health than to fall into impiety for the sake of a 
  cure; for even if a demon cures you, he has hurt more than he has helped. He 
  has helped the body, which a short time later will altogether die and rot 
  away. But he has hurt the soul, which will never die. Kidnappers often entice 
  little boys by offering them sweets, and cakes, and marbles, and other such 
  things; then they deprive them of their freedom and their very life. So, too, 
  the demons promise cure of a limb and then dash the whole salvation of the 
  soul into the sea.</P>
  <P>(11) Beloved, let us not put up with that; in every way let us seek to keep 
  ourselves free from godlessness. Could Job not have heeded his wife, 
  blasphemed against God, and been free from the disaster which beset him? 
  "Curse God and die" she said. But he chose to suffer the pain and to waste 
  away; he chose to endure that unbearable blow rather to blaspheme and be free 
  from the evils which beset him. You must emulate him. If the demon shall 
  promise you ten thousand cures from the ills which beset you, do not heed him, 
  do not put up with him-just as Job refused to heed his wife. Chose to endure 
  your illness rather than destroy your faith and the salvation of your soul. 
  God does not forsake you. It is because he wishes to increase your glory that 
  oftentimes he permits you to fall sick. Keep up your courage so that you may 
  also hear him say: "Do you think I have dealt with you otherwise than that you 
  may be shown to be just"? </P>
  <P>VIII</P>
  <P>I could have said more than this, but to keep you from forgetting what I 
  have said, I shall bring my homily to an end here with the words of Moses: "I 
  call heaven and earth to witness against you". If any of you, whether you are 
  here present or not, shall go to the spectacle of the Trumpets, or rush off to 
  the synagogue, or go up to the shrine of Matrona, or take part in fasting, or 
  share in the Sabbath, or observe any other Jewish ritual great or small, I 
  call heaven and earth as my witnesses that I am guiltless of the blood of all 
  of you.</P>
  <P>(2) These words will stand by your side and mine on the day of our Lord 
  Jesus Christ. If you heed them, they will bring you great confidence; if you 
  heed them not or conceal anyone who dares to do those things, my words shall 
  stand against you as bitter accusations. "For I have not shrunk from declaring 
  to you the whole counsel of God".</P>
  <P>(3) I have deposited the money with the bankers. It remains for you to 
  increase the deposit and to use the profit from my words for the salvation of 
  your brothers. Do you find it an oppressive burden to denounce those who 
  commit these sins? It is an oppressive burden to remain silent. For this 
  silence makes you an enemy to God and brings destruction both to you who 
  conceal such sinners and to those whose sins go unrevealed. How much better it 
  is to become hateful to our fellow servants for saving them to provoke God's 
  anger against yourselves. Even if your fellow servant be vexed with you now, 
  he will not be able to harm you but will be grateful later on for his cure. 
  But if you seek to win your fellow servant's favor, if you remain silent and 
  hurt him by concealing his sin, God will exact from you the ultimate penalty. 
  Your silence will make God your foe and will hurt your brother; if you 
  denounce him and reveal his sin, you will make God propitious and benefit your 
  brother and you will gain as a friend one who was crazed but who learned from 
  experience that you served him well. </P>
  <P>(4) Do not think, then, that you are doing your brothers a favor if you 
  should see them pursuing some absurdity and should fail to accuse them with 
  all zeal. If you lose a cloak, do you not consider as your foe not only the 
  one who stole it but also the man who knew of the theft and refused to 
  denounce the thief? Our common Mother (the Church) has lost not a cloak but a 
  brother. The devil stole him and now holds him in Judaism. You know who stole 
  him; you know him who was stolen. Do you see me lighting, as it were, the lamp 
  of my instruction and searching everywhere in my grief? And do you stand 
  silent, refusing to denounce him? What excuse will you have? Will the Church 
  not reckon you among her worst enemies? Will she not consider you a foe and 
  destroyer?</P>
  <P>(5) Heaven forbid that anyone who hears my words of advice should commit 
  such a sin as to betray the brother for whom Christ died. Christ poured out 
  his blood on his account. Are you too reluctant to utter a word on this 
  account? I urge you not to be so reluctant. Right after you leave here, stir 
  yourselves to the chase and let each of you bring me one of those suffering 
  from this disease.</P>
  <P>(6) But heaven forbid that so many be sick with it. Let two or three, or 
  ten or twenty of you bring me one man. One the day you do and when I see in 
  your nets the game you have caught, I will set before you a more plentiful 
  table. If I see that the advice I gave today has been put to work, I shall be 
  more zealous in undertaking the cure of those men, and this will be a greater 
  boon both for you and them.</P>
  <P>(7) Do not regard my words lightly. Be scrupulous in hunting out those who 
  suffer from this sickness. Let the women search for the women, the men for the 
  men, the slaves for the slaves, the freemen for the freemen, and the children 
  for the children. Come all of you to our next meeting with such success that 
  you win praise from me-and, before any praise of mine, that you obtain, from 
  God a great and indescribable reward which in abundant measure surpasses the 
  labors of those who succeed. May all of us obtain this by the grace and 
  loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom and with whom be glory 
  to the Father together with the Holy Spirit now and forever, world without 
  end. Amen.</P>
