<hr>

<p align="center">
<STRONG>HOMILY IV</STRONG>
  <P>Against the Jews and the trumpets of their Pasch </P>
  <P>Delivered at Antioch in the Great Church </P>
  <P>AGAIN THE JEWS, the most miserable and wretched of all men, are going to 
  fast, and again we must make secure the flock of Christ. As long as no wild 
  beast disturbs the flock, shepherds, as they stretch out under an oak or pine 
  tree and play their flutes, let their sheep go off to graze with full freedom. 
  But when the shepherds feel that the wolves will raid, they are quick to throw 
  down the flute and pick up their slingshots; they cast aside the pipe of reeds 
  and arm themselves with clubs and stones. They take their stand in front of 
  the flock, raise a loud and piercing shout, and oftentimes the sound of their 
  shout drives the wolf away before he strikes. </P>
  <P>(2) I, too, in the past, frolicked about in explicating the Scriptures, as 
  if I were sporting in some meadow; I took no part in polemics because there 
  was no one causing me concern. But today the Jews, who are more dangerous than 
  any wolves, are bent on surrounding my sheep; so I must spar with them and 
  fight with them so that no sheep of mine may fall victim to those wolves. </P>
  <P>(3) That fast will not be upon us for ten days or more. But do not be 
  surprised that from today on I am taking up my tools and building a fence 
  around your souls. This is what the hard-working farmer does. When he has a 
  rushing stream nearby which may wash away the fields he has tilled, he does 
  not wait for winter. Long beforehand he fences in the banks, builds tip dikes, 
  digs ditches, and makes every preparation against the flood. While the stream 
  runs quietly and is low in its bed, it is a simpler matter to restrain it; 
  when it has become swollen and is swept along with a violent rush of waters, 
  it is no longer so simple to oppose the flood. And so it is that long 
  beforehand the farmer anticipates the surge of the torrent and contrives by 
  every means to keep his fields secure in every way. </P>
  <P>(4) As well as farmers, every soldier, sailor, and reaper makes it a 
  practice to prepare ahead. Before the hour of battle, the soldier cleans off 
  his breastplate, examines his shield, makes ready the bridle and bit, feeds 
  and cares for his horse, and sees to it that he is well prepared in every way. 
  Before the sailor launches his ship into the harbor's waters, he prepares the 
  keel, repairs the sides, hews and shapes the oars, stitches together the 
  sails, and makes ready all the other equipment of his ship. Many days before 
  the harvest, the reaper sharpens his sickle. gets ready the threshing-floor, 
  his oxen, his wagon, and everything else which may help him in the harvest. 
  Indeed you can see men everywhere making preparations for their business 
  beforehand so that, when the time does come, it is an easy matter for them to 
  carry on their enterprise. </P>
  <P>(5) I am following the example of these men. Many days beforehand I am 
  making your souls secure by exhorting&nbsp; you to flee from that accursed and 
  unlawful fast. Do not tell me that the Jews are fasting; prove to me that it 
  is God's will that they fast. If it be not God's will, then their fasting is 
  more unlawful than any drunkenness? For we must not only look at what they do 
  but we must also seek out the reason why they do it. &nbsp; &nbsp; </P>
  <P>(6) What is done in accordance with God's will is the best of all things 
  even if it seems to be bad. What is done contrary to God's will and decree is 
  the worst and most unlawful of all things-even if men judge that it is very 
  good. Suppose someone slays another in accordance with God's will. This 
  slaying is better than any loving-kindness. Let someone spare another and show 
  him great love and kindness against God's decree. To spare the other's life 
  would be more unholy than any slaying. For it is God's will and not the nature 
  of things that makes the same actions good or bad. </P>
  <P>II</P>
  <P>Listen to me so that you may learn that this is true. Ahab once captured a 
  king of Syria and, contrary to God's decree, saved his life. He had the Syrian 
  king enjoy a seat by his side and sent him off with great honor. About that 
  time a prophet came to his companion and "said to him: 'In the word of the 
  Lord, strike me.' But his companion was not willing to strike him. And the 
  prophet said to him: 'Because you would not hearken to the word of the Lord, 
  behold, you will depart from me and a lion will strike you.' And he departed 
  from him, and the lion found him and struck him. Then the prophet found 
  another man and said: 'Strike me.' And the man did strike him and wounded him, 
  and the prophet bandaged up his face." </P>
  <P>(2) What greater paradox than this could there be? The man who struck the 
  prophet was saved; the one who spared the prophet was punished. Why? That you 
  may learn that, when God commands, you must not question too much the nature 
  of the action; you have only to obey. So that the first man might not spare 
  him out of reverence, the prophet did not simply say: "Strike me" but said: 
  "Strike me in the word of God. That is, God commands it; seek no further. It 
  is the King who ordains it; reverence the rank of him who commands and with 
  all eagerness heed his word. But the man lacked the courage to strike him and, 
  on this account, he paid the ultimate penalty. But by the punishment he 
  subsequently suffered, he encourages us to yield and obey God's every command. 
  </P>
  <P>(3) But after the second man had struck and wounded him, the prophet bound 
  his own head with a bandage, covered his eyes, and disguised himself. Wily did 
  he do this? He was going to accuse the king and condemn him for saving the 
  life of the king of the Syrians. Is Now Ahab was an impious man and always a 
  foe to the prophets. The prophet did not wish Ahab to recognize him and then 
  drive him from his sight; if the king drove him away, he would not hear the 
  prophet's words of correction. So the prophet concealed his face and any 
  statement of his business in the hope that this would give him the advantage 
  when he did speak and that he might get the king to agree to the terms he 
  wanted. </P>
  <P>(4) "When the king was passing by, the prophet called aloud to him and 
  said: 'Your servant went forth to the campaign of war. Behold, a man brought 
  another man to me and said to me: "Guard this man for me. If he shall leap 
  away and bound off, it will be your life for his life, or you will pay a 
  talent of silver." And it happened that as your servant turned his eyes this 
  way and that, the man was not there.' And the king of Israel said to him: 
  'This is your judgment before me: You slew the man.' And the prophet hurried 
  to take the bandage from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized that he 
  was one of the sons of the prophets. And he said to the king: 'So says the 
  Lord: "Because you let go from your hand a man worthy of death, it will be 
  your life for his life, and your people for his people.' .... </P>
  <P>(5) Do you see how not only God but men make this kind of judgment because 
  both God and men heed the end and the causes rather than the nature of what is 
  done? Certainly even the king said to him: "This is your judgment before me: 
  you slew the man." You are a murderer, he said, because you let an enemy go. 
  The prophet put on the bandage and presented the case as if it were not the 
  king but somebody else on trial, so that the king might pass the proper 
  sentence. And, in fact, this did happen. For after the king condemned him, the 
  prophet tore off the bandage and said: "Because you let go from your hand a 
  man worthy of death, it will be your life for his life, and your people for 
  his people." </P>
  <P>(6) Did you see what a penalty the king paid for his act of kindness? And 
  what punishment he endured in return for his untimely sparing of his foe? The 
  one who spared a life is punished; another, who slew a man, was held in 
  esteem. Phinehas certainly slew two people in a single moment of time-a man 
  and his wife; and after he slew them, he was given the honor of the 
  priesthood. His act of bloodshed did not defile his hands; it even made them 
  cleaner. </P>
  <P>(7) So you see that he who struck the prophet goes free, while he who 
  refused to strike him perishes; you see that he who spared a man's life is 
  punished, while he who refused to spare a life is held in esteem. Therefore, 
  always look into the decrees of God before you consider the nature of your own 
  actions. Whenever you find something which accords with His decree, approve 
  that-and only that. </P>
  <P>III </P>
  <P>Let us examine the matter of fasting and apply this rule to it. Suppose we 
  should not apply this rule but merely take the act of fasting and consider it 
  with no reference to anything else. The result will be great tumult and 
  confusion. It is true that highwaymen, grave-robbers, and sorcerers have their 
  sides torn to pieces; it is also true that the martyrs undergo this same 
  suffering. What is done is the same, but the purpose and reason why it is done 
  is different. And so it is that there is a great difference between the 
  criminals and martyrs. </P>
  <P>(2) In these cases we not only consider the torture but we first look for 
  the intention and the reasons why the torture is inflicted. And this is why we 
  love the martyrs-not because they are tortured but because they are tortured 
  for the sake of Christ. But we turn our backs on the robbers-not because they 
  are being punished but because they are being punished for their wickedness. 
  </P>
  <P>(3) So, too, in the matter of fasting, you must pass a judgment. If you see 
  people fasting for the sake of God, approve what they do; if you see that they 
  do this against God's will, turn your back on them and hate them more than you 
  do those who drink, revel, and carouse. And in the case of this fasting we 
  must inquire not only into the reason for fasting but we must consider also 
  the place and the time. </P>
  <P>(4) But before I draw up my battle line against the Jews, I will be glad to 
  talk to those who are members of our own body, those who seem to belong to our 
  ranks although they observe the Jewish rites and make every effort to defend 
  them. Because they do this, as I see it, they deserve a stronger condemnation 
  than any Jew. Not only the wise and intelligent but even those with little 
  reason and understanding would agree with me in this. I need no clever 
  arguments, no rhetorical devices, no prolix periodic sentences to prove this. 
  It is enough to ask them a few simple questions and then trap them by their 
  answers. </P>
  <P>(5) What, then, are the questions? I will ask each one who is sick with 
  this disease: Are you a Christian? Why, then, this zeal for Jewish practices? 
  Are you a Jew? Why then, are you making trouble for the Church? Does not a 
  Persian side with the Persians? Is not a barbarian eager for what concerns the 
  barbarians? Will a man who lives in the Roman empire not follow our laws and 
  way of life? Tell me this. If ever anyone living among us is caught in 
  collusion siding with the barbarians, is he not immediately punished? He is 
  given neither hearing nor examination, even if he has ten thousand arguments 
  in his own defense. If ever anyone living among the barbarians is clearly 
  following Roman custom and law, again, will he not suffer the same punishment? 
  How, then, do you expect to be saved by defecting to that unlawful way of 
  life? </P>
  <P>(6) The difference between the Jews and us in not a small one, is it? Is 
  the dispute between us over ordinary, everyday matters, so that you think the 
  two religions are really one and the same? Why are you mixing what cannot be 
  mixed? They crucified the Christ whom you adore as God. Do you see how great 
  the difference is? How is it, then, that you keep running to those who slew 
  Christ when you say that you worship him whom they crucified? You do not 
  think, do you, that I am the one who brings up the law on which these charges 
  are based, nor that I make up the form which the accusation takes? Does not 
  the Scripture treat the Jews in this way? </P>
  <P>(7) Hear what Jeremiah says against those same Jews: "Go off to Kedar and 
  see; send off to the islands of the Kittim and find out if such things have 
  happened. What things? "If the gentiles will change their gods, and indeed 
  they are not gods, but you have changed your glory and from it you will derive 
  no profit." He did not say: "You have changed your God," but, "your glory." 
  What he means is this. Those who worship idols and serve demons are so 
  unshaken in their errors that they choose not to abandon them nor desert them 
  for the truth. But you, who worship the true God, have cast aside the religion 
  of your fathers and have gone over to strange ways of worship. You did not 
  show the same firmness in regard to the truth that they did in regard to their 
  error. That is why Jeremiah says: "Find out if such things have happened, if 
  the gentiles will change their gods, and indeed they are not gods; but you 
  have changed your glory and from it you will derive no profit." He did not 
  say: "You have changed your God," for God does not change. But he did say: 
  "You have changed your glory." You did no harm to me, God says, because no 
  harm has come to me. But you did dishonor yourselves. You did not make my 
  glory less, but you did diminish your own. </P>
  <P>(8) Let me also say this to those who are our own-if I must call our own 
  those who side with the Jews. Go to the synagogues and see if the Jews have 
  changed their fast; see if they kept the pre-Paschal fast with us; see if they 
  have taken food on that day. But theirs is not a fast; it is a transgression 
  of the law, it is a sin, it is trespassing. Yet they did not change. But you 
  did change your glory and from it you will derive no profit; you did go over 
  to their rites. </P>
  <P>(9) Did the Jews ever observe our pre-Paschal fast? Did they ever join us 
  in keeping the feast of the martyrs? Did they ever share with us the day of 
  the Epiphanies? They do not run to the truth, but you rush to transgression. I 
  call it a transgression because their observances do not occur at the proper 
  time. Once there was a proper time when they had to follow those observances, 
  but now there is not. That is why what was once according to the Law is now 
  opposed to it. </P>
  <P>IV </P>
  <P>Let me say what Elijah said against the Jews. He saw the unholy life the 
  Jews were living: at one time they paid heed to God, at another they 
  worshipped idols. So he spoke some such words as these: "How long will you 
  limp on both legs? If the Lord our God is with you, come, follow Him; but if 
  Baal, then follow him." Let me, too, now say this against these Judaizing 
  Christians. If you judge that Judaism is the true religion, why are you 
  causing trouble to the Church? But if Christianity is the true faith, as it 
  really is, stay in it and follow it. Tell me this. Do you share with us in the 
  mysteries, do you worship Christ as a Christian, do you ask him for blessings, 
  and do you then celebrate the festival with his foes? With what purpose, then, 
  do you come to the church? </P>
  <P>(2) I have said enough against those who say they are on our side but are 
  eager to follow the Jewish rites. Since it is against the Jews that I wish to 
  draw up my battle line, let me extend my instruction further. Let me show 
  that, by fasting now, the Jews dishonor the law and trample underfoot God's 
  commands because they are always doing everything contrary to his decrees. 
  When God wished them to fast, they got fat and flabby? When God does not wish 
  them to fast, they get obstinate and do fast; when he wished them to offer 
  sacrifices. they rushed off to idols; when he does not wish them to celebrate 
  the feast days, they are all eager to observe them. </P>
  <P>(3) This is why Stephen said to them: "You always oppose the Holy Spirit." 
  This is the one thing, he says, in which you show your zeal: in doing the 
  opposite to what God has commanded. And they are still doing that today. What 
  makes this clear? The Law itself. In the case of the Jewish festivals the Law 
  demanded observance not only of the tune but also the place. In speaking about 
  this feast of the Passover, the Law says to them something such as this: "You 
  will not be able to keep the Passover in any of the cities which the Lord your 
  God gives to you." The Law bids them keep the feast on the fourteenth day of 
  the first month and in the city of Jerusalem. The Law also narrowed down the 
  time and place for the observance of Pentecost, when it commanded them to 
  celebrate the feast after seven weeks, and again, when it stated: "In the 
  place which the Lord your God chooses." So also the Law fixed the feast of 
  Tabernacles. </P>
  <P>(4) Now let us see which of the two, time or place, is more necessary, even 
  though neither the one nor the other has the power to save. Must we scorn the 
  place but observe the time? Or should we scorn the time and keep the place? 
  What I mean is something such as this. The Law commanded that the Passover be 
  held in the first month and in Jerusalem, at a prescribed time and in a 
  prescribed place. Let us suppose that there are two men keeping the Passover. 
  Suppose one of them neglects the place but observes the time; suppose the 
  other observes the place but neglects the time. Let the one who observes the 
  time but neglects the place celebrate the Passover in the first month, but far 
  away from Jerusalem; and let the one who observes the place but neglects the 
  time celebrate the feast in Jerusalem but in the second month instead of the 
  first. </P>
  <P>(5) Next, let us see which of these two is charged and accused, and which 
  receives approval and esteem. Will it be the one who transgressed in the 
  matter of time but observed the place, or the one who neglected the place but 
  observed the time? If the man who transgressed about the time so as to 
  celebrate the feast in Jerusalem clearly deserves esteem, but the one who 
  observed the time while neglecting the place deserves to be charged and 
  accused for his impious action it is quite obvious that those who do not keep 
  the Passover in the proper place are transgressing the Law, even if they 
  maintain a thousand times over that they are observing the proper time. </P>
  <P>(6) Who will make this clear to us? Moses himself. As he tells it, even 
  after some men had observed the Passover outside Jerusalem, "they came up to 
  Moses and said: 'We are unclean through touching the body of a dead man. We 
  should not fail to offer the Lord's offering at its proper time among the sons 
  of Israel, should we'?.' And Moses said to them: 'Stay here and I shall listen 
  to what the Lord will command in your regard.' And the Lord spoke to Moses and 
  said: 'Speak to the sons of Israel and say: "If any man be unclean through the 
  body of a dead man, or if he be afar off oil a journey, whether he be one of 
  you or of your descendants, he shall keep the Pasch in the second month.' .... 
  </P>
  <P>(7) He means something such as this. If anyone be away from home in the 
  first month. let him not keep the Passover outside the city: but let him 
  return to Jerusalem and keep it in the second month. Let him disregard the 
  time so as not to fail in the matter of the city. In this way he shows that 
  observance of the place is more necessary than observance of the time. </P>
  <P>(8) But what could the Jews say if they observe the Passover outside the 
  city of Jerusalem? Since they transgress in the more necessary matter of 
  place, their observance in the less important matter of time cannot be urged 
  in their defense. The result is that they are guilty of the worst 
  transgression of the Law, even if it is obvious a thousand times over that 
  they are not neglecting the matter of time. </P>
  <P>(9) This is certain not only from what I have said but also from the 
  prophets. What excuse would the Jews of today have when it is clear that the 
  Jews of old never offered sacrifice, nor sang hymns in an alien land, nor did 
  they observe any such fasts as they do today? To be sure, the Jews of old were 
  expecting to recover the way of life in which they could observe these 
  rituals. Therefore, they remained obedient to the Law and did what it 
  commanded, for the Law told them to expect this. But the Jews of today have no 
  hope of recovering their forefathers' way of life. In what prophet can they 
  find proof that they will? They have no hope, but they cannot bear to give up 
  these practices. And yet, even if they were expecting to recover the old way 
  of life, even so they ought to be imitating those holy men of old by neither 
  fasting nor observing any other such ritual. </P>
  <P>V </P>
  <P>To prove to you that the Jews in exile observed none of these rituals, hear 
  what they said to those who asked them to do so. For their barbarian captors 
  were urging them by force and demand to play their musical instruments. "Sing 
  to us a hymn of the Lord," they said. But the Jews clearly understood that the 
  Law commanded them not to do so. Therefore, they said: "How shall we sing the 
  song of the Lord in a strange land?" And, again, the three boys who were 
  captives in Babylon said; "At this time we have no prince or prophet nor place 
  to offer sacrifice in your sight and find mercy." Certainly there was much 
  room for a place of sacrifice in the country, but since the temple was not 
  there, they steadfastly refrained from offering sacrifice. </P>
  <P>(2) And again God spoke to his people through the lips of Zechariah: "For 
  these seventy years you have not kept a fast for me, have you? He was speaking 
  of the captivity. Tell me. By what right, then, do you Jews fast today, when 
  your ancestors neither offered sacrifices, nor fasted, nor kept the feasts? 
  And this makes it especially clear that they did not observe the Passover. 
  Where there was no sacrifice, there no festival was held, because all the 
  feasts had to be celebrated with a sacrifice. </P>
  <P>(3) Let me provide proof for this very point. Listen to the words of 
  Daniel: "In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three weeks. I ate not 
  desirable bread, and neither flesh nor wine entered my mouth, nor did I anoint 
  myself with ointment in those weeks. And it came to pass on the twenty-fourth 
  day of the first month that I saw the vision. Pay careful heed to me here, for 
  this text makes it clear that they did not observe the Passover. Let me tell 
  you how this is. The Jews were not permitted to fast during the days of the 
  feast of unleavened bread. But for twenty-one days Daniel took no food at all. 
  And what proves that the twenty-one days included the days of the feast of 
  unleavened bread? We learn this from what he said, namely, that it was on the 
  twenty-fourth day of the first month. </P>
  <P>(4) But the Passover comes to an end on the twenty-first of that month. If 
  they began the feast on the fourteenth day of the first month and then 
  continued it for seven days, they then come to the twenty-first. Nonetheless, 
  Daniel steadfastly continued his fast even after the Passover had come and 
  gone. For if Daniel had begun his fast on the third day of the first month and 
  then continued through a full twenty-one days, he passed the fourteenth, went 
  on for seven days after that, and then kept fasting for three more days. </P>
  <P>(5) How, then, do the Jews of today avoid being cursed and defiled? The 
  holy ones of old followed no such observances of what the Law prescribed, 
  because they were in a strange land. Are today's Jews doing just the opposite 
  so that they may stir up contentiousness and strife? If some of the holy ones 
  of old who spoke and acted tiffs way were lax and irreverent, perhaps we would 
  have considered their failure to observe these precepts as a sign of their 
  laxity. But they loved and revered God, they gave their very lives for what 
  God had decreed. So it is abundantly clear that failure to keep the Law was 
  not the result of their laxity. Rather, their failure to keep the Law was 
  prompted by the Law itself, because the Law said they must not observe those 
  rituals outside Jerusalem. </P>
  <P>(6) This brings us to a conclusion on another matter of great importance. 
  The observances regarding sacrifices, Sabbaths, new moons, and all such things 
  prescribed by the Jewish way of life of that day were not essential. Even when 
  they were observed they could make no great contribution to virtue; when 
  neglected they could not make the excellent man worthless, nor degrade in any 
  way the sanctity of his soul. But those men of old, while still on earth, 
  manifested by their piety a way of life that rivals the way the angels live. 
  Yet they followed none of these observances, they slew no beasts in sacrifice, 
  they kept no feast, they made no display of fasting. But they were so pleasing 
  to God that they surpassed this human nature of ours and, by the lives they 
  lived, they drew the whole world to a knowledge of God. </P>
  <P>(7) Who could match a Daniel? Who could match the three boys in Babylon? 
  Did they not anticipate the greatest commandment which the Gospels give, the 
  commandment which is the chief source of all blessings? Had they not already 
  proved this by their deeds? For John says: "Greater love than this no one has, 
  that one lay down his life of his friends. But they laid down their lives for 
  God.</P>
  <P>(8) We must admire them for this. But we must also admire them because they 
  were not doing it for any reward. This is why the boys in Babylon said: "There 
  is a God in heaven, and he can save us; but if lie will not, be it known, O 
  king, that we will not worship your gods." The prophet means: The reward is 
  sufficient for us that we are dying for God. And they gave proof of this great 
  virtue even though they were observing none of the Law's prescriptions. </P>
  <P>VI </P>
  <P>You Jews will say: "Why, then, did God impose these prescriptions if he did 
  not wish them observed?" And I say to you: If he wished them observed, why, 
  then, did he destroy your city? God had to do one or the other of two things 
  if he wished these prescriptions to remain ill force: either he had to command 
  you not to sacrifice in one place, since he intended to scatter you to every 
  corner of the world; or, if he wished you to offer sacrifice only ill 
  Jerusalem, he was obliged not to scatter you to every corner of the world and 
  he should have made that one city impregnable, because it was there alone that 
  sacrifice has to be offered. </P>
  <P>(2) Again the Jews will say: "What is this, then? Was God contradicting 
  himself when he ordered the Jews to sacrifice in one place but then barred 
  them from that very place?" By no means! God is very consistent. He did not 
  wish you to offer sacrifices from the beginning, and I bring forward as my 
  witness of this the very prophet who said: "Hear the word of the . . . Lord, 
  you rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah." 
  But it was really to the Jews the prophet spoke, not to those dwelling in 
  Sodom and Gomorrah. Yet he calls the Jews by the names of these people 
  because, by imitating their evil lives, the Jews had developed a kinship with 
  those who dwelt in those cities. </P>
  <P>(3) In fact Isaiah called the Jews dogs and Jeremiah called them mare-mad 
  horses This was not because they suddenly changed natures with those beasts 
  but because they were pursuing the lustful habits of those animals. "'What 
  care I for the number of your sacrifices?' says the Lord. But it is clear that 
  those who dwelt in Sodom never offered sacrifices. Isaiah is aiming his 
  remarks against the Jews when he calls them by the name of those brute 
  animals, and he does so for the reason I just mentioned." 'What care I for the 
  number of your sacrifices' says the Lord 'I am filled up with your holocausts 
  of rams I desire not the fat of sheep, and the blood of bulls, not even if you 
  come to appear before me. For who required all these things from your hands?' 
  Did you hear his voice clearly saying that he did not require these sacrifices 
  from you from the beginning? If he had made sacrifice a necessity, he would 
  also have subjected the first Jews to this way of life and all the patriarchs 
  who flourished before the Jews of Isaiah's day.</P>
  <P>(4) Then the Jews will ask: "How is it that he straightway did permit the 
  Jews to sacrifice?" He was giving in to their weakness. Suppose a physician 
  sees a man who is suffering from fever and finds him in a distressed and 
  impatient mood. Suppose the sick man has his heart set on a drink of cold 
  water and threatens, should he not get it, to find a noose and hang himself, 
  or to hurl himself over a cliff. The physician grants his patient the lesser 
  evil, because he wishes to prevent the greater and to lead the sick man away 
  from a violent death. </P>
  <P>(5) This is what God did. He saw the Jews choking with their mad yearning 
  for sacrifices. He saw that they were ready to go over to idols if they were 
  deprived of sacrifices. I should say, he saw that they were not only ready to 
  go over, but that they lad already done so. So he let them have their 
  sacrifices the time when the permission was granted should make it clear that 
  this is the reason. After they kept the festival in honor of the evil demons, 
  God yielded and permitted sacrifices. What he all but said was this: "You are 
  all eager and avid for sacrifices. If sacrifice you must, then sacrifice to 
  me." But even if he permitted sacrifices, this permission was not to last 
  forever: in the wisdom of his ways, lie took the sacrifices away from them 
  again. </P>
  <P>(6) Let me use the example of the physician again-there is really no reason 
  why I should not. After lie has given into the patient's craving, he gets a 
  drinking cup from his home and gives instructions to the sick man to satisfy 
  his thirst from this cup and no other. When he has gotten his patient to 
  agree, he leaves secret orders with the servants to smash the cup to bits; in 
  this way lie proposes, without arousing the patient's suspicion, to lead him 
  secretly away from the craving on which lie has set his heart. </P>
  <P>(7) This is what God did, too. He let the Jews offer sacrifice but 
  permitted this to be done in Jerusalem and nowhere else in the world. After 
  they had offered sacrifices for a short time, God destroyed the city. Why? The 
  physician saw to it that the cup was broken. By seeing to it that their city 
  was destroyed, God led the Jews away from the practice of sacrifice, though it 
  was against their will. If God were to have come right out and said: "Keep 
  away from sacrifice," they would not have found it easy to keep away from this 
  madness for offering victims. But now, by imposing the necessity of offering 
  sacrifice in Jerusalem, he led them away from this mad practice: and they 
  never noticed what he had done </P>
  <P>(8) Let me make the analogy clear. the physician is God, the cup is the 
  city of Jerusalem, the patient is the implacable Jewish people, the drink of 
  cold water is the permission and authority to offer sacrifices. The physician 
  has the cup destroyed and, in this way, keeps the sick man from what lie 
  demands at an ill-suited time. God destroyed the city itself, made it 
  inaccessible to all, and in this way led the Jews away from sacrifices. If lie 
  did not intend to make ready an end to sacrifice, why did God, who u 
  omnipresent and fills the universe, confine so sacred a ritual to a single 
  place? Why did he confine worship to sacrifices, the sacrifices to a place, 
  the place to a time, and the time to a single city, and then destroy the city? 
  It is indeed a strange and surprising thing. the whole world is left open to 
  the Jews, but&nbsp; they are not permitted to sacrifice there; Jerusalem alone 
  is inaccessible to them, and that is the only place where they are permitted 
  to offer sacrifice. </P>
  <P>(9) Even if a man he completely lacking ill understanding, should it not be 
  clear and obvious to him why Jerusalem was destroyed? Suppose a builder lays 
  the foundation for a house, then raises up the walls, arches over the roof, 
  and binds together the vault of the roof with a single keystone to support it. 
  If the builder removes the keystone, he destroys the bond which holds the 
  entire structure together. This is what God did. He made Jerusalem what we 
  might call the keystone which held together the structure of worship. When he 
  overthrew the city, he destroyed the rest of the entire structure of that way 
  of life. </P>
  <P>VII </P>
  <P>Let then my battle with the Jews wait awhile. I did fight a skirmish of 
  words with them today, but I said only what was enough to save our brothers 
  from danger. Perhaps I said much more than that. But I must now exhort those 
  of you who are here in church to show great concern for the fellow members of 
  our body. I do not want to hear you say: "What concern is this of mine? Why 
  interfere and meddle in other people's affairs?" </P>
  <P>(2) Our Master died for us. Will you not take the trouble to say a single 
  word? What excuse or defense will you find for this? Tell me this. If you look 
  the other way when so many souls are perishing, how will you find the 
  confidence to stand before the judgment seat of Christ.'? I wish I could know 
  which ones are running off to the synagogue. Then I would not have needed your 
  help but I would have straightened them out with all speed. </P>
  <P>(3) Whenever your brother needs correction, even if you must lay down your 
  life, do not refuse him. Follow the example of your Master. If you have a 
  servant or if you have a wife, be very careful to keep them at home. If you 
  refuse to let them go to the theater, you must refuse all the more to let them 
  go to the synagogue. To go to the synagogue is a greater crime than going to 
  the theater. What goes on in the theater is, to be sure, sinful; what goes on 
  in the synagogue is godlessness. When I say this I do not mean that you let 
  them go to the theater, for the theater is wicked; I say it so that you will 
  be all the more careful to keep them away from the synagogue. </P>
  <P>(4) What is it that you are rushing to see in the synagogue of the Jews who 
  fight against God? Tell me, is it to hear the trumpeters? You should stay at 
  home to weep and groan for them, because they are fighting against God's 
  command, and it is the devil who leads them in their revels and dance. As I 
  said before, if there once was a time when God did permit what is against his 
  will, now it is a violation of his law and grounds for punishments beyond 
  number. Long ago, when the Jews did have sacrifices, they did sound their 
  trumpets; now God does not permit them to do this. </P>
  <P>(5) At least listen to the reason why they got the trumpets. God said to 
  Moses: "Make for yourself trumpets of beaten silver. Next God explained how 
  the trumpets were to be used, for he went on to say: "You will sound them over 
  the holocausts, and the sacrifices for your deliverance. </P>
  <P>(6) But where is the altar? Where is the ark? Where is the tabernacle and 
  the holy of holies? Where is file priest? Where are the cherubim of glory? 
  Where is the golden altar of incense? Where is the mercy-seat? Where is the 
  bowl? Where are the drink offerings? Where is the fire sent down from heaven? 
  Did you lose all those and keep only the trumpets? Do you Christians not see 
  that what the Jews are doing is mockery rather than worship? </P>
  <P>(7) I blame the Jews for violating the Law. But I blame you much more for 
  going along with the lawbreakers, not only those of you who run to the 
  synagogues but also those of you who have the power to stop the Judaizers but 
  are unwilling to do so. Do not say to me: "What do I have in common with him? 
  He is a stranger, and I do not know him." I say to you that as long as he is a 
  believer, as long as he shares with you in the same mysteries, as long as he 
  comes to the same church, he is more closely related to you than your own 
  kinsmen and friends. Remember, it is not only those who commit robbery who pay 
  the penalty for their crime; those, too, who could have stopped them but did 
  not, pay the same penalty. Those guilty of impiety are punished, and so, too, 
  are those who could have led them from godless ways but did not, because they 
  were too timid or lazy to be willing to do so. </P>
  <P>(8) To be sure, the man who buried his talent gave it back to his master 
  whole and entire; yet he was punished because he did not make a profit from 
  it. Suppose, then, that you yourself remain pure and free from blame; if you 
  fail to make a profit from your talent, if you fail to bring back to salvation 
  your brother who is perishing, you will suffer the same punishment which he 
  does. </P>
  <P>(9) Is it some great burden I am asking of you, my beloved? Let each one of 
  you bring back for me one of your brothers to salvation. Let each one of you 
  interfere and meddle in your brother's affairs so that we may come to 
  tomorrow's service with great confidence, because we are bringing gifts more 
  valuable than any others, because we are bringing back the souls of those who 
  have wandered away. Even if we must suffer revilement, even if we must be 
  beaten, even if we must endure any other pain whatsoever, let us do everything 
  to win these brothers back. Since these are sick brothers who trample us 
  underfoot, revile us, and rail against us, we are not stung by their insults; 
  we want to see one thing and only one thing: the return to health of him who 
  behaved in this outrageous way. </P>
  <P>(10) Many a time a sick man tears the physician's clothes. But the 
  physician does not let this stop him from trying to cure his patient. It is 
  normal, then, for physicians to show such concern for their patients' bodily 
  health. When so many souls are perishing, is it right for us to slacken our 
  efforts and to think we are suffering no terrible harm, even if our own 
  members are rotting with disease? Paul did not think so. What did he say? "Who 
  is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and I am not on fire?" See to 
  it that you catch this fire. </P>
  <P>(1l) Suppose you see your brother perishing. Even if he reviles you, if he 
  insults you, if lie strikes you, if he threatens to become your foe, if lie 
  menaces you in any other way, show your courage and endure all these insults 
  so that you may win his salvation. If he should become your foe, God will be 
  your friend and will give you in return many great blessings on that day. </P>
  <P>(12) May the prayers of the saints save those who have wandered into error, 
  may you who are faithful be successful in your hunt, may those who have 
  blasphemed God be freed from their ungodliness and come to know Christ, who 
  died for them on the cross, so that all of us may, with one accord and one 
  voice, give glory to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be 
  glory and power together with the Holy Spirit for ever and ever. Amen.</P>
