<p align="center"><b>John Chrysostom, Against the Jews.&nbsp; Homily 2</b></p>
<hr>

<p align="center"><STRONG>HOMILY II</STRONG></p>

  <P>Against those who fast the fast of the Jews and against the Jews 
  themselves. Delivered after the other homily has been given and five days 
  before the Jewish fast.</P>
  <P>THE WICKED AND UNCLEAN FAST of the Jews is now at our doors. Thought it is 
  a fast, do not wonder that I have called it unclean. What is done contrary to 
  God's purpose, be it sacrifice or fast, is the most abominable of all things. 
  Their wicked fast will begin after five days. Ten days ago, or more than ten, 
  I anticipated this and gave an exhortation with the hope it would make your 
  brothers safe. Let no one find fault and say my discourse was untimely because 
  I gave it so many days beforehand. When a fever threatens, or any other 
  disease, physicians anticipate this and with many remedies make safe and 
  secure the body of the man who will be seized by the fever; they hurry to 
  snatch his body from the dangers which threaten it before the patient 
  experiences their onset.</P>
  <P>(2) Since I, too, see that a very serious disease is going to come upon 
  you, long beforehand I gave you solemn warning so that you might apply 
  corrective measures before the evil attacked. This was my reason for not 
  waiting until just before the days of fasting to exhort you. I did not want 
  the lack of time to stop you from hunting out your brothers; I hoped that with 
  the span of many days you might be able to track down with all fearlessness 
  those who are suffering from this disease and restore them to health.</P>
  <P>(3) Men who are going to celebrate a wedding or prepare a sumptuous feast 
  do this same thing. They do not wait for the day itself. Long beforehand they 
  speak with the fishermen and bird hunters so that the brevity of time may 
  present no obstacle to preparing for the banquet. Since I, too, am going to 
  set a banquet before you against the obstinacy of the Jews, I have gotten a 
  head start in talking to you, the fishermen, that you may sweep up your weaker 
  brothers in your nets and bring them to hear what I have to say.</P>
  <P>(4) Those of you who did fish and have your catch securely in your nets, 
  remain steadfast and bind them tight with your words of exhortation. Those of 
  you who have not yet taken this goodly catch have time enough in these five 
  days to trap and overcome your prey. So let us spread out the nets of 
  instruction; like a pack of hunting dogs let us circle about and surround our 
  quarry; let us drive them together from every side and bring them into 
  subjection to the laws of the Church. If you think it is a good idea, let us 
  send to pursue them the best of huntsmen, the blessed Paul, who once shouted 
  aloud and said: "Behold, I, Paul, tell you that if you be circumcised, Christ 
  will be of no advantage to you."</P>
  <P>(5) When wild beasts and savage animals are hiding under a thicket and hear 
  the shout of the hunter, they leap up in fear. The loud clamor drives them 
  from their hiding and, even against their will, the hunter's cry forces them 
  out, and many a time they fall right into the nets. So, too, your brothers are 
  hiding in what I might call the thicket of Judaism. If they hear the shout of 
  Paul, I am sure that they will easily fall into the nets of salvation and will 
  put aside all the error of the Jews. For it is not Paul who spoke, but Christ, 
  who moved Paul's soul. So when you hear him shout and say: "Behold, I, Paul, 
  tell you," consider that only the shout is Paul's; the thought and the 
  teaching are Christ's, who is speaking to Paul from within his heart.</P>
  <P>(6) But someone might say: "Is there so much harm in circumcision that it 
  makes Christ's whole plan of redemption useless? Yes, the harm of circumcision 
  is as great as that, not because of its own but because of your obstinacy. 
  There was a time when the law was useful and necessary, but now it has ceased 
  and is fruitless. If you take it on yourself to be circumcised now, when the 
  time is no longer right, it makes the gift of God useless. It is because you 
  are not willing to come to him that Christ will be of no advantage to you. 
  Suppose someone should be caught in the act of adultery and the foulest crimes 
  and then be thrown into prison. Suppose, next, that judgment was going to be 
  passed against him and that he would be condemned. Suppose that just at that 
  moment a letter should come from the Emperor setting free from any accounting 
  or examination all those detained in prison. If the prisoner should refuse to 
  take advantage of the pardon, remain obstinate and choose to be brought to 
  trial, to give an account, and to undergo punishment, he will not be able 
  thereafter to avail himself of the Emperor's favor. For when he made himself 
  accountable to the court, examination, and sentence, he chose of his own 
  accord to deprive himself of the imperial gift. </P>
  <P>(7) This is what happened in the case of the Jews. Look how it is. All 
  human nature was taken in the foulest evils. "All have sinned," say Paul. They 
  were locked, as it were, in a prison by the curse of their transgression of 
  the Law. The sentence of the judge was going to be passed against them. A 
  letter from the King came down from heaven. Rather, the King himself came. 
  Without examination, without exacting an account, he set all men free from the 
  claims of their sin.</P>
  <P>II</P>
  <P>All, then, who run to Christ are saved by his grace and profit from his 
  gift. But those who wish to find justification from the Law will also fall 
  from grace. They will not be able to enjoy the King's loving-kindness because 
  they are striving to gain salvation by their own efforts; they will draw down 
  on themselves the curse of the Law because from the works of the Law no flesh 
  will find justification. So it is that Paul says: "If you be circumcised, 
  Christ will be of no advantage to you." For the man who strives to gain 
  salvation from the works of the Laws has nothing in common with grace. This is 
  what Paul hinted at when he said: "If out of grace, then not in virtue of 
  works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if out of works, no longer is 
  it grace: otherwise work is no longer work." And again: "If justice be by the 
  Law, then Christ died in vain." And again: "You who are justified in the Law 
  are fallen from grace." You have died to the Law, you have become a corpse; 
  hereafter you are no longer under its yoke, you are no longer subject to its 
  necessity. Why, then, do you strive to make trouble for yourself when it is 
  all to no purpose and in vain?</P>
  <P>(2) When Paul said: "Behold, I, Paul, tell you," why did he add his name? 
  Why did he not simply say: "Behold, I tell you"? He wanted to remind them of 
  the zeal which he had shown with regard to Judaism. What he is saying is this: 
  "If I were a gentile and knew nothing of Jewish matters, perhaps someone would 
  say that, because I had no share in the Jewish plan and dispensation, because 
  I did not know the power of circumcision, I reject it from the dogmas of the 
  Church." This is why he added his name. He wished to remind them of what he 
  had done in behalf of the Law. It is almost as if he were to say: "I do this 
  not thorough hatred of circumcision but in full knowledge of the truth. I, 
  Paul, say this, that Paul who was circumcised on the eighth day, who am an 
  Israelite by birth, a Hebrew of the Hebrews, of the tribe of Benjamin, a 
  Pharisee according to the Law, who zealously persecuted the Church, who 
  entered houses, dragged out men and women, and handed them over into custody. 
  All this could persuade even those who are very stupid that I set down this 
  law not through any hatred nor in ignorance of things Jewish but in full 
  knowledge of the surpassing truth of Christ. "And I testify again to every man 
  who has himself circumcised, that he is bound to observe the Law". </P>
  <P>(3) Why did he not say: "I exhort", or "I command", or "I say"? Why did he 
  say: "I testify? So that he might, by this word, remind us of the future 
  judgment. Where there are witnesses who testify, there also are judgments and 
  sentences. He is frightening his hearer, then, by reminding him of the royal 
  throne and by showing him that those very words will be his witness on that 
  day when each man will give an account of what he has done, what he has said, 
  and what he has heard. The Galatians heard those words in days gone by. Let 
  those who are sick with the Galatians' disease hear them again today. If they 
  are not present, let them hear through you the words that Paul exclaimed and 
  said: "I testify again to every man who has himself circumcised, that he is 
  bound to observe the whole Law. </P>
  <P>(4) Do not tell me that circumcision is just a single command; it is that 
  very command which imposes on you the entire yoke of the Law. When you subject 
  yourself to the rule of the Law in one part, you must also obey its commands 
  in all other things. If you do not fulfill it, you must be punished and draw 
  its curse upon yourself. When a sparrow has fallen into the hunter's net, even 
  if only its foot is caught, all the rest of its body is caught as well. So, 
  too, the man who fulfills a single commandment of the Law, be it circumcision 
  or fasting, through that one commandment, has given the Law full power over 
  himself; as long as he is willing, and if he is willing to obey a part of the 
  Law, he cannot avoid obeying the whole Law.</P>
  <P>(5) We do not say this in accusation of the Law. Heaven forbid! We say it 
  because we wish to show forth the surpassing riches of the grace of Christ. 
  For the Law is not contrary to Christ. How could it be, when he is the one who 
  gave the Law, when the Law leads us to him? But we are forced to say all these 
  things because of the untimely contentiousness of those who do not use the Law 
  as they should. The ones who outrage the Law are those who bid us stand apart 
  from it once and for all and come to Christ, and then tell us to hold fast to 
  it again. The Law has profited our nature very much. I agree to that and would 
  never deny it. But you Judaizers cling to it beyond the proper time and will 
  not let us see how very useful it has been.</P>
  <P>(6) It would be the greatest source of praise for a tutor if his young 
  pupil no longer needed him to keep watch over his conduct because the lad had 
  advanced so greater virtue. So, too, it would be the greatest praise for the 
  Law that we no longer had need of its help. For the Law has brought that very 
  thing to pass for us: it has prepared our soul to receive a greater 
  philosophy.</P>
  <P>(7) So it is that he who still sits at the feet of the Law and can see 
  nothing greater than what is written therein derives no great profit from it. 
  But I put the Law aside and ran to the loftier teachings of Christ; yet I 
  could grant to the Law the greatest dignity because it made me such that I 
  could go beyond the trivialities written therein and rise to the loftiness of 
  the teaching which comes to us from Christ.</P>
  <P>(8) The Law did profit our nature greatly, but only if it led us sincerely 
  to Christ. If this be not the case, it did us harm by depriving us of the 
  greater things because of our close attention to those which are less; it also 
  hurt us by still keeping us in the countless wounds of our transgressions. 
  Suppose there were two physicians, one weaker, the other stronger. If the 
  weaker one applied medicines to the ulcers but could not free the sick man 
  once and for all from the pain coming from his sores, then.......</P>
  <P>III</P>
  <P>"If therefore you are offering your gift at the altar, and there you 
  remember that your brother has anything against you, &gt; leave there your 
  offering before the altar and go first to be reconciled to your brother, and 
  then come and offer your gift". Christ did not say: "Submit your offering and 
  then go away", but "Let it stay there unoffered and go first to be reconciled 
  to your brother".</P>
  <P>(2) Nor did he do this only here but again in another place. If a man has 
  an infidel wife, that is, a gentile, he is not forced to put her away. For St. 
  Paul said: "If any man has an unbelieving wife and she consents to live with 
  him, let him not put her away. But if he has a wife who is a harlot and an 
  adulteress, there is nothing to stop him from putting her away. For Christ 
  said: "Everyone who puts away his wife save on account of immorality, causes 
  her to commit adultery. And so he is allowed to put her away because of 
  immorality.</P>
  <P>(3) Do you see God's loving-kindness and concern? He says: "If your wife be 
  a gentile, do not put her away. But if she be a harlot, I do not stop you from 
  doing so". What he means is this: If she acts outrageously toward Me, do not 
  put her away; if she outrages you, there is no one to stop you from putting 
  her away." If God, then, showed us such honor, will we not deem him deserving 
  of equal honor? Will we let him be outraged by our wives? Will we permit this 
  even though we realize that the greatest punishment and vengeance will be 
  stored up for us when we neglect the salvation of our wives?</P>
  <P>(4) This is why he made you to be head of the wife. This is why Paul gave 
  the order: "If wives wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands 
  at home", so that you, like a teacher, a guardian, a patron, might urge her to 
  godliness. Yet when the hour set for the services summons you to the church, 
  you fail to rouse your wife from their sluggish indifference. But now that the 
  devil summons your wives to the feast of the Trumpets and they turn a ready 
  ear to this call, you do not restrain them. You let them entangle themselves 
  in accusations of ungodliness, you let them be dragged off into licentious 
  ways. For, as a rule, it is the harlots, the effeminates, and the whole chorus 
  from the theater who rush to that festival.</P>
  <P>(5) And why do I speak of the immorality that goes on there? Are you not 
  afraid that your wife may not come back from there after a demon has possessed 
  her soul? Did you not hear in my previous discourse the argument which clearly 
  proved to us that demons dwell in the very souls of the Jews and in places in 
  which they gather? Tell me, then. How do you Judaizers have the boldness, 
  after dancing with demons, to come back to the assembly of the apostles? After 
  you have gone off and shared with those who shed the blood of Christ, how is 
  it that you do not shudder to come back and share in his sacred banquet, to 
  partake of his precious blood? Do you not shiver, are you not afraid when you 
  commit such outrages? Have you so little respect for that very banquet?</P>
  <P>(6) I have spoken these words to you. You will speak them to those 
  Judaizers, and they to their wives. "Fortify one another". If a catechumen is 
  sick with this disease, let him be kept outside the church doors. If the sick 
  one be a believer and already initiated, let him be driven from the holy 
  table. For not all sins need exhortation and counsel; some sins, of their very 
  nature, demand cure by a quick and sharp excision. The wounds we can tolerate 
  respond to more gentle cures; those which have festered and cannot be cured, 
  those which are feeding on the rest of the body, need cauterization with a 
  point of steel. So is it with sins. Some need long exhortation; others need 
  sharp rebuke.</P>
  <P>(7) This is why Paul did not enjoin us to exhort in every case but also to 
  rebuke sharply: "Wherefore rebuke them sharply". Therefore, I will now rebuke 
  them sharply, so that they may accuse themselves and feel shame for what they 
  have done. Then they will never again be hurt by that sinful fast.</P>
  <P>(8) So I shall put aside exhortation henceforth as I testify and exclaim: 
  "If any man does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let a curse be upon him". 
  What greater evidence could there be that a man does not love our Lord than 
  when he participates in the festival with those who slew Christ? It was not I 
  who hurled the curse at them, but Paul. Rather, it was not Paul but Christ, 
  who spoke through him and said earlier: "Those who are justified in the law 
  have fallen away from grace".</P>
  <P>(9) So speak these words to them, read aloud to them these texts. Show all 
  your zeal in saving them. When you have snatched them from the devil's jaws, 
  bring them to me on the day of the Jewish fast. Then, after I have kept the 
  rest of my promise to you, let us, with one accord and with one voice, join 
  our brothers in giving glory to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
  for to Him is glory forever. Amen.</P>
