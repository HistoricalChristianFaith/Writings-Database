<STRONG>HOMILY III</STRONG>
  <P>Against those who keep the first Paschal Fast </P>
  <P>ONCE AGAIN A NECESSARY and pressing need has interrupted the sequence of my 
  recent discourses. I must put aside my struggles with the heretics for today 
  and turn my attention to this necessary business. For I was ready to address 
  your loving assembly again on the glory of the only-begotten Son of God. But 
  the untimely obstinacy of those who wish to keep the first paschal fast forces 
  me to devote my entire instruction to their cure. For the good shepherd does 
  more than drive away the wolves; he also is most diligent in caring for his 
  sheep who are sick. What does he gain if the flocks escape the jaws of the 
  wild beasts but are then devoured by disease? </P>
  <P>(2) The best general is the one who not only repels the siege engines of 
  the enemy but first puts down rebellion within his own city. He knows well 
  that there will be no victory over an outside foe as long as there is civil 
  war within. Do you not know that there is no more destructive force than 
  rebellion and obstinacy? Listen to the words of Christ: "A kingdom divided 
  against itself shall not stand." And yet, what is more powerful than a kingdom 
  which possesses revenues of money, weapons, walls, fortresses, so large a 
  number of soldiers, horses, and ten thousand other sources of strength? </P>
  <P>(3) But even power as great as that is destroyed when it revolts against 
  itself. Nothing produces weakness so effectively as contentiousness and 
  strife; and nothing produces power and strength so effectively as love and 
  concord. When Solomon grasped this truth he said: "A brother that is helped by 
  his brother is like a strong city and kingdom bolted and barred." Do you see 
  the great strength which comes from concord? And do you see the great harm 
  caused by contentiousness? A kingdom in revolt destroys itself. When two 
  brothers are bound together and united into one, they are more unbreakable 
  than any wall. </P>
  <P>(4) I know that, by God's grace, most members of my flock are free from 
  this disease and that the sickness involves only a few. But this is no reason 
  for me to relax my care. If only ten, or five, or two, or even one were sick, 
  he must not be neglected. If there is only one worthless outcast. still he is 
  a brother, and Christ died for him. And Christ made great account of the weak 
  ones. He said: "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to 
  sin, it were better for him to have a great millstone hung around his neck, 
  and to be drowned in the sea." And again: "As long as you did not do it for 
  one of these little ones, you did not do it for me." And again: "It is not the 
  will of your Father in heaven that a single one of these little ones should 
  perish."</P>
  <P>(5) Is it not absurd, when Christ shows such care for his little ones, that 
  we should refuse to care for them? Do not say: "He is one person." Rather, you 
  must say: "He is one, yes, but if we do not take care of him, he will spread 
  the disease to the rest." Paul said: "A little leaven ferments the whole 
  mass." And our neglect of the little ones is what overturns and destroys 
  everything. Neglected wounds become serious, just as the serious wounds would 
  easily become minor if they receive the proper care. </P>
  <P>(6) Moreover, the first thing I have to say to the Judaizers is that 
  nothing is worse than contentiousness and fighting, than tearing the Church 
  asunder and rending into many parts the robe which the robbers did not dare to 
  rip. Are not all the other heresies enough without our tearing each other 
  apart? You must listen to Paul when he says: "But if you bite and devour one 
  another, take heed or you will be consumed by one another."</P>
  <P>(7) Tell me this. Do you stray outside the flock and have you no fear of 
  the lion that prowls about outside the fold? "For your enemy, like a lion, 
  goes about seeking whom he may seize." Here you see a shepherd's wisdom. He 
  does not let the lion in among the sheep for fear the lion may terrify the 
  flock. Nor does he drive the lion away from outside the fold. Why? So that he 
  may gather all the sheep together inside the fold, because they are afraid of 
  the wild beast outside. Do you have no reverence and respect for your father? 
  Then fear your foe. If you separate yourself from the flock, your enemy will 
  surely catch you. </P>
  <P>(8) Christ, too, could have driven the enemy away from the outside of the 
  fold. But to make you sober and watchful, to make you constantly run to your 
  Mother for refuge, he permitted him to roar outside the fold. Why did he do 
  this? So that when those within the fold hear his roar, they may take refuge 
  together and be more closely bound to one another. Mothers who love their 
  children also do this: when their children cry, they often threaten to throw 
  them to the jaws of the wolves. Of course, they would not throw them to the 
  wolves but they say they will to stop the children from bothering them. 
  Everything Christ did was done to keep us bound together and living at peace 
  with one another. </P>
  <P>II </P>
  <P>And so it was that Paul could have accused the Corinthians of many great 
  crimes but lie accused them of contentiousness before any other. He could have 
  accused them of fornication, of pride, of taking their quarrels to the pagan 
  courts, of banquets in the shrines of idols. He could have charged that the 
  women did not veil their heads and that the men did. Over and above all tiffs, 
  he could have accused them of neglecting the poor, of the pride they took in 
  their charismatic gifts, and in the matter of the resurrection of the body. 
  But since, along with these, he could also find fault with them because of 
  their dissensions and quarrels with one another, he passed over all the other 
  crimes, and corrected their contentiousness first. </P>
  <P>(2) If you will not think I am making a nuisance of myself on this point, I 
  shall clarify it from Paul's own words. He did give top priority to correcting 
  the Corinthians' obstinacy and contentiousness. And he did this even though he 
  could charge them with all those other crimes. Hear what he says about their 
  fornication: "It is actually reported that there is lewd conduct among you." 
  That they were puffed up and proud: "As if I were not coming to you, some are 
  puffed up." Again, that they would plead their cases in the pagan courts: 
  "Dare any of you, having a matter against another, bring your case to be 
  judged before unbelievers?" That they ate meat offered to idols: "You cannot 
  be partakers of the table of the Lord and of the table of devils." Hear his 
  words of reproach for the women who do not veil their heads and the men who 
  do. "Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered, disgraces his 
  head. But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered, 
  disgraces her head. He showed that they neglected the poor when he said: "One 
  is hungry and another drinks overmuch. And again: "or do you despise the 
  church of God and put to shame the needy?" When they were all jumping for the 
  more important charismatic gifts and no one was satisfied with the less 
  important, he said: "Are all apostles? Are all prophets?" We can conclude that 
  they were raising doubts about the resurrection because he says: "But someone 
  will say: 'How do the dead rise? Or with what kind of body do they come?"</P>
  <P>(3) Although he could make so many accusations, his first charge against 
  the Corinthians was dissension and contentiousness. At the very beginning of 
  his letter he said: "I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus 
  Christ, that you all say the same thing, and that there be no dissensions 
  among you." For he knew, he knew clearly, that this problem was more urgent 
  than the others. If the fornicator, or the braggart. or a man in the grip of 
  any other vice comes frequently to the church, he will quickly draw profit 
  from the instruction, thrust aside his sin, and return to health. </P>
  <P>(4) But when a man has broken away from this assembly, when he has 
  withdrawn from the instruction of the fathers, when he has fled from the 
  physician's clinic, even if he appears to be in good health, lie will soon 
  fall sick? The best physicians first quench the fires of fever and then cure 
  the wounds and fractures. That is what Paul did. He first removed the 
  dissension and then cured their wounds limb by limb. And so lie spoke of 
  dissension before the other sins, so that the Corinthians would not stand 
  apart in strife, so that they would not choose the leaders whom they should 
  follow, so that they would not divide up the body of Christ into many parts? 
  </P>
  <P>(5) But he was talking not only to the Corinthians; he was also speaking to 
  those who would come after them and suffer from the same Corinthian disease. I 
  would be glad to ask those of us who are sick with this illness: What is the 
  Pasch; what is Lent? What belongs to the Jews: what belongs to us? Why does 
  their Pasch come once each year; why do we celebrate ours each time we gather 
  to celebrate the mysteries? What does the feast of unleavened bread mean? And 
  I would like to ask them many more questions which contribute to understanding 
  this subject. </P>
  <P>(6) If I were to ask them, you would then clearly know how untimely the 
  contentiousness of these men is. They cannot explain what they do. But they 
  refuse to ask anybody, just as if they were wiser than anybody else. They 
  deserve the strongest condemnation because they do not have the answers 
  themselves, but they refuse to follow those who have been appointed to lead 
  them. They have simply risked all they have on this silly practice and are 
  throwing themselves head first down into the depths of danger. </P>
  <P>III </P>
  <P>When I have this to say against them, what argument of theirs will seem 
  clever? They ask: "Did you not observe this fast before?" It is not your place 
  to say this to me, but I would be justified in telling you that we, too, 
  fasted at this time in earlier days, but still we put more importance on peace 
  than on the observance of dates. And I say to you what Paul said to the 
  Galatians: "Become like me, because I also have become like you." What does 
  this mean? He was urging them to renounce circumcision, to scorn the Sabbath, 
  the feast days, and all the other observances of the Law. When he saw they 
  were frightened and afraid that they might be subjected to chastisement and 
  punishment for their transgression, he gave them courage by the example of his 
  own actions when he said: "Become like me, because I also have become like 
  you." </P>
  <P>(2) For, he said, I did not come from the Gentiles, did l? I was not 
  without experience of the Jewish way of life under the Law and the punishment 
  set for those who transgress it, was I? "I am a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as 
  regards the Law, a Pharisee; as regards zeal, a persecutor of the Church. But 
  the things that were gain to me, these, for the sake of Christ, l counted 
  loss." That is, once and for all I stood aloof from them. Therefore, become 
  like me, for I, too, was as you are. </P>
  <P>(3) But why do I speak on my own account? Three hundred Fathers or even 
  more gathered together in the land of Bithynia and ordained this by law; yet 
  you disdain their decrees. You must choose one of two courses: either you 
  charge them with ignorance for their want of exact knowledge on this matter, 
  or you charge them with cowardice because they were not ignorant, but played 
  the hypocrite and betrayed the truth. When you do not abide by what they 
  decreed, this is exactly the choice you must make. But all the events of the 
  Council make it clear that they showed great wisdom and courage at that time. 
  The article of faith they set forth at the Council show how wise they were, 
  because they blocked up the mouths of heretics and, like an impregnable wall, 
  they repelled the treachery of every hostile attack. They proved their courage 
  during the war waged on the Churches and the persecution which had but lately 
  come to an end.</P>
  <P>(4) Like champions in battle who have set up many memorials of victory and 
  have suffered many wounds, so, too, these champions of the Churches, who could 
  count the many tortures they had endured for their confession of the faith, 
  came together from every side, bearing on their bodies the marks of Christ's 
  wounds. Some could tell of their hardships in the mines, others of the 
  confiscation of all their possessions, and still others of starvation and 
  continuous floggings. Some could show where the flesh had been torn from their 
  ribs, some where their backs had been broken, some where their eyes had been 
  dug out, and still others where they had lost some other part of their bodies 
  for the sake of Christ. At that time the whole synodal gathering, welded 
  together from these champions, along with their definition of what Christians 
  must believe, also passed a decree that they celebrate the paschal feast in 
  harmony together. They refused to betray their faith in those most difficult 
  times [of persecution]; would they sink to pretense and deceit on the question 
  of the Easter observance? </P>
  <P>(5) Look what you do when you condemn Fathers so great, so courageous, so 
  wise. If the Pharisee lost all the blessings he possessed because he condemned 
  the publican, what excuse will you have, what defense will you make for rising 
  up against these great teachers beloved of God, especially since your attack 
  is so unjust and irrational? Did you not hear Christ himself say: "Where two 
  or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them? But 
  if Christ is in their midst where two or three are gathered together, was not 
  his presence all the more pervasive among the more than three hundred Fathers 
  at Nicaea? Christ was present there, it was Christ who formulated and passed 
  the laws. Yet you condemn not only the Council Fathers but the whole world 
  which approved their judgment. </P>
  <P>(6) Do you consider that the Jews are wiser than the Fathers who came from 
  everywhere in the world? How can you do that when the Jews have been driven 
  from their ancestral commonwealth and way of life and have no sacred festival 
  to celebrate? I hear many say that the Pasch and the feast of unleavened bread 
  are one. But there is no feast of unleavened bread among them, nor is there a 
  Pasch. Why is there no feast of unleavened bread among them? Hear the words of 
  the Lawgiver: "You may not sacrifice the Passover in any one of the cities 
  which the Lord your God gives you, but only in the place in which His name 
  shall be invoked." And Moses was here speaking of Jerusalem.</P>
  <P>(7) Do you see how God confined the festival to one city, and later 
  destroyed the city so that, even if it was against their wills, he might lead 
  them away from that way of life? Surely, it is clear to everybody that God 
  foresaw what would come to pass. Why, then, did he bring them together to that 
  land from all over the world if he foresaw that their city would be destroyed? 
  Is it not very obvious that he did this because he wished to bring their 
  ritual to an end? God did bring the ritual to an end, but you go along with 
  the Jews, of whom the prophet said: "Who is blind but my children, or deaf but 
  those who lord it over them?"</P>
  <P>(8) And against whom did they show their want of sense and feeling? Was it 
  not against the apostles, the prophets, and their teachers? Why must I mention 
  teachers and prophets when they slaughtered their own children? For they did 
  sacrifice their sons and daughters to demons. When they ignored the voice of 
  nature, were they going to observe the festival days? Tell me this. Did they 
  not trample kinship under foot, did they not forget their children, did they 
  not forget the very God who created them? Moses said: "You have forsaken the 
  God that begot you, and have forgotten the God that nurtured you." Were they 
  going to keep the festivals after they had forsaken God? Who could say that? 
  </P>
  <P>(9) Christ did keep the Pasch with them. Yet he did not do so with the idea 
  that we should keep the Pasch with them. He did so that he might bring the 
  reality to what foreshadowed the reality. He also submitted to circumcision, 
  kept the Sabbath, observed the festival days, and ate the unleavened bread. 
  But He did all these things in Jerusalem. However, we are subject to none of 
  these things, and on this Paul spoke out loud and clear: "If you be 
  circumcised, Christ shall be of no advantage to you." And again, speaking of 
  the feast of unleavened bread, he said: "Therefore let us keep festival, not 
  with the old leaven, not with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with 
  the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth." For our unleavened bread is not 
  a mixed flour but an uncorrupted and virtuous way of life. </P>
  <P>IV </P>
  <P>Why did Christ keep the Pasch at that time? The old Pasch was a type of the 
  Pasch to come, and the reality had to supplant the type. So Christ first 
  showed the foreshadowing and then brought the reality to the banquet table. 
  Once the reality has come, the type which foreshadowed it is henceforth lost 
  in its own shadow and no longer fills the need. So do not keep pleading this 
  excuse, but show me that Christ did command us to observe the old Pasch. I am 
  showing you quite the opposite. I am showing you that Christ not only did not 
  command us to keep the festival days but even freed us from the obligation to 
  do so. </P>
  <P>(2) Hear what Paul had to say. And when I speak of Paul, I mean Christ; for 
  it is Christ who moved Paul's soul to speak. What, then, did Paul say? "You 
  are observing days, and months, and seasons, and years. I fear for you, lest 
  perhaps I have labored in vain among you." And again: "As often as you shall 
  eat this bread and drink this cup, you shall proclaim the death of the Lord." 
  When he said: "As often as," Paul gave the right and power to decide this to 
  those who approach the mysteries, and freed them from any obligation to 
  observe the festival days. </P>
  <P>(3) Now our Pasch and Lent are not one and the same thing: the Pasch is one 
  thing, Lent another. Lent comes once each year; our Pasch is celebrated three 
  times each week, sometimes even four times, or rather as often as we wish. For 
  the Pasch is not a fast but the offering and sacrifice which is celebrated at 
  each religions service That you may know that this is true, listen to Paul 
  when he says: "For Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed," and again: "As 
  often as you shall eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of 
  the Lord.</P>
  <P>(4) So as often as you approach the sacrificial banquet with a clean 
  conscience, you celebrate the Pasch. You celebrate it not when you fast but 
  when you share in that sacrifice. "For as often as you shall eat this bread 
  and drink this cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord." Our Pasch is the 
  proclamation of the Lord's death. The sacrifice which we offer today, that 
  which was offered yesterday, and each day's sacrifice is alike and the same as 
  the sacrifice offered on that Sabbath day; the sacrifice offered on that 
  Sabbath is no more solemn than today's, nor is today's of less value than 
  that; they are one and the same, alike filled with awe and salvation. </P>
  <P>(5) Why, then, do we fast for forty days? In the past, and especially at 
  the time when Christ entrusted to us these sacred mysteries, many a man 
  approached the sacrificial banquet without thought or preparation. Since the 
  Fathers realized that it was harmful for a person to approach the mysteries in 
  this heedless fashion, they came together and marked out forty days for people 
  to fast, pray, and gather together to hear the word of God. Their purpose was 
  that we might all scrupulously purify ourselves during tiffs time by our 
  prayers. almsgiving, fasting, vigils tears, confessions, and all the other 
  pious practices. so that we might approach the mysteries with our consciences 
  made as clean as we could make them. </P>
  <P>(6) And they did well when they came to our aid and established for us the 
  practice of this Lenten fast. This is clear because, if we keep shouting and 
  proclaiming a fast the whole year through, no one listens to what we say. But 
  as soon as the season of Lent draws near, even the laziest of men rouses 
  himself, even though no one counsels or advises him. Why? He gets advice and 
  counsel from the season of Lent. </P>
  <P>(7) So if a Jew or pagan ask you why you are fasting, do not tell him that 
  it is because of the Pasch or because of the mystery of the cross. If you tell 
  him that, you give him an ample grip upon you. Tell him we fast because of our 
  sins and because we are going to approach the mysteries. The Pasch is not a 
  reason for fasting or grief; it is a reason for cheerfulness and joy. The 
  cross has taken away sin; it was an expiation for the world. a reconciliation 
  for the ancient enmity. It opened the gates of heaven, changed those who hated 
  into friends; it took our human nature, led it up to heaven, and seated it at 
  the right hand of God's throne. And it brought to us ten thousand other 
  blessings. </P>
  <P>(8) There is no need, then, to grieve or be downcast: we must rejoice and 
  glory in all these things. This is why Paul said: "But God forbid that I 
  should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." And again: "But God 
  commends his charity towards us, because when as yet we were sinners, Christ 
  died for us." John put it like this: "God so loved the world. Tell me, how did 
  God love the world? John passed over all the other signs of God's love and put 
  the cross in first place. For after he said: "God so loved the world," he 
  said: "That he gave his only-begotten Son," that he be crucified, "that those 
  who believe in him may not perish but may have life everlasting." If, then, 
  the cross is the basis and boast of love, let us not say that it is a cause 
  for grief. Heaven forbid that we grieve because of the cross. We grieve for 
  our sins, and this is why we fast. </P>
  <P>V</P>
  <P>Although the catechumen keeps the fast each year, lie does not celebrate 
  the Pasch since he does not share in the sacrifice. But even though a man is 
  not observing the Lenten fast, he does celebrate the Pasch as long as lie 
  comes to the altar with a clean conscience and shares in the sacrifice-whether 
  it be today, tomorrow, or any day whatsoever. The best time to approach the 
  mysteries is determined by the purity of a man's conscience and not by his 
  observance of suitable seasons.</P>
  <P>(2) Yet we do just the opposite. We fail to cleanse our conscience and, 
  even though we are burdened with ten thousand sins, we consider that we have 
  celebrated the Pasch as long as we approach the mysteries on that feast day. 
  But this is certainly not the case. If you approach the altar on the very day 
  of the Sabbath and your conscience be bad, you fail to share in the mysteries 
  and you leave without celebrating the Pasch. But if you wash away your sins 
  and share in the mysteries today, you do celebrate the Pasch in precisely the 
  proper way. </P>
  <P>(3) Therefore you must safeguard this exactness and vigor of spirit, not in 
  the observance of the proper times but in your approach to the altar. Now you 
  would elect to endure all things rather than change this practice. So, too, 
  you must disdain it and choose to do or suffer anything so as not to approach 
  the mysteries when you are burdened with sins. </P>
  <P>(4) Be sure that God takes no account of such observance of special 
  seasons. Hear him as he passes judgment on those at his right hand: "You saw 
  me hungry and gave me to eat; you saw me thirsty and gave me to drink; you saw 
  me naked and you covered me." But he charged with quite different conduct 
  those on his left hand. At another time he brought forward another man in a 
  parable and castigated him because He remembered the evil the man had done. 
  For he said: "You wicked servant, I forgave you all the debt. Should not you 
  then have had compassion also on your fellow servant, even as I had compassion 
  on you?" Again, when the virgins had no oil in their lamps, he locked them out 
  of the bride chamber. And he cast out another man who came into the feast 
  without a wedding garment because this man was garbed in filthy clothes and 
  was wearing the cloak of his fornication and uncleanness, But no one was ever 
  punished or accused because he observed the Pasch in this or that month. </P>
  <P>(5) But why speak of ourselves since we have been set free from all such 
  necessity? We are citizens of a city above in heaven, where there are no 
  months, no sun, no moon, no circle of seasons. If you wish to give exact 
  attention to the matter, you will see that, even among the Jews, little 
  account was made of the season of the Pasch, but they cared greatly about the 
  place for it, namely, Jerusalem. Some men came up to Moses and said to him: 
  "We are unclean through touching the dead body of a man. How shall we avoid 
  failing ill the Lord's offering?" He said to them: "Wait here and let me 
  report it to God." Then, after he reported it, he brought back the law which 
  says: "If any man be unclean through touching a dead body, or be afar on a 
  journey and be unable to keep the Pasch in the first month, he shall keep it 
  in the second." </P>
  <P>(6) And so is not the observance of the time annulled among the Jews so 
  that the Pasch may be observed in Jerusalem? Will you not show greater concern 
  for the harmony of the Church than for the season? So that you may seem to be 
  observing the proper days, will you outrage the common Mother of us all and 
  will you cut asunder the Holy Synod? How could you deserve pardon when you 
  choose to commit sins so enormous for no good reason ? </P>
  <P>(7) But why must I speak of the Jews? No matter how eagerly and earnestly 
  we wish it, it is not altogether possible for us to observe that day on which 
  He was crucified. This will make it clear. Let us suppose the Jews had not 
  sinned, that they were not hard of heart, nor senseless, nor indifferent, nor 
  despisers; suppose they had not fallen from their ancestral way of life but 
  were still carefully observing it. Even if this was the case, we could not, by 
  following in their footsteps, put our finger on the very day on which He was 
  crucified and fulfilled the Pasch. Let me tell how this is the case. When He 
  was crucified it was the first day of the feast of unleavened bread and the 
  day of preparation.</P>
  <P>(8) But it is not possible for both of these to fall always on the same 
  day. This year the first day of the feast of unleavened bread falls on Sunday, 
  and the fast must still last for a whole week; According to this, after 
  Passiontide, after the cross and resurrection have come and gone, we are still 
  fasting. And it has often happened that, after the cross and resurrection, our 
  fast is still being observed because the week is not yet over. This is why no 
  observance of the exact time is possible. </P>
  <P>VI</P>
  <P>Let us not quarrel, let us not say: "After fasting these many years, am I 
  to change now?" Change for that very reason. Since you have been so long 
  severed from the Church, come back now to your Mother. No one says: "After I 
  lived as her enemy so long a time, I am ashamed to be reconciled now." You 
  have grounds for shame if you do not change for the better but persist in your 
  untimely contentiousness. That is what destroyed the Jews. While they always 
  kept looking for the old customs and life, these were stripped from them and 
  they turned to impiety. </P>
  <P>(2) But why do I speak of fasting and the observance of special days? Paul 
  continued to observe the Law and to endure many a toil; he patiently put up 
  with many journeys and hardships; he surpassed all his contemporaries in the 
  exact observance of that way of life. But after he achieved the heights of 
  that life and came to realize that he was doing all this for his own hurt and 
  destruction, he immediately changed. He did not say to himself: "What is this? 
  Am I to lose the reward for this great zeal of mine? Am I to waste all this 
  work?" Rather he was the quicker to change for the very reason that he might 
  continue to suffer that loss. He scorned justification by the Law so that he 
  might receive the justification of faith. And so he loudly proclaimed: "The 
  things that were gain to me I have counted as loss for Christ. And Christ 
  said: "If you offer your gift at the altar, and there you remember that your 
  brother has anything against you, go first and be reconciled to your brother 
  and then come and offer your gift."</P>
  <P>(3) What do you mean? If your brother has something against you, Christ 
  does not permit you to offer your sacrifice until you are reconciled to your 
  brother. When you have the whole Church and so many Fathers against you, do 
  you have the hardihood to dare to approach the divine mysteries before you put 
  aside that unseemly enmity? Since this is the way you feel, how could you 
  celebrate the Pasch? </P>
  <P>(4) I say this not only to those who are sick but also to you who are in 
  good health. When you who are well see how many are sick, you will show them 
  great care and kindness, you will pick them out, gather them together, and 
  bring them back to their Mother. Whatever they say against us, however they 
  jump at us, no matter what else they do to us, we must not grow weary and stop 
  until we win them back. For there is nothing comparable to peace and harmony. 
  </P>
  <P>(5) It is for this reason that, when the Father enters the church, he does 
  not mount to this chair until he has prayed for all of you; when he rises from 
  this chair, he does not begin his instruction until he has first given the 
  peace to all. And when the priests are going to give the blessing, they first 
  pray for peace for you and then begin the blessing.</P>
  <P>(6) And when the deacon bids you to pray all together, he also enjoins you 
  in his prayer to ask for the Angel of Peace, and that everything which 
  concerns you be blessed with peace. As he dismisses you from the assembly, he 
  petitions [peace] for you and says: "Go in peace." And without this peace, it 
  is altogether impossible for us to say or do anything. For peace is our nurse 
  and mother. she is very careful to cherish us and foster us. I am not speaking 
  of what is merely called by the name of peace, nor of the peace which comes 
  from sharing meals together, but of the peace which accords with God, the 
  peace which comes from the harmony sent by the Spirit. Many are now tearing 
  this peace asunder by destroying us and exalting the Jews. These men consider 
  the Jews as more trustworthy teachers than their own Fathers; they believe the 
  account of Christ's passion and death which is given by those who slew Him. 
  What could be more unreasonable than this? </P>
  <P>(7) Do you not see that their Passover is the type, while our Pasch is the 
  truth? Look at the tremendous difference between them. The Passover prevented 
  bodily death: whereas the Pasch quelled God's anger against the whole world; 
  the Passover of old freed the Jews from Egypt, while the Pasch has set us free 
  from idolatry; the Passover drowned the Pharaoh, but the Pasch drowned the 
  devil; after the Passover came Palestine, but after the Pasch will come 
  heaven. </P>
  <P>(8) Why, then, do you sit beside a lamp after the sun has appeared? Why do 
  you wish to nourish yourself on milk when solid food is being given to you? 
  You were nourished with milk so that you might not remain satisfied with milk: 
  the lamp shone for you that it might guide you and lead you by the hand into 
  the light of the sun. Now that the era of more perfect things has come, let us 
  not run back to the former times, let us not observe the days and seasons and 
  years: rather, let us everywhere be careful to follow the Church by paying 
  heed to charity and peace before all things. </P>
  <P>(9) Suppose the Church were to be tripped up and fall. The accurate 
  computation of dates would not succeed in making her slip as much as this 
  division and schism would deserve the blame. But I make no account of the 
  exact date, since God makes no account of it, as I proved when I devoted many 
  discourses to this subject. But the one thing I seek is that we do all things 
  in peace and concord. If we do so, you will not stay home and get drunk while 
  we are fasting with the rest of the people, and the priests are praying 
  together for the whole world. </P>
  <P>(10) Note well that this is of the devil's doing and that it is not a 
  single sin, nor two, nor three, but far more than three. It cuts you off from 
  the flock, it makes you ready to hold so many Fathers in scorn, it hurls you 
  into contentiousness, it thrusts you over to the Jews, and furthermore it 
  makes you a scandal both to your own family and to strangers. How can we blame 
  the Jews for waiting for you in their houses when it is you who go running to 
  them? </P>
  <P>(11) These sins are not the only problem. During those days of the fast 
  great harm could come to you from your failure to take advantage of the 
  Scripture readings, the religious meetings in the church, the blessing, and 
  the prayers said in common. Great harm could come to you while you and your 
  bad conscience are spending tiffs whole time in fear and dread that, like some 
  foreigner or stranger, you may be caught ill your sinful act. And during all 
  this time, in common with the Church, you should be discharging all your 
  religious duties in a spirit of confidence, pleasure, good cheer, and full 
  freedom. </P>
  <P>(12) The Church does not recognize the exact observance of dates. In the 
  beginning the Fathers decided to come together from widely separated places 
  and to flux the Easter date; the Church paid respect to the harmony of their 
  thinking. loved their oneness of mind, and accepted the date they enjoined. My 
  earlier remarks have proved adequately that it is impossible for us or you or 
  any other man to arrive at the exact date of the Lord's day. So let us stop 
  fighting with shadows, let us stop hurting ourselves in the big things while 
  we are indulging our rivalry over the small. </P>
  <P>(13) Fasting at tiffs or that time is not a matter for blame. But to rend 
  asunder the Church, to be ready for rivalry, to create dissension, to rob 
  oneself continuously of the benefits of religious meetings-these are 
  unpardonable, these do demand an accounting, these do deserve serious 
  punishment. </P>
  <P>(14) I could have said much more than this. What I have said is enough for 
  those who heed me; those who fail to heed my words will not be helped even if 
  I should have much more to say. So let me finish my discourse at this point. 
  and let us all pray together that our brothers come back to us. Let us pray 
  that they cling fondly to peace and stand apart from untimely rivalry. Let us 
  pray that they scorn this sluggish spirit of theirs and find a great and lofty 
  understanding. Let us pray that they be set free from this observance of days 
  so that all of us, with one heart and with one voice, may give glory to God 
  and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and power now and 
  forever, world without end. Amen. &nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
