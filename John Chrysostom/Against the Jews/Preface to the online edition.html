<p align="center"><b>John Chrysostom, Against the Jews.&nbsp; Preface to the
online edition.</b></p>
<hr>

<p>John Chrysostom preached 8 sermons to his congregation against the
Jews.&nbsp; These were transmitted to us in the Greek manuscripts of his works,
but the 2nd sermon was much shorter than the others, leading scholars to suppose
that most of that sermon was lost.&nbsp; This belief was confirmed in the 1990's
when German scholar Wendy Pradels discovered a forgotten copy of sermon II in a
Greek monastery which contained the missing material.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The English translation on this site used to reside at Fordham University <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>,
in the Medieval Sourcebook, where it was placed by Paul Halsall in 1998.&nbsp;
At the foot of the page he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This translation, here cleaned up for typos, etc, was on an anti-Semitic
  website [as a justification for current anti-Semitism]. So far I have been
  unable to track down the translator. There were eight homilies by Chrysostom
  on the subject. This seems to be the first six.</p>
  <p>MELVYL reports a translation C. Mervyn Maxwell, <em>Chrysostom's homilies
  against the Jews : an English translation</em>, Thesis (Ph. D.)--University of
  Chicago, 1967. I am trying to find out whether these texts are Maxwell's or an
  earlier translators'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Homilies 7 and 8 were listed with the note:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[e-text added May 2002]</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Homily 2 was incomplete in this translation, wherever it comes
from.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seemed to me that it was pointless to rediscover the lost material in
homily 2, if all the copies in all the libraries, and all the copies on the
internet, still did not contain it.&nbsp; In 2010 I commissioned an English
translation with the aim of reuniting the parts of homily 2.&nbsp; I placed it
on the internet, and also posted it on every website or forum which contained
the anonymous translation of Chrysostom's anti-Jewish homilies.&nbsp; As far as
I know, no-one has ever claimed ownership of this translation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2011 I received an email from a stranger enquiring where a translation of
the homilies might be found.&nbsp; This led me to discover that the file on the
Fordham site had disappeared, and raised the question of whether this should be
remedied.&nbsp; I knew that Dr Halsall was no longer involved with the
site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>After some thought, it seemed to me undesirable that the text should only be
accessible through extremist sites, over which no responsible person had any
control, and to which I might not necessarily wish to direct enquirers seeking
to learn what Chrysostom really had to say.&nbsp; Aside from any other
consideration, no text is read justly if it is read in the context of urgent
contemporary political agitation.</p>

<p>I had always thought that, if the text was indeed public domain, that it
should be joined with the other Chrysostomiana on this site.&nbsp; In the
circumstances I retrieved a copy of the Fordham file which I held locally, and
divided it into the 8 separate homilies and uploaded it here.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have
not altered the formatting, but at some point I will probably go through it and
tidy up the chapters and verses and create anchors for these.</p>

<p>Dr Halsall felt obliged to prefix his page with some introductory material
about Chrysostom, and the modern debates.<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>&nbsp;
I have not included this material here, as all these kinds of issues are outside
the scope of this collection.</p>

<p>The only other English translation of the homilies is John Chrysostom, <em>Discourses
against Judaizing Christians</em>, translated by Paul W. Harkins. The Fathers of
the Church ; v. 68 (Washington : Catholic University of America Press, 1979),
which also lacks the Pradels material.&nbsp; However the translation here is not
the Harkins translation.</p>

<p>It should be added that there is a further sermon of Chrysostom against Jews and Pagans,
<i>Contra Iudaeos et gentiles quod Christus sit deus</i>, PG 48, which has never been translated, and is said to end abruptly, in such a manner
as to lead scholars to suppose that the ending is lost.</p>

I have notified the site that the link is broken, but as the collection is
plainly somewhat neglected, I do not know whether this page might
