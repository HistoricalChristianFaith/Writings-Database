  <UL><P><I>ROM. XVI. 17, 18.-"Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and
offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them. For they that are such serve
not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the
hearts of the simple."</I></P>

</UL><P>Again an exhortation, and prayer after the exhortation. For after telling them to "mark them
which cause<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3440_3131439">1</A></SUP> divisions," and not to listen
to them, he proceeds, "And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly:" and, "The
grace of our Lord be with you." And notice how gently too he exhorts them: doing it not in the
character of a counsellor, but that of a servant, and with much respect. For he calls them brethren,
and supplicates them likewise. For, "I beseech you, brethren," (he says). Then he also puts them on
the defensive by showing the deceitfulness of those who abused them. For as though they were not at
once to be discerned, he says, "I beseech you to mark," that is, to be exceedingly particular about,
and to get acquainted with, and to search out thoroughly-whom, pray? why, "those that cause divisions
and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3441_3132320">2</A></SUP> For this is, if anything the subversion of the
Church, the being in divisions. This is the devil's weapon, this turneth all things upside-down. For
so long as the body is joined into one, he has no power to get an entrance, but it is from division
that the offence cometh. And whence is division? From opinions contrary to the teaching of the
Apostles. And whence come opinions of this sort? From men's being slaves to the belly, and the other
passions. For "such," he says, "serve not the Lord, but their own belly." And so there would be no
offence, there would be no division, unless some opinion were thought of contrary to the doctrine of
the Apostles. And this he here points out by saying, "contrary to the doctrine." And he does not say
which we have taught, but "which ye have learned," so anticipating them, and showing that they were
persuaded of and had heard them and received them. And what are we to do to those who make mischief
in this way? He does not say have a meeting and come to blows, but "avoid them." For if it was from
ignorance or error that they did this, one ought to set them right. But if they sin willingly, spring
away from them. And in another place too he says this. For he says, "Withdraw from every brother that
walketh disorderly" (2 Thess. iii. 6): and in speaking to Timothy about the coppersmith, he gives him
the like advice, and says, "Of whom be thou ware also." (2 Tim. iv. 15.) Then also to lash (<FONT
FACE='SPIonic'>kwmwdwn</FONT>) those who dare to do such things, he mentions also the reason of their
devising this division. "For they that are such," he says, "serve not our Lord Christ, but their own
belly." And this he said too when he wrote to the Philippians, "Whose god is their belly." (Phil.
iii. 19.) But here he appears to me to intimate those of the Jews, whom he ever uses particularly to
find fault with as gluttonous. For in writing to Titus too, he said of them, "Evil beasts, slow
bellies." (Tit. i. 12, see v. 10.) And Christ also blames them on this head: "Ye devour widows'
houses" (Matt. xxiii. 14), He says. And the Prophets accuse them of things of the kind. For, "My
beloved," He says, "hath waxen fat and gross, and hath kicked" (Deut. xxxii. 15). Wherefore also
Moses exhorted them,and said, "When thou hast eaten and drunken and art full, remember the Lord thy
God." (ib. vi. 11, 12.) And in the Gospels, they who say to Christ, "What sign showest thou unto us?"
(John vi. 30) pass over everything else, and remember the manna. So do they everywhere appear to be
possessed with this affection. How then comest thou not to be ashamed at having slaves of the belly
for thy teachers, when thou art a brother of Christ? Now the ground of the error is this, but the
mode of attack is again a different disorder, viz. flattery. For it is by "fair speeches," he says,
"that they deceive the hearts of the simple." For their attention reaches only to words; but their
meaning is not such, for it is full of fraud. And be does not say that they deceive you, but "the
hearts of the simple." And even with this he was not satisfied, but with a view to making this
statement less grating, he says,</P>

<P>Ver. 19. "For your obedience is come abroad unto all men?"</P>

<P>This he does, not to leave them free to be shameless, but to win them beforehand with encomiums,
and the number of his witnesses, to arrest their attention. For neither is it I alone that am the
witness, but the whole world. And he does not say for your understanding, but, "your obedience:" that
is, their compliance, which was evidence of much meekness in them. "I am glad therefore on your
behalf." And this is no small encomium too. Then, after the praise, admonition. For lest, after
liberating them from any charges against them, he should make them the more listless, as not being
observed; he gives them another hint in the words,</P>

<P>"I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil."</P>

<P>You see then how he attacks them again, and that without their suspecting it. For this looks like
intimating that some of them were apt to be led astray.</P>

<P>Ver. 20. "And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly."</P>

<P>For since he had spoken of those who "caused divisions and offences among them," he has mentioned
"the God of peace" also, that they might feel hopeful about the riddance of these evils. For he that
rejoiceth in this (i. e., peace) will put an end to that which makes havoc of it. And he does not
say, will subject, but "will bruise" (Gen. iii. 19), which is a stronger expression. And not those
people only, but also him who was the general over them herein, Satan. And not "will bruise" merely,
but "under your feet," so that they may obtain the victory themselves, and become noble by the
trophy. And the time again is made a ground of comfort. For he adds, "shortly." And this was prayer
and prophecy as well at once. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."</P>

<P>That greatest weapon; that impregnable wall; that tower unshaken! For he reminds them of the
grace, that he may give them the more alacrity. Because if ye have been freed from the ills more
grievous by far, and freed by grace only, much more will ye be freed from the lesser, now ye have
become friends too, and contribute your own share likewise. You see how he neither puts prayer
without works, nor works without prayer. For after giving them credit for their obedience, than he
prays; to show that we need both, our own part as well as God's part, if we are to be duly saved. For
it was not before only, but now too, even though we be great and in high esteem, we need grace from
Him.</P>

<P>Ver. 21. "Timotheus my work-fellow saluteth you."</P>

<P>Observe the customary encomiums again. "And Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater my kinsmen."</P>

<P>This Jason Luke also mentions, and sets before us his manliness also, when he says, that "they
drew" him "to the rulers of the city, crying," etc. (Acts xvii. 5.) And it is likely that the others
too were men of note. For he does not mention relations barely, unless they were also like him in
religiousness.</P>

<P>Ver. 22. "I Tertius, who wrote this Epistle, salute you."</P>

<P>This too is no small encomium, to be Paul's amanuensis. Still it is not to pass encomiums on
himself that he says this, but that he might attach a warm love to him on their part, for this
ministration.</P>

<P>Ver. 23. "Gains mine host (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>cenoj</FONT>), and ofthe whole Church, saluteth
you."</P>

<P>See what a crown he has framed for him by bearing witness to such great hospitality in him, and
brought in the entire Church into this man's house! For by the word <FONT
FACE='SPIonic'>cenon</FONT>, used here, he means a host, not a guest. But when you hear that he was
Paul's host, do not admire him for his munificence only, but also for his strictness of life. For
except he were worthy of Paul's excellency, he would never have lodged there, since he, who took
pains to go beyond<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3456_3140606">3</A></SUP> many of Christ's
commands, would never have trespassed against that law, which bids us be very particular about who
receive us, and about lodging with "worthy" persons. (Matt. x. 11.) "Erastus, the chamberlain of the
city, salutes you, and Quartus a brother." There is a purpose in his adding "the chamberlain of the
city," for as he wrote to the Philippians, "They of Caesar's household salute you" (Phil. iv. 22),
that he might show that the Gospel had taken a hold upon great folk, so here too he mentions the
titlewith a view to the same object, and to show that, to the man who gives heed, neither riches are
a hindrance, nor the cares of government, nor anything elseof the kind.</P>

<P>Ver. 24. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen."<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3458_3141388">4</A></SUP> </P>

<P>See what we ought to begin and to end with everywhere! For in this he laid the foundation of the
Epistle, and in this he putteth on the roof, at once praying for the mother of all good things for
them, and calling the whole of his loving-kindness to their mind. For this is the best proof of a
generous teacher, to benefit his learners not by word only, but likewise by prayer, for which cause
also one said, "But let us give ourselves contiually to prayers, and to the ministry of the word."
(Acts vi. 4.)</P>

<P>Who is there then to pray over us, since Paul hath departed? These who<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3461_3142052">5</A></SUP> are the imitators of Paul. Only let us yield
ourselves worthy of such intercession (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>sunhgoriaj</FONT>), that it may not be
that we hear Paul's voice here only, but that hereafter, when we are departed, we may be counted
worthy to see the wrestler of Christ.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3462_3142363">6</A></SUP> Or
rather, if we hear him here, we shall certainly see him hereafter, if not as standing near him, yet
see him we certainly shall, glistening near the Throne of the king.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3463_3142728">7</A></SUP> Where the Cherubim sing the glory, where the
Seraphim are flying, there shall we see Paul, with Peter, and as a chief<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3464_3143013">8</A></SUP> and leader of the choir of the Saints, and shall
enjoy his generous love. For if when here he loved men so, that when he had the choice of departing
and being with Christ, he chose to be here, much more will he there display a warmer affection. I
love Rome even for this, although indeed one has other grounds for praising it, both for its
greatness, and its antiquity, and its beauty, and its populousness, and for its power, and its
wealth, and for its successes in war. But I let all this pass, and esteem it blessed on this account,
that both in his lifetime he wrote to them, and loved them so, and talked with them whiles he was
with us, and brought his life to a close there.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3465_3146056">9</A></SUP> Wherefore the city is more notable upon this
ground, than upon all others together. And as a body great and strong, it hath as two glistening eyes
the bodies of these Saints. Not so bright is the heaven, when the sun sends forth his rays, as is the
city of Rome, sending out these two lights into all parts of the world. From thence will Paul be
caught up, from thence Peter. Just bethink you, and shudder (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>fricate</FONT>) at
the thought of what a sight Rome will see, when Paul ariseth suddenly from that deposit, together
with Peter, and is lifted up to meet the Lord. (1 Thess. iv. 17.) What a rose will Rome send up to
Christ! (Is. xxxv. 1) what two crowns will the city have about it! what golden chains will she be
girded with! what fountains possess! Therefore I admire the city, not for the much gold, not for the
columns, not for the other display there, but for these pillars of the Church. (1 Cor. xv. 38.) Would
that it were now given me to throw myself round (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>perixuqhnai</FONT>) the body of
Paul, and be riveted to the tomb, and to see the dust of that body that "filled up that which was
lacking" after "Christ" Col. i. 24), that bore "the marks" (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>stigmata</FONT>,)
(Gal. vi. 17) that sowed the Gospel everywhere yea, the dust of that body through which he ran to and
fro everywhere! the dust of that body through which Christ spoke, and the Light shone forth more
brilliant than any lightning, and the voice started out, more awful than any thunder to the devils!
through which he uttered that blessed voice, saying, "I could wish that myself were accursed, for my
brethren" (Rom. ix. 3), through which he spake "before kings, and was not ashamed!" (Ps. cxix. 46)
through which we come to know Paul through which also Paul's Master! Not so awful to us is the
thunder, as was that voice to the demons! For if they shuddered at his clothes (Acts xix. 12), much
more did they at his voice. This led them away captive, this cleansed out the world, this put a stop
to diseases, cast out vice, lifted the truth on high, had Christ riding<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3466_3148144">10</A></SUP> upon it, and everywhere went about with Him; and
what the Cherubim were, this was Paul's voice, for as He was seated upon those Powers, so was He upon
Paul's tongue. For it had become worthy of receiving Christ, by speaking those things only which were
acceptable to Christ, and flying as the Seraphim to height unspeakable! for what more lofty than that
voice which says, "For I am persuaded that neither Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things
present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate
us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus?" (Rom. viii. 38, 39.) What pinions doth not this
discourse seem to thee to have? what eyes? (Ez. x. 12.) It was owing to this that he said, "for we
are not ignorant of his devices." (2 Cor. ii. 11.) Owing to this did the devils flee not only at
hearing him speak, but even at seeing his garments. This is the mouth, the dust whereof I would fain
see, through which Christ spake the great and secret things, and greater than in His own person, (for
as He wrought, so He also spake greater things by the disciples,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3467_3149417">11</A></SUP> ) through which the Spirit gave those wondrous
oracles to the world! For what good thing did not that mouth effect? Devils it drave out, sins it
loosed, tyrants it muzzled, philosophers' mouths it stopped, the world it brought over to God,
savages it persuaded to learn wisdom, all the whole order of the earth it altered. Things in Heaven
too it disposed what way it listed (1 Cor. v. 3, 4), binding whom it would, and loosing in the other
world, "according unto the power given unto it." (2 Cor. xiii. 10.) Nor is it that mouth only, but
the heart too would fain see the dust of, which a man would not do wrong to call the heart of the
world, and a fountain of countless blessings, and a beginning, and element of our life. For the
spirit of life was furnished out of it all, and was distributed through the members of Christ, not as
being sent forth by arteries, but by a free choice of good deeds. This heart was so large, as to take
in entire cities, and peoples, and nations. "For my heart" he says, "is enlarged." (ib. vi. 11.) Yet
even a heart thus large, did this very charity that enlarged it many a time straiten and oppress. For
he says, "Out of much affliction (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>qliyewj</FONT>) and anguish (<FONT
FACE='SPIonic'>sunoxhj</FONT>) of heart I wrote unto you." (ib. ii. 4.) I were desirous to see that
heart even after its dissolution, which burned at each one that was lost, which travailed a second
time with the children that had proved abortions (Gal. iv. 19), which saw God,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3468_3150916">12</A></SUP> ("for the pure in heart," He says, "shall see
God,") (Matt. v. 8) which became a Sacrifice, ("for a sacrifice to God is a contrite heart,") (Ps.
li. 17) which was loftier than the heavens, which was wider than the world, which was brighter than
the sun's beam, which was warmer than fire, which was stronger than adamant, which sent forth rivers,
("for rivers," it says, "of living water shall flow out of his belly,") (John vii. 38) wherein was a
fountain springing up, and watering, not the face of the earth, but the souls of men, whence not
rivers only, but even fountains of<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3469_3151577">13</A></SUP> tears,
issued day and night, which lived the new life, not this of ours, (for "I live," he says, "yet not I,
but Christ liveth in me," (Gal. ii. 20) so Paul's heart was His heart, and a tablet of the Holy
Spirit, and a book of grace); which trembled for the sins of others, (for I fear, he says, lest by
any means "I have bestowed labor upon you in vain; (ib. iv. 11) lest as the serpent beguiled Eve; (2
Cor. xi. 3) lest when I come I should find you not such as I would;") (ib. xii. 20) which both feared
for itself, and was confiding too, (for I fear, he says, "lest by any means after having preached to
others I myself should be a castaway," (1 Cor. ix. 27) And, "I am persuaded that neither angels nor
powers shall be able to separate us;") (alluding to Rom. ix. 3) which was counted worthy to love
Christ as no other man loved Him: which despised death and hell, yet was broken down by brothers'
tears, (for he says, "what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?") (Acts xxi. 13) which was most
enduring, and yet could not bear to be absent from the Thessalonians by the space of an hour! (1
Thess. ii. 17; iii. 10.) Fain would I see the dust of hands that were in a chain, through the
imposition of which the Spirit was furnished, through which the divine writings were written, (for
"behold how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand:" (Gal. vi. 11) and again, "The
salutation of me Paul with mine own hand,") (1 Cor. xvi. 21) of those hands at the sight of which the
serpent "fell off into the fire." (Acts xxviii. 5.) Fain would I see the dust of those eyes which
were blinded gloriously, which recovered their sight again for the salvation of the world; which even
in the body were counted worthy to see Christ, which saw earthly things, yet saw them not, which saw
the things which are not seen, which saw not sleep, which were watchful at midnight, which were not
effected as eyes are. I would also see the dust of those feet, which ran through the world and were
not weary; which were bound in the stocks when the prison shook, which went through parts habitable
or uninhabited, which walked on so many journeys. And why need I speak of single parts? Fain would I
see the tomb, where the armor of righteousness is laid up, the armor of light, the limbs which now
live, but which in life were made dead; and in all whereof Christ lived, which were crucified to the
world, which were Christ's members, which were clad in Christ, were a temple of the Spirit, an holy
building, "bound in the Spirit," (Acts xx. 22) riveted to the fear of God, which had the marks of
Christ. This body is a wall to that City, which is safer than all towers, and than thousands of
battlements. And with it is that of Peter. For he honored him while alive. For he "went up to see
Peter." (Gal. i. 18) and therefore even when departed grace deigned to give him the same abode with
him. Fain would I see the spiritual Lion. For as a lion breathing (Gr. sending,) (Cant. ii. 15) forth
fire (<FONT FACE='SPIonic'>pur afieij</FONT>) upon the herds of foxes, so rushed he upon the clan of
demons and philosophers, and as the burst of some thunderbolt, was borne down into the host of the
devil. (Luke xiii. 32.) For he did not even come to set the battle in array against him, since he
feared so and trembled at him, as that if he saw his shadow, and heard his voice, he fled even at a
distance. And so did he deliver over to him the fornicator, though at a distance, and again snatched
him out of his hands (1 Cor. v. 5, 2 Cor. ii. 7, 11); and so others also, that they might be taught
"not to blaspheme." (1 Tim. i. 20.) And consider how he sent forth his own liegemen against him,
rousing them, suppling them. And at one time he says to the Ephesians, "We wrestle not against flesh
and blood, but against principalities and powers." (Eph. vi. 12.) Then too he puts our prize in
heavenly places. For we struggle not for things of the earth, he says, but for Heaven, and the things
in the Heavens. And to others, he says, "Know ye not that we shall judge Angels? how much more the
things of this life?" (1 Cor. vi. 3.) Let us then, laying all this to heart, stand nobly; for Paul
was a man, partaking of the same nature with us, and having everything else in common with us. But
because he showed such great love toward Christ, he went up above the Heavens, and stood with the
Angels. And so if we too would rouse ourselves up some little, and kindle in ourselves that fire, we
shall be able to emulate that holy man. For were this impossible, he would never have cried aloud,
and said, "Be ye imitators of me, as I am of Christ." (1 Cor. xi. 1.) Let us not then admire him
only, or be struck with him only, but imitate him, that we too may, when we depart hence, be counted
worthy to see him, and to share the glory unutterable, which God grant that we may all attain to by
the grace and love toward man of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom, and with Whom, be glory to the
Father, with the Holy Ghost, now and evermore. Amen.parparpar</P>
