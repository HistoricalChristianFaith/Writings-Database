<p><b><a name="preface"></a>PREFACE</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Julius Africanus, under the emperor Marcus Aurelius Antonius, was the first
among us to compose, using a simple style of history, a brief chronology
organized according to generations and reigns. From there, Bishop Eusebius of
Caesaria and the priest Jerome of holy memory edited a multipart history of the
canons of chronicles organized according to reigns and times. After these came
others, in particular, Bishop Victor of Tunnunna who, having reviewed the
histories of the previous times, filled out the deeds of succeeding ages up to
the consolate of Justin the Younger. We have recorded here, as briefly as we
were able, a summary of the times from the beginning of the world up to the
principates of the emperor Heraclius and of King Sisebut of the Goths, laying
down, bit by bit, the descending order of times, so that, by means of the
information provided, the whole of the past ages might be known.
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a name="first"></a>
FIRST AGE OF THE WORLD</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
1. God created everything in six days. On the first day he fashioned light; on
the second, the firmament of heaven; on the third, the land and the sea; on the
fourth, the stars; on the fifth, the fish and the birds; on the sixth, the
animals and the beasts of burden and finally the first man, Adam, in his image.
<p>
2. Adam, at age 230, bore Seth, who was born in the place of Abel. Seth means
&quot;resurrection&quot; because in him was resuscitated the first seed, that
is, the seed of the sons of God. Seth, at age 205, bore Enosh, who was the first
to begin invoking the name of God. Enosh, at age 190, bore Kenan, whose name
means &quot;the nature of God.&quot; At the same time, Cain became the first,
before the flood, to build a city, which he filled solely with the multitude of
his own descendents.
<p>
3. Kenan, at age 170, bore Mahalalel, whose name means &quot;plantation of
God.&quot; Mahalalel, at age 165, bore Jared, which means &quot;descending&quot;
or &quot;beseeching.&quot; Jared, at age 162, bore Enoch, who was lifted up by
God, and who is reported to have written quite a few things, but which, on
account of their antiquity, are refuted by the fathers as of suspect faith.
<p>
4. Enoch, at age 165, bore Methuselah, who, according to his lifespan, is
discovered to have lived fourteen years after the flood, yet he is not found to
have been on the ark. On account of this, some conjecture, with false opinion,
that he might have lived after the flood, having spent some time with his father
Enoch, who was lifted up. In this generation, the sons of God lusted after the
daughters of men. Methuselah, at age 167, bore Lamech. In this generation,
giants were born. In this age also, Jubal, from the line of Cain, discovered the
art of music and his brother Tubal Cain was the inventor of the arts of copper
and iron.
<p>
5. Lamech, at age 190, bore Noah who, by divine oracle, was ordered to build the
arc in the five-hundredth year of his life. In these times, as Josephus reports,
some men, who knew that they were about to die by either fire or water,
inscribed their discoveries on two columns made of brick and stone, so that the
memory of those things which they had discovered in their wisdom might not be
erased. Their stone columns are reported to have withstood the flood and remain
in Syria to this very day.
<p>
6. In Noah's six-hundredth year, the flood is recorded to have occurred.
Josephus reports that his ark came to rest among the mountains of Armenia, which
are called Ararat. There were three sons of Noah, out of which seventy-two
nations were born, that is, fifteen from Japheth, thirty from Ham, and
twenty-seven from Shem.
<p>
The first age came to an end in the year 2,242.
<blockquote>
<p>
<b><a name="second"></a>
THE SECOND AGE OF THE WORLD</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
7. Shem, in the second year after the flood, when he was 100 years old, bore
Arpachshad, from whom the people of the Chaldeans arose. This Shem is reported
to have been Melchisedech, who was the first after the flood to build the city
of Salem, which now is called Jerusalem.
<p>
8. Arphaxad, at age 135, bore Shelah, from whom came the ancient Salamites or
Medians. Shelah, at age 130, bore Eber, after whom the Hebrews were named.
<p>
9. Eber, at age 134, bore Peleg, in whose time the Tower of Babel was built, and
the division of languages was effected. The height of this tower is said to have
stretched four miles, starting out wide and becoming narrower so that the
immense weight might be more easily sustained. They describe the marble temples
there as being unmatched in precious stones and gold and many other things that
seem unbelievable. The giant Nimrod constructed this tower. After the confusion
of tongues, he departed from there for Persia and taught them to worship fire.
<p>
10. Peleg, at age 130, bore Reu. In these times, temples were first constructed.
And certain princes of the peoples began to be adored as gods. Reu, at age 132,
bore Serug, under whom the kingdom of the Scythians arose, where Tanaus first
ruled. Serug, at age 130, bore Nachor. The kingdom of the Egyptians arose for
the first time, with Zoes ruling there first.
<p>
11. Nachor, at age 79, bore Terah, at the time when the kingdom of the Assyrians
and the Sicyonans rose up. The first who ruled in Assyria was Belus, though some
consider it to have been Saturnus. And the first in Sicyon was Aegialeus, after
whom Aegialea, which today is called the Peloponnesus, is named.
<p>
12. Terah, at age 70, bore Abraham. At the same time Ninus ruled as king of the
Assyrians. He was the first to institute wars and invented the instruments of
weaponry. In this age the art of magic was discovered in Persia by Zoroaster,
the king of the Bactrians. He was killed by King Ninus. Also the walls of
Babylon were built by Samiramis, queen of the Assyrians. From the flood to the
birth of Abraham: 942 years. The second age came to an end in the year 3,184.

finally, &quot;Saracens.&quot;
<p>
14. Isaac, at age 60, bore twins, of whom the first was Esau, from whom came the

have lived in these times. At this time also, his brother Atlas discovered

his death, he was lifted up among the gods. In that age also, Proclytus was the
first to harness a team of horses. At the same time Cecrops founded Athens and

</blockquote>
<p>

Sicilian war, had three triumphs: Dalmatia, Asia, and later Alexandria against
Anthony. From there, Spain. At that point, having brought peace on land and sea

a virgin in Bethlehem of Judah in the forty-second year of Octavian's rule.
<p>

<p>

<p>
69. Claudius ruled for fourteen years. With him ruling, the apostle Peter went
to Rome against Simon Magus. Also Mark the Evangelist, preaching Christ in

<p>
70. Nero ruled for fourteen years. Given to injury, cruelty, and lust, he even
fished with nets of gold. He prostituted and killed his mother and sister, wiped
out much of the senate, lost many cities and provinces of the republic, and also
burned down the city of Rome so that he might witness an image of the
destruction of Troy. In his times, Simon Magus was reported to have had an
altercation with the apostles Peter and Paul. Claiming that a certain great
power that he had came from God, he proposed at midday to fly to the Father in
heaven with the help of demons, by whom he was to be born aloft. But, with Peter
swearing at the demons and Paul praying, Simon was cast down and he crashed.
Because of Simon's death, Peter was crucified by Nero and Paul was killed with a
sword. In this same storm, a Persian poet died. In addition, Lucan and Seneca
were killed by order of Nero.
<p>
71. Vespasian ruled for ten years. Vigorous in military discipline, through his
fighting he restored to the republic many provinces which Nero had lost. He was
unmindful of offenses and he bore lightly the insults said against him. In his
second year Titus took and overthrew Jerusalem, where 1,100,000 Jews perished by
famine and the sword. Beyond these, another 100,000 were publicly sold into
slavery.
<p>
72. Titus ruled for eleven years. He was so eloquent in both languages that he
could prepare legal cases in Latin and compose poems and tragedies in Greek. He
was, however, so bellicose that in the assault on Jerusalem, fighting under his
father, he pierced twelve soldiers with twelve arrows. But he was of such
magnanimity in the exercise of his imperial rule, that he punished no one at
all, but dismissed those convicted of conspiring against him and maintained the
same familiarity with them which he had had before. Among all of his sayings,
the most famous was: &quot;The day is lost in which nothing good is
accomplished.&quot;
<p>
73. Domitian, brother of Titus, ruled for sixteen years. He was the second after
Nero who, cursed with pride, commanded that he be considered a god and ordered
the Christians to be persecuted by the pagans. Under him, the apostle John was
banished to the island of Patmos, where he wrote the Apocalypse. (Domitian)
killed and sent many of the senators into exile, and he ordered everyone from
the line of David to be killed so that none of the Jews from the royal line
would survive.
<p>
74. Nerva ruled for one year. A moderate man in his imperium, he presented
himself as equal to, and approachable by, everyone. In his time, John the
Apostle returned from exile to Ephesus and, entreated by the bishops of Asia,
became the most recent to edit a new gospel.
<p>
75. Trajan ruled for nineteen years. He extended the empire of the Romans with
wondrous power far and wide to the east. Tranquil and liberal in all things, he
took Babylonia and Arabia and reached all the way to the territory of India,
like Alexander. Among all of the things he said, the most extraordinary is
reported to have been his response when asked why he was so approachable by
everyone around him: (to wit), that he would rather deprive himself of being
emperor than be a private emperor. Simon Cleophas, bishop of Jerusalem, was
crucified at this time and John the Apostle passed away.
<p>
76. Hadrian ruled for twenty-one years. Envying the glory of Trajan, he
surrendered the provinces of the east to the Persians and established the
boundary of the Roman empire at the river Euphrates. He also subjugated the Jews
who, for a second time, had become rebels, and he restored the city of Jerusalem

second translator after the Septuagint, arose. And Basilides was acknowledged to
be a heresiarch.
<p>
77. Antoninus Pius ruled for twenty-two years. He received this cognomen on
account of his clemency, because throughout the entire Roman kingdom he relaxed
the debts of everyone, burning the notes. For which reason he is also called the
&quot;Father of the Country.&quot; He was the first to divide the imperium of
the Roman world, which he did with Antoninus the Younger, making him equal in
power. With Antoninus Pius ruling, Valentius and Marcion were shown to be
heresiarchs and the doctor Galen, born in Pergamum, was regarded as illustrious
in Rome.
<p>
78. Antoninus Minor ruled for eighteen years. Having advanced to Parthia, he
took Seleucia, the city of Assyria, with 400,000 men. He triumphed over the
Parthians and the Persians. With him ruling, Montanus, the author of the
Cataphrygites and Tatian, from whom came the heresy of the Encratitarites,
appeared.
<p>
79. Commodus ruled for thirteen years. He was a man of great lust. Under his
imperial rule, Theodotian of Ephesus, the third translator, appeared. And
Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons, was regarded as illustrious in his teaching.
<p>

that he ought to be replaced because he ruled unwillingly.
<p>

with many virtues. Tertullian of Africa was regarded as illustrious in the
church. Origen of Alexandria was erudite in his studies.
<p>

impatient in his desires. He took his stepmother as his wife. He did nothing
memorable. In his time, in Jericho, a fifth edition of the holy scriptures was
found, the author of which was not known.
<p>
83. Macrinus ruled for one year. Ruling with his own son, he undertook nothing
memorable during his brief time as emperor. For after only one year, both were
killed as a result of a military uprising.
<p>
84. Aurelius Antoninus ruled for four years. He lived most obscenely and was
himself killed by a military revolt. In his time, a sixth edition was found in
Nicopolis. The heresiarch Sabellius appeared.
<p>
85. Alexander ruled for thirteen years. He most gloriously conquered the
Persians. He was favorable to the citizens. In his time, Origen of Alexandria
excelled and in Rome, the legal expert Ulpian was illustrious.
<p>
86. Maximinus ruled for three years. He was the first to be made emperor by the
body of the military without a senate decree. He persecuted Christians.
<p>
87. Gordian ruled for six years. He afflicted the rebelling Parthians and
Persians. Returning victorious from Persia, he died as a result of the treachery
of his own men. In his time, Zephyrinus, with the witness of the holy spirit
descending in the form of a dove over his head, was ordained bishop of Rome.
<p>
88. Philip ruled for seven years. He was the first among the emperors to believe
in Christ. In his first year, the one thousandth year of the city of Rome was
reported to have passed.
<p>
89. Decius ruled for one year. In his time, St. Anthony the monk, by whom

bishop Cyprian, came to Rome and founded the Novatian hersesy.
<p>
91. Valerian, with Gallienus, ruled for fifteen years. Cyprian, first rhetor and
them bishop, was crowned with martyrdom. Also the Goths depopulated Greece,
Macedonia, and Pontus in Asia. Valerian, orchestrating a persecution of the
Christians, was captured by Sapor, king of the Persians, and there he grew old
with the disgrace of his life.
<p>
92. Claudius ruled for two years. He conquered and devastated the Goths (in)
Illyricum and Macedonia. Paul of Samostenus was acknowledged to be a heresiarch.
<p>

almost to its previous boundaries. Carrying out the persecution against the
Christians, he was seized with a sudden calamity and died without delay.
<p>
94. Tacitus ruled for one year. His brief life left no deed worthy of record.
<p>
95. Probus ruled for six years. Vigorous in war and illustrious in civilian
life, he restored to the Romans, by force, Gaul, which had been occupied by the
barbarians. In his time the heresy of the Manicheans arose. (5,481)
<p>
96. Carus ruled with his sons Carinus and Numerianus for two years. (134) Carus,
after he triumphed over the Persians and, victorious, placed fortifications
along the Tigris, was killed by a stroke of misfortune.
<p>
97. Diocletian and Maximian ruled for twenty years. Diocletian, having burned
holy books, persecuted Christians throughout the world. He was the first to
order gems put on clothes and shoes. At that time princes were to wear only
purple on their backs. These emperors waged various wars and, having conquered
Persia, took Mesopotamia. After awhile, when both had left the rank of emperor,
they lived as private citizens.
<p>
98. Galerius ruled for two years. His brief imperium saw nothing worthy of
historical record.
<p>
99. Constantine ruled for thirty years. He prepared for war with the Persians
and they feared his arrival, so that supplicants came forth promising to carry
out his orders. He also became a Christian, giving permission to Christians to
congregate freely, and built basilicas in honor of Christ. In these times, the
Arian heresy appeared. Also the Nicene Council was convoked by Constantine for
the condemnation of Arius. Also at that time the schism of the Donatists arose.
At the same time the cross of Christ was discovered in Jerusalem by Helen, the
mother of Constantine. But Constantine, baptised by Bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia
at the very end of his life, was converted to the Arian dogma. O the pain! Such
a good beginning, such a bad end.
<p>
100. Constantius and Constans ruled for twenty-four years. Constantius, terrible
in the cruelty of his ways, endured many things from the Persians. From that
time on he became an Arian and persecuted Catholics all over the world. Relying
on his favor, Arius proceeded to the church in Constantinople, about to fight
against those of our faith. Diverted through the forum of Constantine for the
sake of some necessity, suddenly his viscera and his life simultaneously poured
out. At the same time, Athanasius and Hilary were celebrated for their doctrine
and confession of the faith. The heresy of the Anthropomorphites arose in Syria,
Macedonia, and Constantinople. Donatus, an author of the art of grammar and
instructor of Jerome, was regarded as illustrious in Rome. Anthony the monk
died. The bones of the apostles Andrew and Luke were translated to
Constantinople.
<p>
101. Julian ruled for two years. He went from being a cleric to being an emperor
and a pagan. He was converted to the cult of the idols and instituted martyrdom
for the Christians. He forbade Christians to teach or learn the liberal arts. At
that time he also, out of his hatred for Christ, permitted the Jews to repair
the Temple of Jerusalem. Jews gathered from all the provinces and laid new
foundations for the Temple. Suddenly at night an earthquake struck and the
stones from the deepest parts of the foundation were shaken and scattered far
and wide. In addition a fiery ball came out from the interior of the building of
the Temple and prostrated many with its fire. Those remaining were frightened by
this terror and involuntarily confessed Christ. And lest they thought it was
over with this destruction, the sign of the cross appeared the following night
on everyone's clothing. Julian, proceeding against the Persians, died, having
been hit with a javelin as the attack was being launched.
<p>
102. Jovian ruled for one year. When he realized that he was being chosen
emperor by the army, he confirmed that he was a Christian and decided that it
was no longer permissable for pagans to hold office. &quot;And we,&quot; he said
to all of the army, &quot;who through Julianus rejected the name of Christ, wish
to be Christians again.&quot; He then received the sceptre of the imperium from
those who had heard him and returned after having made peace with the Persians.
He gave the priveleges back to the Christians with a law granted in perpetuity
and ordered the temples of the idols closed.
<p>
103. Valentinian and his brother Valens ruled for fourteen years. The Goths, in
Istrus, were divided into two kingdoms under kings Fridigern and Athalaric. But
Fridigern overcame Athalaric with the help of Valens, the Arian emperor, having
been persuaded, in exchange for the aid, to convert form being a catholic to
being an Arian along with all of the people of the Goths, thus following Valens'
error. Also at that time Ulfilas, bishop of the Goths, invented letters for the
Goths like the letters of the Greeks and then translated both (the New and Old)
Testaments into their own tongue. Also Photinus, Eunomius, and Apollonaris were
acknowledged to be heresiarchs at this same time.
<p>
104. Gratian with his brother Valentinian ruled for six years. Ambrose, bishop
of Milan, excelled in the dogma of the Catholics. Priscillian introduced into
Spain the evil heresy bearing his name. Martin, bishop of Tours, the city of
Gaul, was resplendent with the signs of many miracles.
<p>
105. Valentinian ruled with Theodosius for eight years. The Synod of
Constantinople, with one hundred fifty holy fathers, at which all heresies were
condemned, was convoked by Theodosius. The priest Jerome in Bethlehem was
regarded as illustrious throughout the world. Priscillian, being accused by
Itacius, was killed with the sword by the tyrant Maximus. At the same time the
head of John the Baptist was taken to Constantinople and buried at the seventh
milestone (septimo milliario) of the city. And in the same time the temples of
the gentiles all over the world were torn down by order of Theodosius, for until
then they had remained untouched.
<p>
106. Theodosius, with Arcadius and Honorius, ruled for three years. At the same
time, John the Anchorite was regarded as noteworthy in the miracles of his
virtues. Also, when consulted by Theodosius, he foretold his victory over the
tyrant Eugenius.
<p>
107. Arcadius and his brother Honorius ruled for thirteen years. In his time,
bishop Augustine was regarded as noteworthy in the knowledge of his teaching.
Also John of Constantinople and Theophilus of Alexandria were proclaimed to be
illustrious bishops. At the same time, Donatus, bishop of Epirus, was regarded
as noteworthy in his miracles (virtutes). He killed, by spitting in its eye, an
immense dragon, which even with eight yoke of oxen was scarcely able to be
dragged to the place where it was to be burned so that it would not corrupt the
air as it decomposed. At the same time, the bodies of the holy prophets Habucuc
and Micah were found by divine revelation. The Goths plundered Italy. And the
Vandals and Alans invaded Gaul.
<p>
108. Honorius, with Theodosius the Younger, the son of his brother, ruled for
fifteen years. With these two governing, the Goths took Rome and the Vandals,
Alans and Suevi seized Spain. In this time Pelagius preached the dogma of his
error against the grace of Christ. A council of 214 of bishops was convoked in
Carthage for his condemnation. In this time Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, was
regarded as noteworthy.
<p>
109. Theodosius the younger, son of Arcadius, ruled for twenty-seven years. The
Vandals crossed over from Spain into Africa. There they subverted the Catholic
faith with Arian impiety. At the same time Nestor, bishop of Constantinople,
stirred up the error of his perfidy. The synod of Ephesus, convoked against him,
condemned his impious dogma. In this same time, the devil in the guise of Moses
appeared to the Jews in Crete and promised to lead them to the promised land
over the sea without even getting their feet wet. After many had been killed,
those remaining, who survived, were converted immediately to the grace of
Christ.
<p>
110. Marcian ruled for six years. The beginning of his imperial reign, the
Council of Chalcedon was held, where Eutyches along with Dioscorus, the
Alexandrian bishop, were condemned. In the sixth year of his imperium,
Theodoric, king of the Goths, invaded Spain with a huge army.
<p>
111. Leo the older ruled with Leo the younger for sixteen years. Alexandria and
Egypt, despising the Synod of Chalcedon and languishing in the error of the
heretic Dioscorus, barked with canine madness, filled with an unclean spirit. At
the same time appeared the heresy of the Acephali, attacking the Council of
Chalcedon. They are called Acephali, that is, &quot;without a head,&quot;
because the one who first introduced this heresy is not known. Many to the east
languish with the disease of this heresy.
<p>
112. Zeno ruled for seventeen years. The heresy of the Acephali was defended by
him and the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon were abandoned. Zeno sought to
kill his son Leo Augustus. But his mother handed over to Zeno someone similar to
Leo in appearance and secretly made Leo a cleric. He lived among the clergy
until the time of Justinian. At the same time the body of Barnabas the apostle
and the gospel of Matthew, written with his own stylus, having revealed
themselves, were found.
<p>
113. Anastasius ruled for twenty-seven years. Appropriating the error of the
Acephali, he condemned to exile the bishops who were defenders of the Synod of
Chalcedon and also found fault with, and corrected, the gospels as if they had
been composed by idiot evangelists. In his time, Bishop Fulgentius excelled in
his knowledge and confession of God. Trasemundus, king of the Vandals, closed
Catholic churches in Africa, sent 120 bishops to Sardinia, and raged against
Catholics. At the same time in Carthage, Olympus, a certain Arian who blasphemed
the holy Trinity in the balineum, was ignited in public by three fiery javelins
thrown by angels. Also a certain Arian bishop by the name of Barbas is reported
to have spoken against a rule of the faith while baptising (&quot;Barbas
baptises you in the name of the Father, through the Son, in the name of the Holy
Spirit&quot;) and immediately the water in the font which had been brought for
baptism disappeared. Seeing this, the one who was to be baptised immediately
rushed away to the Catholic faith and received the baptism of Christ according
to the custom of the evangelic faith.
<p>
114. Justin the older ruled for nine years. A love of the Synod of Chalcedon, he
abandoned the heresy of the Acephali. In his time, after Trasemundus, Childeric,
born of the captive daughter of the emperor Valentinian, received the kingdom
among the Vandals. Though bound by an oath to Trasemundus that he would not show
favor to the Catholics in the kingdom, before assuming power he ordered the
bishops to be returned from exile and commanded that their own churches be
restored to them.
<p>
115. Justinian ruled for thirty-nine years. Receiving the heresy of the
Acephali, he compelled every bishop in his kingdom to condemn the three chapters
of the Council of Chalcedon. In Alexandria, the Theodosian and Gaianan heresies
appeared. In Spain the Roman &quot;miles&quot; was invaded by the tyrant
Athanagild. The patricius Belisarius triumphed wonderfully over the Persians.
From there he was sent by Justinian to Africa and destroyed the people of the
Vandals. Also in Italy, Totila, king of the Ostrogoths, was overcome by Narses,
the Roman patricius. At the same time, the body of St. Anthony the monk,
discovered by divine revelation, was taken to Alexandria and buried in the
church of St. John the Baptist.
<p>
116. Justin the younger ruled for eleven years. He destroyed those who had
spoken out against the Synod of Chalcedon and ordered the effigy of the 150
fathers to be burned by the people in the time of sacrifice. The Armenians first
received the faith of Christ at that time. The Gepids were extinguished by the
Lombards. At the same time Martin, bishop of Braga in Galicia, was regarded as
illustrious in prudence and the teaching of the Catholic faith. The patricius
Narses, after he had overcome King Totila of the Goths in Italy in the time of
the Augustus Justinian, was frightened by the threats of the empress Sophia,
wife of Justin, and so invited the Lombards from Pannonia and introduced them
into Italy. At that time Leovigild, king of the Goths, brought back, under the
power of his kingdom, certain regions of Spain that were rebelling against him.
<p>
117. Tiberius ruled for seven years. The Lombards, expelled by the Romans,
entered Italy. The Goths were divided into two by Hermenegild, son of King
Leovigild, and they were devastated with mutual slaughter.
<p>
118. Maurice ruled for twenty-one years. The Suevi, held by King Leovigild, were
subjected by the Goths. The Goths were also converted to the Catholic faith,
having been summoned by that most religious prince, Reccared. The Avars,
fighting against the Romans, were defeated more by gold than by iron. Thrace was
seized by the Huns. At this time, Leander excelled in the teaching of the faith
and the sciences for the conversion of the Gothic people in Spain.
<p>
119. Phocas ruled for eight years. Made emperor as the result of a military
revolt, he killed the emperor Maurice and many of the nobles. In his time the
Prasini and the Veneti waged civil war throughout the east and Egypt and
prostrated themselves with mutual slaughter. In addition, very grave battles
were fought against the republic of the Persians, in which the Romans were
forcefully beaten and lost many provinces up to the Euphrates River as well as,
they say, Jerusalem.
<p>
120. Heraclius has completed five years of his imperial rule. At the beginning,
the Slavs took Greece from the Romans; the Persians took Syria, Egypt, and many
provinces. Also in Spain, Sisebut, king of the Goths, took certain cities from
the same Roman &quot;militia&quot; and converted the Jews subject to his kingdom
to the faith of Christ.<p>
121. 5,814 years have passed from the beginning of the world to the present era
654 [616 AD], that is, to the fifth year of the imperium of Heraclius and the
fourth of the most glorious prince Sisebut.
<p>
122. The time remaining for the world cannot be ascertained by human
investigation. Our Lord Jesus Christ forestalled every question about this
matter when he said: &quot;It is not for you to know times or the moment which
the Father has fixed by his own authority.&quot; And elsewhere: &quot;But of
that day,&quot; he said, &quot;and that hour no one knows, not even the angels
of heaven, but the Father only.&quot; Each one, then, should think about his own
passing, as holy scripture says: &quot;In all works, be mindful of the most
recent.&quot; When, therefore, any one passes away that moment is the end of his
world.</p>
