<hr>

<p>With St. Isidore of Seville (Isidorus Hispalensis, born ca. 560, d. 636 AD),
the patristic age in the West comes to an end.&nbsp; He became Archbishop of
Seville in 600-601.&nbsp; He was a very industrious author, and exercised an
immense influence on medieval Europe.&nbsp; His works are mainly compilations
from earlier authors, but of great value because he was the last author still in
touch with antiquity.&nbsp; Many of his works, especially the exegetical ones,
have never been printed.&nbsp; More details of his works with a limited
bibliography can be found in B. Altaner, <i>Patrology</i>, tr. H. Graef,
Freiburg:Herder (1960) pp. 594-8.</p>
<p>In the same way, Isidore is the last Latin historian of the patristic period,
producing two historical works.&nbsp; His brief <i>Chronicon</i> or <i>Chronicle
of the World</i> extends to 615 AD, and is given here.&nbsp; The work appears in
the Patrologia Latina 83: cols. 1017-1058.&nbsp; There is also a critical text
in Mommsen, <i>Chronica Minora saec. IV-VII</i>, 2 vols (Monumenta Germania
Historia vols. 9 and 11) vol. 2 pp.391-488, and the text will be reedited in the
near future for the Corpus Christianorum series.&nbsp; His other work, the <i>Historia
Gothorum</i>, a chronicle of the Visigoths to 625 with two short appendices on
the Vandals and Suevians, can be found in the same sources.</p>
<p>This text is something of a departure for this series, in that it was
translated recently from the PL text by Dr. Kenneth B. W<SPAN class="small">OLF</SPAN>
as a teaching aid for his students.&nbsp; I came across it online one day, and
felt it deserved to be more generally known.&nbsp; To the best of my knowledge
it is the only English translation.&nbsp; Dr. Wolf has very kindly released this
version into the public domain, so that it can appear here, but warns that this
is only a first draft.&nbsp; The master copy can be found at his site, at "http://www.history.pomona.edu/kbw/h100y/chronicon.htm",
with revisions as they are made.</p>
