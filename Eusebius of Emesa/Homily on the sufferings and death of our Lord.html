On the Sufferings and Death of our Lord.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></h3>
<p align="center">[Translated by S. C. Malan]</p>
<p>BRETHREN, we cannot hold our peace on the sufferings of Christ; we must speak
of them; for both the time and place constrain us to do so. For, since He died
for us, shall we not tell of His Passion? Yea, rather, we will dwell on it, and
proclaim it aloud. He is on the Cross, for thy sake, O sinner; and thou, be at
His feet, for thy own sake also. Thou darest not think or say nothing of thy
Lord's sufferings; for where He suffered, there Satan died.</p>
<p>The traitor is come to look about him; and when come, he is on the alert and
ready, not in places unknown, but in a spot which he knows full well. That place
is near you. But what is meant by 'near you?' To that very place which you
yourselves had shown to others is the traitor come, bringing with him a crowd;
as if much people could overrule the power of God! The devil's son is come with
swords, that are the wiles of his father who came to Adam as a friend, while he
acted by him as an enemy: for he deceived and overcame him like a man that was
taken in. And here he hid his guile under a kiss; although he remonstrated when
his friendship was doubted. Did he come to betray with a kiss? No; he came not
to kiss, but to betray. I resist not, said the Lord; do what thou listed: thou
alone art the cause of thy own destruction. That was to the traitor himself; but
to those who came to lay hands on Him, He said: What seek ye? They answered:
Jesus of Nazareth. And the Lord replied: I am He; I resist you not, I flee not
from you; for this very purpose am I come, and to this end was I born. But while
He spake they and the traitor fell backwards to the earth; to show that He had
come there of His own accord, for if they could not stand His speaking to them,
how could they have bound Him against His will? &quot;If ye seek Me,&quot; said
the Lord, &quot;let these go their way.&quot;</p>
<p>But Peter, who was the most fervent of all the disciples, comes forward also
on this occasion. For at times he stepped rightly before the others; at other
times it was very much as he thought best himself. He who knew how to come out
of the ship boldly and walk on the water to his Lord, he who believed fervently,
nevertheless suddenly fell back. But that was ere he was made a Rock, and ere he
had received of the Spirit. For when once he had received the Spirit, he no
longer quailed before a maid, nor shook in the wind; but he abode unmoved and
faithful in the place in which he was put. Do not find fault with me, brethren,
if I gather, one by one, every merit of our Lord; while I endeavour as well as I
can, to tell His virtues. I pray you, do not grow weary; for I tell you of the
Cross.</p>
<p>Peter drew his sword, which the Lord bade him take with him in order to
fulfil every particular dispensation connected with His humanity; according to
what S. Luke declares, that this saying should be fulfilled, &quot;He was
reckoned among the transgressors a saying which the other Evangelists apply to
Christ on the Cross.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> He cut off the servant's ear,
well and deservedly; for the ear that hears not, ought not to remain in its
place. But the Lord showed kindness even then to those who laid hands on Him;
for although He healed the servant's ear by a miracle, yet He did not hinder
their hands from taking Him. Having bound Him they led Him away captive, that
the prophecy of Esaias should not come false, which said, that &quot;He was
brought as a Lamb to the slaughter.&quot; The Jews were pleased at His being
taken; and the traitor rejoiced as if he had done a good work.</p>
<p>Peter then follows to see the end, full of doubt and forethought on the
denial his Lord had foretold him should take place. He had been told that he
would deny Him; and he repelled that, saying, he would never do so. His
readiness was both good and becoming; but it was ignorance on his part: for he
did not know how far he was about to show himself weak and mean. He follows
anxiously and doubting: full of misgivings: his heart beating all the while. He
meets the maid, who says to him: &quot;Art thou not a Galilean also?&quot; But
Peter denies, and declares he is not. Yet that denial was not without meaning in
one who was to be witness of his Lord's Resurrection. For if He who had died,
was dead and not alive, then why should Peter think it fitting that he should be
crucified with his head downwards for One who was dead?<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>
Then Peter moves further, goes from his place, but not from his denial. When
about to speak, so troubled is he as to wish to change his language. &quot;Thou
art a Galilean, says the maid.&quot; Nay; I am not a Galilean, says Peter, with
a lip that betrays him. Yet see how he who was thus troubled in his speech by an
ignorant maid, afterwards persuaded even Roman orators. But we will presently
speak of the Resurrection; meanwhile let us tell more about the Cross.</p>
<p>The high priests, servants by birth, sat in council, and the Judge of all
stood before them as a servant. The lawyers themselves who had not learned the
law, asked Him: Art Thou the Son of God? like the devil, of whom the Lord had
said before, that he was their father. &quot;I adjure Thee, said the high
priest, tell me if Thou be the Son of the living God.&quot; Not that he cared to
know it; but he wished to destroy Him. Then they brought the King of the judge
before that judge. He stood before him &quot;like a sheep before his
shearer,&quot; as Esaias says. The judge trembled; not so the accusers. They
say: &quot;He maketh Himself a King,&quot; that His sentence might be
irrevocable. Then the wife of the judge, who had suffered in a dream because of
Him, sends a message to her husband; he was better disposed than the rest, he
even wished not to kill Him, but to release Him, and he commanded Him to be
scourged, in order to allay their fury; thus fulfilling the saying of the
prophet: &quot;With His stripes we are healed.&quot; But they cried with one
voice: &quot;Away with Him, away with Him, and crucify Him that might be
fulfilled what was said of the Lord: &quot;He lifted up his voice against
Me.&quot;</p>
<p>What crime could the Jews bring against Him? What blind man was there that
had not received sight, or lame that had not walked? Maybe some of those that
had once been healed by Him, were among them who then railed at Him. No doubt
many whose tongue He had loosed, cried against Him to please the Jews. I trow
that of them was said: &quot;What could be done to My vineyard that I have not
done to it? I looked that it should bring forth grapes, and behold, it hath
brought forth wild grapes.&quot; Pilate grew weary of denying the Jews their
request; but he was overcome by those shameless miscreants. He washed his hand,
because he had not soiled it: but they cried, that His blood might be on them
and on their children. If what they at first required had not been done, then He
would neither have been put to death nor risen again. While they prevailed in
their impious intreaties, while they raged in their savage fury, and the judge
refused to give way to their wickedness, they brought to pass and fulfilled the
truth of the prophet's words who, because he knew beforehand the malice of the
Jews, foretold that the Anointed of the Lord should suffer at their hands.
Pilate wished to stop their evil deeds, but he could not.</p>
<p>Jesus went forth out of the city, bearing Himself the Tree of His own Cross;
like another Isaac carrying the wood for the sacrifice. Will anyone say that
this was done without purpose? The daughters of Jerusalem wept on that occasion,
not knowing over whom they would have to weep. &quot;Weep over yourselves and
your children,&quot; said the Lord, &quot;and not over Me, for I am now
fulfilling that which I chose of Mine own free will.&quot; And they would weep
hitherto if He whom the Jews did away with was not risen again from the dead.
But now let us speak with joy of our salvation. Jesus went forth and walked
between malefactors; that it might be fulfilled, &quot;He was reckoned among the
transgressors.&quot; He who only did good, our Saviour and our Lord, went forth
among thieves and sinners.</p>
<p>And now the day of His crucifixion, was the day of Adam's transgression. God
created Adam on the sixth day; and on that day he transgressed. On that day too
Jesus became obedient and endured His sufferings at the sixth hour, when Adam
tasted of the fruit; that we should overcome in Christ at the same hour that we
were overwhelmed in Adam. The Tree of Life in the Garden, is the Tree of the
Cross. There was a woman, through whom sin came into the world; here is a virgin
who heard Him say: &quot;Behold thy mother.&quot; On that day Adam put forth his
hand for evil; and Jesus spread His holy arms for our good. Adam drew near to
the tree; and Jesus laid His hands and His feet on the Tree to which they were
fastened with nails. Adam tasted of the fruit through lust; and Jesus tasted of
vinegar mingled with bitter gall. Adam heard this sentence: The earth shall
bring forth to thee thorns and thistles. Our Jesus of His own will was crowned
with the thorns of Adam. Adam brought down a curse upon himself; but Jesus who
is blessed by them that are condemned, was hanged on the Tree as one accursed.</p>
<p>We run as it were in a race; one on the right, the other on the left; for the
types given by Moses are complete and realised. For as he went up the mountain
at the time when the people of God was fighting with Amalek, and Joshua the Son
of Nave, as leader, held out his rod in his hand, he showed beforehand the
figure of the Cross, with his arms and his rod. There Hur and Aaron, one on the
right hand of Moses, and the other on the left; and here two thieves, one on the
right and the other on the left of Jesus. And why thieves? that thou mayest
know, O sinner, that His sufferings were for such as thou art. One reviled; but
the other blessed.</p>
<p>And what didst thou see, O thief, or rather, O thou bringer of glad tidings
to us? Neither a sign nor a miracle. He is nailed to the Cross as well as thou;
and He tastes of gall which thou hast not drunk. He is crowned with thorns,
which thou hast not worn. Then one reviled and would not learn of his fellow.
What seest thou? A Man hanging on the Cross and the scorn of His foes, and thou
sayest: &quot;Remember me when Thou comest in Thy kingdom.&quot; What! dost thou
call Him Lord who is thus hanging on the Cross, sentenced to it by His Judges;
and is He a Judge who is thus condemned? Thou didst feel and acknowledge that He
was crucified for sinners, and was doing His utmost to give life to those that
were lost: for He is the Lamb slain and offered in sacrifice for many. What then
dost thou ask, O thou believer, and no longer thief?&#8212;That Thou wouldst
remember me in Thy kingdom. Thou askest a thing that is far and distant, but I
will give it thee at once. Thou hast not been slow in believing; and I will not
withhold My grace: today shalt thou be with Me in Paradise. So that he really
rose to Paradise, who was about to descend into hell to which he was doomed. And
why this day? Because while on this day Adam was driven from Paradise, at this
hour the thief opened it and went into it. And from the hour at which Adam ate
of the fruit of the garden until he left it, Jesus remained on the Cross, until
He fulfilled the spreading of Moses' hands towards heaven. &quot;They pierced My
hands and My feet,&quot; according to the saying of David. Gall in the cup is
offered because of Adam's lust to Him Who is crowned with thorns. In order that
the adversary should be put to shame, He carried the conquest of His enemy as
far as the Cross, and endured patiently his infamous treatment.</p>
<p>But in like manner as the heavens showed the place of the Nativity by means
of a brilliant star in the East, so also they made known how they mourned for
the sufferings of Christ, by withholding the light of the sun, in order to hide
the fury and audacity of His enemies. The light hid itself for three hours, as
long as the Sun of Righteousness remained on the Cross and in sufferings;
afterwards the sun reappeared, lest they might think night had arrived. But the
sun did not shrink from being darkened; it hid itself three hours in order to
represent as it were the stay of the Son of Man for three days and three nights
in the heart of the earth, and His appearing again. When the heavens withheld
their light and gave it back they proclaimed a miracle; and the earth shook at
the fight it could not bear. For it was fitting and becoming all creation to
bear witness of Him Who was suffering on the Cross. And the bosom and bars of
the earth were torn asunder in order to receive Him Who was free among the dead.</p>
<p>The types and examples of Joseph the patriarch, as handed down by the ancient
Jews, were realised in the Son Who was betrayed to death by them, and dwells for
ever with His Father,</p>
<p>Let us then abide by Jesus who endures Agony for our sake. At the foot of His
Cross thieves were crucified with Him, as being necessary to the fulfilment of
the dispensation, that we might learn how men do die, and how God was separated
from him by His will and not without it. Those who were subject to the law of
nature had their legs broken, that they should endure death according to that
nature. But He who had power to lay down His life and power to take it again in
like manner as He took of His own will and not against it, a body out of the
Virgin, also of His own accord and not otherwise made on the Cross, a separation
between His Spirit and His body. &quot;Father, in Thy hands I commit My
Spirit:&quot; not in the hands of the wicked who, reviled and reproached Him on
all sides. This is a great wonder: for He died willingly and not unwillingly;
and there need not of necessity be any pain connected with it, for when He will,
He gives up His Spirit.</p>
<p>He is then in every respect the One Only-begotten; for as He alone was
begotten of the Father, and He alone was born of the Virgin according to the
flesh, so also in death, He dies of His own will and not otherwise. Those who
heard this could hardly believe it, and they asked; Can a man give up the ghost
when he likes, of his own will? So that one of the soldiers who could not
believe that He was already dead, made a gash in His side with a spear, and some
in wonder said: &quot;Of a truth He was the Son of God.&quot; But why did he not
pierce with his spear the heart or other parts near it? Because it was where the
serpent hid his fangs. For Eve Was taken from Adam's side, and he who wishes to
heal the bite of the serpent, must cut the part in which the venom lies. It was
therefore fitting and right that one side should be wounded for another; that
the saying might come true; &quot;All things concerning Me have an end.&quot;</p>
<p>Mark also the day: for when the days of unleavened bread, then also the
passover of sufferings; and when the Lamb, then also Him that is without blemish
and without spot. If the reckoning of days does not exactly fit, care not for
it; for the Church makes no mistake in her reckoning, but the Jews have altered
their own. This day was the death of death, and the destruction of sin: this day
was the sacrifice offered for the propitiation of our sins, but the shame of our
foe. This was the beginning of our life, the signal of victory over the great
adversary. But of that death no one doubts; for all admit and confess it. The
Gentiles ridicule it; the Jews say: we put Him to death. But they will bear the
doom they have brought down upon themselves; while the Church rejoices in Jesus
Christ our Lord; to Whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
