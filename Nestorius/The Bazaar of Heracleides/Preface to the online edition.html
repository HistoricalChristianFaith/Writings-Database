<hr>

<p>Here are a few notes compiled from Bedjan and Nau, which may supplement the
information in the translation presented here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="center">I. Life of Nestorius (by Paul Bedjan)</h3>

<p>Bedjan gives a summary of the life of Nestorius.&nbsp; Material in quotes is
from a Syriac <i>Life</i> supposed by Nestorius himself, which he found in a
Persian manuscript, and of which he says,&nbsp; &quot;it was made from
manuscript 134 of the library of the American missionaries at Ourmiah.&nbsp; The
manuscript was written in 1558 AD.&quot;&nbsp; Page references are to this
manuscript.&nbsp; I have translated Bedjan's words fairly literally.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nestorius was born at Maras in Turkey (then Germanicia, in the province of
Syria Euphratensis).&nbsp; His teacher was Theodore, bishop of Mopsuestia.&nbsp;
He embraced the monastic life at Antioch, where he had been ordained priest.</p>
<p>When he was called to the see of Constantinople in 428, he delayed his
journey for two days, which he spent with his master.&nbsp; On their parting,
Theodore said to him, &quot;My son, I know you; I know that no woman has ever
brought into the world a man so zealous as you; this is why I counsel you to
moderate your zeal against the opinions of others . . . I rejoice in your
enthusiasm, but I will be grieved if you perish at the hands of wicked
men.&quot;</p>
<p>Nestorius made the presumptuous reply, &quot;Master, why do you speak
thus?&nbsp; If I lived in the times of our Lord, he would answer you: 'do you
others also wish to depart?'&nbsp; The advent of our Lord is all we need to eat;
the stomach that can digest this is nourished; that which does not is
uncomfortable.&quot;</p>
<p>After he arrived at Constantinople he was consecrated bishop on 10th April
428, and, ascending his episcopal throne for the first time, he addressed the
following famous words to the emperor, &quot;Sire, give me your empire purged of
heretics and I will give you the kingdom of Heaven.&nbsp; Give me power over the
heretics, and I, I will subjugate the Persians who make war on you.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The inhabitants of the city, hearing this bombast, were very
annoyed.&nbsp; But Nestorius, five days later, gave the order to set fire to the
churches of the Arians.&nbsp; Many houses also were caught in the flames, which
was a great affliction to the people.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nestorius boasts however of being very patient with the
heretics.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&quot;He abolished the circus games, the theatres, prohibited shouting,
singing, dancing and the other amusements to which the Romans were
devoted.&nbsp; This made him hated in the city.</p>

<p>&quot;After Nestorius had the ornaments which the emperor's sister Pulcheria
had given to the church removed, under the pretext that she had not completed
what she had promised, she lent her influence to Cyril against him.&nbsp;
Nestorius then had the portrait of her which was painted in the church
effaced.&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Nestorius says that he resigned as bishop of Constantinople.&nbsp; This is
confirmed by the author of his life, who adds, &quot;the tribune John was sent
to Ephesus and presented the resignation to the emperor, who accepted it, and
the seven bishops then returned home.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;After his resignation, he obtained as a great favour permission to
  return to his monastic cell at Antioch, and stayed there for four years.&nbsp;
  He was not unknown: his convent was close to the city, and the inhabitants
  visited him for instruction.&nbsp; The patriarch John became jealous of his
  popularity and wrote to the emperor. 'A woman cannot be the wife of two
  husbands,' he says symbolically, 'that is to say, a city cannot have two
  bishops.&nbsp; If Nestorius is to reside here, order that I be sent
  elsewhere.'&nbsp; The emperor, at the instigation of his sister Pulcheria,
  then sent him [Nestorius] into exile at the Oasis,&quot; in the Thebaid.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The history of the church does not mention this jealousy of John of Antioch,
but it tells of the evil that the insubordination of Nestorius caused in the
people who were sent to him, an insubordination in which he behaved increasingly
like a heresiarch. This led the patriarch and the bishops of the East to make
peace and union with those of Alexandria, a year after the Council of Ephesus,
in condemning Nestorius and his teaching.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;After the death of Theodosius, Marcian was chosen emperor;&nbsp; he
  recalled Nestorius and the 26 bishops who were exiled at the same time with
  him.&nbsp; To his friends, who urged him to return, Nestorius replied, 'The
  desert pleases me by its aridity.'&quot; (p.521)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The church histories and this Syriac biography agree that Nestorius only held
the see of Constantinople for 3 years; he lived in a cell at Antioch then for 4
or 5 years; in exile in the Thebaid for 15 years.&nbsp; In the <i>Bazaar</i> he
speaks of the death of Theodosius on the 28th July 450 AD.&nbsp; The author of
his life, together with Zacharias Rhetor (according to Philoxenus of Mabbug,
Assemani, Bibliotheca Orientalis II, p. 40, 55) pretends that he was called to
the council convoked on the 17th May 451 AD.&nbsp; If we believe these
statements, Nestorius must have lived in Africa from 436 to 451, which would be
the year of his death.</p>
<p>Assemani correctly denies this famous invitation of Nestorius to the
council.&nbsp; The idea was an invention of the Monophysites, in hatred of the
Catholic Church and St. Leo, who sought to represent all that happened there as
Nestorian.&nbsp; In fact the celebrated council of Chalcedon again condemned
Nestorius as a heretic.</p>
<p>The <i>Bazaar</i> speaks explicitly of the death of Theodosius (p. 506), but
makes no mention of Marcian who succeeded him on the 24th August, that is to say
27 days later.&nbsp; Had Nestorius really been invited to Chalcedon, he would
certainly have boasted of it in his writings, as despite repeated condemnations
over 20 years, he continued always to complain that he was being misrepresented!</p>
<p>On the next to last page of the <i>Bazaar</i>, the author speaks of the
Vandal barbarians who had invaded Sicily and even Rome.&nbsp; He adds with the
air of a prophet that they will return, that Leo will be obliged to give them
the sacred vessels with his own hands, and that he will see with his own eyes
the princesses, the daughters of the emperor, led into captivity.&nbsp; Here
Nestorius, who knew the celebrated letter of Leo and who speaks at such length
of the Robber-synod of Ephesus in 449, is silent about Marcian, silent about the
Council of Chalcedon at which he was again condemned, and mentions only two
invasions of Rome by the barbarians.&nbsp; History tells us that Attila invaded
Italy in 452, and was turned back by Leo; that Genseric came from Africa via
Sicily and pillaged Rome in 455 and captured two imperial princesses.&nbsp; For
these reasons it is necessary to believe that these great events were added
after the event by a forger who wanted to give the halo of a prophet to the
founder of the sect.&nbsp; In the manuscript, indeed, this last chapter has the
title &quot;Prophecy.&quot;</p>
<p>All this leads us to suppose that Nestorius died in 450 or 451.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A longer biography is given by Nau, with references.</p>
<h3 align="center">II. The manuscript</h3>
<p>The information that we have is rather unsatisfactory.&nbsp; Bedjan writes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Nestorius wrote in Greek.&nbsp; His works were condemned to be burned, so
  only a few sermons and letters have reached us, in either Greek or
  Latin.&nbsp; In the catalogue of Syriac writers drawn up by Ebedjesu, bishop
  of Nisibis, at the end of the 13th century, we see that Nestorius' work <i>On
  Tragedy</i>, his <i>Heracleides</i>, his letter to Come, his liturgy, a volume
  of letters, and another of sermons still existed in Syriac translation.&nbsp;
  Today only his liturgy and the <i>Bazaar</i> survive.</p>
  <p>The title of the <i>Bazaar</i> must be translated: <i>Liber inscriptus:
  Mercatura Heraclidis Damasceni, scriptus a D. Nestorio.</i>&nbsp; &quot;Tegourta&quot;
  which is translated &quot;Bazaar&quot; is no doubt the translation of the
  Greek <span class="Greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03B3;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>
  which signifies &quot;mercatura&quot; and also &quot;tractatus&quot; (philosophiae
  vel theologiae) [i.e. treatise of philosophy or theology].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A single manuscript of the Syriac translation of the <i>Bazaar</i> survived
to the end of the 19th century, at which time it was found in the library of the
Nestorian patriarch.&nbsp; That dignitary had found it necessary for his own
safety to base himself at Kotchanes in the mountains of Kurdistan. Bedjan tells
us that the Syriac translation was made
around 535 at the time of the patriarch Paul,&nbsp; and according to
notes in the copy of it at Ourmiah (ms. 147), it was about 800 years old.&nbsp;
The manuscript was mutilated.&nbsp; This mainly happened in 1843, during a
famous massacre carried out by a Kurdish chief and Turkish official, Bader Khan
Bey, against the Christians.&nbsp; Bedjan tells us that he has met survivors of
the massacre himself in Persia.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Based upon the blank pages in the manuscripts which I have seen myself and
  some small notes of the copyist, I calculate that in the text as far as p. 146
  of my edition some 55 pages of text are missing; to page 161, 42 pages are
  missing; to page 209, 36 pages are missing.&nbsp; This calculation can only be
  approximate.&nbsp; Also there are some passages where a number of lines have
  been left blank, and in other places small sections are unreadable through
  age.</p>
  <p>A copy was made from this manuscript by the priest Ouchana in 1889,
  secretly and in haste, for the library of the American missionaries at Ourmiah.&nbsp;
  Two copies were made from this copy. One was made for Cambridge, and the other
  for Strasbourg.&nbsp; I have both of these here with me.&nbsp; In addition, I
  have obtained a third manuscript from Kurdistan, one part of which was written
  at Van and the other at Kotchanes directly from the famous manuscript of the
  patriarch.&nbsp; Because I received both parts from Van, I have referred to
  them both under the same name [of Van].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A footnote thanks the Rev. Bethune-Baker for loaning the Cambridge copy to
Bedjan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is quite unclear how a copy could be written at Van unless a further copy
had been made sometime, or else the manuscript had travelled there.&nbsp;
Bedjan's words are repeated by Driver and Hodgson. Francois Nau's introduction,
p.xxii ff, elaborates the story and supplies additional detail.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The unique manuscript preserved at Kotchanes belongs to the 11th or 12th
century. ...</p>

  <p>From this manuscript, a copy was taken in secret and in haste in 1889 by
  the priest Auscha`n&acirc;, for the library of the American missionaries at Ourmiah,
  cf. <i>infra</i>, p. 4 note 5.&nbsp; All the copies derive from this copy of
  Ourmiah, apart from that (<i>V</i>) which P. Bedjan had made, part at Van
  (coming from Kotchanes) and part at Kotchanes itself.</p>

  <p>From the Ourmiah copy there were made:</p>

  <p>1. A copy for the university of Strasbourg by the efforts of the abb&eacute; H.
  Goussen, cf. <i>Martyrius Sahdona's Leben und Werke</i>, Lepizig, 1897, p. 15,
  note 1, and the analysis of A. Baumstark in <i>Oriens Christianus</i>, t. III
  (1903), p. 517-520.</p>

  <p>2. Two copies for Messrs. Parry and Jenks, the first of whom was the leader
  and the other a member of the English mission at Ourmiah.&nbsp; [A footnote
  tells us that while the US mission was founded in 1836, there was a mission
  sent out from England around 1890 by the Archbishop of Canterbury at the
  request of the Nestorian patriarch].&nbsp; Jenks' copy was first placed at the
  disposal of Bethune-Baker, and was translated for him by one of his friends in
  order to be used for his book, <i>Nestorius and his teaching</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Jenks' copy is currently in Cambridge University Library.&nbsp; Parry's copy
was donated to the British Library.&nbsp; In common with so many manuscripts at
that institution since WW1, it has been effectively unavailable to those who
could use it.&nbsp; Nau continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3. A copy in 1899 for Rendel Harris, which can now be found at Harvard
  college in the USA.&nbsp; Cf. Bethune-Baker, <i>loc. cit.</i> p. xiv-xv.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Bethune-Baker's book (Cambridge, 1908) is online at <a href="http://books.google.com">google
book</a>, although only to US readers.&nbsp; Bethune-Baker tells us (p.xiv-xv)
that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...I learn from Mr. O. H. Parry, the head of the Archbishop of Canterbury's
Mission to the Assyrian Christians at Urmi ... that members of the mission had
long been acquainted with the book, and that several copies had been made.</p>

<p>Mr. D. Jenks, a former member of the mission (1892-99) was the first to learn
of the MS [the copy in the American library at Ourmiah] and to procure a copy of
it.&nbsp; A copy was also obtained by Dr. Rendel Harris in 1899.&nbsp; (This
copy is now, I understand, at Harvard.)&nbsp; Mr. Parry himself has had a copy
by him for the last seven years and has made a translation of part of it. ... Mr
Jenks, now a member of the House of the Sacred Mission, ... brought [his copy]
back with him to England in 1899 and has kindly placed his copy at my disposal
for use in this fresh examination of the teaching of Nestorius.</p>

<p>A friend, who is an expert Syriac scholar, has been good enough to make a
translation of it for me, and it is his translation which I have used whenever
the book is referred to or quoted.&nbsp; ... I should have wished his name to
appear on the title page.&nbsp; But his standpoint on matters concerning the
church and church doctrine is not the same as mine.&nbsp; He would not treat the
subject as a whole as I have treated it, nor would he wish to associate himself
with all the inferences which I have drawn from the fresh evidence which is now
available.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>SPCK announced ca. 1920 that a translation prepared by Norman McLean, also a
Cambridge don would be forthcoming, so I think that we may presume that he was
the anonymous friend referred to.&nbsp; No such work was published,
however.&nbsp; The whereabouts of this translation are now unknown.&nbsp; I
queried whether it had been deposited at Cambridge University Library, but they
have little by McLean other than a couple of letters.</p>

<p>Nau adds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1903 the manuscript at Strasbourg (S) had already been copied and
  vocalised by Fr. Bedjan, and the abb&eacute; Ermoni began to translate the work into
  Latin from this copy.&nbsp; He halted after completing around a third of the
  work and had to abandon it at that point.&nbsp; ... It was in 1909 that Fr. P.
  Bedjan asked me to translate the <i>Book of Heraclides</i> from the
  proof-sheets of his edition.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Bedjan continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These various copies have allowed me to verify the text, to fill up
  accidental gaps, and to compensate, to a certain degree, for the absence of
  the ancient manuscript, of which I have not been able to have knowledge.&nbsp;
  ...</p>

  <p>The Cambridge copy is of a very nice calligraphy and is the only one that
  is vocalised, although often in a very defective manner.&nbsp; The proper
  names are mispronounced, especially towards the beginning. [Problems with the
  name Sophronius] Sophronius, bishop of Tella, was excommunicated at the Robber
  council led by Disocorus as a partisan of Nestorius.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A footnote adds that the details about Sophronius can be found in Assemani, <i>B.O.</i>
t. 1, pp. 202, 402.&nbsp; He was the cousin of Ibas, it is said.&nbsp; He was
reintroduced at Chalcedon, after which he was obliged to anathemise Nestorius. (Labbe,
t. IV, 623 D).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the different copies we can see that each has tried to reproduce the old
  manuscript, and each has placed the second folio where the first should be,
  and vice-versa.&nbsp; The copyists through an excess of scrupulousness have
  followed this false pagination.&nbsp; I have placed the pages back in their
  natural order.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>During the First World War there were very significant losses of
manuscripts.&nbsp; The library at Ourmiah was destroyed, although a few books
were saved.&nbsp; Presumably the ancient ms. of Kotchanes was also lost.&nbsp;
The whereabouts of the Van copy is also unknown to me.&nbsp; The Strasbourg and
Cambridge copies still exist.&nbsp; If anyone has any additional information, I
would be most glad to hear of it.</p>
