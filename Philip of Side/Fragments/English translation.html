<p>As Philip of Side says in the 24th <i>logos</i>:<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"
title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Athenagoras was the first to lead the school<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"
title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a>
in Alexandria; he flourished in the times of Hadrian and Antoninus,<a
href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a>
to whom also he addressed his <i>Embassy-speech</i><a
href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a>on behalf of the Christians&#8212;a man who
lived as a Christian in the very philosophers' cloak, and who was at the head
of the Academic school.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a>&nbsp;
This man&#8212;before Celsus&#8212;was eager to write against the Christians, but when he
read the divine Scriptures in order to make his arguments more precisely, he
was seized by the Holy Spirit in such a way that, like the great Paul, he
became a teacher instead of a persecutor of the faith which he was
persecuting.&nbsp; Philip says that Clement, the author of the <i>Stromateis</i>, became a student of this man,
and Pantaenus [a student] of Clement.&nbsp; And Pantaenus himself was also an
Athenian, and a Pythagorean philosopher.&nbsp; But Eusebius says that Pantaenus
became Clement's teacher&#8212;and he mentions him as a teacher in his <i>Hypotyposeis</i>.&nbsp; And this
Pantaenus,
according to Philip, had Origen as student and successor in the headship of the
school after him.&nbsp; But according to Eusebius, [it was] Clement and after
Clement, Origen.&nbsp; Still, in one way or another, Origen was fourth head of the
Christian school.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a>&nbsp;
After Origen, Heraclas; after him, Dionysius; after him, Pierius; after Pierius,
Theognostus; after him, Serapion; after him, Peter the Great, the
bishop, who became a martyr.&nbsp; After Peter, Macarius, whom his fellow-countrymen
called &quot;Politicus&quot;; after him, Didymus; after Didymus, Rhodon, who
moved the school, according to Philip, to the city of Side, the same [as
Philip's home city], at the time of Theodosius the Great.&nbsp; Philip says that he was
a student of this Rhodon, concerning whose knowledge of literature / argument,<a
href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a>
both our own and that of those outside [the Church], he provides copious
attestation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The teachers:<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"
title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Athenagoras (1); Pantaenus (2); Origen (3); Heraclas (4); Dionysius (5);
Clement (6); Pierius (7); Theognostus (8); Serapion (9); Peter the martyr (10);

[From the
Story of Cassander]</h4>

<p>[p. 5]</p>

<p>11. Cassander
died, leaving behind a sister, called Doris; she was the daughter of Pylades,
who had been killed in Greece.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Attalus the king of the Lacedaemonians<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"
title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a>
lusted after her; and when they went to bed together, she, having a sword
inside [the room], planted it in his heart and took control of the kingdom.&nbsp;
And once this had happened, she acquired<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"
title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a>
great fear.&nbsp; And his brother Philip went to live in Achaea<a href="#_ftn24"
name="_ftnref24" title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a>
and there taking as wife the sister of Calliopus their general, named Alisbis
[p. 6], he was seeking to destroy Doris and her people.&nbsp; And they were afraid.&nbsp;
For all the peoples around her, being enamored of her beauty, were helping
her.&nbsp; For she would not give herself in marriage to just anyone.</p>

<p>But since they
were all afraid of her&#8212;for she had attacked many and had destroyed them all&#8212;the
Achaeans decided at that time to send an embassy to Delphi and to receive an
oracle there about this matter.&nbsp; And they, after setting out, asked Euoptia the
priestess at the water of the Castalian [spring], for themselves to know the
object of their coming.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a>&nbsp;
She, having tasted the spring water, answered thus:&nbsp; &quot;Philip, &lt;child of
Olympias, of Pella, going to places above Asia&gt;, will strike the higher ring
that circles everything with his all-powerful arm.&quot;<a href="#_ftn26"
name="_ftnref26" title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p>12. But they,
deriding and cursing her, said:&nbsp; &quot;Thrice-accursed one, we asked about a woman;
we did not ask about a man who came from Macedonia, did we?&quot;&nbsp; But she said
to them that unconquerable times<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a>
had begun to arise; for indeed she herself [i.e., the woman] and that man, and
those with him, would vanquish everyone.</p>

<p>And they
departed, with insults for the prophetess, and went off to the temple of
Athens.&nbsp; And while a priestly cloth was being woven and fine purple was being
applied to it, they came with a will and burst in.&nbsp; The priestess, Xanthippe,
said to them with a burst of anger:&nbsp; &quot;You have entered here at an evil
hour, you reckless and unruly<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a>
ones!&quot;&#8212;and they, becoming displeased in turn, mistreated her and said:&nbsp;
&quot;You are unworthy of any honor; [p. 8] you are foreign to the priestly
disposition&#8212;and you are disgracing the purple, which the gods granted to
royalty, by which those who wear it possess honor and glory.&nbsp; Stop speaking
strange things!&nbsp; Depart from your wineless drunkenness, you arrogant
huckster!&quot;&nbsp; But she said to them:&nbsp; &quot;You have brought these charges
not against me, but against those who cannot be insulted.<a href="#_ftn29"
name="_ftnref29" title=""><sup>[29]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Nevertheless, receive a secure oracle and go your way:&nbsp; 'A certain youthful
man, who is the effectual conception of a mingling bed, having the
unconquerable weight of God's unconquerable scale,<a href="#_ftn30"
name="_ftnref30" title=""><sup>[30]</sup></a>
will circle the boundless world like an egg, capturing<a href="#_ftn31"
name="_ftnref31" title=""><sup>[31]</sup></a>
all with his spear.'&quot;&nbsp; But they, blowing on her,<a href="#_ftn32"
name="_ftnref32" title=""><sup>[32]</sup></a>
withdrew, speaking unlawful things against the gods.&nbsp; And they said, &quot;We
do ourselves no good, if we do not go to Phoebus Apollo the Great!&quot;</p>

<p>13. And they
went to the temple of Apollo and said by way of entreaty:&nbsp; &quot;You victorious
and pure well-pleasing<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><sup>[33]</sup></a>
gods, why do you treat your servants in this way&#8212;asking<a href="#_ftn34"
name="_ftnref34" title=""><sup>[34]</sup></a>
to win a womanly war?&nbsp; You throw us into a warlike war!&nbsp; Do not act this way,
you immortals, true masters, who have granted to us the greatest material
things as gifts; instead, give us clear signs.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35"
title=""><sup>[35]</sup></a>&nbsp;
What, then, will happen to us?&quot;&nbsp; And immediately a voice came in invisibly
speaking as follows:&nbsp; &quot;The tripod turning a third turn, the prophet is the
root;<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><sup>[36]</sup></a>
[p. 9] for [there are] three-fold of these [oracles]; a certain light-bringer,
heaven-sent to earth's plain, passing by,<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37"
title=""><sup>[37]</sup></a>
dwells within matter, forming for himself a body in the womb of a maiden.&nbsp; And
her name is twice seventy-six.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><sup>[38]</sup></a>&nbsp;
He, demolishing the lordships and every holy object of your reverence,<a
href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><sup>[39]</sup></a>
will transfer the reward of all glory to the heights of his all-blessed
wisdom.&quot;</p>

[Aphroditianus'
Story]<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><sup>[40]</sup></a></h4>

<p>[p. 11]</p>

<p>19. Christ was
known to Persia<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><sup>[41]</sup></a>
from the beginning.&nbsp; For nothing escapes the learned jurists of that country,
who investigate all things with the utmost care. The facts, therefore, which
are inscribed upon the golden tablets,<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42"
title=""><sup>[42]</sup></a>
and laid up in the royal temples,<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><sup>[43]</sup></a>
I shall announce&#8212;for it is from the temples there, and the priests connected
with them,<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><sup>[44]</sup></a>
that the name of Christ has first been heard of.&nbsp; The temple of Hera,
surpassing even the royal palace, which temple King Cyrus, who was
knowledgeable in all piety, built, and erected golden and silver statues of the
gods in it, and adorned it<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><sup>[45]</sup></a>
with precious stones&#8212;not to digress with a detailed description of that
ornamentation...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now about that
time (as the inscribed tablets testify), the king having entered the temple,
with the view of getting a dream-interpretation, was addressed by the priest
Prupippus<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><sup>[46]</sup></a>
thus:&nbsp; &quot;I congratulate you,<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><sup>[47]</sup></a>
master:&nbsp; Hera has conceived.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And the king,
smiling, said to him, &quot;Has she who is dead conceived?&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And he said,
&quot;Yes, she who was dead has come to life again, and begets life.&quot;&nbsp; [p.
12]</p>

<p>20. And the
king said,&nbsp; &quot;What is this?&nbsp; Explain it to me.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And he
replied, &quot;In truth, master, you have come here at just the right time. For
over the whole night the images, both the males and the females, continuously
danced, saying to each other, 'Come, let us congratulate<a href="#_ftn48"
name="_ftnref48" title=""><sup>[48]</sup></a>
 Hera.'&nbsp; And they said to me, 'Prophet, come forward; congratulate Hera, for she
has been loved.'&nbsp; And I said, 'Who was able to be loved<a href="#_ftn49"
name="_ftnref49" title=""><sup>[49]</sup></a>&#8212;she
who does not exist?'&nbsp; They reply, 'She has come to life again, and is no longer
called Hera, but Urania.<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><sup>[50]</sup></a>&nbsp;
For the mighty Helios has loved her.' Then the females say to the males,
disparaging the matter, 'Pege<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><sup>[51]</sup></a>
is she who was loved; for it was not Hera, was it? She espoused a carpenter.'&nbsp;
And the males say, 'She has rightly been called Pege, we admit.&nbsp; But her name
is Myria;<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><sup>[52]</sup></a>
for she bears in her womb, as in the sea, a vessel conveying a myriad.&nbsp; And if
she is also [called] Pege, let it be understood thus:&nbsp; This stream of water
sends forth a perennial stream of spirit; it contains but a single fish, taken
with the hook of divinity, and with its own flesh sustaining the whole world,
while it dwells [there] as though in the sea. You have well said,&nbsp; &quot;She
has a carpenter&quot;<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><sup>[53]</sup></a>&#8212;but
not a carpenter whom she bears from a marriage-bed.<a href="#_ftn54"
name="_ftnref54" title=""><sup>[54]</sup></a>&nbsp;
For this carpenter who is born, the child of the chief carpenter, framed by his
most sagacious skill the triple-constructed celestial roof,<a href="#_ftn55"
name="_ftnref55" title=""><sup>[55]</sup></a>
and established by his word this dwelling with its triple habitations.'<a
href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><sup>[56]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Thus, then, the statues continued to dispute with each other concerning Hera
and Pege, and [at length] with one voice they said:&nbsp; 'When the day is brought
to completion, we all, male and female, [p. 13] shall know the matter
clearly.'&nbsp; Now, therefore, master, tarry for the rest of the day.&nbsp; For the
matter shall certainly receive full clarity.&nbsp; For that which has emerged is no
common affair.&quot;<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p>21. And when
the king remained there and was watching the statues, the harpers of their own
accord began to strike their harps, and the Muses began to sing; and all the
creatures that were within [the temple], whether quadrupeds or birds (made of
silver and gold), were uttering their own characteristic voices.&nbsp; And as the
king shuddered, and was filled with great fear&#8212;he was about to withdraw, for he
could not endure the spontaneous tumult&#8212;the priest said to him, &quot;Remain, O
King, for the full revelation is at hand which the God of gods has chosen to
make plain to us.&quot;</p>

<p>22. And when
these things had been said, the roof was opened, and a bright star descended
and stood above the pillar<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><sup>[58]</sup></a>
of Pege, and a voice was heard to this effect:&nbsp; &quot;Mistress Pege, the great
Sun<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><sup>[59]</sup></a>
has sent me to make the announcement to you, and at the same time to serve you
in your giving birth&#8212;as he produces blameless offspring with you, who are
becoming mother of the first of all ranks [of being], bride of the single
divinity with three names. And the child born without seed is called the
Beginning and the End:&nbsp; the beginning of salvation, and the end of
destruction.&quot;</p>

<p>When this
voice had spoken, all the statues fell upon their faces, with Pege alone still
standing, on whom also a royal diadem was found to have been fastened, having
on its upper side a star set with precious stones of carbuncle and emerald.&nbsp;
And up above [i.e., in the sky], the star stood still.<a href="#_ftn60"
name="_ftnref60" title=""><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p>23. And the
king forthwith gave orders<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><sup>[61]</sup></a>
to bring in all the wise interpreters of signs, as many as were under his
dominion. And when the heralds hurried them along with their trumpets, they all
assembled in the temple.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And when they
saw the star [p. 14] above Pege, and the diadem with the starry stone, and the
statues lying on the floor, they said:&nbsp; &quot;O king, a divinely inspired and
royal root has risen, bearing the stamp of a heavenly and earthly king.&nbsp; For
Pege is the daughter of Karia the Bethlehemite,<a href="#_ftn62"
name="_ftnref62" title=""><sup>[62]</sup></a>
and the diadem is a kingly mark, and the star is a celestial announcement of
marvels on the earth. Out of Judah has arisen a kingdom which shall destroy all
the memorials of the Jews.<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><sup>[63]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And the prostration of the gods upon the floor anticipated the end of their
honor.&nbsp; For he who comes, being of more ancient dignity, shall shake those who
are new in it [i.e., dignity]. Now therefore, O king, send to Jerusalem.&nbsp; For
you will find the Son of the Omnipotent God being carried in bodily form in the
bodily arms of a woman.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And the star
remained above Pege, who has been named Urania, until the <i>magi</i> went forth, and then it went with
them.</p>

<p>24. And then,
in the depth of evening, Dionysus appeared in the temple, unaccompanied by the
satyrs, and said to the statues:&nbsp; &quot;Pege is no longer one of us, but stands
far above us, since she gives birth to a human being who was conceived by
divine Fortune.&nbsp;&nbsp; O priest Prupippus!&nbsp; What are you doing sitting here? An
action, indicated in writing, has proceeded against us, and we are going to be
convicted [p. 15] as false by a person in action.&nbsp; The apparitions we produced,
we produced; and that which we ruled, we ruled.<a href="#_ftn64"
name="_ftnref64" title=""><sup>[64]</sup></a>
No longer do we give oracular responses.&nbsp; Removed from us is our honour. We
have become without honor and glory.&nbsp; There is one, one alone, out of all, who has
received again his proper honour.&quot;</p>

<p>25. They
said:&nbsp; &quot;Do not be disturbed.<a name="fna_v.iv-p22.2"></a><a href="#_ftn65"
name="_ftnref65" title=""><sup>[65]</sup></a>
&nbsp;No longer do the Persians exact tribute of earth and air.&nbsp; For he who
established these things is at hand, and he brings tribute of <i>actions</i> to him who sent him&#8212;he who renews
the ancient image, and puts image together with image, and brings the unlike to
likeness.<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><sup>[66]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Heaven rejoices with earth, and earth itself boasts at receiving heaven's
boast.<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><sup>[67]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Things which have not happened above, have happened below.&nbsp; He whom the order
of the blessed has not seen, is viewed by the [order of] the miserable.&nbsp; Flame
threatens those; dew is present for these.&nbsp; It [was] the good fortune of Karia
to give birth to Pege in Bethlehem, and it [is] Pege's grace to become
heaven-desired and to conceive grace of grace.<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68"
title=""><sup>[68]</sup></a>
Judaea has bloomed, and our affairs are withering immediately.<a href="#_ftn69"
name="_ftnref69" title=""><sup>[69]</sup></a>&nbsp;
To Gentiles and foreigners, salvation has come; to the wretched, relief is
provided in abundance.&nbsp; Rightly do the women dance, and say, 'Lady Pege,
Stream-bearer, you who have become mother of the heavenly light-giver, you
cloud that brings the world dew after heat, remember your servants, dear
mistress.'&quot;<a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p>26. The king
then, without delay, sent the <i>magi</i>
under his dominion<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><sup>[71]</sup></a>
with gifts, with the star showing them the way.&nbsp; And when they returned, they
narrated everything to the men of that time&#8212;those very things which were also
written on leaves of gold, to the following effect:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>27. For when
we came to Jerusalem, the sign, together with our arrival, [p. 16] disturbed
everyone.&nbsp; They say, &quot;What is this?&nbsp; Wise men of the Persians are here,
and along with them an appearance of a star?&quot;&nbsp; And the foremost of the
Jews asked us what was going to happen, and the reason for our coming.&nbsp; And we
said:&nbsp; &quot;He whom you call 'Messiah' has been born.&quot; And they were
confounded, and dared not oppose us.&nbsp; But they, for their part, said to us,
&quot;Justice of Heaven!&nbsp; Tell us what you know.&quot;&nbsp; And we said to them:&nbsp;
&quot;You have the disease of unbelief; and neither without an oath nor with an
oath do you believe, but you follow your own ill-advised intentions.&nbsp; For the
Christ, the child of the Most High, has been born, putting an end to of your
law and synagogues.&nbsp; And it is for this reason that, struck as it were by a
most excellent oracle<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><sup>[72]</sup></a>
as with a dart, you do not hear with pleasure this name which has come up
against you suddenly.&quot;&nbsp; And they then, taking counsel together, urged us
to accept their gifts, and tell no one such a thing [as the news] from this
land [of theirs], lest a revolt rise against us.<a href="#_ftn73"
name="_ftnref73" title=""><sup>[73]</sup></a>&nbsp;
But we said:&nbsp; &quot;We have brought gifts in his honor, with the view of
proclaiming those mighty things which have happened in our country on occasion
of his birth&#8212;and you bid us take your gifts, and conceal the things which have
been made known to us by celestial divinity, and neglect the commandments of
our own king?&nbsp; Or do you not know what an experience of the Assyrians you once
received?&quot;&nbsp; And they became afraid, and after beseeching us repeatedly,
they sent us away.</p>

<p>When the one
who was ruling over Judaea sent for us [p. 17] and had some converse with us,
and asked us questions, we said to him [things] at which he was thoroughly
disturbed.<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title=""><sup>[74]</sup></a>&nbsp;
We departed from him, without giving any greater heed to him than to any
worthless person.</p>

<p>28. And we
came to that place to which we had been sent, and saw the one who had given
birth and the one who had been born, the star indicating to us the lordly
babe.&nbsp; And we said to the mother:&nbsp; &quot;What are you called, O renowned
mother?&quot;&nbsp; And she says:&nbsp; &quot;Mary, masters.&quot;&nbsp; And we said to her:&nbsp;
&quot;Where do you come from?&quot;&nbsp; And she said:&nbsp; &quot;From this
district&#8212;[the district] of the Bethlehemites.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Have you not taken
a husband?&quot;&nbsp; She says:&nbsp; &quot;I have only been betrothed, with only
pre-nuptial arrangements having been concluded; but my thoughts are divided.&nbsp;
For I had no wish at all to come to this [state of affairs].&nbsp; But while I was
giving very little concern to it, at the dawn of a certain Sabbath&#8212;at the
rising of the sun&#8212;an angel straightway appeared to me bringing me the good news
of offspring, all of a sudden.&nbsp; And I was disturbed, and cried out, 'Let it not
be so to me, Lord, for I do not have a husband.'&nbsp; And he persuaded me to
believe, that it was by the will of God that I would have the son.&quot;&nbsp; And
we said to her:&nbsp; &quot;Mother of mothers, all the gods of the Persians have
called you blessed:&nbsp; Your grounds for boasting are great, for you have
transcended all women of renown, and you have become manifestly more queenly
than all queens.&quot;</p>

<p>29. The child,
moreover, was seated on the ground, being, as she said, nearly two years old,
and having in part the likeness of the one who bore him.&nbsp; For she was small in
stature even when holding her head up, and had a delicate body; and she was the
color of wheat; and she had her hair bound up with a simple, very beautiful
hair-style.&nbsp; And as we had along with [p. 18] us a servant quite skilled in
painting, we brought back with us to our country a likeness of them both; and
it was placed in the temple in which the oracle was given,<a href="#_ftn75"
name="_ftnref75" title=""><sup>[75]</sup></a>
with the following inscription:&nbsp; &quot;In the heaven-sent<a href="#_ftn76"
name="_ftnref76" title=""><sup>[76]</sup></a>
temple, the power of Persia dedicated this to Zeus Helios, the great God, King
Jesus.&quot;</p>

<p>And taking the
child up, and bearing him in our arms, each of us in turn, we saluted him and
worshipped him, and presented to him gold,<a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77"
title=""><sup>[77]</sup></a>
addressing Him thus:&nbsp; &quot;[We give] to you what is your own; we lavish you
[with gifts], O powerful one in heaven.&nbsp; Things unordered would be ordered in
no way other than by your presence.&nbsp; In no other way could things above be
brought into conjunction with things below, but by your descent.&nbsp; Service is
not carried out to such a degree, if only a servant is sent, as when the
[master] himself is present; neither [can so much be achieved] when the king
sends only his satraps to war, as when he is there himself.&nbsp; It was quite
fitting for your methods, for you to deal in this manner with the rebels.&quot;<a
href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78" title=""><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p>And the child
smiled and leaped at our fawning and our words. And when we had bidden the
mother farewell, and when she had shown us honor, and we had glorified her as
was necessary, we went to the place in which we lodged.</p>

<p>30. And when
evening came, there appeared to us someone terrifying and awesome,<a
href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title=""><sup>[79]</sup></a>
saying:&nbsp; &quot;Get away quickly, lest you fall prey to a plot.&quot;&nbsp; And we,
in fear, said:&nbsp; &quot;And who is it that is plotting against so august [p. 19]
an embassy, O general of God?&quot;&nbsp; And he replied:&nbsp; &quot;Herod&#8212;but get up
immediately and depart in safety and peace.&quot;&nbsp; And we speedily mounted our
strong steeds and departed from there in all earnestness; and we reported all
that we had seen in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Behold, then,
such great things have we told you regarding Christ; and we know that Christ
has become our Savior.<a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" title=""><sup>[80]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But you, by
your ways, are opposed to him, slandering his pain and suffering all the time.&nbsp;
For speaking unworthy things, and doing still more unworthy things, are a mark
of hatred.<a href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81" title=""><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>[p. 45]</p>

<p>84. ...And the
same <i>presbyter</i> [i.e., Philip]
recounted<a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82" title=""><sup>[82]</sup></a>
that the day on which the star appeared in the temple&#8212;that same day, every
year, until the Lord was taken up [into heaven], all the statues would produce<a
href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83" title=""><sup>[83]</sup></a>
their characteristic utterance, and so that entire city there was transfixed,
beholding the great marvels and the yearly appearance of the star.</p>

<p>[p. 31]</p>

<p>52. &quot;Why
should I unfold<a href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84" title=""><sup>[84]</sup></a>
the Hebrews' prophecies and not our own?&nbsp; Ophianus [p. 32] Pertillaeus<a
href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" title=""><sup>[85]</sup></a>
spoke in his 'Laws' as follows:&nbsp; 'Oh my!&nbsp; How the Caspian Gate has been
adorned&#8212;it has received a mountain stone, which hands did not hew out, but
rather <i>grace</i> discovered, and
narrowed the whole Gate all around by means of it.&nbsp; Not only did it strengthen
it, but it also opened it when it had been closed&#8212;the stone having become way
and door.&nbsp; The door leads to an august door, and the way draws one to a pure way,
as all those who see it shout:&nbsp; &quot;Great is the dominion of the gods, whose
will for action is more easily realized.&quot;'<a href="#_ftn86"
name="_ftnref86" title=""><sup>[86]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And Elibatus, who wrote down innumerable laws, when speaking <i>On</i> <i>Eucles</i>
towards the end<i>,</i><a href="#_ftn87"
name="_ftnref87" title=""><sup>[87]</sup></a>
says, 'A frightful cloud settled upon a mountain and cast a single stone upon
the earth, and strengthened all its foundations.&nbsp; And how shall a single stone
prevail over the entire [earth]?&nbsp; Did not one God alone create the universe?'&nbsp;
And Trachelaphius, speaking <i>Against the
Falsely-Named</i>, demonstrates his mastery also in the following solid
reasoning:<a href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88" title=""><sup>[88]</sup></a>&nbsp;
'Who deceived those who trust in Dionysus so as to say about him that he, being
forever without a beginning, was born from an unravished virgin?&nbsp; They clothe
him with another's dignity.&nbsp; For the one without a beginning, being<a
href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89" title=""><sup>[89]</sup></a>
of the substance that is forever without beginning, takes hold of mortal
substance without receiving it as a violation.&nbsp; For that which he formed, he
shall not consider an violation, when he takes it up.&nbsp; There, a virgin&#8212;[p. 33]
unsullied in her body and having no falsehood in her tongue&#8212;supplies virginal
flesh; [this process is the] activation of all grace dwelling within [her].<a
href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90" title=""><sup>[90]</sup></a>&nbsp;
I marvel at the flux-bound taking hold of the flux-free&#8212;knowing this:&nbsp; that
some have been deified on account of their promulgation of laws; others,
because of their nobility of life and their conspicuous purity in other
respects, because of which it is fitting to honor them; but to go after
heavenly honors is beyond all audacity and above all blasphemy.'&quot;</p>

...&quot;There have been Christians [p. 20] indeed, but there have also been
pagans,<a href="#_ftn91" name="_ftnref91" title=""><sup>[91]</sup></a>
who practiced the utmost virtue.&nbsp; King Cyrus had very attractive female
bodyguards<a href="#_ftn92" name="_ftnref92" title=""><sup>[92]</sup></a>
where he slept:&nbsp; he was sharpening his desire, but also correcting it by such
trials.&nbsp; He used to say that all glory was worthy of the heavenly power alone.&nbsp;
He loved his fellow man so much that there was no poor man or even the least
captive in Persian territory, because of his constant bestowing of benefits
upon everyone.&nbsp; And Concencrates,<a href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93" title=""><sup>[93]</sup></a>
who was truly a philosopher, possessed one single rough cloak&#8212;he lived near the
peak of Masgabala, being terribly worn out by the snow and cold; and the wise
Neoctetius said to him:&nbsp; 'You will perish, wise man, and die because of the
heat and cold.'&nbsp; And he said:&nbsp; 'If I die to those here [on earth], I shall live
by my future hope.'&nbsp; He asked:&nbsp; 'What [hope] is that?'&nbsp; And the other said,
'Truly, I am directing my attention to a certain other life, and offering myself
myself to it.&nbsp; For the Providence of God will not disregard those who have
labored during the day:&nbsp; in the evening it will deem them worthy of reward and
rest.&nbsp; Every day I see the heavens and the things of earth that seem good
diminishing and decaying.&nbsp; And this takes place because of our &quot;exasperations,&quot;<a href="#_ftn94" name="_ftnref94" title=""><sup>[94]</sup></a>
which show beforehand that everything here below perishes.&nbsp; But those who have
acquired the virtues above do not die, as they are spoken about and answered
with eternal remembrance by them.'&nbsp; This man only ate fruit, and drank a little
water once a day, not wishing to know anything else [p. 21] of what belongs to
the world, [but] practicing death every day.&nbsp; And this is sufficient.&nbsp; And
Dichorianus, who published so many things about God, and who used to say that
he was nourished by these things, and not by those which harm the body&#8212;after
preserving impassibility of body and mind for 90 years, while he was dying
said:&nbsp; 'Glory to you, righteous Justice, who changed my [mind] regarding what
was honorable.'&nbsp; And there are many others of whom the book-lovers know&#8212;both
Christians and true philosophers.&nbsp; But let us leave off for today, and tomorrow
we [will] inquire into the rest.&nbsp; If it is desired by the will of heaven that
we come this far, we [will] achieve resolution of further questions in

[The
Shepherdess and Coatus]</h4>

<p>[p. 42]</p>

<p>80. ...&quot;...I
once learned of a woman, a shepherdess, in the settlement of the Arigbanes.&nbsp;
One Coatus, son of Coatus, fell in love with her and sent her gifts, so that
she would come to an agreement with him.&nbsp; But she, seeing the gifts, laughed
and said to the messenger, pointing to her sheep:&nbsp; 'Behold my gifts and my
children, from which I am nourished by divine grace.'&nbsp; And he came away to her
and with splendid promises he urged her to accept him.&nbsp; She said to him:&nbsp;
'Shall I defile the undefiled cloak which grace has given to me?'&nbsp; Coatus
said:&nbsp; 'Miserable girl, this law has been established from above for the
propagation of the race.'&nbsp; The shepherdess:&nbsp; 'A law has been established for <i>me</i> not to acquire more than I have.'&nbsp;
After much pleading to no effect, he ordered that she be starved to death.&nbsp; And
so, on the third day, when she was about to expire, she uttered cheerful words
as follows:&nbsp; 'O heavenly Father of your genuine children, O unsullied
bridegroom of those who are in the bloom of beauty, I come to you,
thrice-desired Lord, giving back to you without complaint that which you gave
to me&#8212;virginity, forgiveness of sins, an existence without property, a truthful
tongue, a heart unacquainted with wickedness&#8212;ever intent on the hope that is to
come, which I have honored and whose joys I am now by all means going to
meet.'&nbsp; And thus she expired.&nbsp; [p. 43] His father, learning this, ordered that
he be hung head-downwards on a tall post in the middle of the city, so as to be
eaten by birds.&quot;</p>

of Philip of Side, and that the use and expansion of Eusebius observable in
them is consistent with what we know of his method; but his argument for this
is partly tied to his attribution of the material labeled by Heyden as Fr. 6,
now more convincingly attributed to Gelasius of Caesarea.&nbsp; Pouderon, &quot;Le
t&eacute;moignage,&quot; pp. 10-11, 62-63, and Hansen, <i>Theodoros Anagnostes</i>, pp. xxxvii-xxxviii, point out that at
the very least De Boor's case for these fragments remains unproved.&nbsp; Heyden, p.
224, however, revives De Boor's appeal to the reference to John Chrysostom in
no. 6 as one remaining point in favor of Philip of Side's authorship; and as
another, notes the fact that Gelasius of Caesarea is not otherwise attested as
providing information on the pre-Constantinian period, and thus any attempt to
attribute this material to him would be problematic. &#8212; In the translations

<p>And first he determined to call back to himself those
cities that were rebelling against Roman overlordship&#8212;some by words, others by
force of arms, and others by good treatment and kindness.&nbsp; For he decreed a lighter
tax-burden for them, and gave them equal rights of commerce; he put an end to
their rebelliousness and madness wisely, more by calmness than by frightening
them, since he knew that the peoples of the Sauri<a href="#_ftn124"

and the Frangi<a href="#_ftn125" name="_ftnref125" title=""><sup>[125]</sup></a>

rebellion against their rulers, and often treated their own thoughts as law.&nbsp;
He also subdued the Spani and the Brettani and the islands in that area, and
the remaining tribes and all those who are witnesses of the setting of the
sun&#8212;who, they say, know whether it is really submerged in the Ocean or goes
around the water and returns back to us by another route.&nbsp; And he took the
barbarian tribes there by force of arms, making use of a side-task to further
his [primary] task.&nbsp; For, subduing some, making others subject to tribute, and
making others friends instead of opponents and intimates instead of ancient
enemies, he brought them in as allies, not causing distress or laying siege to
anyone, and being eager for the salvation of others.&nbsp; For where God acts as
one's ally, everything is rightly guided and he raises up on high the human
reason.&nbsp; With this sort of God-loving thought, Constantine, most faithful in
all things, crossed to the right-hand side of the Rhine, passed many mountains,
many unnamed rivers, with a small army, conquered many barbarian peoples,
brought over to his side ten tribes of Gauls and Frangi and Spani, and finally
brought his army to the mountains of Italy.</p>

of the most holy law of the universal Church:&nbsp; the Lord's prayer-house of

fa&ccedil;ade, adorned with a star-shaped seal, is supported by columns, twelve in
number, brighter than snow, immoveable in their placement in Faith&#8212;eternally,
by the power of our Savior's divinity.&nbsp; (4) When we also receive the righteous
faith that comes from the soul, the Architect of this amazing work brings home
to our minds the awesomeness of his everlasting law.&nbsp; Whoever wishes approaches
the gates of this [structure], but in no way other than with the impulse of a
holy and pious desire, with only the confidence of a pure mind.&nbsp; (5) And the

ornament.&nbsp; What I mean is that on the <i>inside</i>,
people's faith, honored over the entire course of the wall of the Lord's house
with blooming garlands,<a href="#_ftn142" name="_ftnref142" title=""><sup>[142]</sup></a>

self-control, and on the other hand for those who are right-minded their praise
directed toward God is ever-present, as a prize for understanding.&nbsp; For as
these two [guards] are placed at the front doors of the most holy place,
righteousness is received by wide-open gates, and this [righteousness] having
been given a home within, it remains there in purity; but unrighteousness is
not allowed to approach the gates, but is shut out from this place and

<p>(7) O brothers
most honored, and worthy of all praise, these facts so clear have led me into
the brightness of the eternal and immortal light, so that I will not stand far
away and be rendered out of harmony with the truth by any wavering faith.&nbsp; (8)
But what shall I proclaim first?&nbsp; The pattern of blessedness,<a href="#_ftn145"
name="_ftnref145" title=""><sup>[145]</sup></a>
which has been compressed and hidden within my breast?&nbsp; Or the divine benefits
in my regard &lt;that have been bestowed&gt; by Almighty God?&nbsp; Of these deeds,
which are numerous, it would seem sufficient for now to say that this same God
of ours, the Father of all, quite rightly made my mediocrity<a href="#_ftn146"
name="_ftnref146" title=""><sup>[146]</sup></a>
subject to himself.&nbsp; Believe me, most honored brothers, and apply an
unprejudiced faith to what I say; even if my mind, having been satiated with
God's favors, seems very much to be blessed,<a href="#_ftn147" name="_ftnref147"
title=""><sup>[147]</sup></a>
nevertheless, as the proof of the truth shows, neither voice nor tongue are
fully able to carry out the mind's commands&#8212;and rightly so.&nbsp; (10) For since the
greatness of his benefits is without measure, although the mind, which is an
exalted thing, possesses the lower &quot;places&quot;&#8212;the body&#8212;the path of the
tongue, being confined in a truly narrow place, being more or less reprehensible,<a
href="#_ftn148" name="_ftnref148" title=""><sup>[148]</sup></a>
remains altogether silent.&nbsp; For which of us is so ready for reasoning that he
would utter such a self-confident speech, whereby he would presume to pronounce
glorious praises easily, and worthy praises perfectly, to the all-powerful God
and creator of all the most beautiful things? (11) If someone were to think
only about the magnificence of the one who ordained the law of his birth, he
would consider with full knowledge that nothing can be found which would be
able to be spoken as something worthy of God.&nbsp; (12) Then what should the
devotion of my mediocrity speak about, except that which the divine Word of
truth makes manifest?&nbsp; The greatest act of worship must consider wisely whether
it will be able to reach his greatness in the very things that are spoken about
him, whether some error will not cause him to stumble.&nbsp; (13) And would that a
liberal abundance of speaking would suffice for me, your fellow servant, to
render him those praises (which are worthy of proclamation) that our divine
Savior, the guardian of all things, made known by the calm assent of his
divinity, in the &quot;prologue&quot; of his presence here, when for the sake
of our benefit he deigned to receive the dwelling-place of a holy body from a
virgin, thus displaying the proof of his own compassion.</p>

<p>(14) Where,
then, shall I begin?&nbsp; With his teaching and his dignity?&nbsp; Or rather, with the
divine teachings of which he himself appeared as sole teacher on his own
account, with no one teaching him?&nbsp; Or rather, with how so many people revived
through his wise provision,<a href="#_ftn149" name="_ftnref149" title=""><sup>[149]</sup></a>
as many as cannot be encompassed by a number, with a small amount of
nourishment and the tiniest loaves of bread and only two fish?&nbsp; By his divine
provision he also caused resurrection, using a certain short staff,<a
href="#_ftn150" name="_ftnref150" title=""><sup>[150]</sup></a>
after the death of Lazarus, and brought him back again into the brightness of
the light.&nbsp; (16) But how could I speak of his holy divinity, by virtue of
which, when he saw that a certain woman was &lt;suffering from&gt; a hidden
&lt;illness&gt;, deeming her worthy of simple contact with himself, he rendered
her well again, and free from all disease?&nbsp; (17) And who could worthily speak
about his immortal deed, by which a certain man who had been worn out by a
major chronic wasting disease, lying there with all his limbs hanging loose and
splayed out, was suddenly strengthened by divine healing and put upon his
shoulders the very pallet on which he had lain; and, pouring forth praise and
thanksgiving, he ran through the country and local territory?&nbsp; (18) Or rather,
his divine and steady walking, when he stepped upon and trod down the savage
sea on foot, and stilled the fluidity of the deepest sea with his divine feet,
and made his way in the midst of the waves, bounded by no measure of depth, as
though he were on dry land?&nbsp; (19) Or rather, his gentle patience, by which he,
being conqueror in all things, tamed the stubbornness of the foolish people
and, once it was tamed, removed it far from them and subjected their savagery
to [his] law?&nbsp; (20) Or rather, the clearest, the greatest [attributes] of his divinity,
by which we live, in which we are well-pleased, we who not only look forward to
the hope of the coming blessedness, but in some way as it were already possess
it?&nbsp; (21) What more do I dare to say, even with my exiguous cultivation of
discourse, except this&#8212;what the purity of my devoted soul ought to understand:&nbsp;
What the omnipotent God, who dwells in heaven, is like in relation to the whole
human race, and especially and preeminently in relation to righteousness, which
is most beatiful and greater than any praise&#8212;considering that he deigned &lt;to
receive&gt; a body&#8212;the holiest, as befitted his divine spirit&#8212;and to dwell in
it, and thus to work salvation for [all] human bodies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(22)
Therefore, since concerning the all-powerful order of God, so entirely holy and
salvific, the measureless madness of the enemies,<a href="#_ftn151"
name="_ftnref151" title=""><sup>[151]</sup></a>
thrown into confusion as though by some cloud, does not hesitate to offer an
interpretation, perverse and destructive, I shall attempt to set forth [my
views] briefly, as far as the faith and devotion of my soul have abundant
resources for speaking.&nbsp; (23) For indeed, the malice of these men, &lt;just
like that&gt; of the pagans, puts on display such a kind of shamelessness that
they are not afraid to say, with an impious mouth, that the all-powerful God
did not do, did not wish to do, all that is revealed in the divine Law.&nbsp; (24)
O, such impious speech, that calls down on itself and deserves every extreme
punishment:&nbsp; It desires, truly insanely and rashly, to make the glory of this
divine benefaction&#8212;a glory that cannot be comprehended by any human
being&#8212;disappear.&nbsp; (25) For what is more worthy of God than purity?&nbsp; This has
come forth from most holy association with the source of righteousness, passed
like a flood through the whole circumference of the world, and put the powers
of the most holy virtues on display for the human race.&nbsp; But they, considering
these virtues at first to be hostile to themselves, suffered &lt;the fate&gt;
of the Assyrians&#8212;and with these leading the way as a bad example, the other
nations were persuaded to go along with them.&nbsp; (26) In these things, just as we
perceive it in our own experience, we see that the divine compassion of God our
Savior has been at work, when the same [Savior] day by day and year by year
commanded many of them, who were being plagued by the sting of fiery madness,
to rise to the patient endurance of the Savior's healing.&nbsp; And yet not even so
is the greatness of such generosity able to come with favor in the eyes of the
others, &lt;because of&gt; human ignorance of the fact that the divine lordship
is able to raise up every people, and to make it secure once it has been raised
to a height, &lt;and&gt; likewise, to demolish and destroy.&nbsp; (27) But things
would have turned out more adversely for human affairs, if God, who is all-powerful,
had &lt;not&gt; given himself the task of doing everything, by the quiet nod of
his own divinity.&nbsp; For human madness would have become even more long-lived,
and human stubbornness, which knows no bounds, would have destroyed all souls,
nor would the other most numerous things,<a href="#_ftn152" name="_ftnref152"
title=""><sup>[152]</sup></a>
which in the disorder of the world still perform their orderly duties, have
been able to appear&#8212;(28) rather, all things would have quickly perished,
together with [human] ignorance of God; and the unrighteousness of malice and
jealousy would have remained, not as in a few people, but rather, no one would
have been found opposed to jealousy, with the [various] religions diffused
largely and broadly into the souls of men to such an extent that through the
baseness of these men, the light of this brightness of ours would have been
obscured for them, and they would always have been deprived of it. (29)
Therefore, no word that has been spoken will be able to drag my faith out of my
soul; for, when nothing base stands in the way, it is accompanied by a perfect
power, the living Word of truth, which is alone all-powerful, the guardian of
all things and protector of our salvation.&nbsp; Thus he [i.e., God] seems, in a
certain manner, lavishly to bestow intimacy with his most holy Word, to preserve
&lt;....&gt;<a href="#_ftn153" name="_ftnref153" title=""><sup>[153]</sup></a>
of the one who frees [us], and to provide for us the brightness of the light.&nbsp;
(30) So then, for what reason do the people of all the nations even now fail to
discern the heavenly light, despise the most glorious Holy One, and go after
earthly things,<a href="#_ftn154" name="_ftnref154" title=""><sup>[154]</sup></a>
which have no substantial truth, no brilliance of pure brightness, no authority
of celestial divinity?&nbsp; (31) What unworthy behavior!&nbsp; Even to this day, not at
all falling short in impiety, and not looking toward their duty, they fail to
see that they are falling down because of their wretched error; they do not
cease to defile the brightness with these filthy works of the world&#8212;that is to
say, by setting up wood and stone and bronze and silver and gold and these
sorts of earthly &lt;materials&gt; for worship, and promising themselves a hope
of life from these, building temples for them with striking ornaments, and in
this way increasing and adding to their worship because of the fact that the
greatness of the buildings (constructed by them!) produces a sense of wonder
worthy of their own gaze.&nbsp; (32) So then, when they are seen to do this, it is
clearly discerned&#8212;even if for the most part they themselves in their arrogance
do not perceive or see it&#8212;that they are caught openly boasting over their own
works.&nbsp; Thus, we do not see how great and how vast is God, the ruler of all,
who is also master and judge of all, whom some [of us] unwittingly<a
href="#_ftn155" name="_ftnref155" title=""><sup>[155]</sup></a>
&lt;outrage&gt; with their very confidence in their own virtue (as they see
it).&nbsp; (33) For it was by virtue of his arrangements that the form of our bodies
received its due shape.&nbsp; The same [God] bound together the connections of all
our limbs with the strongest sinews, so that in every action we pursue we might
keep the vigor of our united parts<a href="#_ftn156" name="_ftnref156" title=""><sup>[156]</sup></a>
without tiring.&nbsp; Then, when this had been brought to completion by his saving
arrangement, he also breathed spirit into us, so that all these [physical
parts] would be able to move and flourish, and granted vision to our eyes, set
them in our head for our understanding, and within this place [i.e., the head]
he enclosed the reasoning process of all our thinking.&nbsp; (34) For this reason,
if any right-minded person were to examine the logic of these arrangements, and
leave off the rest&#8212;which cannot be comprehended either with words or numbers&#8212;he
would be able, with a little reflection, to see and to understand the eternal
and salvific authority of the immortal God.&nbsp; And a man will not be able to trap
that one [i.e., God] with the snares of any kind of error, when it is possible
for him to see that everything that has come to be is [as it is] by the power
of God, as he himself has wished all these things to be. (35) But so that we
may be able to see that a certain unlawful way of life in the world brought
about people's ignorance of God, the reasoning process of sin having first been
produced in the wretched souls of those stupid people because of the Enemy's
deception, we can receive clear proof concerning this from the divine law.&nbsp;
(36) For ever since that time, when the divine and holy command was not kept
with the appropriate diligence by those two people who had been formed in the
beginning, after that, the flower of this name<a href="#_ftn157"
name="_ftnref157" title=""><sup>[157]</sup></a>
was born.&nbsp; And it became continual and increased still further, from the time
when the aforementioned two were cast out by God's will.&nbsp; (37) And the physical
world itself was brought along with human stupidity to such a point that he
pronounced sentence against the Orient and the lands of the Occident.&nbsp; And the
very excess of the Opposite Power took possession of human thoughts and made
them dim.&nbsp; (38) Yet even in this situation, the untiring compassion of the
all-powerful God is both holy and immortal.&nbsp; For in all the days and years that
have passed, God has been setting free from this burden&#8212;through me, his
servant&#8212;numberless multitudes of people who had been enslaved; and he will
bring them out into the perfect brilliance of the eternal light.&nbsp; From these
[facts], most beloved brethren, by virtue of a certain special providence and
the glorious favors of our immortal God, I am confident that in future I shall
be even more highly regarded for my very pure faith in him.</p>

<p>(39)
Therefore, let this most holy gathering of your sanctity receive me, and do not
suffer the most chaste Church and the the doors of the pure mother common to us
all to be set in opposition to me.&nbsp; Even if the reasoning power of my soul,
while it very much even now is seeking the complete purity of the universal
faith, does not think it right for this to be granted too easily, nevertheless
it urges and reminds me&#8212;and it has displayed its own reverential brow as a seal
of the most beautiful virtues; and it has begun to lay hold of the gates of
immortality and to knock on them&#8212;so that you too will consider it right to
grant me straightway the goodwill of your brotherhood, with a view only to the
harmony and peace of the universal Church.&nbsp; (40) For this is fitting with
respect to God, harmonious with respect to the faith of the universal Church,
and beneficial with respect to our common affairs,<a href="#_ftn158"
name="_ftnref158" title=""><sup>[158]</sup></a>
so that [in the end] we may all together offer a response, worthy of the most
highly honored peace that has been granted to us by God, to the one who has
favored us with it.</p>

<p>(41)<a
href="#_ftn159" name="_ftnref159" title=""><sup>[159]</sup></a>
<i>For it would</i> <i>be</i> truly <i>terrible</i>&#8212;<i>most terrible!</i>&#8212;<i>if, when our enemies have been destroyed and no one is </i>still<i> daring to resist</i>, we<i> attack each other and provide pleasure and laughter
to those who are ill-disposed, </i>and<i>

<p>(1) <i>A certain one
of the hirelings of Arius, a philosopher, who was marveled at much more than
all</i> the others, <i>contended </i>much<i>, indeed very much, on Arius' behalf with our bishops</i>
for very many days<i>, with the result that
there was a great lecture every day arising from their </i>verbal<i> encounters:&nbsp; the crowd </i>of those who were
gathering <i>would rush together, </i>and
the philosopherwould put forward
the impious blasphemies of Arius against what was said by the holy council,
saying about the Son that &quot;there was a time when he was not,&quot; and
that &quot;he is a created being, made from nothing, and from a different
substance<a href="#_ftn163" name="_ftnref163" title=""><sup>[163]</sup></a>
and existence<a href="#_ftn164" name="_ftnref164" title=""><sup>[164]</sup></a>
[than the Father].&quot;&nbsp; (2) On behalf of these abominable doctrines of Arius,
he had a great struggle, and [sent forth] his &quot;showers&quot; of arguments,
as he raved against the Son of God and attacked the chorus of those holy
priests<a href="#_ftn165" name="_ftnref165" title=""><sup>[165]</sup></a>--the
enemy of human salvation was speaking in him and through him.&nbsp; (3) But the
defenders of the truth, our bishops, calmly brought to bear against him the
necessary and appropriate counter-arguments, on behalf of the Apostolic
doctrines, imitating the great prophet and king, David, who said, &quot;I was
made ready, and I was not disturbed.&quot;<a href="#_ftn166" name="_ftnref166"
title=""><sup>[166]</sup></a>&nbsp;
For they burned through the philosopher's convoluted propositions by means of
the divine word, as though with fire through hempen fibers.&nbsp; (4) But even so,
the philosopher continued to be confident in his diabolical facility with
arguments, and began to shoot his arrows against the truth proclaimed by the
bishops, <i>applying</i> good and <i>glib responses to all the considerations advanced
against him</i>&#8212;so he thought&#8212;<i>and,
slippery as an eel,</i> he struggled<i>
to solve the issues raised</i>.&nbsp; <i>For
in the midst of what he thought he was contriving for his own benefit, slipping
out of the logical arguments that were being brought quite powerfully against
him,</i> he was caught, on the basis of is own words, and collapsed
along with them.&nbsp; (5) But even so, in an arrogant frenzy, he moved against the
most peaceful council, hoping to defeat the invincible power of the unconquerable
Spirit of Christ that was in them.&nbsp; (6) <i>But
God,</i> &quot;who catches the wise in their cunning,&quot;<a
href="#_ftn167" name="_ftnref167" title=""><sup>[167]</sup></a><i> in order to demonstrate that his kingdom does not
stand &quot;on talk but on power,&quot;<a href="#_ftn168" name="_ftnref168"
title=""><sup><b><sup>[168]</sup></b></sup></a></i>
not only powerfully silenced the wicked demon that was speaking in the philosopher,
but even cast it out, through one of his servants who was there.&nbsp; (7) For <i>a certain man, one of the holy confessors who was
present at the council, with </i>as<i>
simple a nature </i>as any other of the saints [has had],<i> and one who knew nothing &quot;except Jesus Christ,
and him crucified&quot;<a href="#_ftn169" name="_ftnref169" title=""><sup><b><sup>[169]</sup></b></sup></a>
 </i>in the flesh according to the Scriptures, <i>was with the bishops and saw the philosopher swooping down to attack
our </i>holy bishops, <i>and arrogantly
engaged in</i> his <i>malicious
disputation; he asked</i> the bishops, the priests of God, <i>to give him an opportunity for discussion with the
philosopher.</i>&nbsp; (8) <i>Then, the</i>
holy bishops <i>on our side, perceiving the
man's simplicity and his lack of experience with letters, tried to persuade him
not to put himself into the fray, for fear that it would provoke laughter among
the malicious</i> enemies of the truth.&nbsp; (9) <i>But he, not content with this, approached the philosopher and said to
him, &quot;In the name of Jesus Christ</i>, the Word of God who is
always with the Father, <i>listen to the
doctrines of truth, O philosopher.&quot;&nbsp; And the other said to him, &quot;Go
ahead and speak.&quot;&nbsp; And the </i>saint<i> said to him, &quot;There is one God, who created the heavens and the
earth</i> and the sea, and all things that are in them, <i>who also formed man from the earth and subjected
everything to his Logos and to the Holy Spirit.<a href="#_ftn170"
name="_ftnref170" title=""><sup><b><sup>[170]</sup></b></sup></a>&nbsp; </i>(10)
<i>This Logos, </i>O philosopher, <i>we know and worship as the Son of God, believing that
for the sake of our redemption he </i>was made fleshand<i>
was born </i>and became a man, <i>and
that through </i>the suffering of his flesh on the <i>cross and </i>his<i> death he freed us from eternal condemnation</i>, <i>and that through his resurrection </i>he<i> procured eternal life for us; and we have hope that</i>
as he went up into the heavens <i>he will come
back and will judge us </i>concerning<i>
all that we have accomplished.&nbsp; Do you believe in these things, O
philosopher?&quot;&nbsp; </i>(11) <i>And the </i>philosopher,
<i>as though he had never had experience of
words spoken in opposition to him, was dumbfounded and fell silent </i>just
like that, <i>as though he were mute and
speechless, after saying to him, </i>in a most pitiable voice,<i> only the following:&nbsp; &quot;I too think this is so,
and I think no differently that as you have just said.&quot;</i>&nbsp; (12) <i>And the old man said to him, &quot;If you believe
that this is so, O philosopher, stand up and follow me, and let us hurry to the
church, in which you will receive the sign of this faith.&quot;&nbsp; </i>(13)<i> And the philosopher, transforming </i>his
whole self <i>toward</i> the true <i>reverence</i> for the God of the universe,
stood up and followed the old man and, <i>turning
around, said to his disciples and to all those who had gathered to hear [the
discussion], &quot;Listen, men.&nbsp; As long as I was enthusiastic for arguments, I
would place words in opposition to words and would overturn the matters
presented to me by my skill in speaking; </i>(14) <i>but now that instead of words, some divine power has
come forth from the mouth of my interlocutor, my words </i>no longer<i> had the strength to resist this power.&nbsp; For neither
is a human being able to stand in opposition to God</i>.&nbsp; <i>Therefore, if any of you is able to understand, as I
have now come to think, he shall believe in Christ&#8212;and let him follow this old
man, in whom God spoke.</i></p>

<p>(15) <i>In this way, the philosopher</i>  recovered and, being illuminated and <i>becoming a Christian, rejoiced to have been beaten by
the old man.</i></p>

<p>And when this
philosopher had been baptized and was joined to the Church of God and found
relief and exulted, the council rejoiced over the mighty acts of God.</p>

Licinius, for fear of the emperor Constantine, worked his treachery against us
secretly.&nbsp; But later, he drew up his forces against us openly.&nbsp; At that point,
Constantine grew angry against Licinius.&nbsp; And after war had occurred between
them, Licinius was taken alive in Chrysopolis.&nbsp; He [i.e., Constantine]
commanded him [i.e., Licinius] to live quietly in Thessalonica, but when he was
plotting rebellion again, and was going to take up arms, he ordered him killed.</p>

[5.4 Berthelot]</h4>

<p>&quot;Dyeing&quot; of the copper found among the
Persians, recorded from the reign of Philip.<a href="#_ftn185" name="_ftnref185"
title=""><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(1) Take the
upper <i>thuthia</i>,<a href="#_ftn186"
name="_ftnref186" title=""><sup>[186]</sup></a>
as much as you wish, and pound it finely and sift it with a very fine sieve.&nbsp;
Put it into an earthenware vessel, and put on top of it oil of whatever sort
you wish, whether common or sesame-oil.&nbsp; Take it up again in your hands; mix
the oil with the <i>thuthia</i> and
grind it in the earthenware receptacle until the <i>thuthia</i> is saturated with the oil and does not absorb any
more of the oil.&nbsp; And when you see that it has absorbed enough, add again and
mix in still more of the same oil, until it becomes like mud.&nbsp; And [then] take
some of the crimson/palm-paste,<a href="#_ftn187" name="_ftnref187" title=""><sup>[187]</sup></a>
the red [pigment] called <i>nat&ecirc;ph</i>
by the Arabs, one-fifth of the amount of <i>thuthia</i>,
and place it on top of the previously softened <i>thuthia</i>
in the earthenware vessel, after breaking it [i.e., the pigment] up into small
pieces&#8212;not too many, nor too large.&nbsp; Heat an oven with the most intense fire;
put the vessel in the oven; then, cover the opening of the oven with mud until
the following day, because the <i>thuthia</i>
is going to be burnt and become black.&nbsp; And the next day, take it out, crush it
and sift it with a fine sieve.</p>

<p>(2) And when
you wish t&#959; dye the above copper&#8212;no better is dyed in Persia&#8212;take two
parts of fine Cyprian copper, and one of the powder that has been prepared with
the <i>thuthia</i> beforehand.&nbsp; Break up
the copper into very small parts, as many as you can, and mix the powder in
with it; put both into a crucible, and use the bellows vigorously, until the
copper bubbles up along with the powder.&nbsp; When it bubbles, add further coals,
together with much bellows-work, until the two are united together.&nbsp; And if you
wish to make sure of the beauty of the color, take an iron implement with a
bent end, and pull out [some of the material] with its end, and look at it.&nbsp; If
the color is pleasing, stop using the bellows; but if if is not yet pleasing,
keep up the bellows-work and add more coal.&nbsp; For the more you use the bellows
and coal, the better your material is rendered.</p>

<h4 align=center><a name="Fr. 7.2">Fr. 7.2</a><br>
[5.5 Berthelot]</h4>

<p>&quot;Dyeing&quot; of the Indian iron, recorded at the
same time.</p>

<p>(1) Take 4
pounds of soft iron and cut it up into small pieces.&nbsp; Take bark of the
palm-nut&#8212;called <i>elileg</i> among the
Arabs&#8212;15 mil.<a href="#_ftn188" name="_ftnref188" title=""><sup>[188]</sup></a>
in weight; and also <i>belileg</i>, with
the insides similarly cleaned out, that is, the bark alone&#8212;4 mil. in weight;
and <i>amblag</i>, similarly cleaned
out&#8212;4 mil.; and of the above-mentioned glass-makers' <i>magnesia</i> (feminine <i>magnesia</i>),<a
href="#_ftn189" name="_ftnref189" title=""><sup>[189]</sup></a>
2 mil.&nbsp; Pound all this together, not too finely, and mix it in with the 4
pounds of iron.&nbsp; Put it into a crucible&#8212;and level out the place of the crucible
before applying the flames; for if you do not do this, so that it does not move
this way and that, there will necessarily be problems in the melting process.&nbsp;
Then, after this, add the coals, and heat up the crucible until the iron melts,
and the [other] materials are united with it.&nbsp; And the 4 pounds of iron require
100 pounds of coals.</p>

<p>(2) Note that
if the iron is quite soft, it does not need the <i>magnesia</i>, but only the other materials.&nbsp; For the <i>magnesia </i>dries it out to excess, and it
becomes fragile.&nbsp; But if it is soft, there is need of it [i.e., the <i>magnesia</i>?] alone, so that it is higher.&nbsp;
For this accomplishes everything.</p>

<p>(3) This is
the first, the royal work, with which they are concerned to this day, and on
the basis of which they fashion the &quot;marvelous&quot; swords.&nbsp; It was
discovered by the Indians, and was passed on to the Persians, and from them it
came to us.&nbsp;</p>

wording after the name &quot;Philip&quot; on the basis of mangled indications
in the manuscripts and also the cues apparent in the context:&nbsp; namely, their
response to the oracle shows that the oracle has mentioned a woman, and a man
from Macedonia; and Aphroditianus' comment in &sect;14 (p. 9) makes clear that a
prediction is made that can be taken as referring to &quot;the Macedonian&quot;
and to Christ.&nbsp; Bringel, by contrast, marks the words following Philip as a
crux, having little confidence in any reconstruction.&nbsp; In connection with this
consultation of the oracle, there is a further major textual variant:&nbsp; In a
couple of manuscripts, a fairly long sequence of text is either substituted for
(ms. Q) or added to the end of (ms. N) the oracular response translated above;
this additional text runs roughly as follows [minor discrepancies do exist in
the witnesses]:&nbsp; &quot;Late, a certain one will make his way to this
much-splintered earth, and without a misstep will become flesh, and by the
untiring bounds of divinity he will dissolve the destructive force of incurable
passions / sufferings; and ill-will shall arise for this one at the hands of an
unbelieving people, and he will be hung up to a height as one condemned to
death.&nbsp; And having willingly suffered to bear all these things as well, at
death he will be lifted up into eternal life.&quot;&nbsp; The supposed prophecy of
Christ is much clearer in this additional text, which may well have been added
specifically to alleviate the annoyace of a too-obscure prophecy.</p>

sense that it has been produced by sublimation to the upper part of the furnace

as zinc oxide (see the introduction, Livr. 1, pp. 239-40, where this is referred
to as [artificially manufactured] <i>cadmia</i>).&nbsp;
As Berthelot's note argues, the word <i>thuthia
</i>is attested late; along with the mention of the Arabs, it indicates
that this portion of text at least was probably written between the 7th and
11th centuries. &nbsp;(Cf. also introduction, Livr. 1, p. 268.)</p>

arsenic, perhaps equivalent to the <i>cobathia</i>
red / arsenic sulfide (realgar) which was treated as equivalent to palm-cinders
as early as Zosimus' time (see Fr. tr., p. 185; see also the introduction,
