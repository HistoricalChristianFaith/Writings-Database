<p>[p. 1]</p>

<p>1. When
Arrhinatus<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup>[4]</sup></a>
was king of Persia, and second after him was Pasargarus, who held the highest
rank of the highest officials in authority, and third was Diocles, who managed
the satrapies and provinces,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>[5]</sup></a>
and Aphroditianus, holding the rank of &quot;chief cook&quot;<a href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup>[6]</sup></a>&mdash;<i>dialalia abdoded&ocirc;rou mou toi</i><a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>[7]</sup></a>&mdash;&quot;the
authority will judge purely&quot;&mdash;<b>there arose
a dispute in this land between pagans<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup>[8]</sup></a>
and Christians concerning Dionysarus and Philip, the writers of history.&nbsp; The
pagans championed Dionysarus, the Christians, Philip. </b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. And when
many had been agitated, the King gathered together all the bishops who were in
those lands, numbering more than 100,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup>[9]</sup></a>
and not a few archimandrites;<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><sup>[10]</sup></a>
[p. 2] among these they urged me also to come along&mdash;the only one from Roman
territory; for all [these others] were from those regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. And when
they had been assembled, the King brought together the Rabbis of the Jews,
saying to them:&nbsp; &quot;<b>Since some have said
that the fine sayings</b><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><sup>[11]</sup></a><b> of the pagans preach about Christ, and some dispute
this,</b> become judges of the two sides, and tell me the truth
accurately.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><sup>[12]</sup></a>&nbsp;
For I trust neither pagans nor Christians one-sidedly, when they are speaking
in defense of themselves.&nbsp; Therefore, laboriously unfolding every idea in the
divine book,<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a>
and devoting all your thoughts to it, neither favoring the one group nor the
other, report them to the unconquerable authority of my hands<a href="#_ftn14"
name="_ftnref14" title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a>&mdash;knowing
that if you are hindered by any other order, I will immediately see to the
destruction of you all.&quot;<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p>And they fell
down upon the golden pavement at his feet seven times, and said:&nbsp;
&quot;Imperial Master, first god of all authority and kingship, grant us space
for a defence!&quot;</p>

<p>And he granted
it, saying:&nbsp; &quot;Consider the religion which you revere, without partiality
to either.&quot;</p>

<p>And they
said:&nbsp; &quot;Let us not come into evil suspicion, when your hand holds sway
over all the land.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a>&nbsp; We shall not say anything except what is right for Your Heavenly
Divinity to hear.&nbsp; For we are not able to listen to pagans&mdash;for they are far
from our religion&mdash;nor to give heed at all to the murderous and impure
Christians, who have become tyrants over the whole human race, and have
attacked all the just [commands] of the divine monarchy; they apply all [p. 3]
their professions of faith<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a>
to one single man, whom our ancestors rightly determined to destroy; and they
treat the one who died as though he were alive, and they call upon the one whom
they did not see as though they see him.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"
title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a>&nbsp;
But if it seems good to you, righteous<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"
title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a>
masters, make the all-wise and noble Aphroditianus [act as] judge for the two
parties.&quot;</p>

<p>And
immediately the King said:&nbsp; &quot;By Zeus,<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"
title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a>
you have uttered inspired speech today!&quot;<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"
title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And quickly bringing Aphroditianus, and sending those men [i.e., the Jews]
away, he said to him:&nbsp; &quot;<b>Your people</b><a
href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a><b> began the dispute against Philip, the priest</b><a
href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a><b> of the Christians</b>.&nbsp; Therefore, whereas I
know that you neither take delight in feasting nor take pleasure in wine, but
instead you spurn gatherings of people<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"
title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a>
and despise reputation and cast aside money, devoting yourself solely to
philosophy, I give you this order:&nbsp; Go yourself alone and respond to the chorus
of priests,<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><sup>[25]</sup></a>
showing all deference to the truth, so that in this matter too the power of our
kingship shall be preeminent.&quot;</p>

<p>4. But the
Jews were putting this man forward as a trick, so that he might trample
underfoot the Christians' name.&nbsp; This Aphroditianus was a pagan to whom no
one's mouth was able to render an account.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26"
title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And there was no small struggle impending for us, so as not to be defeated by
this man.&nbsp; For all the hairs [on our heads], if they became mental processes,
would not be able to disentangle one simple thought of his.</p>

<p>5. Now then,
when before the meeting everyone had been cowering in fear of him, and they
were trying to escape from his inarguable stratagems,<a href="#_ftn27"
name="_ftnref27" title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a>
and were lamenting<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><sup>[28]</sup></a>&mdash;before
his appearance, I said to the bishops who were with me:&nbsp; &quot;Do you not know
that right here, the &quot;un-wise&quot; [art] defeated the
&quot;all-wise&quot; art?&nbsp; Have you given yourselves such expectations of being
entirely overcome by him?&nbsp; All the wisdom of the Chaldaeans and Babylonians has
been overcome by the divine thought of that young man, Daniel.<a href="#_ftn29"
name="_ftnref29" title=""><sup>[29]</sup></a>
[p. 4]&nbsp; Therefore, in imitation of him, let us say:&nbsp; 'There is a God in heaven
who reveals deep and hidden things.'<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><sup>[30]</sup></a>&nbsp;
So let us take along with us Casteleus the senior priest and let us continue
entirely undefeated.&quot;</p>

<p>6. And after
fasting and making prayers of entreaty, we assembled together, along with that
man who had grown old in righteousness, Casteleus; and the bishops sealed
themselves,<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><sup>[31]</sup></a>
keeping the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in their minds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And now,
Aphroditianus arrived&mdash;he himself having also grown old, being now in his
eightieth year&mdash;and when he sat down upon a throne of gold, built from priceless
stones, since the faces of everyone were bowed to the ground, he recognized
that they were in no way able to defend themselves<a href="#_ftn32"
name="_ftnref32" title=""><sup>[32]</sup></a>
before him.&nbsp; And he said to them, having been goaded<a href="#_ftn33"
name="_ftnref33" title=""><sup>[33]</sup></a>
by God:&nbsp; &quot;You peaceful priests, why are you disturbed?&nbsp; I have not come to
cause you pain by any means, but rather to encourage you.&nbsp; So the contest can
proceed painlessly.&nbsp; Take heart, then, and apply yourselves to the truth
correctly, in earnest,<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><sup>[34]</sup></a>
and you will have victory.&quot;&nbsp; And the bishops, hearing this, recovered
their wits fully.</p>

<p>7. Irenaeus,
the bishop of Basir&ecirc;n&ecirc;,<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><sup>[35]</sup></a>
said:&nbsp; &quot;With whom is your God-fearing will disputing?&nbsp; With Dionysarus or
with Philip?&nbsp; If you are at odds with Dionysarus, he is yours!<a href="#_ftn36"
name="_ftnref36" title=""><sup>[36]</sup></a>&nbsp;
You ought to be the judge regarding him.&nbsp; <b>But
if [you are at odds] with Philip, then <i>we</i>
should make a defence in his regard, since he is a Christian</b>.&quot;</p>

<p>8.
Aphroditianus said:&nbsp; &quot;It is well for you, priest, if you finish as you
have begun.&nbsp; For I bear on my lips<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><sup>[37]</sup></a>
<b>the things [written] by Philip</b>.<a
href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><sup>[38]</sup></a>&nbsp;
But, so that you will not think that I [p. 5] have made any additions, bring
the so-called 'books'<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><sup>[39]</sup></a>
themselves and read them to the assembly.&quot;<a href="#_ftn40"
name="_ftnref40" title=""><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p>9. Hesiod the
bishop said:&nbsp; &quot;And if I bring out a book and you attack it as having been
falsified<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><sup>[41]</sup></a>...?&quot;</p>

<p>Aphroditianus
said:&nbsp; &quot;I know,<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><sup>[42]</sup></a>
if anything has been left out or if anything has been added.&quot;</p>

<p><b>10. And his long-winded book</b><a
href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><sup>[43]</sup></a><b> was brought, in which &quot;Greek
Oracles&quot; were contained</b>.<a href="#_ftn44"
name="_ftnref44" title=""><sup>[44]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And he ordered the boy standing near him to read it:&nbsp; <i>Phdgse distrarek tou &ocirc;</i>&mdash;&quot;let the one
standing beside [me] read.&quot;<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p>But he, not
paying heed to the book, quickly declared it (?).<a href="#_ftn46"
name="_ftnref46" title=""><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p>And he said to
him, &quot;Read from <b>the story of Cassander</b>.&quot;<a
href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><sup>[47]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And he read as follows:</p>

<p><b>11. Cassander died, leaving behind a sister, called Doris;
she was the daughter of Pylades, who had been killed in Greece.</b><a
href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><sup>[48]</sup></a><b>&nbsp; Attalus the king of the Lacedaemonians</b><a
href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><sup>[49]</sup></a><b> lusted after her; and when they went to
bed together, she, having a sword inside [the room], planted it in his heart
and took control of the kingdom.&nbsp; And once this had happened, she acquired</b><a
href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><sup>[50]</sup></a><b> great fear.&nbsp; And his brother Philip went
to live in Achaea<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><sup>[51]</sup></a>
and there taking as wife the sister of Calliopus their general, named Alisbis </b>[p. 6]<b>, he was seeking to destroy
Doris and her people.&nbsp; And they were afraid.&nbsp; For all the peoples around her,
being enamored of her beauty, were helping her.&nbsp; For she would not give herself
in marriage to just anyone.</b></p>

<p><b>But since they were all afraid of
her&mdash;for she had attacked many and had destroyed them all&mdash;the Achaeans decided
at that time to send an embassy to Delphi and to receive an oracle there about
this matter.&nbsp; And they, after setting out, asked Euoptia the priestess at the
water of the Castalian [spring], for themselves to know the object of their coming.</b><a
href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><sup>[52]</sup></a><b>&nbsp; She, having tasted the spring water,
answered thus:&nbsp; &quot;Philip, &lt;child of Olympias, of Pella, going to places
above Asia&gt;, will strike the higher ring that circles everything with his
all-powerful arm.&quot;</b><a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p><b>12. But they, deriding and cursing her, said:&nbsp; &quot;Thrice-accursed
one, we asked about a woman; we did not ask about a man who came from
Macedonia, did we?&quot;&nbsp; But she said to them that unconquerable times<a
href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><sup>[54]</sup></a> had
begun to arise; for indeed she herself [i.e., the woman] and that man, and
those with him, would vanquish everyone.</b></p>

<p><b>And they departed, with insults for the prophetess, and went
off to the temple of Athens.&nbsp; And while a priestly cloth was being woven and
fine purple was being applied to it, they came with a will and burst in.&nbsp; The
priestess, Xanthippe, said to them with a burst of anger:&nbsp; &quot;You have
entered here at an evil hour, you reckless and unruly<a href="#_ftn55"
name="_ftnref55" title=""><sup>[55]</sup></a>
ones!&quot;&mdash;and they, becoming displeased in turn, mistreated her and said:&nbsp;
&quot;You are unworthy of any honor; </b>[p. 8]<b> you are foreign to the priestly disposition&mdash;and you
are disgracing the purple, which the gods granted to royalty, by which those
who wear it possess honor and glory.&nbsp; Stop speaking strange things!&nbsp; Depart
from your wineless drunkenness, you arrogant huckster!&quot;&nbsp; But she said to
them:&nbsp; &quot;You have brought these charges not against me, but against those
who cannot be insulted.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><sup>[56]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Nevertheless, receive a secure oracle and go your way:&nbsp; 'A certain youthful
man, who is the effectual conception of a mingling bed, having the
unconquerable weight of God's unconquerable scale,<a href="#_ftn57"
name="_ftnref57" title=""><sup>[57]</sup></a> will
circle the boundless world like an egg, capturing<a href="#_ftn58"
name="_ftnref58" title=""><sup>[58]</sup></a> all with
his spear.'&quot;&nbsp; But they, blowing on her,<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59"
title=""><sup>[59]</sup></a>
withdrew, speaking unlawful things against the gods.&nbsp; And they said, &quot;We
do ourselves no good, if we do not go to Phoebus Apollo the Great!&quot;</b></p>

<p><b>13. And they went to the temple of Apollo and said by way of
entreaty:&nbsp; &quot;You victorious and pure well-pleasing</b><a
href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><sup>[60]</sup></a><b> gods, why do you treat your servants in
this way&mdash;asking</b><a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><sup>[61]</sup></a><b> to win a womanly war?&nbsp; You throw us into a
warlike war!&nbsp; Do not act this way, you immortals, true masters, who have
granted to us the greatest material things as gifts; instead, give us clear
signs.</b><a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><sup>[62]</sup></a><b>&nbsp; What, then, will happen to us?&quot;&nbsp; And
immediately a voice came in invisibly speaking as follows:&nbsp; &quot;The tripod
turning a third turn, the prophet is the root;</b><a href="#_ftn63"
name="_ftnref63" title=""><sup>[63]</sup></a>[p. 9]<b> for [there are] three-fold of these [oracles]; a
certain light-bringer, heaven-sent to earth's plain, passing by,</b><a
href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><sup>[64]</sup></a><b> dwells within matter, forming for himself a body in
the womb of a maiden.&nbsp; And her name is twice seventy-six.</b><a
href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><sup>[65]</sup></a>
<b>&nbsp;He, demolishing the lordships and every holy
object of your reverence,</b><a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><sup>[66]</sup></a><b> will transfer the reward of all glory to the heights
of his all-blessed wisdom.&quot;</b></p>

<p>14.
Aphroditianus said: &quot;You have pointed out as something
impressive&mdash;something that escapes my notice, in your view&mdash;the fact that [these
oracles] have spoken about the Macedonian and about your Christ.&nbsp; But the
Macedonian, when he had trodden upon the provinces of the Persians in an
untimely fashion, departed from them in a timely fashion, whereas Christ
prevailed when he was defeated, and he put the machinations of the plotters to
shame.</p>

<p>15. The
bishops said:&nbsp; &quot;Your commendable love of wisdom<a href="#_ftn67"
name="_ftnref67" title=""><sup>[67]</sup></a>
has not missed anything pertaining to knowledge.&nbsp; But it<a href="#_ftn68"
name="_ftnref68" title=""><sup>[68]</sup></a>
was in doubt about <b>the oracles [recorded] by
Philip</b>.&nbsp; Hence, if there is any truth and benefit contained [in
them], share salvation with us, who have fled for refuge to your
serenity.&quot;</p>

<p>16. Aphroditianus:&nbsp; &quot;You think that I am ignorant of the opinions that have
been voiced regarding Christ.&nbsp; But the fact that<a href="#_ftn69"
name="_ftnref69" title=""><sup>[69]</sup></a>
there is not <i>one </i>single voice and
<i>one</i> single tongue<a href="#_ftn70"
name="_ftnref70" title=""><sup>[70]</sup></a>&mdash;[such
that] the people around him are plentiful or that group itself is not divided
or at variance with itself, advancing divided opinions itself&mdash;while the Jews
speak differently about him (for indeed, I have both come into contact with
their Scriptures and know yours; and the Scriptures themselves are
well-constructed, but those who deal with [p. 10] them are inharmonious)&mdash;for
this reason, Christian [teachings and arguments] remain implausible to me, hindered
as they are by their own disputations&mdash;because [the teachers]<a href="#_ftn71"
name="_ftnref71" title=""><sup>[71]</sup></a>
are incoherent and thoughtless.&quot;</p>

<p>17. The
bishops said:&nbsp; &quot;And what nation does not fight against itself, both in
earlier times and now?<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><sup>[72]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Jews, Samaritans, Greeks who live in religious ignorance,<a href="#_ftn73"
name="_ftnref73" title=""><sup>[73]</sup></a>
and the children of the Buddha [all disagree with themselves / each other (?)].<a
href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title=""><sup>[74]</sup></a>&nbsp;
For indeed, Jews and Samaritans say that there is a Christ, but he has not yet
come; and Greeks even unwillingly have proclaimed the doctrines<a href="#_ftn75"
name="_ftnref75" title=""><sup>[75]</sup></a>
concerning him, exactly as the prophets taught them.&quot;</p>

<p>18. Aphroditianus:&nbsp; &quot;But <i>you</i>
ought not to disagree, you who are said to rise above every [other] nation!&nbsp;
Nevertheless, if you will bear with me, I will tell you countless further
quotes<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title=""><sup>[76]</sup></a>
about Christ.&nbsp; But the fact that the subject of him is so disputed by his own
people leaves me in two minds.&nbsp; And not only that, but so does the fact that
his own nation lies with all their might, never allowing truth into their
thinking; they commit injustice, love impure unions, and are prone to anger,
eager to destroy each other, each one believing as seems best to him,
preferring his wishes over tradition&mdash;and all this is not characteristic of true
religion.&nbsp; Therefore, I patiently urge you to listen to me; and I believe that
I both give and receive help.&nbsp; For if I benefit you, then I myself have
received a benefit.&nbsp; Indeed, I do not accept the eulogies you make to me:&nbsp; for
I am nothing.&nbsp; I hate all that [is said] in order to curry favor, and I reject
mere human glory.&nbsp; But if anything aims at truth, I take pleasure in it; if
anything aims at righteousness, I rejoice in it; and I am not saying this by
way of seeking praise&mdash;far be it from me to do anything with a view to pleasing
mortal men!&nbsp; But [may I] speak and perform whatever is in accord with the <i>God-</i>pleasing laws.&nbsp; But as for you, noble
priests&mdash;for I do not call you Christian priests, but ministers of divine power
[p. 11]&mdash;pay attention to my words, as befits your consecrated status:&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>Aphroditianus' Story</i></b><a href="#_ftn77"
name="_ftnref77" title=""><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p><b>19. Christ was known to Persia<a href="#_ftn78"
name="_ftnref78" title=""><sup>[78]</sup></a> from the
beginning.&nbsp; For nothing escapes the learned jurists of that country, who
investigate all things with the utmost care. The facts, therefore, which are
inscribed upon the golden tablets,<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title=""><sup>[79]</sup></a>
and laid up in the royal temples,<a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" title=""><sup>[80]</sup></a>
I shall announce&mdash;for it is from the temples there, and the priests connected
with them,<a href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81" title=""><sup>[81]</sup></a>
that the name of Christ has first been heard of.&nbsp; The temple of Hera,
surpassing even the royal palace, which temple King Cyrus, who was
knowledgeable in all piety, built, and erected golden and silver statues of the
gods in it, and adorned it<a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82" title=""><sup>[82]</sup></a>
with precious stones&mdash;not to digress with a detailed description of that
ornamentation...&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>Now about that time (as the inscribed tablets testify), the
king having entered the temple, with the view of getting a
dream-interpretation, was addressed by the priest Prupippus<a href="#_ftn83"
name="_ftnref83" title=""><sup>[83]</sup></a> thus:&nbsp;
&quot;I congratulate you,<a href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84" title=""><sup>[84]</sup></a>
master:&nbsp; Hera has conceived.&quot;&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>And the king, smiling, said to him, &quot;Has she who is dead
conceived?&quot;&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>And he said, &quot;Yes, she who was dead has come to life again,
and begets life.&quot;&nbsp; [p. 12]</b></p>

<p><b>20. And the king said,&nbsp; &quot;What is this?&nbsp; Explain it to
me.&quot;&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>And he replied, &quot;In truth, master, you have come here at
just the right time. For over the whole night the images, both the males and
the females, continuously danced, saying to each other, 'Come, let us
congratulate<a href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" title=""><sup>[85]</sup></a>
 Hera.'&nbsp; And they said to me, 'Prophet, come forward; congratulate Hera, for she
has been loved.'&nbsp; And I said, 'Who was able to be loved<a href="#_ftn86"
name="_ftnref86" title=""><sup>[86]</sup></a>&mdash;she who
does not exist?'&nbsp; They reply, 'She has come to life again, and is no longer
called Hera, but Urania.<a href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87" title=""><sup>[87]</sup></a>&nbsp;
For the mighty Helios has loved her.' Then the females say to the males,
disparaging the matter, 'Pege<a href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88" title=""><sup>[88]</sup></a>
is she who was loved; for it was not Hera, was it? She espoused a carpenter.'&nbsp;
And the males say, 'She has rightly been called Pege, we admit.&nbsp; But her name
is Myria;<a href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89" title=""><sup>[89]</sup></a>
for she bears in her womb, as in the sea, a vessel conveying a myriad.&nbsp; And if
she is also [called] Pege, let it be understood thus:&nbsp; This stream of water
sends forth a perennial stream of spirit; it contains but a single fish, taken
with the hook of divinity, and with its own flesh sustaining the whole world,
while it dwells [there] as though in the sea. You have well said,&nbsp; &quot;She
has a carpenter&quot;<a href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90" title=""><sup>[90]</sup></a>&mdash;but
not a carpenter whom she bears from a marriage-bed.<a href="#_ftn91"
name="_ftnref91" title=""><sup>[91]</sup></a>&nbsp; For
this carpenter who is born, the child of the chief carpenter, framed by his
most sagacious skill the triple-constructed celestial roof,<a href="#_ftn92"
name="_ftnref92" title=""><sup>[92]</sup></a> and
established by his word this dwelling with its triple habitations.'<a
href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93" title=""><sup>[93]</sup></a>&nbsp; Thus,
then, the statues continued to dispute with each other concerning Hera and Pege, and [at length] with one voice they said:&nbsp; 'When the day is brought to
completion, we all, male and female, [p. 13] shall know the matter clearly.'&nbsp;
Now, therefore, master, tarry for the rest of the day.&nbsp; For the matter shall
certainly receive full clarity.&nbsp; For that which has emerged is no common
affair.&quot;<a href="#_ftn94" name="_ftnref94" title=""><sup>[94]</sup></a></b></p>

<p><b>21. And when the king remained there and was watching the
statues, the harpers of their own accord began to strike their harps, and the
Muses began to sing; and all the creatures that were within [the temple],
whether quadrupeds or birds (made of silver and gold), were uttering their own
characteristic voices.&nbsp; And as the king shuddered, and was filled with great
fear&mdash;he was about to withdraw, for he could not endure the spontaneous
tumult&mdash;the priest said to him, &quot;Remain, O King, for the full revelation is
at hand which the God of gods has chosen to make plain to us.&quot;</b></p>

<p><b>22. And when these things had been said, the roof was opened,
and a bright star descended and stood above the pillar<a href="#_ftn95"
name="_ftnref95" title=""><sup>[95]</sup></a> of Pege,
and a voice was heard to this effect:&nbsp; &quot;Mistress Pege, the great Sun<a
href="#_ftn96" name="_ftnref96" title=""><sup>[96]</sup></a> has sent
me to make the announcement to you, and at the same time to serve you in your
giving birth&mdash;as he produces blameless offspring with you, who are becoming
mother of the first of all ranks [of being], bride of the single divinity with
three names. And the child born without seed is called the Beginning and the
End:&nbsp; the beginning of salvation, and the end of destruction.&quot;</b></p>

<p><b>When this voice had spoken, all the statues fell upon their
faces, with Pege alone still standing, on whom also a royal diadem was found to
have been fastened, having on its upper side a star set with precious stones of
carbuncle and emerald.&nbsp; And up above [i.e., in the sky], the star stood still.<a
href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97" title=""><sup>[97]</sup></a></b></p>

<p><b>23. And the king forthwith gave orders<a href="#_ftn98"
name="_ftnref98" title=""><sup>[98]</sup></a> to bring
in all the wise interpreters of signs, as many as were under his dominion. And
when the heralds hurried them along with their trumpets, they all assembled in
the temple.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>And when they saw the star [p. 14] above Pege, and the diadem
with the starry stone, and the statues lying on the floor, they said:&nbsp; &quot;O
king, a divinely inspired and royal root has risen, bearing the stamp of a
heavenly and earthly king.&nbsp; For Pege is the daughter of Karia the Bethlehemite,<a
href="#_ftn99" name="_ftnref99" title=""><sup>[99]</sup></a> and the
diadem is a kingly mark, and the star is a celestial announcement of marvels on
the earth. Out of Judah has arisen a kingdom which shall destroy all the
memorials of the Jews.<a href="#_ftn100" name="_ftnref100" title=""><sup>[100]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And the prostration of the gods upon the floor anticipated the end of their
honor.&nbsp; For he who comes, being of more ancient dignity, shall shake those who
are new in it [i.e., dignity]. Now therefore, O king, send to Jerusalem.&nbsp; For
you will find the Son of the Omnipotent God being carried in bodily form in the
bodily arms of a woman.&quot;&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>And the star remained above Pege, who has been named Urania,
until the <i>magi</i> went forth, and
then it went with them.</b></p>

<p><b>24. And then, in the depth of evening, Dionysus appeared in
the temple, unaccompanied by the satyrs, and said to the statues:&nbsp; &quot;Pege
is no longer one of us, but stands far above us, since she gives birth to a
human being who was conceived by divine Fortune.&nbsp;&nbsp; O priest Prupippus!&nbsp; What
are you doing sitting here? An action, indicated in writing, has proceeded
against us, and we are going to be convicted [p. 15] as false by a person in
action.&nbsp; The apparitions we produced, we produced; and that which we ruled, we
ruled.<a href="#_ftn101" name="_ftnref101" title=""><sup>[101]</sup></a>
No longer do we give oracular responses.&nbsp; Removed from us is our honour. We
have become without honor and glory.&nbsp; There is one, one alone, out of all, who
has received again his proper honour.&quot;</b></p>

&nbsp;No longer do the Persians exact tribute of earth and air.&nbsp; For he who
established these things is at hand, and he brings tribute of <i>actions</i> to him who sent him&mdash;he who renews
the ancient image, and puts image together with image, and brings the unlike to
likeness.<a href="#_ftn103" name="_ftnref103" title=""><sup>[103]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Heaven rejoices with earth, and earth itself boasts at receiving heaven's
boast.<a href="#_ftn104" name="_ftnref104" title=""><sup>[104]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Things which have not happened above, have happened below.&nbsp; He whom the order
of the blessed has not seen, is viewed by the [order of] the miserable.&nbsp; Flame
threatens those; dew is present for these.&nbsp; It [was] the good fortune of Karia
to give birth to Pege in Bethlehem, and it [is] Pege's grace to become
heaven-desired and to conceive grace of grace.<a href="#_ftn105"
name="_ftnref105" title=""><sup>[105]</sup></a> Judaea
has bloomed, and our affairs are withering immediately.<a href="#_ftn106"

Gentiles and foreigners, salvation has come; to the wretched, relief is
provided in abundance.&nbsp; Rightly do the women dance, and say, 'Lady Pege,

cloud that brings the world dew after heat, remember your servants, dear
mistress.'&quot;<a href="#_ftn107" name="_ftnref107" title=""><sup>[107]</sup></a></b></p>

<p><b>26. The king then, without delay, sent the <i>magi</i> under his dominion<a href="#_ftn108"
name="_ftnref108" title=""><sup>[108]</sup></a> with
gifts, with the star showing them the way.&nbsp; And when they returned, they
narrated everything to the men of that time&mdash;those very things which were also
written on leaves of gold, to the following effect:</b></p>

<p><b>27. For when we came to Jerusalem, the sign, together with
our arrival, [p. 16] disturbed everyone.&nbsp; They say, &quot;What is this?&nbsp; Wise
men of the Persians are here, and along with them an appearance of a
star?&quot;&nbsp; And the foremost of the Jews asked us what was going to happen, and
the reason for our coming.&nbsp; And we said:&nbsp; &quot;He whom you call 'Messiah' has
been born.&quot; And they were confounded, and dared not oppose us.&nbsp; But they,
for their part, said to us, &quot;Justice of Heaven!&nbsp; Tell us what you
know.&quot;&nbsp; And we said to them:&nbsp; &quot;You have the disease of unbelief; and
neither without an oath nor with an oath do you believe, but you follow your
own ill-advised intentions.&nbsp; For the Christ, the child of the Most High, has
been born, putting an end to of your law and synagogues.&nbsp; And it is for this
reason that, struck as it were by a most excellent oracle<a href="#_ftn109"
name="_ftnref109" title=""><sup>[109]</sup></a> as with
a dart, you do not hear with pleasure this name which has come up against you
suddenly.&quot;&nbsp; And they then, taking counsel together, urged us to accept
their gifts, and tell no one such a thing [as the news] from this land [of
theirs], lest a revolt rise against us.<a href="#_ftn110" name="_ftnref110"
title=""><sup>[110]</sup></a>&nbsp; But we
said:&nbsp; &quot;We have brought gifts in his honor, with the view of proclaiming
those mighty things which have happened in our country on occasion of his
birth&mdash;and you bid us take your gifts, and conceal the things which have been
made known to us by celestial divinity, and neglect the commandments of our own
king?&nbsp; Or do you not know what an experience of the Assyrians you once
received?&quot;&nbsp; And they became afraid, and after beseeching us repeatedly,
they sent us away.</b></p>

<p><b>When the one who was ruling over Judaea sent for us [p. 17]
and had some converse with us, and asked us questions, we said to him [things]
at which he was thoroughly disturbed.<a href="#_ftn111" name="_ftnref111"
title=""><sup>[111]</sup></a>&nbsp; We
departed from him, without giving any greater heed to him than to any worthless
person.</b></p>

<p><b>28. And we came to that place to which we had been sent, and
saw the one who had given birth and the one who had been born, the star
indicating to us the lordly babe.&nbsp; And we said to the mother:&nbsp; &quot;What are
you called, O renowned mother?&quot;&nbsp; And she says:&nbsp; &quot;Mary,
masters.&quot;&nbsp; And we said to her:&nbsp; &quot;Where do you come from?&quot;&nbsp; And
she said:&nbsp; &quot;From this district&mdash;[the district] of the Bethlehemites.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Have you not taken a husband?&quot;&nbsp; She says:&nbsp;
&quot;I have only been betrothed, with only pre-nuptial arrangements having
been concluded; but my thoughts are divided.&nbsp; For I had no wish at all to come
to this [state of affairs].&nbsp; But while I was giving very little concern to it,
at the dawn of a certain Sabbath&mdash;at the rising of the sun&mdash;an angel straightway
appeared to me bringing me the good news of offspring, all of a sudden.&nbsp; And I
was disturbed, and cried out, 'Let it not be so to me, Lord, for I do not have
a husband.'&nbsp; And he persuaded me to believe, that it was by the will of God
that I would have the son.&quot;&nbsp; And we said to her:&nbsp; &quot;Mother of mothers,
all the gods of the Persians have called you blessed:&nbsp; Your grounds for
boasting are great, for you have transcended all women of renown, and you have
become manifestly more queenly than all queens.&quot;</b></p>

<p><b>29. The child, moreover, was seated on the ground, being, as
she said, nearly two years old, and having in part the likeness of the one who
bore him.&nbsp; For she was small in stature even when holding her head up, and had
a delicate body; and she was the color of wheat; and she had her hair bound up
with a simple, very beautiful hair-style.&nbsp; And as we had along with [p. 18] us
a servant quite skilled in painting, we brought back with us to our country a
likeness of them both; and it was placed in the temple in which the oracle was
given,<a href="#_ftn112" name="_ftnref112" title=""><sup>[112]</sup></a>
with the following inscription:&nbsp; &quot;In the heaven-sent<a href="#_ftn113"
name="_ftnref113" title=""><sup>[113]</sup></a> temple,
the power of Persia dedicated this to Zeus Helios, the great God, King
Jesus.&quot;</b></p>

<p><b>And taking the child up, and bearing him in our arms, each of
us in turn, we saluted him and worshipped him, and presented to him gold,<a
href="#_ftn114" name="_ftnref114" title=""><sup>[114]</sup></a>
addressing Him thus:&nbsp; &quot;[We give] to you what is your own; we lavish you
[with gifts], O powerful one in heaven.&nbsp; Things unordered would be ordered in
no way other than by your presence.&nbsp; In no other way could things above be
brought into conjunction with things below, but by your descent.&nbsp; Service is
not carried out to such a degree, if only a servant is sent, as when the
[master] himself is present; neither [can so much be achieved] when the king
sends only his satraps to war, as when he is there himself.&nbsp; It was quite
fitting for your methods, for you to deal in this manner with the rebels.&quot;<a
href="#_ftn115" name="_ftnref115" title=""><sup>[115]</sup></a></b></p>

<p><b>And the child smiled and leaped at our fawning and our words.
And when we had bidden the mother farewell, and when she had shown us honor,
and we had glorified her as was necessary, we went to the place in which we
lodged.</b></p>

<p><b>30. And when evening came, there appeared to us someone
terrifying and awesome,<a href="#_ftn116" name="_ftnref116" title=""><sup>[116]</sup></a>
saying:&nbsp; &quot;Get away quickly, lest you fall prey to a plot.&quot;&nbsp; And we,
in fear, said:&nbsp; &quot;And who is it that is plotting against so august [p. 19]
an embassy, O general of God?&quot;&nbsp; And he replied:&nbsp; &quot;Herod&mdash;but get up
immediately and depart in safety and peace.&quot;&nbsp; And we speedily mounted our
strong steeds and departed from there in all earnestness; and we reported all
that we had seen in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>Behold, then, such great things have we told you regarding
Christ; and we know that Christ has become our Savior.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>&quot;But you, by your ways, are
opposed to him, slandering his pain and suffering all the time.&nbsp; For speaking
unworthy things, and doing still more unworthy things, are a mark of hatred.<a
href="#_ftn117" name="_ftnref117" title=""><sup>[117]</sup></a></b></p>

<p>31. &quot;As
for me, I honor the Sun / Helios, which is beneficial to all, the one that
sends out its rays of light; and in the same way, I marvel at Air, which
stoutly encompasses our bodies round about, and embellishes the earth with its
other natural qualities.&nbsp;&nbsp; [Likewise,] the irresistible Fire, to which all
corporeal nature is subjected, the proof more approved than all matter.&nbsp;
[Likewise,] Water, the life of mortals&mdash;when it is not present, nothing fleshly
shall live.&nbsp; And while I honor all these, I honor the one who graciously gave
them, the one who stands as First Cause of the universe.&nbsp; He was owed obeisance
from the undefiled powers alone, whose thanksgivings are uninterrupted and
undivided, whom no other occupation ever dominates, whose attendance on him is
unvarying and who worship him in accordance with their very nature.&nbsp; For human
beings are known to be worthless, since they are slaves to their own pleasures.</p>

<p>32. And when
Aphroditianus had said these things, the entire gathering fell silent, having
nothing to answer.&nbsp; But it only said, &quot;Glory to you, O Christ, whose gifts
of grace every mouth confesses.&quot;<a href="#_ftn118" name="_ftnref118"
title=""><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

<p>Aphroditianus
said:&nbsp; <b>&quot;There have been Christians [p.
20] indeed, but there have also been pagans,<a href="#_ftn119" name="_ftnref119"
title=""><sup>[119]</sup></a> who
practiced the utmost virtue.&nbsp; King Cyrus had very attractive female bodyguards<a
href="#_ftn120" name="_ftnref120" title=""><sup>[120]</sup></a> where
he slept:&nbsp; he was sharpening his desire, but also correcting it by such trials.&nbsp;
He used to say that all glory was worthy of the heavenly power alone.&nbsp; He loved
his fellow man so much that there was no poor man or even the least captive in
Persian territory, because of his constant bestowing of benefits upon
everyone.&nbsp; And Concencrates,<a href="#_ftn121" name="_ftnref121" title=""><sup>[121]</sup></a>
who was truly a philosopher, possessed one single rough cloak&mdash;he lived near the
peak of Masgabala, being terribly worn out by the snow and cold; and the wise
Neoctetius said to him:&nbsp; 'You will perish, wise man, and die because of the
heat and cold.'&nbsp; And he said:&nbsp; 'If I die to those here [on earth], I shall live
by my future hope.'&nbsp; He asked:&nbsp; 'What [hope] is that?'&nbsp; And the other said,
'Truly, I am directing my attention to a certain other life, and offering
myself myself to it.&nbsp; For the Providence of God will not disregard those who
have labored during the day:&nbsp; in the evening it will deem them worthy of reward
and rest.&nbsp; Every day I see the heavens and the things of earth that seem good
diminishing and decaying.&nbsp; And this takes place because of our &quot;exasperations,&quot;<a
href="#_ftn122" name="_ftnref122" title=""><sup>[122]</sup></a> which
show beforehand that everything here below perishes.&nbsp; But those who have
acquired the virtues above do not die, as they are spoken about and answered
with eternal remembrance by them.'&nbsp; This man only ate fruit, and drank a little
water once a day, not wishing to know anything else [p. 21] of what belongs to
the world, [but] practicing death every day.&nbsp; And this is sufficient.&nbsp; And
Dichorianus, who published so many things about God, and who used to say that
he was nourished by these things, and not by those which harm the body&mdash;after
preserving impassibility of body and mind for 90 years, while he was dying
said:&nbsp; 'Glory to you, righteous Justice, who changed my [mind] regarding what
was honorable.'&nbsp; And there are many others of whom the book-lovers know&mdash;both
Christians and true philosophers.&nbsp; But let us leave off for today, and tomorrow
we [will] inquire into the rest.&nbsp; If it is desired by the will of heaven that
we come this far, we [will] achieve resolution of further questions in turn.&quot;</b></p>

<p>33.&nbsp; When
everyone had departed, some archimandrites accused Aphroditianus to the king of
having inclined toward the Christians, pleading on their behalf in everything,
and engaging in no discourse about the true religion of the pagans, but instead
working contrary to the pagans, conducting his exercise about Christ alone.&nbsp;
The king, on the other hand, grew angry at them, and said to them:&nbsp; &quot;You
who are called Christians and heads of monasteries, what is your object in
unsettling the affairs of the pagans?&nbsp; Why, as monks, are you not at
rest?&quot;&nbsp; And immediately Aphroditianus entered and told the king
everything.&nbsp; And the king said to him:&nbsp; &quot;In the name of our divinely
inspired Fortune, I am in no doubt at all regarding you.&nbsp; For I know your guilelessness
and truthfulness; and if only my kingdom had another one like you!&nbsp; But you are
doing well in making known the truth to both Christians and pagans.&nbsp; Hence,
take these sycophants and cut off their heads!&quot;&nbsp; And Aphroditianus, taking
them into his own house, accorded them [p. 22] all possible care, not in any
way mistreating them, and [thus] he kept the Christians safe from the plot
against them.<a href="#_ftn123" name="_ftnref123" title=""><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p>34.&nbsp; The
following day, Oricatus<a href="#_ftn124" name="_ftnref124" title=""><sup>[124]</sup></a>
the foremost of the enchanters came to him and said:&nbsp; &quot;Master of
everything under the sun, grant me glory, so that I may preside in this
assembly, since I have three mighty acts<a href="#_ftn125" name="_ftnref125"
title=""><sup>[125]</sup></a>
to perform!&quot;&nbsp; And the king said:&nbsp; &quot;Are <i>you</i> trying to rise above the marvellous
Aphroditianus?&quot;&nbsp; Oricatus said:&nbsp; &quot;If I do not demonstrate there a
power which no one else has demonstrated, persuading them with great signs,
then hand me over to be crucified!&quot;&nbsp; But the king did not wish to cause
pain to Aphroditianus, and he told him the entire matter.&nbsp; Aphroditianus said:&nbsp;
&quot;What he intends to do, he cannot do in the midst of those men, and he
[will] fail.&nbsp; But let him act as the king decides.&quot;&nbsp; And again, along with
others, he troubled [the king], giving assurances to the king that he possessed
the ability absolutely to undo the Christians, with all probability. &nbsp;The king
said to him:&nbsp; &quot;Go today to my council-chamber, and either persuade or be
persuaded; and if you pass through this affair and persuade them without any
compulsion, you will be deemed worthy of monuments<a href="#_ftn126"
name="_ftnref126" title=""><sup>[126]</sup></a>&mdash;but
if, on the contrary, you fail, you will be deprived of possessions and
life.&quot;&nbsp; And he was sent to the gathering with a letter containing the
following words:&nbsp; &quot;The great king, superior to all glory, lord of peoples
and tribes and islands, to the priests of the Christians who have assembled
together, rejoice!<a href="#_ftn127" name="_ftnref127" title=""><sup>[127]</sup></a>&nbsp;
I myself rejoice as well.&nbsp; I have sent to you Oricatus, the leader of the [p.
23] enchanters belonging to my kingdom&mdash;who will in no way compel you, but will
learn either to persuade or to be persuaded.&nbsp; But if he goes too far, he will
come to know what the force of kingly power is able to do.&nbsp; And I am sending to
you Aphroditianus, who is enthroned with me, for the sake of evaluating the
aforementioned [Oricatus], and he will fill up any lack or deficiency.&nbsp; <i>Abanatran&ecirc;te chr&ocirc; katelloi ter terennatoi&mdash;</i>that
is to say:&nbsp; 'The heaven-born power has deigned to converse with mortals.'&quot;</p>

<p>35.&nbsp; Oricatus
himself, along with others in white robes, came wearing a necklace with three
Gorgon-faces<a href="#_ftn128" name="_ftnref128" title=""><sup>[128]</sup></a>&mdash;the
figure of three &quot;dignities,&quot; he said.&nbsp; When the holy Casteleus, who
saw ahead with a prophetic eye, caught sight of him, he said:&nbsp; &quot;This man
is here to destroy himself.&quot;&nbsp; And when everyone had sat down, the same
Oricatus said to the gathering:&nbsp; &quot;We have heard that before now you have
honored actions more than words.&nbsp; What then does your wisdom wish either to say
or to do?&quot;&nbsp; But everyone was silent, viewing him with displeasure; and he
said to them:&nbsp; &quot;If you remain silent, then it is necessary for me to say
this&mdash;as it were, in accordance with your Scripture:&nbsp; that you should give us a
sign or a wonder, or I should give one to you.&quot;&nbsp; The bishops, together
with the holy Casteleus, said:&nbsp; &quot;It is proper that you, who have put
forward and proposed this, should do it first.&quot;&nbsp; The same group, again,
said:&nbsp; &quot;We do not have the 'dignity' to go after amazing deeds; instead,
you yourself, since you are the standard of measurement for such things,
display your [p. 24] power, so that we may know whether it really comes from a
divine source.&quot;&nbsp; And he said:&nbsp; &quot;Straightaway.&quot;&nbsp; And taking some
clay, he fashioned a falcon and immediately caused it to fly.<a href="#_ftn129"
name="_ftnref129" title=""><sup>[129]</sup></a>&nbsp;
But the holy Casteleus along with the bishops paying attention to it&mdash;it
straightaway fell, becoming clay again, and shattered.&nbsp; Oricatus said:&nbsp;
&quot;Grant me five responses<a href="#_ftn130" name="_ftnref130" title=""><sup>[130]</sup></a>
whereby I can persuade you that I am a child of gods and everything obeys me as
a powerful being.&quot;&nbsp; The gathering said:&nbsp; &quot;Very well.&quot;</p>

<p>36.&nbsp; Oricatus
said:&nbsp; &quot;There are some Ethiopian Indians here, who have come in pursuit of
business:&nbsp; I shall make them white quickly with a word.&quot;&nbsp; The bishops,
along with the holy man, said:&nbsp; &quot;If you know of anything that is a help to
you, do it.&quot;&nbsp; And having brought the Indians [forward], he said:&nbsp; &quot;I
am able to make you white and send you home with many gifts.&quot;&nbsp; And they
were content with this.&nbsp; And taking a silver dish and putting spring water in
it, he called on the forces<a href="#_ftn131" name="_ftnref131" title=""><sup>[131]</sup></a>
with which he was familiar.&nbsp; And when he had made the incantation, he poured
[the water] on the two men by way of finishing [the process].&nbsp; Immediately
their entire bodies were covered with blisters, and their shouts went up to the
heavens as they were burned up by the blisters.&nbsp; And <i>he</i> threatened the forces on whom he had called, shrieking at
them and growing angry.&nbsp; The gathering, together with the holy man, said to the
Ethiopians:&nbsp; &quot;Behold the gifts of Satan!<a href="#_ftn132"
name="_ftnref132" title=""><sup>[132]</sup></a>&nbsp;
But believe in God, and he himself will heal you through water and the
Spirit.&quot;&nbsp; And they said:&nbsp; &quot;We believe in the God whom you worship,
who will revive us in body and in spirit.&quot;&nbsp; And immediately they exorcized
them&mdash;for their affliction was frothing up&mdash;and brought them down into the pool,
saying:&nbsp; &quot;Now you shall know the power of God and Christ the
Savior.&quot;&nbsp; And they baptized them.<a href="#_ftn133" name="_ftnref133"
title=""><sup>[133]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And when they came up out of the water, their bodies were found [p. 25] free of
any fault.<a href="#_ftn134" name="_ftnref134" title=""><sup>[134]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And they said to Oricatus:&nbsp; &quot;You afflicted us by means of water, but God
healed us by means of water.&nbsp; We are now going to tell our King about the
amazing works of the Lord, and the benefits conferred by his soldiers.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>37. But Oricatus
waited, protesting and saying:&nbsp; &quot;I still have three acts to perform&mdash;and by
all means, if I suceed in one [of them], I win.&quot;&nbsp; And again, the bishops
said:&nbsp; &quot;For your own judgment, do what you wish.&quot;&nbsp; <b>And he said:&nbsp; &quot;I shall bring Philip the
presbyter, concerning whom we are disputing, out of Hades into our midst&mdash;he

not belong to him.&quot;</b>&nbsp; The bishops said:&nbsp; &quot;And again we say
to you:&nbsp; At your own risk, do as you will.&quot;&nbsp; And taking a brazier filled
with coals, he first placed calves upon it, and then also threw wine-bottles
into the fire, such that many stepped back so as not to be harmed; but he,
bearing staves of walnut, again called upon the familiar names of the
demons&mdash;while the gathering loudly laughed at him.&nbsp; For they knew that he was
going to be refute himself.&nbsp; And indeed, after an interval of time elapsed, and
his artifice was being hindered, and he was trying to compel the force to show
itself, there came into our midst the appearance of a certain monk, to whom the
bishops, along with the holy Casteleus, said:&nbsp; &quot;Where have you been a
monk?&quot;&nbsp; Put to shame, it was transformed into a weeping woman, and they,
as one, all said:&nbsp; &quot;Whom are you lamenting?&quot;&nbsp; And she said:&nbsp;
&quot;The man who brought me here.&quot;&nbsp; And the holy man said to her:&nbsp;
&quot;Say in the presence of everyone who you are, so that the man who brought
you here will not seem to be boasting as though he had contrived some noble
action.&quot;&nbsp; And she said:&nbsp; &quot;I am an angel; I have been put to shame
before you and debased because of the contentiousness of this man alone, who is
not able to perform any signs.&quot;&nbsp; The gathering, together with Casteleus,
said:&nbsp; &quot;Behold!&nbsp; In the third procedure, you fail; and you remain in your
failure.&nbsp; So then, since you have been beaten, henceforth give way before the
men of God, lest you be destroyed by them.&quot;&nbsp; And he said:&nbsp; &quot;I have
been defeated three times, but in what remains [p. 26] I believe I will
win.&quot;&nbsp; Then they say to the demon:&nbsp; &quot;Do you confess that you are a
demon, or [do you claim to be] a human being?&quot;&nbsp; And it said:&nbsp; &quot;I am a
demon, and I have come here to deceive&mdash;if I were permitted to do so.&quot;&nbsp; And
they breathed upon it and caused it to disappear&mdash;and <i>he</i>, on the other hand, would not stop gnashing his teeth and
blaspheming.<a href="#_ftn135" name="_ftnref135" title=""><sup>[135]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>38. Oricatus
said:&nbsp; &quot;I shall fire up a furnace to a high pitch, and I shall walk into
the midst of the fire and then come out.&quot;&nbsp; The gathering said:&nbsp; &quot;Do
this as your final sign.&quot;<a href="#_ftn136" name="_ftnref136" title=""><sup>[136]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Then Oricatus in his turn said:&nbsp; &quot;A woman has died before the gates.&nbsp; So
then, the one in whose name she rises again, this one is a god.&quot;&nbsp; And they
all rejoiced and were content.&nbsp; And he, for his part, making use of the sweet
smell of incense, began to sprinkle the dead woman with the blood of
goats.&quot;&nbsp; And again, he performed an ox-sacrifice and, snorting loudly,<a
href="#_ftn137" name="_ftnref137" title=""><sup>[137]</sup></a> said
threateningly to the familiar standing next to him:&nbsp; &quot;I give you eight
souls; grant me the one soul of the Nazoraean, since I am worn out because of
you.&quot;&nbsp; And a voice came:&nbsp; &quot;You have adversaries who are defeating you
in all respects.&nbsp; Now then, yield to defeat.&nbsp; For the angels of Jesus are
standing with swords in opposition to us, along with our<a href="#_ftn138"
name="_ftnref138" title=""><sup>[138]</sup></a>
followers.&quot;&nbsp; But he, along with the hundred oxen, slaughtered birds, not
at all acting well&mdash;and groaning deeply indeed because he had been triumphed
over, he said to the bishops:&nbsp; &quot;At this point I will believe in you, so
that you may accomplish that for which I have lost esteem.&quot;</p>

<p>And the
bishops, casting themselves down [to their knees] together with the holy man
made their request to God, with toil and humility,<a href="#_ftn139"
name="_ftnref139" title=""><sup>[139]</sup></a>
and standing over the body with one accord, they raised a single voice,
saying:&nbsp; &quot;Lord, let impiety not defeat piety, but rather, glorify your
name, O God, in the midst of these unbelievers who pay heed to vain
things.&quot;&nbsp; And when they had finished their prayer, the woman sat up and
stood up straight on her feet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>39. And
Oricatus said:&nbsp; &quot;By Hera, this power is great!&nbsp; And yet, the perfection
[p. 27] of the <i>fifth</i> sign will
persuade [you].<a href="#_ftn140" name="_ftnref140" title=""><sup>[140]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Let the furnace be fired up, and let each person enter there, [trusting] in
whichever god he worships, and then the truth of the god<a href="#_ftn141"
name="_ftnref141" title=""><sup>[141]</sup></a>
will be manifest.&nbsp; However, I am going to select whomever of you I wish to
enter the fire.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And he chose
Se.....tianus,<a href="#_ftn142" name="_ftnref142" title=""><sup>[142]</sup></a>
bishop of Homobyrrhus.&nbsp; And that man, removing his tunic and clothing himself
with the name of Christ, entered the furnace and took his place in the middle,
while conversing with those who stood nearby.&nbsp; And the bishops said to
Se.....tianus:&nbsp; &quot;Come out, confessor, so that this man too may fulfill his
promise.&quot;&nbsp; And he came out, having not even taken in any smoke at
all.&quot;&nbsp; And so, Oricatus, trying not to lose face, went in, and was
completely engulfed in flames, along with his clothing&mdash;and they<a
href="#_ftn143" name="_ftnref143" title=""><sup>[143]</sup></a>
took him and dragged him out, only half alive.&nbsp; And they prayed over him and
healed him.&nbsp; Now then, those who were with him, having seen what had happened,
said:&nbsp; &quot;No power of the gods is equal to this power!&quot;</p>

<p>40. And when
the king found out about this, he proceeded against all his [i.e., Oricatus']
possessions,<a href="#_ftn144" name="_ftnref144" title=""><sup>[144]</sup></a>
handing him over to Aphroditianus to be crucified.&nbsp; The latter, however, took
him and led him to his house, and after taking care of him suitably for a few
days, persuaded the king to receive him.&nbsp; And the king said to him:&nbsp; &quot;I
know of no man who has helped an enemy except you!&quot;&nbsp; And he said:&nbsp;
&quot;We have learned to give help from the one who gives help to all.&nbsp; For
when one does good to one's enemies, the force of enmity will no longer be
useful; instead, dear peace will be there, dancing for the sake of everyone.&quot;</p>

<p>41.&nbsp; Now then,
when the Jewish lawgivers knew that the Christians had won and had been honored
in this way, they were bitterly jealous [p. 28] and they approached the king,
saying:&nbsp; &quot;Master, heavenly sun, the priests of the Christians are able, if
they are willing, to resolve our doubts.&nbsp; So command them to make a decision on
what concerns us, together with the divine Aphroditianus.&nbsp; For we are able,
since we revere one single God just as they do, to gain insight into the
question at issue&mdash;whether Christ has already been made manifest.&quot;&nbsp; And the
king said:&nbsp; &quot;Regarding Christ, hear this without evasion:&nbsp; To those who
came before us he did indeed appear, and a heavenly star made publicly known
both him and his birth.&nbsp; And people from here brought gifts to him; and we have
the image of the mother and the child, housed in the temple of the Heaven-sent.<a
href="#_ftn145" name="_ftnref145" title=""><sup>[145]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Regarding your coming to be in harmony, by Mithras,<a href="#_ftn146"
name="_ftnref146" title=""><sup>[146]</sup></a>
I pray that both parties may be belong to one single religion.&nbsp; But I do not
know whether your love of power will allow you to be reconciled.&nbsp; For indeed,
from the beginning this [love of power] has cast you down, attacking everyone
tyranically.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>43.&nbsp; And they
answered:&nbsp; &quot;We implore your immortal sovereignty, now that we have come
into its presence:&nbsp; We are willing to be persuaded, as we engage with them in
discussions which Aphroditianus, your partner in the throne, will hear and
[thereby] provide a speedy resolution on every subject.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>44.&nbsp; And the
king summoned Aphroditianus and said to him:&nbsp; &quot;Indulge your good character
by judging between the Jews and Christians.&nbsp; For because of your freedom from
falsehood, they all choose you as judge.&quot;&nbsp; And he wrote to the bishops a
letter running as follows:&nbsp; &quot;I, the king of kings, having the magnificence
of the celestial gods, write as follows to the priests of the Christians:&nbsp;
Jacob and Pharas, the foremost of the Jews, have asked me to persuade you to
have a dialogue with them and to arrive at full assurance regarding Christ,<a
href="#_ftn147" name="_ftnref147" title=""><sup>[147]</sup></a>
whether in fact he has come.&nbsp; Therefore, do not approach them as foreigners,
but receive them as parts of your own body, so that they may become
fellow-members with you [in one body].&nbsp; For if this happens, the innermost
ill-will will be weakened, [p. 29] and justice and pious simplicity, being
glorified, will grant the peace that befits our times.&nbsp; <i>Marthedredela kornakykola peplandereinak<a
href="#_ftn148" name="_ftnref148" title=""><sup><b><sup>[148]</sup></b></sup></a>&mdash;</i>which
is translated:&nbsp; He who administers the heavenly powers has given this command
to mortals.&quot;</p>

<p>45.&nbsp; Jacob and Pharas, the Jews
who were mentioned earlier, came to the gathering along with the guileless
Aphroditianus, and when all were seated, Aphroditianus said:&nbsp; &quot;Beloved
men, let us not come together with each other in striving and contentiousness,
like enemies, but rather become one in purpose and receive the truthful
oracles.&nbsp; Therefore, I urge you to interact with each other without
rancor.&quot;<a href="#_ftn149" name="_ftnref149" title=""><sup>[149]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Then he says to the Jews:&nbsp; &quot;Tell us without imposture all that is
contained in your Law.&nbsp; For I will know if you take away or add anything.&nbsp; So
tell us, for what reason have you gathered here?&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>46.&nbsp; Jacob and
his companions said:&nbsp; &quot;For us, the discussion is about the Christ who is
born in Bethlehem:&nbsp; whether he has indeed come.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>47.&nbsp;
Aphroditianus said:&nbsp; &quot;And how are you inclined, regarding him?&quot;&nbsp; And
they answered:&nbsp; &quot;He has yet to come.&quot;&nbsp; Aphroditianus said:&nbsp;
&quot;When do you think he will be born?&quot;&nbsp; The Jews said:&nbsp; &quot;At the
end of time.&quot;&nbsp; Aphroditianus said:&nbsp; &quot;And what more is there for him
to do, when time is done away with?&quot;&nbsp; The Jews said:&nbsp; &quot;That which your
inspired wisdom said&mdash;restoring what is done away with.&quot;</p>

<p>48.
Aphroditianus:&nbsp; &quot;He will restore again what is done away with by his
command and will?&nbsp; The story is incoherent.&nbsp; For it has nowhere been said that
after the consummation of the world another such structure is to arise.&nbsp; Of
this, your own prophet will convince you, saying:&nbsp; 'I shall send to you Elijah
the Tishbite before the great day [p. 30] of the Lord comes...without coming, I
shall smite the earth utterly.'<a href="#_ftn150" name="_ftnref150" title=""><sup>[150]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Now then, if this one, whom you expect as Christ [i.e., Messiah], is Elijah,
one who is not coming to restore but to smite, then we must also find out
this:&nbsp; How is it that he is not called Christ but Elijah?&mdash;and is the one who
was begotten in Tishbe begotten [also] in Bethlehem, as your ancestors
understood the prophet?&nbsp; For the one who said, 'I shall send to you Elijah,' is
different from the one who is sent, and since he said, 'Without coming, I shall
smite the earth utterly' <i>through that man</i>,
he first calls his audience to witness and then does away with this structure
[i.e., the earth].&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Is Christ's birth <i>then</i>, or before that time?&nbsp; For whom would he<a
href="#_ftn151" name="_ftnref151" title=""><sup>[151]</sup></a>
be pleasing or useful?&quot;</p>

<p>49.&nbsp; The
Jews:&nbsp; &quot;Christ and Elijah are two different figures.&nbsp; For our prophet
Daniel beheld a stone<a href="#_ftn152" name="_ftnref152" title=""><sup>[152]</sup></a>
for the king of the Babylonians, and it became a great mountain.&quot;</p>

<p>50.&nbsp;
Aphroditianus:&nbsp; &quot;You have recklessly refuted<a href="#_ftn153"
name="_ftnref153" title=""><sup>[153]</sup></a>
yourselves, not understanding your own bulwark of protection.<a href="#_ftn154"
name="_ftnref154" title=""><sup>[154]</sup></a>&nbsp;
For this text was brought from Babylon to Persia, and I know it perfectly.&nbsp; It
reads as follows:&nbsp; 'And in the days of those kings, the God of heaven will
raise up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed'&mdash;and [p. 31] 'This [kingdom]
shall never be destroyed'&mdash;and 'The king saw that a stone was cut without hands
from a mountain, and the stone that crushed the statue became a great mountain
and filled the whole earth.'<a href="#_ftn155" name="_ftnref155" title=""><sup>[155]</sup></a>&nbsp;
So after those four kingdoms, the God of heaven raised a kingdom which he
promised would be indestructible and without a successor&mdash;which is the stone
that became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.&nbsp; Thus, you have cited
this text against yourselves!&quot;</p>

<p>51.&nbsp; The
Jews:&nbsp; &quot;What four kingdoms?&quot;</p>

<p>Aphroditianus:&nbsp;
&quot;The glorious and renowned ones, which came in succession one after the
other:&nbsp; the Babylonians, the Medes, the Persians, and the fourth one, the
bandit-like one that was difficult to attack, the Macedonian [kingdom].&nbsp; These
[first] three were powerful, and this [fourth] with its rashness has been added
to the three.&nbsp; For it grew up after these [first] kingdoms.</p>

<p>The Jews:&nbsp;
&quot;We assert that the iron kingdom is that of Augustus and his
successors.&quot;<a href="#_ftn156" name="_ftnref156" title=""><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

<p>52.&nbsp;
Aphroditianus:&nbsp; &quot;Whom did the kingdom of Augustus and the rest pulverize
and subdue?<a href="#_ftn157" name="_ftnref157" title=""><sup>[157]</sup></a>&nbsp;
They both defeated and were defeated.&nbsp; The 'pulverizing' [kingdom] is undefeatable.&nbsp;
How do these [i.e., the Romans] subdue anyone, when they themselves all also
give tribute and gifts to this kingdom?&nbsp; And you should understand the
statement, 'In the days of those kings, the God of heaven will raise up a
kingdom,' to mean that it appeared <i>between
them</i>.<a href="#_ftn158" name="_ftnref158" title=""><sup>[158]</sup></a>&nbsp;
If, then, you believe that there is a Christ, look for him at that point in
time, for you will not find him afterwards.&nbsp; For just as your ancestors,
keeping hold of their past expectation, missed its proper time, even so will it
be with you as well.&nbsp; You should see the prophet's words, 'The stone, which the
builders rejected, this has become the head [stone] of the corner,'<a
href="#_ftn159" name="_ftnref159" title=""><sup>[159]</sup></a>
not as still pointing to the future, but as already having taken place.</p>

<p>&quot;Why
should I unfold<a href="#_ftn160" name="_ftnref160" title=""><sup>[160]</sup></a>
the Hebrews' prophecies and not our own?&nbsp; Ophianus [p. 32] Pertillaeus<a
href="#_ftn161" name="_ftnref161" title=""><sup>[161]</sup></a>
spoke in his 'Laws' as follows:&nbsp; 'Oh my!&nbsp; How the Caspian Gate has been
adorned&mdash;it has received a mountain stone, which hands did not hew out, but
rather <i>grace</i> discovered, and
narrowed the whole Gate all around by means of it.&nbsp; Not only did it strengthen
it, but it also opened it when it had been closed&mdash;the stone having become way
and door.&nbsp; The door leads to an august door, and the way draws one to a pure
way, as all those who see it shout:&nbsp; &quot;Great is the dominion of the gods,
whose will for action is more easily realized.&quot;'<a href="#_ftn162"
name="_ftnref162" title=""><sup>[162]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And Elibatus, who wrote down innumerable laws, when speaking <i>On</i> <i>Eucles</i>
towards the end<i>,</i><a href="#_ftn163"
name="_ftnref163" title=""><sup>[163]</sup></a>
says, 'A frightful cloud settled upon a mountain and cast a single stone upon
the earth, and strengthened all its foundations.&nbsp; And how shall a single stone
prevail over the entire [earth]?&nbsp; Did not one God alone create the universe?'&nbsp;
And Trachelaphius, speaking <i>Against the
Falsely-Named</i>, demonstrates his mastery also in the following solid
reasoning:<a href="#_ftn164" name="_ftnref164" title=""><sup>[164]</sup></a>&nbsp;
'Who deceived those who trust in Dionysus so as to say about him that he, being
forever without a beginning, was born from an unravished virgin?&nbsp; They clothe
him with another's dignity.&nbsp; For the one without a beginning, being<a
href="#_ftn165" name="_ftnref165" title=""><sup>[165]</sup></a>
of the substance that is forever without beginning, takes hold of mortal
substance without receiving it as a violation.&nbsp; For that which he formed, he
shall not consider an violation, when he takes it up.&nbsp; There, a virgin&mdash;[p. 33]
unsullied in her body and having no falsehood in her tongue&mdash;supplies virginal
flesh; [this process is the] activation of all grace dwelling within [her].<a
href="#_ftn166" name="_ftnref166" title=""><sup>[166]</sup></a>&nbsp;
I marvel at the flux-bound taking hold of the flux-free&mdash;knowing this:&nbsp; that
some have been deified on account of their promulgation of laws; others,
because of their nobility of life and their conspicuous purity in other
respects, because of which it is fitting to honor them; but to go after
heavenly honors is beyond all audacity and above all blasphemy.'&quot;</p>

<p>53.&nbsp; The
Jews:&nbsp; &quot;We are not familiar with these things, Lord, nor do we have them
in our knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p>Aphroditianus:&nbsp;
&quot;With your own prophets, you are not in agreement; your laws, you falsify.<a
href="#_ftn167" name="_ftnref167" title=""><sup>[167]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Produce for us simply your laws concerning women, if indeed you will obey <i>them</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>The Jews:&nbsp;
&quot;Custom is law.&nbsp; It was established for us, and we are not able to
overturn ancestral practices.&quot;</p>

<p>Aphroditianus:&nbsp;
&quot;I too know that, as you hold fast to your own habits, you do not accept
the true religion.&nbsp; For, as you safeguard your own glory, you do not subject
yourselves to the glory of your God.&quot;</p>

<p>54.&nbsp; The
Jews:&nbsp; &quot;What, then, is your command?&nbsp; Are we to become Christians and fall
into heresies?&quot;</p>

<p>Aphroditianus:&nbsp;
&quot;So you are not acting as heresiarchs in living by your own customs?&nbsp; But
when the bishops themselves are sitting [nearby], why should I wish to give an
account of them&mdash;in particular when having a discussion with <i>you</i>, who appear to magnify yourselves by
your own defeat?&quot;</p>

<p>The Jews
said:&nbsp; &quot;Let the crowd of bishops speak to us!&nbsp; For we know that we will
not be at a loss before them.&quot;</p>

<p>55. The
bishops:&nbsp; &quot;You have done well to come.&nbsp; We do not stand apart from the God
who said, 'Take heart, for I have defeated the world.'<a href="#_ftn168"
name="_ftnref168" title=""><sup>[168]</sup></a>&quot;</p>

<p>The bishops,
again:&nbsp; &quot;We shall set before them a challenge which shall by all means
vanquish them.&quot;</p>

<p>The Jews:&nbsp;
&quot;Propose it with boldness!&quot;</p>

<p>56.&nbsp; The
bishops:&nbsp; &quot;In Jeremiah, he says:&nbsp; 'This is our God; there shall not be
reckoned any other in addition to him.&nbsp; He searched out every path of knowledge
and gave it to Jacob his servant and to Israel his beloved.&nbsp; After this, [p.
34] he appeared upon the earth and lived with humans.'<a href="#_ftn169"
name="_ftnref169" title=""><sup>[169]</sup></a>&quot;</p>

<p>57.&nbsp;
Aphroditianus:&nbsp; &quot;What can Jacob and Pharas, the Rabbis of the priests,<a
href="#_ftn170" name="_ftnref170" title=""><sup>[170]</sup></a>
say in answer to this?&quot;</p>

<p>The Jews:&nbsp;
&quot;It is fitting for them to make use of one other witness, as the Law
says.&quot;</p>

<p>58.&nbsp; The
bishops:&nbsp; &quot;To whom was it said, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your
enemies the footstool of your feet?'<a href="#_ftn171" name="_ftnref171"
title=""><sup>[171]</sup></a>&quot;</p>

<p>The Jews:&nbsp;
&quot;Christ sits at the right hand of God, until he makes his timely
arrival&mdash;which he promised through the prophets.&quot;</p>

<p>59.&nbsp; The
bishops:&nbsp; &quot;To the one who <i>is sitting</i>,
he says, 'Sit at my right hand'?&nbsp; And with whom were the enemies at enmity?&nbsp;
With the one who was not yet there?&nbsp; Indeed, the word 'sit,' which he says,
refers to his going back up from earth to the heavens and sitting, as before,
above his enemies&mdash;so that <i>you</i> are
under the feet of his nation,<a href="#_ftn172" name="_ftnref172" title=""><sup>[172]</sup></a>
being trampled until the last hour.&quot;</p>

<p>The Jews:&nbsp;
&quot;You too should by all means expect to be trampled at the proper
time.&quot;</p>

<p>60.&nbsp; The
bishops:&nbsp; &quot;After unjustly trampling, you are justly trampled.&nbsp; Hence, what
will happen to you is just.&quot;&nbsp; The bishops, again:&nbsp; &quot;As for the time
which you say is coming upon you&mdash;it is approaching, quite terrible to see; and
with it, both you and the deceiver in whom you trust at that time will be
handed over to the eternal embrace of fire. Nevertheless, we put before you
your own witnesses, who understood Christ's presence in the flesh.&nbsp; For indeed,
you also have what we are going to say to you in your records:<a href="#_ftn173"
name="_ftnref173" title=""><sup>[173]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Your ancestors (who had suffered grave defeat and were recalling the defeat as
an unconquerable victory) at that time commanded that no one possess or even
look for these things, so that diligence would not procure knowledge for the
many.&nbsp; But we say these things to those who know&mdash;even if you are compelled by
your custom to conceal the truth.&nbsp; Did you not hear about the <i>magi</i> who crossed over from here to there,
[p. 35] led by divine prophecy, in connection with whom your leaders at the
time met with Herod and told him where [the Messiah] was [to be] born,<a
href="#_ftn174" name="_ftnref174" title=""><sup>[174]</sup></a>
such that Herod became jealous of the kingdom that had sprouted, and committed
such a huge slaughter of children?&nbsp; Wasn't John the Baptist of Jewish
ancestry?&mdash;to whom you sent people to ask whether he was the Messiah, and he
said, 'I am not'; but he pointed him out and said, 'This is the lamb of God who
takes away the sin of the world.'&quot;<a href="#_ftn175" name="_ftnref175"
title=""><sup>[175]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Futhermore, [what about] Nicodemus, your ruler, and Nathanael and Joseph from
Arimathaea, and Bizes and Alexander, who dined with him at the marriage of
Simon of Galilee, where he turned the water into wine?<a href="#_ftn176"
name="_ftnref176" title=""><sup>[176]</sup></a>&nbsp;
[What about] the elders who were sent by those very men on an embassy on behalf
of the centurion's servant&mdash;that he trouble himself on account of his salvation<a
href="#_ftn177" name="_ftnref177" title=""><sup>[177]</sup></a>&mdash;they
said:&nbsp; 'For he is worthy that you provide this for him; for indeed, he loves
our people and he himself built the synagogue for us'?&nbsp; Basilicus<a
href="#_ftn178" name="_ftnref178" title=""><sup>[178]</sup></a>
the proconsul, the brother of Jairus the leader of the synagogue, whose son he
made well?<a href="#_ftn179" name="_ftnref179" title=""><sup>[179]</sup></a>&nbsp;
This man's brother, Jairus, who implored him [p. 36] and raised his daughter
from the dead?<a href="#_ftn180" name="_ftnref180" title=""><sup>[180]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Caiaphas, who counselled that a single man should die 'and the whole nation not
perish'?<a href="#_ftn181" name="_ftnref181" title=""><sup>[181]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Your own children<a href="#_ftn182" name="_ftnref182" title=""><sup>[182]</sup></a>
who shout, 'Hosanna to the son of David!&nbsp; Blessed is he who comes in the name
of the Lord,' 'King of Israel'?&nbsp; The disciple Judas, with whom you settled
thirty pieces of silver, so that he would betray him to you?&nbsp; The soldiers, to
whom you gave silver so that they would say, 'His disciples came at night and
stole him away while we were sleeping'?<a href="#_ftn183" name="_ftnref183"
title=""><sup>[183]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Josephus your own writer of history, who spoke about Christ, who was
demonstrated to be a righteous and good man by divine grace, by means of signs
and wonders, one who bestowed benefits on many?<a href="#_ftn184"
name="_ftnref184" title=""><sup>[184]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And as many other things as are recorded, which we do not bring forward
now?&quot;</p>

<p>61.&nbsp; The
Jews:&nbsp; &quot;We crucified a certain <i>man</i>,
but not the Messiah.&quot;</p>

<p>Aphroditianus:&nbsp;
&quot;Who was it that you crucified?&quot;</p>

<p>And they
said:&nbsp; &quot;A certain man who said that he was God, not indeed the
Messiah.&quot;</p>

<p>Aphroditianus:&nbsp;
&quot;You crucified, in short, the one you say was a man, the son of
Mary?&quot;</p>

<p>They said:&nbsp;
&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>62.&nbsp;
Aphroditianus:&nbsp; &quot;And why did you crucify him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because
he said that he was God.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And for
this reason,&quot; he said, &quot;he was killed?&quot;</p>

<p>They said:&nbsp;
&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>63.&nbsp;
Aphroditianus:&nbsp; &quot;And which of those who claimed to be God have been
killed, in all times?&nbsp; But this one, by contrast, did more good, and healed
people.&quot;</p>

<p>The bishops:&nbsp;
&quot;In reference to whom did they, according to the prophet David, 'divide my
garments amongst themselves, and cast lots for my clothes'<a href="#_ftn185"
name="_ftnref185" title=""><sup>[185]</sup></a>?&quot;</p>

<p>But they were
silent. [p. 37]</p>

<p>The bishops:&nbsp;
&quot;Concerning whom did Moses say, 'You will see your life suspended before
your eyes, and you shall surely not believe'<a href="#_ftn186" name="_ftnref186"
title=""><sup>[186]</sup></a>?&quot;</p>

<p>64.&nbsp; Jacob and
Pharas said:&nbsp; &quot;Truly, a great mistake has occurred, even should those of
our nation recoil from us in horror ten thousand times over.&nbsp; For as the <i>hierophants</i><a href="#_ftn187"
name="_ftnref187" title=""><sup>[187]</sup></a>
proclaimed beforehand vinegar and gall and division of garments, we did these
things because of great blindness, so that his blood would come upon the nation
and the events would prove true.&nbsp; For, carried away by envy of his signs and
wonders, which he did before them, they hurried to destroy him (because
everyone followed him afterwards), so that the nation would stand firm&mdash;and not
only did it not stand firm, but we were even handed over to multiple
scatterings and we sang the song of the Lord in a strange land because of our
power-hungry teachers at that time, whose minds Satan had blinded.&quot;</p>

<p>65.&nbsp; The
bishops:&nbsp; &quot;We urge, Lord, that all this be reported back to the divine
hearing.&quot;<a href="#_ftn188" name="_ftnref188" title=""><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p>Aphroditianus:&nbsp;
&quot;It shall be so reported.&nbsp; <i>Dastikon
labok&eacute;tras; aut&iacute;ka pith&iacute;grisab lestrin<a href="#_ftn189" name="_ftnref189"
title=""><sup><b><sup>[189]</sup></b></sup></a>&mdash;</i>which
means, We shall immediately make it known.&quot;&nbsp; And he went off and made it
all known to the king.&nbsp; And the king rejoiced, as did those under his rule, at
the uprightness of Aphroditianus.</p>

<p>66.&nbsp; And now
the rest of the Jews, and their leaders, learning of this, rose up against
these two, Jacob and Pharas, and cast them out of the synagogue, saying to
them:&nbsp; &quot;You have shamed us since you have become advocates for the
Christians; you have begun to be Christians, you have scorned your ancestors,
you have dissolved the Law.&nbsp; You have learned, in short, to worship a human
being.&quot;&nbsp; And straightway they went off to Mithrobades the son of Arrhinatus,
agreeing to pay him 30 <i>centenaria</i>,<a
href="#_ftn190" name="_ftnref190" title=""><sup>[190]</sup></a>
[p. 38] so that <i>those men</i> would
not lead them any longer, but instead be [cast] out of the priestly rank.&nbsp; But
Arrhinatus said to his son:&nbsp; &quot;Why do you want money for such a reason, as
though the Persian kingdom is in need?&nbsp; Count up its wealth:&nbsp; All the treasures
of the Medes and Bactrians, the Scythians and Elymaeans and Semiramites, are in
your hands.&nbsp; And you pay attention to this paltry sum, especially when it is
provided for the sake of breaking the Law?&nbsp; Stand aside from this, child.&nbsp; Let
the priests act in accordance with their consciences.&quot;</p>

<p>67.&nbsp; Jacob and
Pharas, when they found out what had been said, left and assembled all their
households and their friends and those who were diligent for the truth, and
they divided their people, such that their part was more than half.&nbsp; And in the
other part were Simon and Barnaes and Scillas (this last had converted from
paganism).&nbsp; And Jacob's party implored Aphroditianus that they should have a
decree not to be subject to any attack from the authorities&mdash;and &quot;we [will]
defend ourselves also with the justification speeches that are available to
us.&quot;<a href="#_ftn191" name="_ftnref191" title=""><sup>[191]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And the king did accordingly. [p. 39]&nbsp; <i>Arr&iacute;k&ecirc;s
exaktorakl&eacute;s&mdash;</i>which means, &quot;I order each [group] to plead their
cause.&quot;</p>

<p>68. On the
next day, both came in and did obeisance to Aphroditianus and the bishops; and
they were commanded to sit down, the two groups separately, as they ought to
do.<a href="#_ftn192" name="_ftnref192" title=""><sup>[192]</sup></a>&nbsp;
And when they had sat down, Aphroditianus said to the bishops:&nbsp; &quot;Now the
controversy is not between <i>us</i>,<a
href="#_ftn193" name="_ftnref193" title=""><sup>[193]</sup></a>
but between <i>these people.</i>&nbsp;
Therefore, I urge you not to interrupt this debate, so that they themselves may
persuade themselves.&nbsp; For if you stand in opposition, they themselves too
[will] become more vigorous in opposition, and the audience-chamber [will] be
thrown into confusion&mdash;and for such a thing to happen is especially contrary to
your dignity.&quot;</p>

<p>The bishops:&nbsp;
&quot;As you command us, O pure and distinguished man, so shall we do.&quot;</p>

<p>69.&nbsp;
Aphroditianus:&nbsp; &quot;It is permitted to you, Simon and Barnaes and Scillas, to
speak, if you have any speech of justification to make regarding your own Law.&nbsp;
For subsequently, after this it will remain to ask also about your accusation
of your teachers.&quot;</p>

<p>70.&nbsp; Simon and
his party:&nbsp; &quot;Your august and celestial will knows, as does that of the
God-beloved priests here, that we all worship one single God and that God is
the father of countless glories.<a href="#_ftn194" name="_ftnref194" title=""><sup>[194]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Thus, each one worships him in accordance with his view of God's glory.&quot;</p>

<p>71.&nbsp;
Aphroditianus said:&nbsp; &quot;God neither had nor will have his glories <i>divided</i>.&nbsp; For since he is one, he also has
a single, firm-standing glory, which everyone ought to know.&nbsp; For if he is the
father of <i>countless</i> glories /
opinions, which of them should one cling to, or how could one judge which of
them one should grasp?&nbsp; If the glories are divided, then the one who is
glorified is also divided.&quot;</p>

<p>72.&nbsp; Simon's
party, again:&nbsp; &quot;We implore your gentle and calm kindness not to inveigh
against us [p. 40] in this way.&nbsp; For you have trained yourself with great diligence,
and we have no great resources for speaking to you.&nbsp; But speak to us rather in
a way that we can understand.&quot;</p>

<p>73.&nbsp; Jacob and
Pharas:&nbsp; &quot;Our dispute, surely, is not about the glory of God, but about
Christ the Nazoraean, whom <i>your</i>
ancestors<a href="#_ftn195" name="_ftnref195" title=""><sup>[195]</sup></a>&mdash;for
[they are not] our [ancestors any more]<a href="#_ftn196" name="_ftnref196"
title=""><sup>[196]</sup></a>&mdash;killed
out of envy.&nbsp; For since you cannot bear the shame of this envy,<a
href="#_ftn197" name="_ftnref197" title=""><sup>[197]</sup></a>
you reject the whole thing, so that you are not condemned.&nbsp; This is the one
about whom David said, 'The Lord said to me:&nbsp; You are my son; today I have
begotten you,'<a href="#_ftn198" name="_ftnref198" title=""><sup>[198]</sup></a>
and so on; and 'Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,' down to the words,
'For this reason, God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness
beyond your companions';<a href="#_ftn199" name="_ftnref199" title=""><sup>[199]</sup></a>
and 'The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the
corner';<a href="#_ftn200" name="_ftnref200" title=""><sup>[200]</sup></a>
and 'Behold! a stone was cut without hands from a mountain, and the stone that
struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole world';<a
href="#_ftn201" name="_ftnref201" title=""><sup>[201]</sup></a>
and 'Behold! I place in Zion a corner-foundation-stone, choice and precious;
and the one who believes in it shall be saved';<a href="#_ftn202"
name="_ftnref202" title=""><sup>[202]</sup></a>
and 'Behold! the young woman shall conceive and bear a son and they shall call
his name Emmanuel';<a href="#_ftn203" name="_ftnref203" title=""><sup>[203]</sup></a>
and 'He was led like a lamb to slaughter'<a href="#_ftn204" name="_ftnref204"
title=""><sup>[204]</sup></a>
and the rest; and 'Behold! there was coming with the clouds of heaven one like
a son of man, and he proceeded as far as the Ancient of Days, and honor and
kingship were presented to him, and all the peoples shall serve him.&nbsp; His
kingdom is perpetual and his authority is for generations and further.'<a
href="#_ftn205" name="_ftnref205" title=""><sup>[205]</sup></a>&nbsp;
All these things, and the others, were said about Christ, whom <i>your</i> self-condemned ancestors
crucified&mdash;and he rose again and is sitting with his holy Father in the
unsullied heavens.&quot;</p>

<p>74.&nbsp; Simon and
his party:&nbsp; &quot;And why did you not say these things earlier, [p. 41] but instead
you began to put forward such teachings by virtue of your <i>antipathy</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>75.&nbsp; Jacob and
Pharas said:&nbsp; &quot;<i>Antipathy</i> is
able to procure good and profitable resources.&nbsp; And as our ancestral God knows,
we kept all these things in mind and we condemned those who killed him&mdash;and we
concealed the truth because of the dignity we possessed.&nbsp; And yet, we began to
be Christians in our heart.&nbsp; Therefore, behold! we have come to the stage of
completion with a good pretext.&nbsp; For indeed, even then, while because of our fear
we preserved our outward appearance, we were different in our minds.&quot;</p>

<p>76.&nbsp;
Aphroditianus:&nbsp; &quot;The human being is unsettled, by virtue of both its own
cogitations and those that come in from outside, and it inclines to many
different things; one will not attain the truth in its entirety through
falsehood, nor will one find uprightness through its opposite.&nbsp; And even if
someone comes across piety, how will he remain in it?&nbsp; Hence, both parties here
should accomplish what is pleasing to them by their own examination.&quot;</p>

<p>77.&nbsp; Jacob's
party said:&nbsp; &quot;We know that Christ has come from heaven and we belong to
his faith, no longer wishing to have a Jewish mindset.&quot;</p>

<p>78.&nbsp; Simon and
the others:&nbsp; &quot;The nation will not accept you even if you want them to.&nbsp;
For how could they keep with them those who are against them?&quot;</p>

<p>Aphroditianus:&nbsp;
&quot;Do you then cast aside your teachers, if they choose to speak the
truth?&quot;</p>

<p>Simon:&nbsp;
&quot;Neither shall they be at peace any longer with us, nor we with them; for
we are at variance with each other and have become each other's enemies.&quot;</p>

<p>79.&nbsp;
Aphroditianus:&nbsp; &quot;Enough! (For this was his oath.)&nbsp; Your affairs are still
at the stage of words, and you are bereft of all action.&nbsp; For I know that those
people, who are agitated over <i>action</i>,
are a chosen people, being in touch with heavenly things in a heavenly manner,
and not boasting in a word only but strengthened by an <i>eternal</i> subject for boasting. [p. 42]</p>

<p>80.&nbsp; &quot;I
shall, however, present to you an example equal to the first.<a href="#_ftn206"
name="_ftnref206" title=""><sup>[206]</sup></a>&nbsp; <b>I once learned of a woman, a shepherdess, in
the settlement of the Arigbanes.&nbsp; One Coatus, son of Coatus, fell in love with
her and sent her gifts, so that she would come to an agreement with him.&nbsp; But
she, seeing the gifts, laughed and said to the messenger, pointing to her
sheep:&nbsp; 'Behold my gifts and my children, from which I am nourished by divine
grace.'&nbsp; And he came away to her and with splendid promises he urged her to
accept him.&nbsp; She said to him:&nbsp; 'Shall I defile the undefiled cloak which grace
has given to me?'&nbsp; Coatus said:&nbsp; 'Miserable girl, this law has been established
from above for the propagation of the race.'&nbsp; The shepherdess:&nbsp; 'A law has been
established for <i>me</i> not to acquire
more than I have.'&nbsp; After much pleading to no effect, he ordered that she be
starved to death.&nbsp; And so, on the third day, when she was about to expire, she
uttered cheerful words as follows:&nbsp; 'O heavenly Father of your genuine
children, O unsullied bridegroom of those who are in the bloom of beauty, I
come to you, thrice-desired Lord, giving back to you without complaint that
which you gave to me&mdash;virginity, forgiveness of sins, an existence without
property, a truthful tongue, a heart unacquainted with wickedness&mdash;ever intent
on the hope that is to come, which I have honored and whose joys I am now by all
means going to meet.'&nbsp; And thus she expired.&nbsp; [p. 43] His father, learning
this, ordered that he be hung head-downwards on a tall post in the middle of
the city, so as to be eaten by birds.</b></p>

<p>81.&nbsp; &quot;And
now, I speak to everyone regarding Christ.&nbsp; That which has happened already has
happened.&nbsp; <b>And as regards Philip the
history-writer:&nbsp; I met him in Amida and in Ostra.<a href="#_ftn207"
name="_ftnref207" title=""><sup>[207]</sup></a></b>&nbsp;
And as regards all the pagans and Christians and Jews:&nbsp; We boast in a name
only.&nbsp; And so, brothers, whether you live as Christians or live as Jews, do not
destroy the common bond of peace.&nbsp; Let us honor each other with love, and
strive after the uninterrupted good things of heaven; and let us hate the
division of opposites.&nbsp; Embrace each other, everyone, with a view to being
brought to unity by divine grace.&quot;<a href="#_ftn208" name="_ftnref208"
title=""><sup>[208]</sup></a></p>

<p>82.&nbsp; And the
man received grace to persuade both parties to be reconciled with each other,
as the party of Simon and the others cast itself at the feet of the party of
Jacob, asking them not to abandon their ancient friendship.&nbsp; But worship [of
God should proceed] as any individual wished, with sincere love remaining
[between all].&nbsp; And after bidding each other farewell, as they ought, and
kissing the bishops' feet, giving thanks to God, praising the king at length,
and saying the Alleluia in Hebrew together, they departed from each other.&nbsp; And
Jacob, Pharas, and 60 [other] souls were baptized.&nbsp; But the others remained in
the section [p. 44] of Simon, and they were called
&quot;Christianomerites.&quot;<a href="#_ftn209" name="_ftnref209" title=""><sup>[209]</sup></a>&nbsp;
Aphroditianus urged both to honor Providence, because &quot;this [i.e.,
Providence] has greatly honored us.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>84.&nbsp; <b>This Philip was a <i>presbyter</i>
and <i>synkellos</i> of John, the bishop
of Constantinople; he divided the whole [of history] into stages&mdash;magnificently,
such that not one of the wise writers of history of all time is comparable to
him.&nbsp; And the same <i>presbyter</i>
recounted</b><a href="#_ftn216" name="_ftnref216" title=""><sup>[216]</sup></a><b> that the day on which the star appeared in the

<p align=center>*</p>

<p>85.&nbsp; And it is
amazing how <b>Aphroditianus, who was nominally
a pagan but in fact behaved as a Christian, surpassed the <i>presbyter</i> Philip in saying great things
about Christ</b>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And Dorus the
Jew, the advocate of his own slanderous nation, said that the king conducted a
competition in the temple, which had never taken place&mdash;and the statues have
under their feet invisible &quot;reed-nuts,&quot;<a href="#_ftn218"

of [them] all.&nbsp; For he says that the reputation [of these marvels] advances in this way through these.&nbsp; And to those who read this it
should be clear to see, whether that [interpretation] seems true.</p>

wording after the name &quot;Philip&quot; on the basis of mangled indications
in the manuscripts and also the cues apparent in the context:&nbsp; namely, their
response to the oracle shows that the oracle has mentioned a woman, and a man
from Macedonia; and Aphroditianus' comment in &sect;14 (p. 9) makes clear that a
prediction is made that can be taken as referring to &quot;the Macedonian&quot;
and to Christ.&nbsp; Bringel, by contrast, marks the words following Philip as a
crux, having little confidence in any reconstruction.&nbsp; In connection with this
consultation of the oracle, there is a further major textual variant:&nbsp; In a
couple of manuscripts, a fairly long sequence of text is either substituted for
(ms. Q) or added to the end of (ms. N) the oracular response translated above;
this additional text runs roughly as follows [minor discrepancies do exist in
the witnesses]:&nbsp; &quot;Late, a certain one will make his way to this
much-splintered earth, and without a misstep will become flesh, and by the
untiring bounds of divinity he will dissolve the destructive force of incurable
passions / sufferings; and ill-will shall arise for this one at the hands of an
unbelieving people, and he will be hung up to a height as one condemned to
death.&nbsp; And having willingly suffered to bear all these things as well, at
death he will be lifted up into eternal life.&quot;&nbsp; The supposed prophecy of
Christ is much clearer in this additional text, which may well have been added
specifically to alleviate the annoyace of a too-obscure prophecy.</p>
