<br><br><sup id="P5369_1637308">1</sup>: Oxford ed.: Ep. xiii. A.D. 251.
<br><br><sup id="P5374_1637654">2</sup>: V. l. "to Cyprian, greeting."
<br><br><sup id="P5375_1637819">3</sup>: "Rutili," scil. confessors who had spilt their blood.
<br><br><sup id="P5376_1638009">4</sup>: "Budinarius." The exact meaning of this word is unknown. Some read it as another name: "Soliassus and Budinarius" The Oxford editor changes it into Burdonarius, meaning a "carrier on mules." Salmasius, in a long note on a passage in the life of Aurelian ( Hist. Aug ., p. 408), proposes butinarius , which he derives from Butinh , a cruet for containing vinegar, etc., and which he identifies with Bouttij , the original of our bottle . Butinarias would then mean a maker of vessels suitable for containing vinegar, etc. See Sophocles' Glossary of Byzantine Greek, s. v. Bouttij . [Probably low Latin for a maker of force-meats. Spanish, budin .]
