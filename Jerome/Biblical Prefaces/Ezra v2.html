<h3 align="center">The Prologue of Eusebius Hieronymus on the Book of Ezra <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a></h3>

<p>Whether it is more
difficult to do what you ask or to say no, I have still not decided.<sup><a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">2</a></sup>
For, on the one hand, it is impossible to refuse you when you are requesting
something of significance. But, on the other hand, the weight of the burden
imposed presses down upon my neck so hard that it would be necessary to lighten
it before rushing into it thus encumbered. In addition to this, there is the
hostility of my detractors. They think everything I write<sup><a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title="">3</a></sup>
ought to be refuted and rip apart in public what they read in private, even
though their conscience accuses them. They do this to such an extent that I am
compelled to cry out and say, "Lord, free my soul from wicked lips and from the
deceitful tongue!"<sup><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">4</a></sup>
For three years now you have been continually writing and rewriting to me,
asking that I translate the book of Ezra for you from Hebrew, making your
request as if you did not already have Greek and Latin editions, or as if
everyone would not immediately spit upon whatever I translate.<sup><a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title="">5</a></sup>
As someone said, "To strive in vain and not to seek anything in your weariness
except hatred is the pinnacle of insanity."<sup><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"
title="">6</a></sup>
</p>

<p>And so, I beseech
you, my most dear Domnio and Rogatianus: do not make the book known to the
public and be content to read it privately. Do not toss food to those who
disdain it and thus avoid the snobbery of those who know only how to judge
others but not how to do anything themselves. But if there are some of the
brothers who are not displeased with my work, you may give them the
master-copy. Advise them to copy the Hebrew names, of which there is a great
abundance in this book, with distinct spaces between them. For it will be of no
benefit to have corrected the book unless the corrections are diligently
preserved by the copyists.</p>

<p>No one ought to be
bothered by the fact that my edition<sup><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">7</a></sup>
consists of only one book, nor ought anyone take delight in the dreams found in
the apocryphal third and fourth books. For among the Hebrews the texts of Ezra
and Nehemiah comprise a single book, and those texts which are not used by them
and are not concerned with the twenty-four elders ought to be rejected
outright.<sup><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">8</a></sup>
But if anyone should oppose you on the basis of the Septuagint translation
(whose very variety of texts indicates that its copies are corrupt and damaged,
nor can it by any means be claimed that what is diverse is true), have him take
a look at the gospels.<sup><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">9</a></sup>
There are many passages in them which are said to be from the Old Testament but
which are not found in the Septuagint translation. Examples include: "He shall
be called a Nazarene,"<sup><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">10</a></sup> "Out of Egypt I have called my son,"<sup><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">11</a></sup>
"They shall look upon him whom they have pierced,"<sup><a href="#_ftn12"
name="_ftnref12" title="">12</a></sup>
and many others that I shall reserve<sup><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">13</a></sup>
for a more extensive work. And so, have him attempt to locate where these
passages are written in the Septuagint. When he cannot locate them, you should
read aloud from the editions I recently did,<sup><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"
title="">14</a></sup>
which are continually denigrated by the tongues of those who have nothing good
to say.</p>

<p>Though I intend to
keep things brief, what I am about to say by way of introduction certainly
makes the most sense.<sup><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">15</a></sup>
In my version I translated whatever was not contained in the Greek version or
was there in a variant form.<sup><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="">16</a></sup>
What translator do they butcher with their criticism? Let them ask the Hebrews
and judge the fidelity of my translation on the basis of their authority. It is
quite a different matter, if with eyes shut (as the saying goes), they want to
speak ill of me and not follow the example of the Greeks in their application
to study and goodwill. When the Gospel of Christ was already shining brightly,
after they had read the Septuagint translators, the Greeks attentively read the
Jewish and Ebonite translators of the old Law, that is, Aquila, Symmachus, and
Theodotion. Through the labors of Origen in his <i>Hexapla</i>, the Greeks
caused these three to be used for ecclesiastical purposes. How much more ought
speakers of Latin be grateful for having discovered that Greece in her
exultation borrows something from herself!<sup><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"
title="">17</a></sup></p>

<p>First of all, it is
very expensive and infinitely difficult to procure possession of all the
versions.<sup><a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">18</a></sup>
Secondly, even those who own them but are ignorant of the Hebrew language will
make all the more mistakes, being unable to determine which reading out of the
many is more correct. In fact this is what happened recently among the Greeks
to a certain one of their wisest men. The result was that in some instances he
disregarded the sense of Scripture and followed the mistake of some translator.
However, as I have<sup><a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">19</a></sup>
at least a little bit of knowledge about the Hebrew language and am not at all
without facility in Latin, I am better able<sup><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"
title="">20</a></sup>
than others to make decisions<sup><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">21</a></sup>
and render things as I myself understand<sup><a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"
title="">22</a></sup>
them in our language.</p>

<p>And so, even though
the serpent hisses "and victorious Sinon is scattering firebrands,"<sup><a
href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">23</a></sup>
with the help of Christ my voice shall never be silenced; even with a severed
tongue I shall manage to stammer out something. Those who want to read my
edition should do so; those who do not should put it aside. If they pick apart
the writing, if they find fault with the letters, by your charity I shall be
more provoked to apply myself to study than be discouraged by their detraction
and hatred.</p>

Sacra iuxta vulgatam versionem</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (Stuttgart: Deutsche
Bibelgesellschaft, 1994), 638-639. Jerome's preface to his translation of Ezra
was written c. 394 to Domnio, a Roman presbyter (see Jerome, Eps. 47.3 and 50),
and Rogatianus, of whom nothing is known.</p>

Jerome generally speaks in the first person singular ("I, me"). He
exceptionally&nbsp; uses the first person plural ("we, us"), which instances are
nevertheless rendered in the first person singular for the sake of consistency.
These exceptions are, however, footnoted.</p>

There were several different books which circulated in antiquity under the name
of Ezra (or Esdras). The books which the RSV calls Ezra and Nehemiah were
originally one book in Hebrew, called Ezra. The division of the original Ezra
into two books was a later development. The Latin and Greek traditions,
however, each have four Ezra books, called Esdras A-D (Greek) and I-IV Esdras
(Latin). The RSV Ezra corresponds to Esdras B and I Esdras, while RSV Nehemiah
to Esdras C and II Esdras. Jerome's Ezra contained both I and II Esdras in a
single book, in imitation of the Hebrew. Esdras A and III Esdras corresponds to
what the RSV calls 1 Esdras; it sequentially consists of&nbsp; (1) 2 Chronicles
35:1-36:23 (summarized), (2) Ezra 1:1-4:24, (3), additions, (4)&nbsp; Ezra
5:1-10:44, and (5) Nehemiah 7:38-9:12. The RSV's 2 Esdras, which is an apocryphal
apocalypse from the Christian period, corresponds to Esdras D and IV Esdras.
Jerome here explicitly denies canonicity to III and IV Esdras.</p>

<div id=ftn9>

<p><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9" title="">9</a>
Jerome's project of translating the scriptures from the Hebrew was continually
challenged by those who appealed to the authority of the Septuagint as the
basis for deciding questions of canonicity. Jerome is here attempting to
convince his readers to follow the Hebrew tradition&nbsp; by undercutting the
reliability of the Septuagint text in two ways: (1) its variety, and (2) its
lack of Old Testament passages quoted as such in the New Testament.</p>

Septuagint translators. Latin speakers should be inspired by their scholarly
example.</p>
