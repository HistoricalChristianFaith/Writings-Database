<p align="center"><b>Jerome, Prologue to Jeremiah (2006)</b></p>
<hr>

<p align="center">[Translated by Kevin P. Edgecomb]</p>
<p>BEGINNING OF THE PROLOGUE OF JEROME TO THE BOOK OF THE PROPHET JEREMIAH</p>
<p>The Prophet Jeremiah, for whom this prologue is written, was seen among the
Hebrews to be certainly more rustic in style than Isaiah and Hosea and certain
other prophets, but equal in meanings, which the same Spirit obviously
prophesied. Furthermore, his simplicity of speech happened from the place in
which he was born. For he was from Anathoth, which is up to today a village
three miles distant from Jerusalem, a priest from priests and sanctified in his
mother's womb, dedicating with her virginity a man of the Gospel to the Church
of Christ. This boy began to prophesy the captivity of the city and Judea both
not only by the Spirit, but also with eyes of flesh. The Assyrians had already
transferred the ten tribes of Israel, and now colonies of gentiles had taken
possession of their lands. For this reason he prophesied only in Judah and
Benjamin, and he lamented the ruins of his city in a fourfold alphabet, which we
have presented in the measure of the meter and in verses. Besides this, the
order of visions, which is entirely confused among the Greeks and Latins, we
have corrected to the original truth. And the Book of Baruch, his scribe, which
is neither read nor found among the Hebrews, we have omitted, standing ready,
because of these things, for all the curses from the jealous, to whom it is
necessary for me to respond through a separate short work. And I suffer because
you think this. Otherwise, for the benefit of the wicked, it was more proper to
set a limit for their rage by my silence, rather than any new things written to
provoke daily the insanity of the envious.</p>

<p align="left" class="small">Kevin introduces his translation as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left" class="small">A couple of notes on this prologue by St Jerome to
Jeremiah are in order. He mentions that Jeremiah "lamented the ruins of his city
in fourfold alphabet," <em>civitatis suae ruinas quadruplici plaxit alfabeto</em>.
This is a reference to the acrostic first four chapters of Lamentations, in
which each verse begins with the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet, thus
"in a fourfold alphabet." Another perhaps puzzling reference just after that is
to his presenting the book "in the measure of the meter and in verses." This
refers to his breaking the verses into separate lines based upon metrical
measurements, probably according to the Hebrew, and written with separation of
verses and words. Basically think of the way that poetry is printed today, in
short lines that take no notice of the width of the page, and that's what
he's describing. If I find a picture of one of the early Vulgate manuscripts
reflecting this, I'll post it. St Jerome also mentions a confusion of the
order of the visions in Jeremiah as known among the Greeks and Latins. This
refers to the very different (and probably original) arrangment of the
prophecies as found in the Septuagint and is supported by a Dead Sea Scroll
fragment, so we know that there were Hebrew manuscripts with this order, which
Jerome did not. Anyhow, in the meantime, enjoy yet another prologue. There
aren't many left now! Once I've done all of them, I'll go back through to
edit them and then post them all on a single page, with notes and such.</p>
