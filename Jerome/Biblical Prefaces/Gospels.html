  <p align="left">BEGINNING OF THE PREFACE FOR THE GOSPELS OF SAINT JEROME THE
  PRESBYTER</p>
<p>To the blessed Pope Damasus, from Jerome,</p>
<p>You urge me to make a new work from the old, and that I might sit as a kind
of judge over the versions of Scripture dispersed throughout the whole world,
and that I might resolve which among such vary, and&nbsp;which of these they may
be which truly agree with the Greek. Pious work, yet perilous presumption, to&nbsp;change
the old and aging language of the world , to carry it back to infancy, for to
judge others is to invite&nbsp;judging by all of them. Is there indeed any
learned or unlearned man, who when he picks up the volume&nbsp;in his hand, and
takes a single taste of it, and sees what he will have read to differ, might not
instantly&nbsp;raise his voice, calling me a forger, proclaiming me now to be a
sacrilegious man, that I might dare to add,&nbsp;to change, or to correct
anything in the old books? Against such infamy I am consoled by two causes: that&nbsp;it
is you, who are the highest priest, who so orders, and truth is not to be what
might vary, as even now I&nbsp;am vindicated by the witness of slanderers. If
indeed faith is administered by the Latin version, they might&nbsp;respond by
which, for they are nearly as many as the books! If, however, truth is to be a
seeking among&nbsp;many, why do we not now return to the Greek originals to
correct those mistakes which either through faulty&nbsp;translators were set
forth, or through confident but unskilled were wrongly revised, or through
sleeping scribes&nbsp;either were added or were changed? Certainly, I do not
discuss the Old Testament, which came from the&nbsp;Seventy Elders in the Greek
language, changing in three steps until it arrived with us <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>.&nbsp;Nor
do I seek what Aquila, or what Symmachus may think, or why Theodotion may walk
the middle of the road&nbsp;between old and new. This may be the true
translation which the Apostles have approved. I now speak of the&nbsp;New
Testament, which is undoubtedly Greek, except the Apostle Matthew, who had first
set forth the Gospel&nbsp;of Christ in Hebrew letters in Judea. This (Testament)
certainly differs in our language, and is led in the way of&nbsp;different
streams; it is necessary to seek the single fountainhead. I pass over those
books which are called by&nbsp;the name of Lucian and Hesychius, for which a few
men wrongly claim authority, who anyway were not allowed&nbsp;to revise either
in the Old Instrument after the Seventy Translators, or to pour out revisions in
the New; with the&nbsp;Scriptures previously translated into the languages of
many nations, the additions may now be shown to be false.</p>
<p>Therefore, this present little preface promises only the four Gospels, the
order of which is Matthew, Mark, Luke,&nbsp;John, revised in comparison with
only old Greek books. They do not disagree with many familiar Latin readings,&nbsp;as
we have kept our pen in control, but only those in which the sense will have
been seen to have changed (from&nbsp;the Greek) are corrected; the rest remain
as they have been.</p>
<p>We have also copied the lists which Eusebius the bishop of Caesarea,
following Ammonius of Alexandria, set&nbsp;out in ten numbers, as they are had
in the Greek, so that if any may then wish through diligence to make known&nbsp;what
in the Gospels may be either the same, or similar, or singular, he may learn
their differences. This is great,&nbsp;since indeed error has sunk into our
books; while concerning the same thing, one Evangelist has said more,&nbsp;into
another they have added because they thought it inferior; or while another has
differently expressed the&nbsp;same sense, whichever one of the four he had read
first, he will revise the other to the version he values most.&nbsp;Whence it
happened how in our time that all have been mixed; in Mark are many things of
Luke, and even of&nbsp;Matthew; turned backwards in Matthew are many things of
John and of Mark, yet in the remaining others, they&nbsp;are found to be
correct. When, therefore, you will have read the lists which are attached below,
the confusion&nbsp;of errors is removed, and you will know all the similar
passages, and the singular ones, wherever you may turn&nbsp;to. In the first
list, the four agree, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John; in the second, three, Matthew,
Mark, John; in&nbsp;the third, three, Matthew, Luke, John; in the fourth, three,
Matthew, Mark, John; in the fifth, two, Matthew, Luke;&nbsp;in the sixth, two,
Matthew, Mark; in the seventh, two, Matthew, John; in the eighth, two, Luke,
Mark; in the ninth,&nbsp;two, Luke, John; in the tenth some peculiar ones are
given which the others don't have. Separately in the Gospels&nbsp;are numbered
sections of unequal length, beginning with one and increasing to the end of the
books. This is&nbsp;written before the passage in black, and it has under it a
red number, which shows to which of the ten (lists) to&nbsp;proceed, with the
first number to be sought in the list. Therefore, when the book is open, for
example, if you will&nbsp;wish to know of this or that chapter in which list
they may be, you will immediately be shown by the lower number. Returning to the
beginning (of the book) in which the different lists are brought together, and
immediately finding&nbsp;the same lists by the title in front, by that same
number which you had sought in the Evangelist, which you will&nbsp;find marked
in the inscription, you may also view other similar passages, the numbers of
which you may note&nbsp;there. And when you know them, you will return to the
single volumes, and immediately finding the number which&nbsp;you will have
noted before, you will learn the places in which either the same things or
similar things were said.</p>
<p>I wish that in Christ you may be well, and that you will remember me, most
blessed Pope.</p>
