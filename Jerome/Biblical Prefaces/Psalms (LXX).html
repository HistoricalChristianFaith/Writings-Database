<p>BEGINNING OF THE PREFACE OF EUSEBIUS HIERONYMUS TO THE BOOK OF PSALMS</p>
<p>Not long ago while located in Rome, I emended the Psalter, and had corrected
it, though cursorily, for the most part according to the (version of the)
Seventy interpreters. Because you see it again, O Paula and Eustochium,
corrupted by the error of the scribes, and the more ancient error to prevail
rather than the new emendation, you urge that I work the land like some kind of
field already ploughed, and uproot with sideways furrows the thorns being
reborn, saying it is proper that what so frequently sprouts badly is just as
frequently cut down. For this reason I remind by my usual preface, both you for
whom this mighty work exerts itself, and those who would have copies of such,
that those things to have been diligently emended might be transcribed with care
and diligence. Each may himself note either a horizontal line or a radiant sign,
that is, either an obelus or an asterisk, and wherever he sees a preceding
virgule, from there to the two points which we have marked in, he knows more is
to be found in the (version of the) Seventy interpreters; and where he has
looked at the image of a star, he will have recognized an addition from the
Hebrew scrolls, likewise up to the two points, only according to the edition of
Theodotion who did not differ from the Seventy interpreters in simplicity of
speech. I, knowing me to have done this for you and for each studious person, do
not doubt there will be many who, either envious or arrogant, "prefer to be seen
to condemn the brilliant rather than to learn," and to drink from a turbulent
river much rather than from an entirely pure spring.</p>

<p align="left" class="small">St Jerome did two separate translations of the
Psalms. One was simply a revision of the popular Old Latin psalms (which are
still used in some older rites, most notably the Ambrosian, I recall), with
reference to the Greek Psalms version in the Hexapla. This is the prologue to
that edition of the Psalms. The other version, based directly on the Hebrew
Psalms, will follow separately.</p>
