<p>BEGINNING OF THE PROLOGUE TO JUDITH</p>
<p>Among the Hebrews the Book of Judith is found among the Hagiographa, the
authority of which toward confirming those which have come into contention is
judged less appropriate. Yet having been written in Chaldean words, it is
counted among the histories. But because this book is found by the Nicene
Council to have been counted among the number of the Sacred Scriptures, I have
acquiesced to your request, indeed a demand, and works having been set aside
from which I was forcibly curtailed, I have given to this (book) one short
night's work translating more sense from sense than word from word. I have
removed the extremely faulty variety of the many books; only those which I was
able to find in the Chaldean words with understanding intact did I express in
Latin ones.</p>
<p>Receive the widow Judith, an example of chastity, and declare triumphal honor
with perpetual praises for her. For this one, imitable not only for women, but
also for men, has the Rewarder of her chastity given, Who has granted such
strength, that she conquered the one unconquered by all men, she surpassed the
insurpassable.</p>
<p>END OF THE PROLOGUE</p>

<p align="left" class="small">Kevin introduces his translation as follows: In
this preface, too, St Jerome makes mention of the authority of the Church, in
this case literally the famous First Ecumenical Council of Nicea, as declaring
Judith among the books of Holy Scripture. In fact, he also mentions that
"among the Hebrews" the book was considered as among the "Hagiographa,"
some would say a somewhat flexible term, which in the previous prologue (to
Tobias), he certainly seems to have equated with the Scriptures. If this is the
case, then at one point in history, in the late 4th century, Judith was
considered by at least some Jews in Palestine to have been Scripture. He does,
however, in that very first sentence note that even though it is considered an
"accepted" book, this is considered to have no bearing on the status of
other books. Interesting. Enjoy!</p>
