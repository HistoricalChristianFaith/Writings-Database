<p>BEGINNING OF THE PROLOGUE OF JEROME TO THE BOOKS OF SOLOMON</p>
<p>Jerome to Bishops Cromatius and Heliodorus.</p>
<p>May the letter join those joined in priesthood. Indeed, a sheet may not
divide those who the love of Christ has connected. You request commentaries on
Hosea, Amos, Zechariah, and Malachi. I wrote, even if it cost through
ill-health. You have sent the solace of expenses, by our scribes and copyist
having been sustained, so that our genius exerts itself most strongly for you.
And behold, from every side a diverse crowd of those demanding, as though it is
equal for me either to work for you with others hungering, or I might be subject
to anyone besides you in matters of giving and receiving. And so, with a long
sickness broken, I have not kept inwardly silent this year and been mute with
you. I have dedicated to your names the work of three days, namely the
translation of the three scrolls of Solomon: Masloth, which are Parables in
Hebrew, called in the common edition Proverbs; Coeleth, which in Greek is
Ecclesiastes, in Latin we could say Preacher; (and) Sirassirim, which is
translated into our language Song of Songs.</p>
<p>Also included is the book of the model of virtue (&#960;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#959;&#962;)
Jesus son of Sirach, and another falsely ascribed work (&#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#949;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#962;)
which is titled Wisdom of Solomon. The former of these I have also found in
Hebrew, titled not Ecclesiasticus as among the Latins, but Parables, to which
were joined Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs, as though it made of equal worth the
likeness not only of the number of the books of Solomon, but also the kind of
subjects. The second was never among the Hebrews, the very style of which reeks
of Greek eloquence. And some of the ancient scribes affirm this one is of Philo Judaeus. Therefore, just as the Church also reads the books of Judith, Tobias,
and the Maccabees, but does not receive them among the the canonical Scriptures,
so also one may read these two scrolls for the strengthening of the people,
(but) not for confirming the authority of ecclesiastical dogmas.</p>
<p>If anyone is truly more pleased by the edition of the Seventy interpreters,
he has it already corrected by us. For it is not as though we build the new so
that we destroy the old. And yes, when one will have read most carefully, he
will know our things to be more understood, which haven't soured by having
been poured into a third vessel, but have rather preserved their flavor by
having been entrusted to a new container immediately from the press.</p>

<p align="left" class="small">Kevin introduces his translation as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left" class="small">Here St Jerome gives us not only more information
about his work habits (he translated Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of
Songs in three days), but also a bit more on his understanding of the apocrypha.
He implicitly defines the canon of Scriptures as those books used "for
confirming the authority of eccelsiastical dogmas," and excludes the apocrypha
from that category. Granted, the majority of the apocrypha are not useful for
this, but then neither, admittedly, are a number of canonical works. It's an
argument or position against the apocrypha that we have yet to find the origins
of. And although St Jerome here states that the apocrypha that he names are not "canonical
Scriptures," we know that he recognized the authority of the Council of Nicea in
advancing Judith as canonical. So, St Jerome's equivocation on the matter
reveals a more subtle understanding, in which he considers the apocrypha good "for
the strengthening of the people." Anyhow, perhaps St Jerome will have more to
say on the subject in some of the upcoming prologues. We'll see. One fun thing
he mentions in this prologue is the marginal tradition that Philo Judaeus of
Alexandria was the author of Wisdom of Solomon, something also found in the Canon
Muratorianus, and various other places, though not often. Enjoy!</p>
