<p align="center">[Translated by Kevin P. Edgecomb]</p>
<p>BEGINNING OF THE PREFACE OF SAINT JEROME TO THE BOOK OF JOSHUA</p>
<p>Having finally finished with the Pentateuch of Moses, as though freed for a
great advantage, we set (our) hand to Jesus son of Nave, who the Hebrews call
Joshua ben Nun, that is, Joshua son of Nun, and to the book of Judges, which
they call Sopthim, to Ruth also and Esther, which they extol by the same names.
And I admonish the reader, that he, being careful with Scripture, might preserve
the forest of Hebrew names and (their) separations divided into parts, so that
our work and his effort might not be wasted. And that in the first place, which
I often testify, let him know me not to coin the new in rebuke of the old, as
though my friends are accused, but rather to offer, for my part, to men of my
language, those things of ours which still delight, like the copies of the
Hexapla for the Greeks, which require great expense and work, so they might have
our edition, and anywhere the readings of the ancient scrolls are doubtful,
comparing this this to them, they might find what they seek, especially when
among the Latins there are as many versions as there are books, and everyone
has, according to his own judgment, either added or subtracted whatever seemed
right to him, and he indeed may not have been able to be certain what differed.
From which may scorpion cease to rise against me with bow-like wound, and
poisoned tongue desist from slandering a holy work, either accepting, if it has
pleased, or condemning, if it has displeased, and remember these verses: "Your
mouth has abounded in malice, and your tongue constructed deceits; sitting, you
have spoken against your brother, and against the son of your mother imposed a
scandal. These things you have done and I was quiet; you wrongly thought that I
might be like you: I will accuse you and stand before your face" [Psalm
49.19-21]. For what advantage is it to the listener for us to sweat at work and
to work at criticizing others, for Jews to lament that the opportunity has been
taken away from them for falsely accusing and insulting Christians, and for men
of the Church to despise, indeed to tear apart, that from which enemies are
tortured. If only what is old in the interpretation pleases them, which things
are also not displeasing to me, and they think of receiving nothing further, why
are they reading or not reading those things which are either added or cut out
by the asterisks and obeli? For what reason have the churches accepted the
translation of Daniel by Theodotion? Why are Origen and Eusebius Pamphilou
admired for having treated entire editions similarly? Or what foolishness was
it, after they had spoken true things, to set forth things which are false? And
from where in the New Testament are they able to prove the received testimonies,
which are not supported in the books of the Old (Testament)? Thus, we say, I may
be seen to be not altogether quiet to accusers.</p>
<p>Otherwise, after the falling asleep of Paula, whose life is an example of
virtue, and these books, which I was not able to deny to Eustochium the virgin
of Christ, we have decided "while spirit yet rules these limbs" to incline to
the explanation of the Prophets, and to resume, in a kind of return home, a work
long unfinished, especially when the admirable and holy man Pammachius demands
the same in letters, and we, hurrying on to the homeland, need to pass by the
deadly songs of the sirens with deaf ear.</p>

<p align="left" class="small">Kevin introduced the text as follows: This one was
tough because of some quite peculiar sentences, which I think I've pretty much
figured out now. I don't think there's any English translation of this one
around, certainly not one in my possession, so I didn't have one as a "cheat
sheet" when I got stuck, which is good for my Latin, but not for my schedule....
Many thanks especially to Michael Gilleland (of <a href="http://laudatortemporisacti.blogspot.com/">Laudator
Temporis Acti</a> fame!) for puzzling over a certain ambiguous <em>scriptura</em>
with me! UPDATE: I've changed a couple of sentences with Michael Gilleland's
input. Several formerly questionable renderings are now resolved. Huzzah!</p>
