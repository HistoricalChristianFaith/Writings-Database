<p>BEGINNING OF THE PROLOGUE OF SAINT JEROME TO THE BOOK OF PARALIPOMENON</p>
<p>If the version of the Seventy translators is pure and has remained as it was
rendered by them into Greek, you have urged me on superfluously, my Cromatius,
most holy and most learned of bishops, that I translated the Hebrew scrolls into
Latin words. For what has formerly won the ears of men and strengthened the
faith of those being born to the Church was indeed proper to be approved by our
silence. Now, in fact, when different versions are held by a variety of regions,
and this genuine and ancient translation is corrupted and violated, you have
considered our opinion, either to judge which of the many is the true one, or to
put together new work with old work, and shutting off to the Jews, as it is
said, "a horn to pierce the eyes." The region of Alexandria and Egypt praises in
their Seventy the authority of Hesychius; the region from Constantinople to
Antioch approves the version of Lucian the Martyr; in the middle, between these
provinces, the people of Palestine read the books which, having been labored
over by Origen, Eusebius and Pamphilius published. And all the world contends
among them with this threefold variety. And Origen certainly not only put
together the texts of four editions, writing the words in a single row so that
one regularly differing may be compared to others agreeing among themselves, but
what is more audacious, into the edition of the Seventy he mixed the edition of
Theodotion, marking with asterisks those things which were missing, and placing
virgules by those things which are seen to be superfulous. If, therefore, it was
allowed to others not to hold what they once accepted, and after the seventy
chambers, which are considered without a single author, individual chambers were
opened, and thus is read in the churches what the Seventy did not know, why do
my (fellow) Latins not accept me, who thus put together the new with the
inviolate old edition so that I might make my work acceptable to the Hebrews
and, what is greater than these, to the authors, the Apostles? I have recently
written a book, "On the best kind of translating," showing these things in the
Gospel, and others similar to these, to be found in the books of the Hebrews: "Out
of Egypt I called my son," and "For he will be called a Nazarene," and "They
will look on him whom they have pierced," and that of the Apostle, "Things which
eye has not seen, nor ear heard, and had not arisen in the heart of man, which
God has prepared for those loving Him." The Apostles and Evangelists were
certainly acquainted with (the version of) the Seventy interpreters, but from
where (were) they (supposed) to say these things which are not in the Seventy?
Christ our God, author of both Testaments, says in the Gospel according to John,
"He who believes in me, as Scripture has said, Rivers of living water will flow
from his belly." Certainly, whatever is witnessed by the Savior to be written,
is written. Where is it written? The Seventy don't have it; the Church ignores
the apocrypha; thus the turning back to the Hebrew (books), from which the Lord
spoke and and the disciples took forth texts. In peace I will say these things
of the ancients, and I respond only to my detractors, who bite me with dogs'
teeth, slandering me in public, speaking at corners, the same (being) both
accusers and defenders, when approving for others what they reprove me for, as
though virtue and error were not in conflict, but change with the author. I have
recalled another edition of the Seventy translators corrected from the Greek to
have been distributed by us, and me not to need to be considered their enemy,
which things I always explain in the gatherings of the brothers. And what is now
Dabreiamin, that is, Words of the Days, I have translated. I have therefore made
the foreignness of the meanings clearer, and have separated lines into members,
so that the inextribcable spaces and forest of names, which are confused through
the error of the scribes, are, as Hismenius says, "themselves singing to me and
mine," even if the ears of others are deaf.</p>

<p align="left" class="small">Kevin introduced the text as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left" class="small">This prologue gives us an interesting view into
the history of St Jerome's translation work, and some very important
information about the Septuagint in the world of his day. It appears that in
addition to Origen's Hexaplaric text, and the other well-known Septuagintal
texts, he had done a corrected Latin version of the Septuagint, which
unfortunately is entirely lost to us. One of the interesting things in this
prologue is the mention of Jerome separating "lines into members" (<em>per
versuum cola</em>). That is, he has separated the members, the individual words,
with spaces, which was then rarely done, but so common now that we don't even
notice it.</p>

<p align="left" class="small">The name "Paralipomenon" means, "things left over."
The book was called this because it included things not mentioned in Kings. I
can remember being fascinated as a child by the exotic mystery of that name,
Paralipomenon, like incense, silk, and the Faith itself, being something from
the ancient world, in contrast to the much more prosaic Chronicles, a boring,
uninteresting name to be found at the top of the local paper, and more redolent
of the supermarket and gas station. But enough about me! Enjoy the continuing
saga of the feisty St Jerome!</p>
