<p>BEGINNING OF THE PROLOGUE TO ESTHER</p>
<p>The Book of Esther stands corrupted by various translators. Which (book) I,
lifting up from the archives of the Hebrews, have translated more accurately
word for word. The common edition drags the book by knotted ropes of words
hither and yon, adding to it things which may have been said or heard at any
time. This is as is usual with instruction by schools, when a subject has been
taken up, to figure out from the words which someone could have used, which one
either suffered injury, or which one caused injury (to the text).</p>
<p>And you, O Paula and Eustochium, since you have both studied to enter the
libraries of the Hebrews and also have approved of the battles of the
interpreters, holding the Hebrew Book of Esther, look through each word of our
translation, so you may be able to understand me also to augmented nothing by
adding, but rather with faithful witness to have translated, just as it is found
in the Hebrew, the Hebrew history into the Latin language. We are not affected
by the praises of men, nor are we afraid of (their) slanders. For to be pleasing
to God we do not inwardly fear those caring for the minas of men, "for God has
scattered the bones of those desiring to be pleasing to men" (Ps 52.6), and
according to the Apostle, those like this are "not able to be servants of Christ"
(Gal 1.10).</p>

<p align="left" class="small">Kevin introduces his translation as follows: St
Jerome has little to say in this prologue about his actual work, except that the
"common edition," presumably the or an Old Latin version, of the Book of Esther
was a mess, and he resorted to the Hebrew text of his day. In this respect, his
translation is a valuable version representing a literal translation of a Hebrew
text found in Palestine in the late fourth century. He unfortunately doesn't
describe in this letter the messy situation of the additions to Esther found in
the Septuagint version, which he included en masse at the end of his version,
with short notes indicating where they belonged in his translation. These
additions can be found in various editions of the apocrypha, but they're best
read in the version in the NRSV, which is a full translation of the Septuagint
text, not just of the additions, and includes them all in their places, not in a
bunch at the end. Anyhow, enjoy!&nbsp; UPDATE: Thanks once again to the very
much appreciated help of Michael Gilleland of <a href="http://laudatortemporisacti.blogspot.com/">Laudator
Temporis Acti</a>, I've fixed a sentence (now the second one in the first
paragraph) that gave me trouble.</p>
