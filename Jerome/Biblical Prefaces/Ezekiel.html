<p align="center">[Translated by Kevin P. Edgecomb]</p>
<p>BEGINNING OF THE PROLOGUE TO THE PROPHET EZEKIEL</p>
<p>The Prophet Ezekiel was led captive with Joachin king of Judah to Babylon,
and he prophesied there to those who were captives with him, to those repenting
that they had willingly handed over the prophecy of Jeremiah to enemies, and yet
saw the city Jerusalem to stand, which he had predicted would fall. And in his
thirtieth year of age, and in the fifth year of the captivity, he began to speak
to his fellow captives. And at the same time, though later, this one in Chaldea
and Jeremiah in Judea prophesied. His style is neither greatly eloquent nor
excessively rustic, but properly proportioned between both. And he was a priest,
as also was Jeremiah, the beginning and ending of the book being wrapped in
great obscurities. But also the common edition of him does not differ much from
the Hebrew one. Because of that I greatly wonder what was the cause, that when
we have the same translators in all the books, in some they translated the same
things, in others, different things. Therefore, read this also according to our
translation because, by being written in words with spaces, it gives a clearer
meaning to readers. And if my friends also mock this, say to them that no one
restrains them from writing. But I do not respect him who follows them, which is
more clearly said in Greek, as they are called insult-swallowers (&#966;&#945;&#947;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#948;&#959;&#961;&#959;&#953;).</p>

There's not much to say about this prologue, as it's pretty straightforward.
Near the end, St Jerome sarcastically calls his detractors "friends." And
there's Greek in this one, too! Enjoy!</p>
