<p>BEGINNING OF THE PROLOGUE OF THE TWELVE PROPHETS</p>
<p>The order of the Twelve Prophets is not the same among the Hebrews as it is
among us. For which reason, according to how it is read there, they are also
arranged here. Hosea is composed of short clauses and speaking as though by
aphorisms. Joel is clear in the beginning, more obscure at the end. And they
each have their individual properties up to Malachi, who the Hebrews name Ezra
the scribe and teacher of the Law. And because it is too long to speak of all
these things now, I would only you were warned this, O Paula and Eustochium: the
book of the Twelve Prophets to be one; and Hosea a contemporary (&#963;&#965;&#957;&#967;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;)
of Isaiah; (and) Malachi in fact to have been of the times of Haggai and
Zechariah. And those (books) in which the time is not set down in the title,
under those kings which they were to have prophesied under, they also prophesied
after those which have titles.</p>

<p align="left" class="small">Kevin introduces his translation as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left" class="small">This is St Jerome's prologue to the Twelve
Prophets, or Twelve Minor Prophets as they're often called, because these
books are shorter relative to the books of the Prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, and
Ezekiel. It's a very short prologue, but there are two items of interest in
it. One is that St Jerome mentions that "the Hebrews" of his day considered
Malachi to be Ezra. I don't think I'd ever read that before, so it was a
pleasant surprise. The other interesting thing is that St Jerome considered the
Twelve Prophets to be chronologically arranged (which I
do too, great, somewhat curmudgeonly minds thinking alike), and that the
books which don't include dating indications can be dated after those who do.
And now, I think my introduction to the prologue has now come to more words than
are actually in it, so with no further ado, here it is. Enjoy!</p>
