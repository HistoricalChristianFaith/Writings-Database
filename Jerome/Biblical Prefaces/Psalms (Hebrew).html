<p>BEGINNING OF ANOTHER PREFACE OF THE SAME</p>
<p>Eusebius Hieronymus to his Sophronius, health!</p>
<p>I know some to think the Psalter to be divided into five books, as though
wherever among the (version of the) Seventy interpreters is written
&#947;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#964;&#959;
&#947;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#964;&#959;, that is, "may it be, may it be," for
which in Hebrew is said "amen amen," is the end of the books. And we, the
authority of the Hebrews being followed, and especially of the Apostles, who
always in the New Testament name the Book of Psalms, have asserted one volume.
We also testify of all the authors who are set down in the titles of their
psalms, namely of David, and of Asaph, and of Jeduthun, of the Sons of Korah, of
Heman the Ezraite, of Moses, and of Solomon, and of the rest, which Ezra
compiled into one volume. For if amen, for which Aquila translated "trustworthy"
(&#960;&#949;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;), is
only placed at the end of books and not sometimes wither at the beginning or at
the end of either words or sentences, then both the Savior never said in the
Gospel, "Amen, amen, I say to you," and the letters of Paul (never) contained it
in the middle work, also Moses, and Jeremiah, and others in this way had many
books, who in the middle of their books frequently interposed amen, as also the
number of twenty-two Hebrew books and the mystery of the same number will be
changed. For also its Hebrew title, Sephar Thallim, which is interpreted "Scroll
of Hymns," agreeing with the Apostolic authority, shows not many books, but one
volume.</p>
<p>Therefore, because recently, when disputing with a Hebrew, you produced
certain testimonies about the Lord Savior from the Psalms, and he, wishing to
outmaneuver you, asserted throughout nearly every one of the words that it is
not found thus in Hebrew, so that you were opposed to the (version of the)
Seventy interpreters, you most zealously demanded that, after Aquila, Symmachus
and Theodotion, I translated a new edition in Latin speech. For you said
yourself to be greatly confused by the variety of interpreters, so that you are
inclined by love to be content with either my translation or my judgment. For
this reason, having been compelled by you, to whom I am unable to deny even
those things I cannot do, I again handed myself over to the barkings of
detractors, and I preferred you to question my strengths rather than my
willingness in friendship. Certainly I will speak confidently and I will cite
many witnesses of this work, knowing me in this matter to have changed nothing
of the truth of the Hebrew. Therefore, wherever my edition has differed from the
old ones, ask any of the Hebrews, and you will clearly see me to be torn in
pieces by those striving after error, who "prefer to be seen to condemn the
brilliant rather than to learn," most perverse men. For when they always desire
new delicacies, and their gullets, like the seas, do not suffice, why in only
study of the Scriptures are they content with an old flavor? I do not say this
so that I might bite my predecessors, nor have I considered slandering any
translation of those which I very diligently corrected, (and) formerly gave to
men of my language; but that it is one thing to read the Psalms in the churches
of those believing in Christ, another thing to answer the Jews who accuse every
word.</p>
<p>But if, as you proffer, you will have translated by little work into Greek,
Opposing the Ridiculers (&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#954;&#969;&#957;
&#964;&#959;&#953;&#962;
&#948;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;), and you
will have made the most learned men witnesses to my ignorance, I will say to you
that (saying) of Horace, "You do not carry wood into a forest." Except that I
have this solace, if in the common work I know both praise and slander to be
common to me and you.</p>
<p>I desire you to be well in the Lord Jesus, and to remember me.</p>

<p align="left" class="small">Kevin introduces his translation as follows:&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left" class="small">This is the preface St Jerome wrote to accompany
his translation of the Psalms from the Hebrew. He apparently wasn't too
entirely sure of his success in this, as seems to be implied at a couple of
points in this letter, which shows St Jerome to have had both a humble and a
humorous streak which hasn't been entirely evident in the other prefaces. I
think it helps to put those into a better light, as well. Most interesting is
what he says about this translation's origins, as specifically designed to
reflect the Hebrew for the sake of apologetics, while other translations have
their place in being read in the churches. Of course, it's the other version
of the Psalms, based on the LXX, which were so popular and so ubiquitous before
the modern craze of translating from Hebrew came along. St Jerome is explicit in
that he wouldn't have had a problem with that. Enjoy!</p>
