<h2 id='tocuniq0'>Preface</h2>
<i>[The origin and scope of this book is described in the Preface itself. It was written in the year 388, two years after Jerome had settled at Bethlehem. He had, immediately on arriving in Palestine, three years previously, set to work to improve his knowledge of Hebrew, with a view to his translation of the Old Testament, which was begun in 391. This book, therefore, and the two which follow, may be taken as records of studies preparatory to the Vulgate.]</i>
<br><br>
Philo, the most erudite man among the Jews, is declared by Origen to have done what I am now doing; he set forth a book of Hebrew Names, classing them under their initial letters, and placing the etymology of each at the side. This work I originally proposed to translate into Latin. It is well known in the Greek world, and is to be found in all libraries. But I found that the copies were so discordant to one another, and the order so confused, that I judged it to be better to say nothing, rather than to write what would justly be condemned. A work of this kind, however, appeared likely to be of use; and my friends Lupulianus and Valerianus<sup id="5376"><a href="#fn_5376">1</a></sup> urged me to attempt it, because, as they thought, I had made some progress in the knowledge of Hebrew. I, therefore, went through all the books of Scripture in order, and in the restoration which I have now made of the ancient fabric, I think that I have produced a work which may be found valuable by Greeks as well as Latins.
<br><br>
I here in the Preface beg the reader to take notice that, if he finds anything omitted in this work, it is reserved for mention in another. I have at this moment on hand a book of Hebrew Questions, an undertaking of a new kind such as has never until now been heard of amongst either the Greeks or the Latins. I say this, not with a view of arrogantly puffing up my own work, but because I know how much labour I have spent on it, and wish to provoke those whose knowledge is deficient to read it. I recommend all those who wish to possess both that work and the present one, and also the book of Hebrew Places, which I am about to publish, to make no account of the Jews and all their ebullitions of vexation. Moreover, I have added the meaning of the words and names in the New Testament, so that the fabric might receive its last touch and might stand complete. I wished also in this to imitate Origen, whom all but the ignorant acknowledge as the greatest teacher of the Churches next to the Apostles; for in this work, which stands among the noblest monuments of his genius, he endeavoured as a Christian to supply what Philo, as a Jew, had omitted.
<br><br><br><sup id="fn_5376"><a href="#5376">1</a></sup>:
    Nothing is known of these men. It is very improbable that this Valerianus was the bishop of Apuleia, who must, however, have been known to Jerome.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq1'>Here begins the book</h2>
It is not always to be assumed that wherever a letter A, which in Hebrew is called Aleph, is placed in a name, it is itself that which is put; for there are several other letters, which, though not written, are understood to be consonants, and are pronounced before or after a given vowel; as, for example, the Ain, the He, and the Heth, which letters have the power of modifying aspirates and of changing the sound of consonants with which they are combined. It may therefore be observed, that different letters are used in commencing words by the Hebrews in Genesis and the other books of the law, according to the divers classes of beings previously spoken of; but in our tongue we have not such a variety of sounds, and are therefore contented with a simple pronunciation. Hence it arises that the same words, which are differently written by them, appear to us to have different meanings.

What we said at the beginning should be observed in regards to the vowels: because sometimes there is only one letter among us, and among the Hebrews it is pronounced in different ways: this should also now be understood with the letter S. Indeed, there are three S letters among the Hebrews: one which is called Samech and is simply read like our S letter; another Sin, in which a certain noise is heard that is not found in our language; a third Sade, which our ears completely avoid. Therefore, wherever it occurs, that the same names are interpreted differently, it is because they are written in different letters. But what we said in Genesis should also be observed in all books in the same way.

I have skipped the letter 'I' and 'L', because the same words are translated in other books, and it is pointless to repeat what has been said or needs to be said.
