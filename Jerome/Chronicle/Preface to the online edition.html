<h1 align="center">The Chronicle of St. Jerome</h1>
<p><u>Introduction</u></p>
<p>The <i>Chronicle</i> of St. Jerome was composed around 380AD and became the
primary available source of information on dates and events from the time of its
composition until the end of the middle ages.&nbsp; Jerome's work itself was a
translation into Latin of the <i>Chronicle</i> of Eusebius of Caesarea, brought
up to date, but it was through Jerome that it came to be so influential.</p>
<p>It is the first text in which we see an attempt to accurately date all the
events of times previous.&nbsp; Every event is assigned to a date, the kings and
the dates are drawn up in columns, and brief notes made against each.&nbsp; The
revolutionary tabular format forces the chronologist to be precise in whatever
data is entered and highlights any errors involved in synchronising lists from
different kingdoms of kings and the number of years they reigned.</p>
<p><u>The Chronicle of Eusebius of Caesarea</u></p>
<p>Eusebius of Caesarea wrote his chronicle ca. 311 AD, and is responsible for
the revolutionary format which transformed the study of history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to Eusebius, a chronography would consist of lists of kings, and how
long they reigned.&nbsp; An occasional note might be attached to the name of a
king, stating that in the 3<sup>rd</sup> year of his reign such-and-such event
occurred.&nbsp; Each kingdom would be treated separately, and its rulers or
magistrates listed.&nbsp; Eusebius himself compiled a chronography of this kind,
which is today known as book one of his <i>Chronicle</i>, and has the title <i>The
Chronography</i>.&nbsp; But the problem for the reader was how to link
information about rulers and events in one kingdom to events in other kingdoms.&nbsp;
Eusebius wanted to write a history of the church, and needed to link together
information from Jewish sources with the chronographical information that he
obtained from numerous Greek predecessors, such as Porphyry, Castor, and
Erastothenes, and also from Christian predecessors such as Julius Africanus.</p>
<p>His own contribution was to draw up the existing mass of chronological
information in a tabular format that enforced a perpetual synchronism between
the various parallel strands of data. This innovation may rightly be described
as a moment of genius. The second book of his <i>Chronicle </i>was drawn up in
this way and entitled <i>The Chronological Canons</i>.&nbsp; This was the
portion that Jerome translated and its format can be seen below.&nbsp;
Jerome's translation is the most accurate version of this book that has
reached us.</p>
<p>To do this, Eusebius took the then new medium of the codex (the modern book
format, as opposed to the roll) and exploited the concept of a page.&nbsp; He
divided up the page using a tabular format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He drew vertical columns on the page.&nbsp; The lefthandmost he headed as
'Kings of the Persians' (or whichever other empire was current at the time).&nbsp;
The righthandmost he headed 'Kings of the Egyptians', so long as there were
any.&nbsp; When new kingdoms came along, he added an extra column for them; when
kingdoms disappeared, the column vanished with them.</p>
<p>When a king came to the throne, he placed his name on a separate line by
itself, for any events of that king which had no specified year.&nbsp; Beneath
it he then enumerated the years of his reign on succeeding lines; 1, 2, 3, 4 and
so on.&nbsp; Thus for each year there was a line on which information could be
entered.&nbsp; Also, by running along the line, it could be seen precisely who
ruled where at any given time.</p>
<p>The new format was an act of genius, which ensured that the problems of Greek
chronography would not continue to bedevil history.</p>
<p>Eusebius also decided to start his Chronicle, not with the date of Creation,
but with the earliest date that he felt he could reasonably calculate, which was
the birth of Abraham.&nbsp; Since his new format placed each year on a separate
line, he marked every ten years how many years it had been from the birth of
Abraham.&nbsp; This universal dating foreshadowed the invention of the standard
Anno Domini dating by Dionysius Exiguus.&nbsp; That a standard dating system
would come into being was ensured by the popularity of Jerome's version of the
Chronicle, and the obvious need for it once that work existed.</p>
<p>Eusebius did not collect the materials himself for his work, but relied on
whatever works he could find which gave brief lists of events and rulers.&nbsp;
Once he started work, the problems of Greek chronography must have become
exceedingly evident.</p>
<p><u>The problems of Greek chronography</u></p>
<p>By the time of Eusebius, Greek chronography was a mess.&nbsp; There were a
number of reasons for this.</p>
<p>There was no agreement in the ancient world on which date the year should
begin.&nbsp; Each city would have its own calendar and reckoning.&nbsp; There
were several different systems of months in use.&nbsp; There were also systems
like 'Ab Urbe Condita' (AUC - from the founding of the City, Rome).&nbsp;
But there were so many of these, and they enjoyed such limited use, that these
did not advance things.&nbsp; The Romans, rather than using AUC, tended to date
a year by the names of the annual consuls then in office.&nbsp; Greek cities
often did likewise.</p>
<p>The most common system of dating was by the regnal year of a reigning
monarch, and inscriptions often record that they were erected in the nth year of
king xyz.&nbsp; Lists of kings and the number of years they reigned circulated,
and exist still, carved on the walls of Egyptian temples.&nbsp; But kings do not
always come to the throne on the 1<sup>st</sup> of January, and some rule for
less than a year, and some are obliterated from the lists for political reasons.&nbsp;
In consequence any reckoning based upon regnal years was bound to be in error,
sometimes substantially as errors in a dynasty accumulated.</p>
<p>Once the Olympic games had begun, with a group of four years between games
known as an Olympiad, some of the Greeks began to refer to those four-year
groups by the name of the victor in the games.&nbsp; Later yet, a number was
assigned to the olympiad.&nbsp; Chronicles based on the four-year cycle began to
come into existence, since this dating was more universal for Greek affairs than
lists of annual officials in each city.</p>
<p>Anyone trying to write a history had to struggle with these obstacles.
Frequently the best that could be done was to say that a certain man flourished
in the reign of such a king.&nbsp; Yet even here problems occurred, since the
Greek word used for 'flourished' was extremely similar to that for 'was
born.'&nbsp; The result of such errors can be seen in the <i>Chronicle</i> in
the dates assigned to Lycurgus, who appears 3 times over a period of more than a
century.&nbsp; The first is in fact when he was born; the second his hey-day,
and the third refers to someone of the same name!&nbsp; But each can be traced
back to impeccable sources in the Greek tradition that Eusebius used.</p>
<p><u>Eusebius' approach to the chronological problems</u></p>
<p>Eusebius was powerless to solve most of these problems.&nbsp; His innovative
format however forced him to deal with some of them.&nbsp; In many cases he
simply recorded what he had, and left others to deal with the problem.&nbsp; In
others he presumed an error and adjusted the count of years assigned to a given
ruler in order to make the lines tally and 'correct' the 'error'.</p>
<p>Starting with a mess of loosely connected regnal years, he linked them
together through synchronisms.&nbsp; These were points at which he had
information that tied together events in two different kingdoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance he was able to determine that Darius of Persia and Alexander the
Great of Macedon lived at the same time, since the latter overthrew the former.&nbsp;
This linked the Greek lists with the Persian ones.&nbsp; The Greek lists could
be linked together through the Olympiads, which were often recorded for Greek
events.&nbsp; He was able to link Jewish events with Persian ones because it was
recorded that the second temple was built in the Second Year of Darius.&nbsp;
This last date is one of his crucial synchronisms.&nbsp; The date of the Trojan
War was present in many of his lists, and forms another such link.</p>
<p>Some events, particularly in Olympiad Chronicles, were not given a precise
year, but merely dated to the period of the Olympiad, or of a given ruler.&nbsp;
He handled this by placing each Olympiad and each ruler's name on a fresh
line, separate from the normal list of years.&nbsp; This gave him space to
record such information.</p>
<p>The <i>Chronicle</i> is inevitably riddled with errors.&nbsp; Eusebius
himself records at one point that all dates prior to then are conjectural and
disputed.&nbsp; Responsibility for these errors must be assigned largely to his
predecessors.&nbsp; Even then, it is difficult to condemn inaccurate dates
assigned to times when no-one had any conception of such a thing as a numerical
date.&nbsp; Rather the Chronicle draws a line under the period of confusion, and
provides a framework in which errors can be identified and resolved.</p>
<p>Eusebius' own Chronicle is no longer extant in the original Greek.&nbsp; An
Armenian translation exists in two manuscripts, although the end of book one and
start and end of book two are lost in both.&nbsp; The entries in book two have
also been augmented, and the format rearranged, but numerous errors crept in
during this process.</p>
<p><u>Jerome and Eusebius</u></p>
<p>St. Jerome as a young man spent time in the East and became familiar with a
great deal of the scholarship of the school of Origen and Eusebius.&nbsp; He
came across a copy of the <i>Chronological Canons</i> and recognised its
importance.&nbsp; As with other works by Eusebius, such as the Onomasticon, he
arranged to translate it.&nbsp; He had a skilled scribe draw up a volume with
the numerals in Latin rather than Greek - no trivial task -, and then
dictated a translation of the contents.</p>
<p>He also added his own comments where he felt that Roman history had been
neglected.&nbsp; Finally he composed a continuation down to his own times,
ending with the disastrous defeat and death of the emperor Valens at the hands
of the Goths at Adrianople in 378 AD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This continuation was of the utmost importance for the future.&nbsp; The
esteem in which Jerome was held was great in the succeeding decades and
centuries, and the monastic scribes did not hesitate to follow his example and
write further continuations to the text.&nbsp; This practice undoubtedly
contributed to the preservation of the work and its centrality to all future
historical work.</p>

<p>Jerome made revisions to the text as time went on. He made an error in
transcribing 'Alcamenes' in one entry, mistaking the numeral theta that preceded
it as part of the name.&nbsp; The text 'Thalcamenes' appears in numerous
manuscripts, including 'O'; but is corrected in others.&nbsp; It shows clearly
the manner in which the Greek practise of using letters as numerals facilitated
corruption of both the numbers and the text.</p>

<p><u>Families of manuscripts</u></p>

<p>It was Joseph Justus Scaliger (1540-1609) who first worked on the chronology  
of antiquity and so came up against the primary witness, Jerome's version of  
Eusebius.&nbsp; In his work <i>De emendation temporum</i> (1583) he split the  
mss into two families.</p> 

<ul>
  <li><i>Priores</i>.&nbsp; 10 mostly late manuscripts known to him  
    shared a format with all the numbers on the left-hand side of the page, in  
    columns, and at the right the text of any historical event.&nbsp; This could  
    wrap around, thereby giving a long space for all the text.&nbsp; Scaliger  
    referred to this space for text as the <i>spatium historicum</i> and so it has been known since.&nbsp;
    But Scaliger called it the <i>priores</i>  
    -- earliest -- since he thought they were.</li> 
  <li><i>Posteriores</i>.&nbsp; Three early manuscripts (B, F, P) Scaliger  
    designated <i>posteriores</i> -- later -- since they did not agree with each  
    other in format, nor with the <i>priores</i> group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Also present in the manuscripts of Jerome are a set of king-lists (the <i>Series  
Regum</i>) and an <i>Exordium</i>.&nbsp; In 1750 the Veronese scholar Girolamo  
Da Prato published a treatise, <i>De Chronicis libris duo ab Eusebio scriptis et  
editis</i>.&nbsp; In this he established the late date of these two items.&nbsp;
These are published in Schoene (below).</p> 

<ul>
  <li>O, B, F, P, A and S are all old and agree in format.&nbsp; B is not a  
    child of S, unlike A and P.&nbsp; O and S are independent, so must go back  
    to two exemplars written in Jerome's lifetime.</li> 
</ul>

<p> One MS of the 5th century survives  
almost complete; of another, enough fragments survive to identify two apographs  
which enable it to be reconstructed in its entirety.&nbsp; There are several MSS  
of the 7th and 8th centuries.&nbsp; These early witnesses attest securely not  
only the text of Jerome's version, but equally important, its arrangement of the  
columns of numbers and of the entries on each page of the original (T.D.Barnes,  
p.112).</p>

<p> So old are the manuscripts, that we can see some of Jerome's working 
practises.&nbsp; S and its descendants reflect Jerome's final version.&nbsp; O 
was based on a somewhat earlier copy which had a few readings which Jerome 
corrected against his copy of Eusebius, but has the same format.&nbsp; However 
the copyist of O has chosen to save parchment by condensing the text into 30 
lines per page, rather than the original 26.&nbsp; B also derives from a 
pre-revision copy.&nbsp; Schoene referred to the revised edition as the <i>Editio 
Romana</i> of the Chronicle, on the theory that Jerome made it to present to the 
Roman synod of 382. (RP: I have been unable to find any actual evidence in any 
of the works listed below for this).</p>

<p> There is no uniformity in the manuscripts in the division of lines and pages 
in the prefaces.&nbsp; All the older manuscripts have a single column format for 
the preface; some later ones have two columns.</p>

      Chronicon of Jerome, the Chronicon Imperiale of Prosper, and the Chronicle 
      of Marius of Aventicum.&nbsp; Jerome's Chronicle is ff. 57a-190a.&nbsp; The pages are much larger than most mss, containing 42 (sometimes 40 or 
      41) lines.&nbsp; This is the oldest of the <i>priores</i>.&nbsp; The 
      scribe was careless.&nbsp; A displacement of a portion of the preface 
      shows that the archetype had around 31 lines per page.</td>

<p>This is not a complete list: there are said to be a hundred or so.</p> 

<p><u>About this translation</u></p>
<p>This translation is the first translation of the whole work into a modern
language.&nbsp; The portion written by Jerome himself, from 326-378, has been
translated before.&nbsp; Malcolm Drew Donalson translated it into English with a
commentary in 1996; Beno&icirc;t Jeanjean published an excellent French translation
and commentary in 2004, to which he added a translation of the two prefaces of
Jerome and Eusebius.&nbsp; Most but not all of the preface of Jerome had been
translated into English as part of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers series in
the 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>The translation came about as a result of some experiments in online
collaborative translation by Roger Pearse.&nbsp; Andrew Smith of attalus.org had
translated portions of the text of the Chronicle covering the Hellenistic era,
down to the death of Tiberius, and formatted them as text keyed on Olympiad,
year, and text.&nbsp; This provided a model for placing the text of the
Chronicle online so that it could be translated, without the need to worry about
the king-lists and numbers and the detailed format of the final product.&nbsp;
This was the approach taken.</p>

<p>After a discussion with Steven Van Impe, in September 2004, a web page was
placed online which contained on the left hand side some 160 text entries
in Latin from Jerome's Chronicle, one after another, and on the right a box in
which anyone might enter a translation.&nbsp; The text was broken down into very
short sections of no more than a short sentence.&nbsp; The electronic Patrologia
Latina Database text was used as a basis, and corrected against the edition of
J. K. Fotheringham.&nbsp; The PL text contained a great many medieval additions
which were mostly ignored, and the remainder placed in brackets.</p>

<p>The text was made available in weekly 'chunks' of no more than 160
sections, each being edited, uploaded and announced on a Saturday.&nbsp; Each
chunk took around a week.&nbsp; The website then allowed anyone visiting the
site to enter a translation or comments there and then, without the need for
registration.&nbsp; The emphasis was on each section being so short that anyone
with any knowledge of Latin would be able to do something, and thereby people of
all levels of Latin would be encouraged to participate.&nbsp; Quality was
assured by keeping the length of the chunk short, so that when a chunk was done
people could then review what had been done in the remainder of the week.</p>
<p>The existence of each new chunk was publicised in a variety of online fora,
including humanities.classics, soc.history.ancient and the LT-ANTIQ mailing
list.&nbsp; The process took 14 weeks from September 2004 until Christmas 2004,
starting with Gaius (Caligula) and proceeding to the end, then restarting with
Abraham and continuing down to Tiberius; finally doing the praefationes in the
same way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the bulk of the translation work was done, the translation had to be
harmonised to try to ensure that the same words were translated the same way.&nbsp;
This was not straightforward.&nbsp; The text was too large to edit in Microsoft
Word or Frontpage.&nbsp; In the end, each sentence was placed online in a
separate text file, numbered 1-2574, and a PHP script written so that the
sentences could be browsed by number range (1-10, etc) or by searching for words
in the text file.&nbsp; Using the latter approach, it was easier to display only
those sections which contained a specific word to be harmonised.&nbsp; This
process took a month.</p>
<p>Then the result had to be laid out in the format of the original, which took
some three months until April 2004 and was very arduous.&nbsp; The format is 26
line pages and follows Helm's edition (1956).&nbsp; This proved extraordinarily difficult, involving
some unusual HTML.&nbsp; The layout was done from the rear of the volume, and
only once around 70% of the text had been formatted was a template that would
work for every page successfully evolved.&nbsp; This process took until the end
of April 2005, and around 20% had to be done again once the modus operandi had
been established.&nbsp;However many features of the Chronicle only become clear
once you actually try to lay out a copy on a page, electronic or otherwise.</p>
<p>The layout was done a page at a time in Dreamweaver 6.&nbsp; Attempts to edit
larger files proved impractical.&nbsp; It quickly became clear that the HTML
tables could not be allowed to resize as normally happens.&nbsp; Instead the
tables were specified as fixed size and the properties of each cell specified in
CSS.&nbsp; This ensured compatibility across browsers, such as Internet Explorer
6, Netscape 6 and Firefox.</p>
<p>Finally a question arose about colours in the text.&nbsp; Jerome's original
text had the columns of kings coloured alternately red and black, in order to
avoid confusion.&nbsp; This has been followed in the online text.&nbsp; There
are no indications in either Helm or Fotheringham of the colour system.&nbsp;
The Merton College manuscript is online, but since this has additional colours
it could not be used without reservation.&nbsp; A colour strip of 27 pictures of
the Bodleian manuscript was bought and used as a guide, but this mainly
contained items from the latter portion of the Chronicle.&nbsp; The Assistant
Librarian of the Bodleian, Dr. Bruce Barker-Benfield, kindly agreed to allow
access to this treasure.&nbsp; A visit during
May 2005 allowed the production of a marked up print-out of the translation
which indicated which
portions of the text were in which colour.&nbsp; In the process he found that
the facsimile really was an extraordinarily accurate reproduction of the look
and feel of the codex, colour aside.&nbsp; However the first original page was
page 69.&nbsp; The colour on the pages before this point is therefore a
reconstruction.&nbsp; The last page of the codex was also lost in late
antiquity; again a guess has been made on the correct colours.</p>
<p>One problem that was encountered in the translation was a portion in
Jerome's introduction.&nbsp; The original text was laid out in a specific
tabular format by Eusebius, and following him, by Jerome.&nbsp; However at some
time during the Dark Ages, a scribe chose to reformat the document by placing
all of the columns of kings on the left, and all the text on the right.&nbsp;
The first letter of the text was colour-coded to indicate to which column of
numbers - up to nine - it related.&nbsp; To explain this, the scribe
interpolated a short passage into Jerome's introduction.&nbsp; Unfortunately
this passage is extremely terse and difficult to understand in the absence of a
manuscript formatted and coded in this way.&nbsp; A manuscript of this family
does exist in the British Library.&nbsp; Permission to view this manuscript has
been granted but the opportunity to view it has not yet arrived. Until this can
be checked, the translation of the interpolated passage must be considered
provisional.</p>
<p><u>Translators and helpers</u></p>

<p>Around 25 people participated at various points during the 14 weeks of the
experiment, and I would like to thank everyone who did so.&nbsp; In no
particular order, the main translators and problem-solvers were: Roger Pearse
(RP), Andrew S. Jacobs (ASJ), Jos&eacute; Miguel Blasco Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez (JMB), Jacob Wainwright Love
(JWL), and an anonymous contributor known as '...'; together
with contributions large and small by Argyros George Argyrou (AGA), Steven Van
Impe (SVI), Ben&ocirc;it Jeanjean (BJ: whose splendid
French translation of the last portion of the Chronicle appeared as our project
was drawing to a close), Frank Gay (FG), Frank Van Heden
(FVH), Mark DelCogliano (MD), Andrew Smith (AS), Michael Kuettner (MK), James Hannam (JH),
DSV, TV, GAC, MDM, M. Guy, Kevin O'Donnell, Ayse Tuzlak (AT), FM,
RAK, JWS, tks, EL, SJJC, DH, KS, Pe, AC, RIP and others who chose to remain
entirely anonymous. (If anyone for whom I only have initials would like to
contact me, I'd be glad to add your names).&nbsp; Many, many thanks to you all!</p>

<p>All errors of translation, revision and layout are solely the responsibility
of Roger Pearse, of course. The translation does not pretend to be what it is
not, and
doubtless contains errata and corrigenda.&nbsp; All such will be
gratefully received.&nbsp; The object of the translation was to explore the
possibilities and limitations of online translation of works never before
translated by a mixture of professionals and people not professionally involved
in such activity, and in the process to make this
fascinating work available to the general public, and thereby to encourage
interest in ancient chronography.&nbsp; It is hoped that this will now occur.</p>

<p>Thanks are due to Dr. Bruce Barker-Benfield of the Bodleian Library, Oxford,
who made it possible for the manuscript 'O' -- one of the treasures of that
library -- to be consulted.</p>

<p><u>Key to codes used in the translation</u></p>

<p>The double-page openings of Jerome's copy are represented on-screen by the
white rectangles.&nbsp; Areas in yellow indicate material not part of Jerome's
text.&nbsp; The spine of the book is represented by a yellow column down the
middle.&nbsp; Page numbers (a later addition) are indicated in square brackets
at the top -- [220/221] is pages 220 and 221.&nbsp; These page numbers appear in
Helm and Fotheringham.</p>

<p>A few things in the text may be obscure.&nbsp; These have been transcribed
from the edition of Helm (1956).</p>

<p><i>g</i> An entry -- The italic letter is not present in Jerome's text, but
is a code devised by Rudolf Helm.&nbsp; All the text entries can be referenced
by page number and letter, e.g. 303a.</p>

<p>* -- When an entry is marked with an asterisk in Helm's edition, it is
supposedly not present in the Armenian translation of the original work by
Eusebius.&nbsp; This means that it must be an entry added by Jerome.&nbsp;
However Burgess states (p.24) that these are not very accurate.&nbsp; After some
hesitation, I have transcribed them.<br>
(*) -- Helm's code for an entry which is present in the Armenian, but in a
somewhat shorter or different form.<br>
*? -- Helm's code for another possible modification; I am unclear in what way.</p>

<p>The first column of years, underlined, is the years from Abraham, shown every
10 years.&nbsp; The reckoning of years AD and BC is shown for guidance, but did
not form part of the original text.</p>

<p>Note that the text has been formatted for display under Internet Explorer
6.&nbsp; I have been unable to discover why it behaves erratically under
Firefox.&nbsp; The task of converting the Chronicle to HTML for the first time
has not been a trivial one, and the only way to find out how to do it was to
learn by doing.&nbsp; There are certain irregularities of page width in the
second portion of the Chronicle.&nbsp; I hope I may be forgiven for not redoing
this portion entirely, using the page size and format of the pages in the first
part. Such an enterprise would be useful, but it would take months, for purely
cosmetic gain.&nbsp; At the moment I do not have the resources to redo it.&nbsp;
If it causes deep pain, let me know.</p>

<p>It is possible to print off the tabular portion of the Chronicle, in
landscape mode, resizing to paper width.&nbsp; An inkjet can give quite
satisfactory results.</p>

<p><u>Latin text</u></p>

<p>After this was all done, there was very little energy left for anything else,
and certainly not to create an online Latin text.&nbsp; The text used for the
translation project consisted of the 'lemmas' of text only.&nbsp; But during the
summer of 2005, JMB very heroically volunteered to incorporate this into the
format of the translation, so that a Latin text would be available.&nbsp; This
he did, and it now appears here with the English.&nbsp; The numerals have not
been converted back to Roman numbers.&nbsp; If someone would care to volunteer
for that task, it would be nice to complete the job.</p>
