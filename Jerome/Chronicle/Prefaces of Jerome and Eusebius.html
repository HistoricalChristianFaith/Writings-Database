<p align="center"><b>St. Jerome, Chronicle (2004-5). Preface of Jerome; preface
of Eusebius</b></p>
<hr>

<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Eusebius Hieronymus to his friends Vincentius and
Gallienus, greetings.</font></b></p>
<p>There was an old custom of the scholars, that they would reduce Greek books
to Latin speech for the purpose of exercizing their wits, and, what has even
more difficulty in it, they would translate poems of illustrious men, with the
added necessity of correctly rendering the metre.&nbsp; For the same reason our
Cicero translated complete books of Plato word-for-word: and after he had
published Aratus in Roman dress, in hexameter verses, he amused himself with
Xenophon's <i>Economics</i>.&nbsp; In this work that golden stream of eloquence
is so frequently obstructed by certain rough and turbulent obstacles, so that
whoever does not know that they are translations does not believe they were said
by Cicero.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For it is difficult for someone who is following another's lines not to stray
outside them from time to time; when things were said well in another language,
it is hard to preserve the same elegance in translation.&nbsp; An idea was
captured appropriately by a single word: I do not have my own word to convey it,
and while I seek to complete the sentence, in a long detour I hardly advance a
brief distance along the road. The twists of hyperbaton <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>,
the dissimilarities of cases, finally the varieties of figures of speech are
added to the sense itself and, so to speak, the native idiom of the
language.&nbsp; If I translate word for word, it sounds absurd; if perforce I
alter something in sequence or style, I shall seem to have failed in the duty of
a translator.</p>
<p>Therefore, my dearest Vincentius, and you, Gallienus, part of my soul, I beg
that you reread whatever in this work is hasty, not with the spirit of judges,
but as friends: especially since I dictated as quickly as possible to a
secretary, as you know; and also the style <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> of the
divine books testifies to the difficulty of the task, which, when published by
the LXX translators, did not retain the same flavour in the Greek
language.&nbsp; For this reason Aquila and Symmachus and Theodotion were roused
up to produce almost different works from the same work: with the first
expressing it word-for-word, and the next preferring to follow the sense, and
the third not differing much from the ancients.&nbsp; However the fifth, sixth
and seventh versions <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>, although it is unknown from
which authors they originate, yet they contain intrinsic variants that are so
probably correct, that they have earned authority without having names.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's how it comes about that Sacred Literature seems unpolished and harsh
sounding, for while scholarly men -- not understanding that they were translated
from Hebrew -- look at the outside but not into the kernel, they tend rather to
be thoroughly horrified at the mean clothing, so to speak, before they find the
fair body of the things within.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed what is more melodious than the psalter, which like the works of our
own Flaccus <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> or the Greek Pindar, now runs along in
iambics, now rings out in alcaics, now swells in sapphics, and now walks in
semifoot?&nbsp; What is more beautiful than the Song of Deuteronomy or Isaiah?
What is more serious than Solomon? What is more perfect than Job?&nbsp; All of
which compositions circulate among their own people in hexameter and pentameter
verses, as Josephus and Origen write.&nbsp; When we read these in Greek, they
sound like something else; when we read them in Latin, they are scarcely
coherent.</p>
<p>For if it seems to someone that the grace of a language does not change in
translation, let him present Homer word-for-word in Latin, -- let me say
something more -- let it be translated into his own language in words of prose;
he will see that the word-order has become ridiculous and a most eloquent poet
barely readable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the point of all this?&nbsp; Obviously so that it does not seem
amazing to you, if we offend occasionally, if sluggish speech is either raspy in
consonants or divided and split in its sounds, or constrained by the brevity of
these matters, since the most learned men have struggled in this same task: and
to the general difficulty that we have pleaded in every translation, this in
particular is added to us: that the history is multiplex, possessing barbarian
names, matters unknown to the Latin-speaking peoples, inexplicable numbers, and
columns equally interwoven with events and numbers, so that it is almost more
difficult to discern the order in which things must be read, than to arrive at
an understanding of the meaning.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> In order that, moreover, it may be
  understood, with a clear indication of which number any text pertains to, let
  the reader attend to these inserted distinctions, so that, if the text must be
  related to the first number of kingdom previously marked out, let him look at
  the first letter in the explanation of the text: and, if he should see it in
  bright red, let him know that it must apply to that period or in the year,
  which the number similarly drawn, that is in bright red, will have suggested:
  but if he shall perceive that the number (=initial letter?) is not in a pure
  bright red, but was written after black was mixed in, the text must be related
  to the number of the second column: if however it must be related to the third
  column of numbers that has been written down, the middle of the number
  (initial letter?) will be seen in a pure bright red and the remaining part
  given solely in black. The fourth column of numbers will have nothing in
  bright red, but there will be for an indication how the text is bound to it
  (the column of numbers), when the letter done in bright red at the start of
  the explanation of the text, that must also be supplied for the signs above,
  is displayed anyway, (and) they corresponded in category to none of the signs
  mentioned above.&nbsp; If on the contrary, the (initial) letter was expressed,
  not actually in bright red but in mixed black and red, he will be able to turn
  to the number gleaming with red in the fifth column of numbers; and so the
  sixth column of numbers will be indicated like the second, the seventh like
  the third, and the eighth also like the fourth with a two-colour-appearing
  letter. But when there are none of those signs which we mentioned earlier
  either in the numbers or in the explanation of history, the ninth column which
  was annotated is referred to. However, not all of these requirements are
  needed when the number of columns is less.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this I think that it is necessary to warn in advance that, exactly as
they have been written, the variety of colours should also be preserved; lest
someone suppose that so great an effort has been attempted for a meaningless
pleasure of the eyes, and, when he flees from the tedium of writing, inserts a
labyrinth of error.&nbsp; For this has been devised so that the strips of the
kingdoms, which had almost been mixed together because of their excessive
proximity on the page, might be separated by the distinct indication of bright
red, and so that the same hue of colour which earlier parchment pages had used
for a kingdom, would also be kept on later ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I am not unaware that there will be many people who from their customary
desire to detract from all things, will sink their fangs into this volume, which
cannot be avoided unless one writes nothing at all: they will misrepresent
dates, change the order, dispute events, split syllables, and, because it is
generally customary that this should happen, they will ascribe the negligence of
copyists to authors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I would be within my right to repel those that it displease, by
saying let them not read, in short I prefer to send them away satisfied, so that
they can both assign the fidelity of the Greek things to their own author, and
what new matters we have inserted, they may recognize that they have been
extracted from other very learned men.&nbsp; And indeed it should be known that
I have filled the role of both translator and in part writer, because I have
both most faithfully expressed the Greek, and I have added some things which seemed to me to
have been omitted, in Roman history especially which Eusebius, the
originator of this book, seems to me, not to have been thus ignorant, for he was
most learned, but since he was writing in Greek, to have skipped over those
things less necessary to his countrymen.</p>
<p>And so from Ninus and from Abraham down to the captivity of Troy is a simple
translation from the Greek: from Troy down to the 20th year of Constantine many
things are added or modified, which we have carefully excerpted from Tranquillus
<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>, and the other illustrious historians: but from
the aforementioned year of Constantine down to the 6th consulate of the Emperor
Valens and second of the Emperor Valentinian, is totally my own.</p>
<p>Contented with this end-point, I have reserved the rest of the time of
Gratian and Theodosius for the pen of a broader history; not that I have been
afraid to write freely and truly about living persons -- for the fear of God
drives out the fear of men -- but because while the barbarians are still raging
here in our land, all things are uncertain.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>The Translated Preface of Eusebius.</b><A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A></font></p>
<p>The most learned men -- Clement, and Africanus, and Tatian from among
ourselves, and Josephus and Justus from among the Jews, all while compiling
books of ancient history -- have related that Moses, of the Hebrew nation, who
first of all the prophets before the advent of the Lord Saviour expounded the
divine laws in the sacred texts, lived in the time of Inachus.&nbsp; Again,
Inachus precedes the Trojan War by 500 years: indeed from among the pagans, that
impious man Porphyry in the fourth book of his work which he with pointless
labour concocted against us, affirms that Semiramis, who reigned over the
Assyrians 150 years before Inachus, lived after Moses.&nbsp; And so, according
to him, Moses is discovered to be older than the Trojan War by almost 850
years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When these things are taken into consideration, I have considered that it is
necessary to search after the truth more diligently, and on account of this in a
prior book <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> I have noted in advance for myself, as
a sort of source for a future work, all the dates of kings, of the Chaldaeans,
Assyrians, Medes, Persians, Lydians, Hebrews, Egyptians, Athenians, Argives,
Sicyonians, Lacedaemonians, Corinthians, Thessalians, Macedonians, and Latins
who afterwards were called Romans.</p>
<p>In the present book, however, putting each set of dates in turn in a column
side by side, and counting the years of each of the nations, in order that this
was contemporary with that, I have thus joined them together in careful order.&nbsp;
Nor has it escaped me that differing numbers of years are to be found in the
Hebrew books, either more or less, depending on how it seemed to the
translators; and I would rather follow that which a great number of copies have
guaranteed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But let anyone who wishes calculate it: he will find that, in the time of
Inachus who they say first ruled at Argos, Israel was patriarch of the Hebrews,
from whom the twelve tribes of the Jews drew the name of Israel.&nbsp; Morever
it is clear that Semiramis and Abraham were contemporaries: for Moses, although
he might be younger than the aforementioned, nevertheless is understood to be
older than all of those whom the Greeks consider most ancient: that is, Homer
and Hesiod, and the Trojan War, and much older than Hercules, Musaeus, Linus,
Chiron, Orpheus, Castor, Pollux, Aesculapius, Liber, Mercury, Apollo, and all
the other gods of the nations, and sacred figures, and oracles, even the deeds
of Jupiter, whom Greece placed at the summit of divinity.&nbsp; I say that all
of these whom we have enumerated, we prove that they also lived after Cecrops
Diphyes, the first king of Attica.</p>
<p>Moreover the present history shows that Cecrops is coeval with Moses and
precedes the Trojan War by 350 years.&nbsp; Which, lest it should seem doubtful
to someone, the following reasoning will thus prove.</p>
<p>Christ was born in the 42th year of the rule of Augustus. He started to
preach in the 15th year of Tiberius. If someone therefore, counting backward
through the number of years, seeks the second year of Darius, king of the
Persians, in whose reign the Temple in Jerusalem which had been destroyed by the
Babylonians was rebuilt, he will find 548 years from Tiberius back to
Darius.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course the second year of Darius was in the first year of the 45th
Olympiad, and the 15th year of Tiberius occurred in the 201st Olympiad.&nbsp;
Therefore there were 137 Olympiads between Darius and Tiberius, 548 years,
counting four years in one Olympiad.</p>
<p>Then in the second year of Darius the 70th year from the destruction of the
Temple is completed, from which 64 Olympiads, or 256 years, are counted
backwards to the first Olympiad; the years are counted similarly backwards, from
the aforementioned year of the destruction of the temple to the 50th year of
Uzziah, King of the Jews, in whose reign Isaiah and Hosea lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, the first olympiad occurred in the age of Isaiah and the rest who
prophesied with him.</p>
<p>Again, if you proceed from the first Olympiad to earlier times and until the
capture of Troy, you will discover 406 years, which we both set out in an
earlier little work, and which the most careful history of the Greeks records.&nbsp;
Likewise according to the Hebrews from the aforementioned year of Uzziah and the
times of Isaiah the prophet, back until Samson and the third year of the Judge
Labdon, you will count 406 years.&nbsp; This however is the Samson, whom the
descendants of the Jews report was similar to Hercules in bodily strength, and
they seem to me to have not much time separating them, if indeed both lived
around the time of the capture of Troy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>After these again go back to earlier things, and, when you have completed 329
years going back, you will find Cecrops Diphyes of the Greeks, and Moses of the
Hebrews.&nbsp; For from the 45th year of Cecrops until the capture of Troy, and
from the 80th year of the age of Moses, in which he led the people of Israel
from Egypt, until Labdon and Samson, the judges, there are counted 329 years.</p>
<p>And so, without any ambiguity, Moses, and Cecrops who was the first king of
the Athenians, lived at the exact same time.</p>
<p>Again this is that Cecrops Diphyes the indigene, in whose reign the first
olive tree grew on the summit, and the city of the Athenians drew its name from
the name of Minerva.&nbsp; He first of all of them called upon Jupiter, and
discovers idols, set up an altar, burned sacrificial victims; never before had
such things been seen in this manner in Greece.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then other miraculous things, which are boasted about among the Greeks,
are indicated much later than the years of Cecrops;&nbsp; however if they are
later than Cecrops, they are consequently also later than Moses, who existed
with Cecrops.</p>
<p>For it was after him that it is written that there was the flood in the time
of Deucalion, the fire in the time of Phaethon, Erichthonius the son of
Hephaestus and Earth, Dardanus who founded Dardania: about whom Homer said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Whom Jupiter first fathered in the heavenly citadel; <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A></p>
</blockquote>
<p>also the abduction of Libera and Europa, the rites of Ceres and Isis, the
sanctuary in Eleusis, the corn of Triptolemus, the kingdom of Tros;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Of whom Ganymede was born, who, carried off to the stars,&nbsp;<br>
  The gods wished to pour out the wines of great Jupiter at their meals. <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this time also Tantalus and Tityus lived, and Apollo was born.&nbsp; For
Latona, consort of Jupiter, flees because of Tityus; however of Latona and
Jupiter Apollo is the son; and after these events Cadmus comes to Thebes,&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Who fathered Semele, from whom the most beautiful progeny,&nbsp;<br>
  Liber, emerged and brought a wholly deserving delight by his birth. <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Liber and the rest whom we will bring in next, lived 200 years after
the year of Cecrops; Linus certainly, and Zetus, amd Amphion, Musaeus, Orpheus,
Minos, Perseus, Aesculapius, the twin Castors, Hercules, with whom Apollo served
Admetus, after which the fall of the Trojan city happened: which Homer follows
after a long interval; but Homer is found to have lived long before Solon or
Thales of Miletus and the others who together with them have been called the
Seven Sages.</p>
<p>Then Pythagoras appeared, who wished it to be said that he was not a Sage, as
those earlier, but a philosopher, that is, a lover of wisdom; Socrates followed
him, who taught Plato; by whom philosophy was divided into its well-known
parts.&nbsp; We shall put each of these in their place according to the order of
the following history.</p>
<p>Therefore Moses preceded all those whom we have recorded above: for it has
been shown that he lived in the age of Cecrops.</p>
<p>However, returning to earlier events, from the 80th year of Moses and the
exodus of Israel from Egypt, until the first year of Abraham, you will find 505
years, which you will count similarly from the 45th year of Cecrops back to
Ninus and Semiramis, leaders of the Assyrians.&nbsp; Of course Ninus, son of
Belus, was the first to reign over all Asia, the Indies excepted.&nbsp; And so
it is clear that Abraham was born in the age of Ninus, at least according to the
figure the Hebrew account offers, which is shorter than the usual version.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you do not falter in carefulness and when you have diligently pored over the Divine Scripture, from the birth of Abraham back to the Flood of the whole earth, you will find 942 years,
and from the flood back to Adam, 2242, in which no completely Greek, or
barbarian or, to speak in general terms, gentile history is found.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is why the present little work traces the later years from Abraham and
Ninus down to our time; and starts by displaying Abraham of the Jews, Ninus and
Semiramis of the Assyrians, because at this time Athens was not a city, nor had
the kingdom of the Argives received its name, as the Sicyonians alone were
flourishing in Greece: they say that among them, in the days of Abraham and
Ninus, Europs was the second to have reigned.&nbsp; Why we too believe this will
be demonstrated in the following.</p>
<p>For if you diligently count out from the distant age of Ninus until the
capture of Troy, you will find 834 years: likewise in Sicyon from the 22nd year
of King Europs, until the aforementioned period, you will find those same 834
years: among the Hebrews also from the nativity of Abraham until Labdon and
Samson the Judges of the Hebrews, who led the people in the times of the
Trojans, you will equally count 834 years: likewise among the Egyptians from the
age of Ninus and Semiramis, in which time the 16th dynasty of Thebes was already
ruling over the Egyptians, until the 20th dynasty, and King Thuorin of Egypt,
who is called Polybus by Homer, in whose reign also Troy was captured, the
aforementioned 834 years are also computed: therefore, consequently, we place at
the head of our little book, at one and the same date, Abraham, Ninus, Europs,
and the Theban Egyptians: and as we said earlier, the text following
demonstrates that these things are so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now care must be taken to divide the years of the Hebrews into four periods
of time;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>from Abraham until Moses;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>from Moses until the first building of the Temple;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>from the first building of the Temple until its second rebuilding;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>and from its rebuilding until the coming of Christ the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, from the nativity of Abraham until Moses and the exodus of Israel
from Egypt, there are counted 505 years: from Moses down to Solomon and the
first building of the temple, 479 years, according, however, to the smaller
number which the third book of Kings contains, -- for according to the volume of
Judges 600 years are computed -- from Solomon however down to the restoration of
the temple, which happened under Darius, king of the Persians, 512 years are
counted: further, from Darius down to the preaching of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and down to the 15th year of Tiberius the first citizen of the Romans, 548 years
are completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so likewise 2044 years happen from Abraham until the 15th year of
Tiberius:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>similarly 505 years from Ninus and Semiramis until Moses and
    Cecrops;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>from Cecrops until the capture of Troy, 329 years;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>from the capture of Troy until the first olympiad, 406 years;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>from the first olympiad until the second year of Darius and the
    restoration of the temple, 256 years;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>from the second year of Darius and the restoration of the temple until the
    15th year of Tiberius Caesar, 548 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise there happen from Ninus and Semiramis until the 15th year of
Tiberius 2044 years, which we have also shown counted from Abraham until
Tiberius: from the 15th year of Tiberius, however, until the fourteenth year of
Valens,<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> in which he died, there are numbered 351
years. And so there are in all 2395 years of this history.</p>
<p>And, in case the long series of numbers should perhaps cause some confusion,
we have separated the whole mass of years into decades, which, gathering
together out of the histories of the individual nations in turn, we have placed
opposite each other, so as to provide a simple method of discovering in which
era, Greek or barbarian, the prophets, kings, and priests of the Hebrews
existed, likewise when falsely-believed gods of various nations existed, when
demi-gods, when any city was founded, concerning illustrious men, when
philosophers, poets, princes, and writers of various works appeared, and any
other ancient event, if it was thought deserving of recording. All of which we
shall put in their proper places with the greatest brevity.</p>
