<h2 id='tocuniq3'>Prologue</h2>

There have been very few days since I translated Paul's letter to Philemon and moved on to the Galatians, with many passages in between left unaddressed; and behold, suddenly letters have been brought to me from the City, announcing the return of the venerable old lady Albina in the presence of the Lord, and the abandonment of holy Marcella, my mother, by her companionship. Now I, Paula and Eustochium, beg for your consolation even more. And since this cannot be done for the time being, due to the vast distances of both sea and land, I wish to at least heal my wound by the medicine of the Scriptures. Indeed, I know his passion, I know the faith that he always holds in his heart like a flame, surpassing his gender, forgetting his own humanity, and crossing the red seas of divine works with resounding music. Certainly when I was in Rome, he never saw me in such a hurry that he did not ask about the Scriptures. And yet, he did not consider whatever answer I gave to be correct in the Pythagorean way: nor did my authority hold any value with her without prior reasoning. Rather, she examined everything and weighed all things with a discerning mind, so that I felt that I had not so much a disciple as a judge. And so, what is pleasing to them, who are absent, and useful for you, who are present, I think I will undertake the previously unattempted task, before our own writers on the Latin language, and few Greeks themselves, as the dignity of the matter demanded. Not that I am unaware of Gaius Marius Victorinus, who, when I was a boy, taught rhetoric in Rome and wrote Commentaries on the Apostle; but because he, occupied with the learning of secular literature, entirely ignored the holy Scriptures: and no one can argue well about him, however eloquent, if he is ignorant. What then, am I foolish or rash, who promise what he could not? By no means. Rather, I am more cautious and timid, as it seems to me, because I am aware of the weakness of my own strength. I have followed the Commentaries of Origen, for that man wrote five volumes specifically on the Epistle of Paul to the Galatians, and he completed the tenth book of his Stromateis with a detailed explanation of his discourse. He also composed various treatises and excerpts, which alone could be sufficient. I pass over Didymus, my seer, and Laodicean (Apollinarius) who recently left the Church, and the old heretic Alexander, as well as Eusebius of Emesa, and Theodore of Heraclea, who have also left some comments on this matter. If I were to take even a few things from them, something would be produced that would not be entirely contemptible. Therefore, to confess frankly, I have read all of these things, and in my mind, I have collected many things, summoning a notary, either my own or someone else's, I dictated, not always retaining the order or wording or even the memory of the meanings. Now the only mercy of the Lord is that through our ignorance, good words spoken by others may not perish and not please among strangers, which please among their own. Therefore, summarizing the argument of this Epistle briefly, I remind you with this preface that you may know that the same is the subject matter of the Epistle to the Galatians and the one written to the Romans. But it differs between the two in that in the former, he used a higher sense and deeper arguments, whereas here, writing to those about whom he says in the following, 'O foolish Galatians' and 'So foolish are you,' he moderated his speech in such a way that he rather rebukes than teaches, and he clothed common opinions in common speech, and he recalled those whom reason could not persuade by his authority. Indeed, there is not a single discourse of the Apostles, either through Epistle or in person, in which they do not labor to teach that the burdens of the old Law have been laid aside, and all those things which preceded in types and images, that is, the rest of the Sabbath, the injury of circumcision, the recurrence of the Kalends and the three annual solemnities, the scrupulousness of foods, and the daily washings that must be defiled again, the grace of the Gospel suddenly ceased, which is fulfilled not by the blood of victims, but by the faith of the believing soul. But elsewhere on the other hand, and as it had presented itself to someone else, this question was discussed and almost resolved. However, in these two letters, as I said, there is specifically the cessation of the old law and the introduction of the new. But this is specific to the Galatians, because he does not write to those who had believed in Christ from the Jews and thought that the paternal ceremonies should be observed, but to those who had received the faith of the Gospel from the Gentiles and had again lapsed, some of whom were deterred by authority, asserting that Peter, James, and all the churches of Judaea had mixed the Gospel of Christ with the old law. Moreover, Paul did one thing in Judea and another among the nations: and they would believe in the Crucified One in vain, if they thought that what the leaders of the Apostles observed was to be disregarded. Therefore, he proceeds cautiously, neither betraying the grace of the Gospel, weighed down by the authority of the elders, nor doing injustice to his predecessors, while being an advocate of grace. But he walks indirectly and, as it were, secretly through tunnels, in order to teach Peter also to perform circumcision for the people committed to him, lest departing suddenly from the ancient way of life, they would not believe in the cross, and entrusted with the preaching of the Gentiles, it would be fair to defend what was shown to be true, while pretending on the other hand for the sake of dispensation. Not understanding at all, the citizens of Bata and that wicked Porphyrius, in the first book of his work against us, accused Peter of Paul of being reprehensible because he did not walk uprightly to proclaim the Gospel: desiring to tarnish him with the stain of error and to accuse him of audacity and of spreading a false doctrine in general, while the leaders of the Churches themselves disagree. We happen to come across these things lightly, and we will explain them more fully in their proper places. But now it is time, as we set forth the words of the Apostle himself, to expound each and every thing.

First Book

<h2 id='tocuniq5'>(Chap. I.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 1, Verse 1) 373 Paul the apostle, not from men, nor through man: but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead. He does not claim to be an apostle out of pride, as some may think, but out of necessity. He did not receive his apostleship from men or through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father. This is to confound those who were questioning Paul's legitimacy as an apostle outside of the twelve, claiming he was either self-appointed or ordained by higher authorities, with this authority. However, it is possible to interpret the statement as directed both directly at Peter and to the others, that the Gospel was not handed down to him by the apostles, but by Jesus Christ himself, who had also chosen those apostles. This is all prepared in order that no one who disputes the burdens of the Law for the sake of the Gospel can oppose himself: but Peter said this, but the apostles established this, but your predecessors decreed something else. Indeed, he makes this clearer in the following passages, now alluding, as it were, to a hidden message; he refers nothing to himself, who appear to be something, but claims to have resisted Peter to his face, saying that he was not compelled by any necessity to yield to the hypocrisy of the Jews. But if it seems rash to some that he spoke against the apostles, although secretly, who had gone to Jerusalem in order to confer the Gospel with them, lest perhaps he had run or would have run in vain, let us transfer the understanding to that: Even until today the apostles are sent by the patriarchs of the Jews, from whom I believe that even then the Galatians who had been corrupted began to observe the Law, or at least others from the Jews who believed in Christ had gone to Galatia, who asserted that Peter, the prince of the apostles, and James, the brother of the Lord, also observed the ceremonies of the Law. Therefore, to distinguish those who are sent by men from themselves, and those who are sent by Christ, Paul, the apostle, took this introduction: Paul, an apostle, not from men, nor through man. Apostle, however, is a Hebrew word, which properly means 'sent', and Silas (also known as Silai) is said to have the same meaning, to whom the name 'sent' was given because he was sent. The Hebrews say that among themselves there are also some who are both prophets and apostles, and others who are only prophets. Finally, Moses, to whom it is said: 'and I will send you to Pharaoh' (Exodus 3:10, 11); and he responds: 'provide someone else whom you will send.' And Isaiah, to whom God speaks: 'Whom shall I send, and who will go for us to this people' (Isaiah 6:8)? They are also considered apostles and prophets. Therefore, we can understand that John the Baptist is also called a prophet and apostle, since Scripture says: 'There was a man sent from God, whose name was John' (John 1:6). And in the Epistle to the Hebrews (Heb. III), Paul introduced neither his own name nor the title of apostle, for he was going to speak about Christ: Therefore, having a high priest and the apostle of our confession, Jesus; it was not appropriate for Paul to be called an apostle where Christ was to be called an apostle. Now there are four kinds of apostles. The first kind is not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father; the second kind is indeed from God but through man; the third kind is from man, not from God; and the fourth kind is neither from God, nor through man, nor from man, but from himself. The first kind can be Isaiah, and the other prophets, and even the apostle Paul, who was not sent by man, or through man, but by God the Father and Christ. The second kind is Joshua son of Nun, who indeed was appointed an apostle by God, but through man, Moses. The third kind is when someone is ordained by the favor and zeal of men. As we see now, many are being promoted to the priesthood not by the judgment of God, but by the favor of the crowd and their own redemption. The fourth [sign] is of false prophets and false apostles, about whom the Apostle says: 'Such pseudo-apostles, workers of iniquity, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ, who say: Thus says the Lord: and the Lord did not send them' (2 Corinthians 10:13). But the Apostle Paul is not like this, who was sent not by men, nor through a man, but by God the Father through Jesus Christ. From this it is proven that the heresies of Ebion and Photinus must also be refuted, because our Lord Jesus Christ is God. While the Apostle, being sent by Christ to preach the Gospel, denies that he was sent by a man. In this place, other heresies creep in, claiming that Christ's flesh is merely imaginary and saying that Christ is God, not man. There is also a new heresy that asserts a divided dispensation of Christ. And so, amidst the shipwrecks of so many false dogmas, if one confesses that Christ is a man, Ebion and Photinus arise; if one contends that he is God, Manichaeus and Marcion, the authors of a new doctrine, bubble forth. And in the community they hear that Christ is both God and man. Not that there is another God, and another man: but the one who has always been God, has deigned to become man for our salvation. It is also to be known that in the Apostle Marcion it is not written that Christ was explained by God the Father, but rather raised up by himself, as it is said: Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up (John 2:19). And elsewhere: No one takes my life from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. (Ibid., X, 18).

<h2 id='tocuniq6'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Vers. 2.) And all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia. In other letters, Sosthenes and Silvanus, and sometimes Timothy, are mentioned at the beginning. In this letter only, because the authority of many was necessary, the name of all the brothers is assumed. They themselves perhaps were also from the circumcision and were not considered contemptible by the Galatians. For it greatly contributes to correcting the people, that there is agreement and consensus of many in one matter. But when he says, 'To the Churches of Galatia;' and this is to be noted, that here he writes generally not to one Church of one city, but to the Churches of the whole province, and calls them Churches, which afterwards he charges with being corrupted by error. From which it is to be understood that the term Church can be used in two ways: one, when it has no spot or wrinkle and is truly the body of Christ; the other, when it is gathered in the name of Christ without full and perfect virtues (Eph. 5). How the wise are called in two ways, both those who are full of perfect virtue, and those who are beginning and are in progress. It is said of the perfect: I will send wise men to you (Luke 11:49). Of the foolish: Reprove a wise man, and he will love you (Proverbs 8:9). For he who is full and complete in virtue does not need correction. According to this same meaning, it is to be understood of the other virtues as well: namely, that the brave and prudent, pious, chaste, just, and temperate are sometimes understood fully, sometimes in an exaggerated manner.


<h2 id='tocuniq7'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Unlike in the other Epistles, he does not mention the grace of God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ and peace, through which we have been granted forgiveness of sins and original peace after pardon. But now he skillfully argues against those who had been prevented by the Law and thought they could be justified by their works, so that they would know they should continue in the grace that they had begun.


<h2 id='tocuniq8'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4) He who gave himself for our sins, to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of God and our Father, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen. Neither did the Son give himself for our sins without the will of the Father, nor did the Father deliver the Son without the Son's will; but this is the will of the Son, to fulfill the will of the Father, as he himself says in the psalm: 'To do your will, O God, I desired' (Psalm 40:9). But the Son gave Himself, so that He Himself would overturn the injustice that was in us with justice. He surrendered Himself with wisdom, so that He would overcome foolishness. Holiness and strength offered themselves, so that they would erase impurity and weakness. And thus, not only in the future age according to the promised hope in which we believe, but also here in the present age, He has freed us: while we die with Christ, we are transformed into a new way of thinking, and we are not of this world, from which we are rightly not loved. It is asked how the present age is called evil. For heretics often take hold of opportunities from this, asserting one creator of light and the future age, another of darkness and the present age. But we say that it is not so much the age itself, which runs day and night, years and months, that is called evil, but rather the things that happen in the age: how it is said to be sufficient for its day of evil (Matthew 6) and how the days of Jacob are described as few and evil (Genesis 47). Not that the period of time in which Jacob lived was bad, but that the trials he endured tested him in various ways. For example, during the time when he served for his wives and faced many hardships (Gen. XXIX), Esau was at rest, and thus the same period of time was good for some and bad for others; and it would not be written in Ecclesiastes: 'Do not say that my earlier days were better than these' (Eccles. VII, 11), unless it were to distinguish the bad. Where John says: The whole world is set in evil (1 John 5:19). Not that the world itself is evil, but that evil things happen in the world because of humans. Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die (Isaiah 22:17). And the Apostle himself says: Redeeming the time, for the days are evil (Ephesians 5:16). Even the woods are defiled when they are full of robbers, not because the land and forests sin, but because they also attract the infamy of murder. We detest both the sword, with which human blood has been shed, and the cup in which poison has been mixed, not the swords and cups themselves, nor the sins of the sword and cup, but rather those who have misused them. Thus, the world, which is a span of time, is neither inherently good nor evil, but is called good or evil by those who inhabit it. Therefore, the delusions and stories of Valentinus, who invented thirty ages based on the fact that ages are mentioned in the Scriptures, are to be scorned. He claimed that these ages were animals, and that through squares and octads, decades and duodecads, he produced as many as the Aeneian sow gave birth to piglets. Also to be investigated is what the difference is between saeculum, and saeculum saeculi, or saecula saeculorum, and where it is placed for a brief span of time, where it is placed for eternity: because in Hebrew saeculum, that is Olam, where the letter Vav is added, signifies eternity, but when it is written without the Vav it signifies the fiftieth year, which they call Jubilee. For this reason, that Hebrew who, because of his wife and children, loving his Lord, has his ear pierced and becomes a servant, is commanded to serve forever (Exod. XXI), that is, until the fiftieth year. Both the Moabites and the Ammonites (Deuteronomy XXIII) do not enter the Church of the Lord, up to the fifteenth generation and until eternity: because every hard condition was solved by the coming of the Jubilee. Some say that it has the same meaning in the ages of ages as in the Holy of Holies, in the heavens of heavens, in the works of works, in the Songs of Songs: and they have the same difference as the heavens have to those to whom they belong, and the holy things, which are holier in comparison to the holy ones, and the works, which are better by the preference of the works, and the Songs, which excel among all the Songs: to have the same eternity as the ages of ages by the comparison of the ages. Therefore, they date this present age in such a way that they say it should be counted from the time when heaven and earth were created and will continue until the end of the world, when Christ will judge all things. They also look back even further, and in the year 380, they advance to earlier times, debating about past and future ages, whether they were good or bad, or will be. And they delve into such deep questions that they have even written books and countless volumes on this subject. But as for the prologue of Paul, Amen, which concludes in the Hebrew language: Amen (), the Seventy translated it as γένοιτο, that is, let it be done: Aquila translates it as πεπιστωμένος, truly, or faithfully. This is also always used in the Gospel by the Savior, confirming his words with Amen.

<h2 id='tocuniq9'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) I wonder that you are so quickly transferred from him who called you into the grace of Christ Jesus, to another gospel which is not another, except that there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. We read the word 'translation' for the first time in Genesis (Gen. 5), where God translated Enoch, and he was not found. And in the books of the Kings afterwards (3 Kings 21), when Ahab transferred from the worship of God to the worship of idols, his wife Jezebel, to do according to all that the Amorites did, whom the Lord destroyed from the face of the children of Israel. But since both translations exist, one is from God, the other from the devil. Whoever is translated by God is not found by his enemies: nor can the assailant creep up on him. For I consider this to signify, and it is not found. But whoever is translated by the devil, in that is translated what appears to be, but is not. The wise of this world also call those who are transferred from one belief to another, transferred, as Dionysius (whose belief was that pain is not evil: after being burdened by misfortunes and tortured by pain, he began to affirm that pain is the greatest of all evils) was called Transposed, or Translated, because, departing from his previous belief, he fell into the opposite. Therefore, Paul is amazed: first, because they have been transferred from the freedom of the Gospel to the servitude of the law. Then, because they have been transferred so quickly: for it is not easily the case that someone else's guilt is transferred, and transferred quickly; just as in martyrdom, the same punishment is not inflicted on someone who immediately leaped to denial without struggle and torment, and on someone who, being twisted among the stakes, cords, and fires, was compelled to deny what he believed. The preaching of the Gospel had recently taken place, not a long time ago, in the midst of which the Apostle had led the Galatians from idols to Christ. So he marvels at how quickly they have turned away from Him, to whom they had recently become Christians. The place itself also has a superabundance, which can be read in its own order. I wonder that you are so quickly being transferred from Christ Jesus, who called you into grace, saying: 'I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance' (Mark 2:17). For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God (Ephesians 2:8). But he says, 'You have been transferred to another gospel, which is not another; for there is no other that is false, it does not exist, such as this: 'Do not give your scepter, O Lord, to those who are not' (Esther 14:12). And God called things that were not, to make what was not. But if this is said about those who believed in the same God and possessed the same Scriptures, that they were transferred to another gospel, which is not a gospel, what should we think about Marcion and other heretics, who reject the Creator and pretend to be followers of another God, Christ? Those who do not adhere to the interpretation of the law and letters, or the battle between flesh and spirit, fall and decay, but they contradict the entire right of the Church. But he rightly says: If there are any who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. They want, he says, to change, pervert, and trouble the gospel of Christ, but they are not able. Because it is the nature of this, that it cannot be anything other than what is true. Anyone who interprets the gospel with a different spirit and mind than what is written, disturbs believers and perverts the gospel of Christ, making what is seen in front of them be behind them, and turning what is behind them to be in front of them. If someone follows just the letter, they place the later things in front. If someone acquiesces to Jewish interpretations, they send behind those things which by their nature are set in front. Moreover, it is fitting that the word translation is fit to the Galatians: for Galatia in our language means translation.

<h2 id='tocuniq10'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. This can also be understood in a hyperbolic sense, not that either an apostle or an angel could preach differently from what they had once said: but even if it were possible for both apostles and angels to change, one should not deviate from what was once accepted, especially since the apostle himself shows the steadfastness of his faith in another place, saying: I know that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord (Romans 8:38). I tell the truth, I do not lie, my conscience bearing me witness (Rom. IX, 1). Indeed, these words are not his who can ever depart from Christ and love. However, those who do not want this statement to be according to assumption, but truly, that is, that even apostles and angels can turn to worse things, oppose that which Paul himself knew he could stumble, if he acted less diligently, saying: But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest, when I have preached to others, I myself should become disqualified (I Cor. IX, 27). Angels also can change, those who have not kept their own principality; but leaving their proper dwelling, they are reserved under eternal chains in the darkness for the judgment of the great day (Jude, 6). || Only the nature of God is immutable, about which it is written: But You are the same (Ps. 102, 28). And He Himself about Himself: I am your God, and I do not change (Malachi 3, 6). Lucifer has fallen, who used to rise in the morning; and the one who once sent him to all nations, has been crushed on the earth. In this place, the very learned Tertullian elegantly writes against Apelles and his virgin Philumena, whom a certain angel, a diabolical and perverse spirit, had possessed. He states that this angel, to whom the Holy Spirit had pronounced a curse through the prophecy of the Apostle long before Apelles was born, is to be considered anathema. Now, the word 'anathema' is properly a Jewish term, and it is used in both the book of Joshua (Joshua 6:7) and in Numbers (Numbers 21), when the Lord commanded that all things in Jericho and the detestable things of the Midianites should be devoted to destruction and anathema. Let us question those who assert that Christ and the Apostle Paul, beloved of God and until that time unknown, are either the Son or the servant who does not know how to curse nor to condemn anyone: how does their Apostle, by the word of the Jews, that is, the Creator, use it now: and will he want to destroy either an angel or an apostle, since he himself is not accustomed to take revenge. But what he added, as we have said before, and now I say again, shows that he warned, even from the beginning, anathema to those who would preach otherwise, and now that it has been preached, he proclaims anathema what he had foretold. Therefore, they accused him of doing one thing in Judea and teaching another, and they declared an anathema on the angel whom it was well known to be greater even than his predecessors, the apostles Peter and John, so that their authority may not be considered great, since it was not allowed for him who had taught them before or for the angel to teach differently than what they had learned once. Therefore, he specifically mentioned himself and the angel by name; but the others he referred to without a name. If someone, he said, were to preach the gospel to you, in a general sense, he would not be doing wrong to his predecessors; and yet he would secretly reveal their names.

<h2 id='tocuniq11'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10) For do I now persuade men or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I still pleased men, I would not be a servant of Christ. Let us not think that we are taught by the Apostle to despise the judgments of men, who in another place has said: Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, but we are made manifest to God. (II Cor. 5:11); and that: Be without offense to the Jews, and to the Gentiles, and to the Church of God: even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking that which is profitable to myself, but to many, that they may be saved. (I Cor. 10). But if it is possible, to please God and humans equally, it is necessary to please humans. But if we do not please humans in any other way, unless we displease God: we ought to please God more than humans. Otherwise, it also follows why he pleases everyone in every way: not seeking what is useful to himself, but what is useful to many, for their salvation. However, whoever pleases everyone for the sake of that charity which seeks not its own, but what belongs to others, for their salvation: certainly pleases God first, to whom the salvation of humans is a concern. However, there is also a word, which is specifically added here, either to be pleasing for a time to people, or to be displeasing: so that he who is currently not pleasing because of the truth of the Gospel, may have pleased at some time for the salvation of many. Paul had pleased the Jews at one time, when he was a zealous follower of ancestral traditions, having lived blamelessly under the law, and he had such fervor and faith in the customs of the ancestors that he became a participant in the killing of Stephen, and went to Damascus to arrest those who were deserting the law (Acts 9). But after he was transferred to the vessel of election from being a persecutor, and began to preach the faith which he had once attacked, he began to displease the Jews, whom he had pleased before. This, therefore, is what he says: Do I seek to please the Jews, whom by displeasing, I pleased God? For if I were pleasing to them, I would not yet be a servant of Christ. For I would assert the law and destroy the grace of the Gospel. But now I am not even led to simulate the observance of the law: because I cannot both please God and the Jews at the same time. For whoever tries to convince others of what he himself has and has imbibed once, even attempts to insert it into others. And it is read in many places in the Scriptures, from which this comes: Persuasion is not from the one who calls you (Gal. 5:8). Also in the Acts of the Apostles: Therefore, many Jews came to him as guests, to whom he explained and testified about the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, from the Law of Moses and the Prophets, until evening. But all of this was done secretly, because it had been spread ((or defamed)) about him that he was secretly observing the Law, and had mingled with those in Jerusalem who followed Jewish customs.

<h2 id='tocuniq12'>(Vers. 11, 12.)</h2>

(Vers. 11, 12.) For I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not according to man. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. From this place the doctrine of the Ebionites and Photinus is refuted: that Christ is God and not only man. For if the gospel of Paul is not according to man, nor did he receive it from man or learn it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ; then Jesus Christ, who revealed the gospel to Paul, is certainly not a mere man. But if there is no man, consequently there is God. Not that we deny the assumption of man; but only that we reject a mere man. It is questioned whether the whole Church of God has received the Gospel, or a man: for how many of us have learned through the revelation of Christ, and not by the preaching of man? To which we will respond, those who can say: Do you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me (2 Corinthians 13:3)? And I no longer live, but Christ lives in me (Gal. II, 20), not so much to teach them as to have God speak in them, saying, 'I said, you are gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High' (Ps. LXXXI, 6); and immediately concerning sinners: 'But you shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.' Therefore, when Paul and Peter, who do not die like men nor fall like one of the princes, speak of them as gods, it is clear. But those who are gods, impart the Gospel of God, not of man. Marcion and Basilides and the other pests of heretics do not have the Gospel of God; because they do not have the Holy Spirit, without which the human Gospel is made, which is taught. Nor can we consider the Gospel to be in the words of the Scriptures, but in the meaning: not on the surface, but in the core; not in the leaves of words, but in the root of reason. It is said in the prophet about God: His words are good with him (Micah 2:7). Then the Scripture is useful to the listeners, since it is not spoken without Christ, since it is not professed without the Father, since it is not revealed without the Spirit by the one who preaches it. Otherwise, both the devil who speaks about the Scriptures and all heresies, according to Ezekiel (Chapter 13), make for themselves pillows, which they place under the elbow of every age. I myself, who am speaking, if I have Christ in me, I do not have the Gospel of man; but if I am a sinner, it is said to me: God said to the sinner: Why do you recount my justifications and take my covenant in your lips? But you have despised discipline and cast my words behind you (Ps. 49:16-17), and the rest that follow. There is great danger in speaking in the Church, lest by a perverse interpretation, the Gospel of Christ may become the gospel of man: or worse, of the devil. But there is a difference between receiving and learning, in that one receives the Gospel to whom it is first presented and is led to believe what is written. But he learns, who understands the things that are represented in it by enigmas and parables, when they are explained and discussed: and he understands, not by human revelation but by Christ, who revealed to Paul, or through Paul, in whom Christ speaks. The word itself, ἀποκαλύψεως, that is, revelation, is properly of the Scriptures, and was not used by any wise person among the Greeks. Hence, it seems to me that, just as in other words, which the Seventy translators translated from Hebrew to Greek, they greatly endeavored in this case as well to express the nature of a foreign language, inventing new words for new things: and to sound when something hidden and veiled is revealed and brought forth into the light. To make this clearer, take the example of Moses. When he spoke with God, his face was revealed and uncovered (Exodus XXXIII, XXXIV); that is, without a veil. But when he spoke to the people, they couldn't look at his face, so he put a veil on (Numbers IV). There was also a veil covering the Ark of the Covenant. When that veil was removed, the things that were hidden before were revealed; or, to use the correct word, they were unveiled. So if those who are accustomed to reading the eloquent writers of the age begin to mock us for our novelty and lowliness of speech, let us send them to the books of Cicero, which are dedicated to the questions of philosophy; and let them see with what necessity he is compelled to produce such monstrous words, which the ears of no Latin man have ever heard: and this while he is translating from Greek, which is a neighboring language. What do those endure who attempt to express the peculiarities of the Hebrew difficulties? And yet there are much fewer things in such great volumes of Scriptures that sound of novelty than those things which he has gathered in a small work. However, as we said in the beginning, when we were explaining: Paul the apostle is not from men, nor through man: so also in this present place it is indirectly accepted in Peter, and in his other predecessors: that it is moved by no one's Law and authority, who has Christ alone as the teacher of the Gospel. Furthermore, it signifies that revelation when, going to Damascus, he deserved to hear the voice of Christ on the way, and with blinded eyes, he beheld the true light of the world.

<h2 id='tocuniq13'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it. And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. This account is very beneficial to the Galatians, as it tells them how Paul, once a destroyer of the church and a fierce defender of Judaism, suddenly converted to the faith of Christ. And this was the time when the crucifixion was first announced in the world; when the new doctrine was being expelled from the boundaries of both the Gentiles and the Jews. For they could say: If he who was trained in the disciplines of the Pharisees from a young age, who surpassed all his contemporaries in Jewish tradition, now defends the Church, which he once fiercely persecuted; and he desires more the grace and novelty of Christ with the envy of all, than the antiquity of the Law with the praise of many: what should we do, who have begun to be Christians from Gentile origins? He added beautifully: Above all, I pursued the Church of God intensely, so that admiration would also arise from here, that not just anyone who lightly persecuted the Church, but the one who overcame others in persecution, converted to the faith. And wisely, while recounting something else, he inserts that he served not so much God's Law as the traditions of the fathers, that is, the traditions of the Pharisees; who teach the doctrines and commandments of men (Matt. XV; Mark VII); and reject God's Law, in order to establish their own traditions. However, what a beautiful observation and weight of words: 'You have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it.' I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers. But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being. He said, 'Not the Church of Christ, as he thought at that time (or was thought): whom he regarded with contempt, whom he persecuted: but now he believes in the Church of God: either signifying that Christ himself is God, or that the Church belongs to the same God who was once the giver of the Law. And he says, 'I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my own age: being a more zealous follower of my ancestral traditions. Again, he calls it progress not of the Law of God, but of Judaism.' Not above all, but above many; not above the old, but above his peers, so that he might reflect his study in the Law and avoid boastfulness. But he recounted the traditions of the fathers, not mentioning the Lord's commands, and proclaimed himself a Pharisee among Pharisees, having zeal for God but not according to knowledge. Even to this day, those who interpret the Scriptures in a Jewish sense persecute the Church of Christ and plunder it, corrupted by human traditions rather than the study of God's Law.


<h2 id='tocuniq14'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) But when it pleased Him who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained with him fifteen days. But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s brother. (Now concerning the things which I write to you, indeed, before God, I do not lie.) Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ. But they were hearing only, “He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once tried to destroy.” And they glorified God in me. (Galatians 1:15-24) David sings against sinners: Behold, I was conceived in iniquities: and in sins did my mother conceive me (Ps. 50:7). And in another place: The wicked are alienated from the womb (Ps. 57:4). And on both sides, before the babies were born: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated (Mal. 1:1-2). Heretics find a place, who pretend that there are different natures, namely spiritual, animal, and earthly, and that one is saved, another perishes, and another exists in between the two, so that neither the just would be chosen before doing anything good, nor the sinner hated before committing a sin, unless the nature of those perishing and those being saved were different. To which it can simply be answered that this happens from God's foreknowledge, that the one whom He knows will be just, He loves before he is born from the womb; and the one whom He knows will be a sinner, He hates before he sins. Not because there is injustice in God's love and hate, but because He should not have them any other way, knowing as He does that they will be either sinners or just. We as human beings can only judge based on what is present, while He who has already made the future happen can pass judgment on the end of things, not on their beginnings. And these things have been said quite simply: and without further discussion, they can please the reader in some way. However, those who try to assert that God is unjust, are alienated sinners from birth, they also bring forth the rest that follows: They have gone astray from the womb, they have spoken falsehoods. And they say, how have sinners gone astray from the womb right away, and spoken falsehoods, who could neither have speech nor understanding? But what is this justice of God's foreknowledge, to love and protect one person before they are born, and to detest another? And the causes of this matter relate to a previous life, because each individual is immediately assigned to good or evil angels from their very first birth, according to their merit. And that whole passage about Jacob and Esau, which we have just mentioned, is so debated among the Romans (Rom. IX), that it cannot be answered without sweat and Chrysippus' hellebore. But it is not the case that he reveals his Son in me, as if he were saying, to reveal his Son to me. For to whom something is revealed, to him that can be revealed, which was not before in him. But in that in which it is revealed, that is revealed which was previously in him, and afterward revealed. It is similar to that in the Gospel: There stands among you, whom you do not know (John 1:26). And elsewhere: There was the true light, which enlightens every man coming into the world (Ibid., 9). From which it becomes clear that nature contains in itself the knowledge of God for everyone, and no one is born without Christ, and does not have within them the seeds of wisdom, righteousness, and other virtues. Therefore, many without faith and the Gospel of Christ, either wisely or piously do some things, such as obeying their parents, helping the needy, not oppressing their neighbors, not stealing from others, and in doing so, they become more accountable to the judgment of God, because they have within them the principles of virtue and the seeds of God, but they do not believe in Him without whom they cannot exist. It can also be understood in Paul, the Son of God revealed, that, by his preaching, he was recognized by the Gentiles, whom they previously did not know.

<h2 id='tocuniq15'>(Vers. 16)</h2>

(Verse 16) Immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood. Or, as it is better in Greek: I did not consult with flesh and blood. I know that most people interpret this statement as referring to the apostles. For Porphyry also objects that after the revelation of Christ, he did not deign to go to men and confer with them: so that after the teaching of God, he would not be instructed by flesh and blood. But perish the thought that I, Peter, John, and James consider flesh and blood as possessing the kingdom of God (I Cor. I). If the apostles were spiritual, flesh and blood, what do we think about the earthly ones? Paul clearly did not share after the revelation of Christ with flesh and blood, because he did not want to throw pearls before swine, nor give what is holy to dogs (Matthew 7). See what is written about sinners: My spirit will not remain in these people, because they are flesh (Genesis 6). With those who were flesh and blood, and did not reveal to Peter the Son of God (Matthew 16), the Apostle did not share the Gospel which had been revealed to him, but gradually turned them from flesh and blood into spirit: and only then did he entrust them with the hidden sacraments of the Gospel. Let someone say: If he did not immediately bring together with flesh and blood the Gospel, nevertheless it is understood that he brought it together with flesh and blood afterwards; and this sense, by which the apostles are excused, cannot stand, lest they be flesh and blood, while nevertheless he who did not bring it together with flesh and blood in the beginning, afterwards, as I said, brought it together with flesh and blood. This preposition confines us, so that we may distinguish in this way, lest we immediately or continuously join flesh and blood; but that we may hold fast to the preceding (words), and let it be read: But when it pleased him who separated me from my mother's womb. And then, in order to reveal his Son in me. And finally, in order to preach him among the Gentiles immediately: that he may begin from his own beginning: I did not confer with flesh and blood; rather, it should be understood that he who was immediately sent, after the revelation of Christ, proclaimed the Gospel to the Gentiles, did not delay: nor did he spend time going to the apostles and discussing the revelation of the Lord with men: but he went to Arabia, and then returned to Damascus, and after three years, preached the Gospel: and only then, coming to Jerusalem, did he see Peter, John, and James.


<h2 id='tocuniq16'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) Nor did I come to Jerusalem to the predecessors of my apostles. If he had spoken about the apostles, I did not consult with flesh and blood, so why was it necessary to repeat the same thing by saying: Nor did I come to Jerusalem to the predecessors of my apostles? Therefore, the same meaning must be held, which we explained above.

But I went to Arabia, and then returned to Damascus. The order of the story does not seem to agree, as Luke reports in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 9), that when Paul spoke boldly the Gospel of Damascus after his faith in Christ for many days, plots were made against him, and he was let down in a basket through the wall at night, and he came to Jerusalem trying to join the disciples. But when they avoided him and were afraid to approach him, Barnabas brought him to the apostles and there he told them how he saw the Lord on the way, and how he boldly acted in the name of the Lord (some manuscripts add Jesus) in Damascus. He was, he says, with them, going in and out in Jerusalem, boldly acting in the name of the Lord. He also spoke and argued with the Greeks: but they sought to kill him. When the brothers learned of this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus. But he says that he first went to Arabia, and then returned to Damascus after three years, and went to Jerusalem, saw Peter, and stayed with him for fifteen days, and he did not meet anyone else except James, the brother of the Lord. In order for these things to be believed as true (for they could be doubtful in the absence of witnesses), he confirms under oath, saying: 'The things which I say to you, behold, I say in the presence of God, that I do not lie.' Therefore, we can understand that indeed Paul, according to Luke's history, went to Jerusalem not to learn anything from the apostles who came before him, but to avoid the onslaught of persecution that had been stirred up against him in Damascus for the sake of the Gospel of Christ. And thus he came to Jerusalem as if to any other city. Then, immediately after having withdrawn on account of the treachery and having come to Arabia, whether Damascus: and then after three years having returned to see Peter at Jerusalem. Or certainly in this way: Immediately after being baptized, and having been strengthened by receiving food, he was with the disciples who were in Damascus for a few days: and to the amazement of all in the synagogues of the Jews, he preached continuously that Jesus was the Son of God; and then he went to Arabia, and returned from Arabia to Damascus, and he stayed there for three years: which many days the Scripture testifies, saying: But when many days had passed, the Jews made a plot to kill him (Acts 9:23). However, their plots were made known to Saul; and they were guarding the gates day and night in order to kill him. So his disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket. And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples. But they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple. However, Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus. And this should not be attributed to the Apostle's laziness, if he had been in Arabia in vain (or had remained there): but because there was some dispensation and commandment of God for him to be silent. For we also read that Paul, when he went out with Sila, was forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia (Acts 16). In another place: But I went into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus. What benefit is this to me, if I read that Paul immediately went to Arabia after the revelation of Christ, and immediately returned from Arabia to Damascus, and I do not know what he did there, or what benefit his going and returning had? Give me an opportunity for a deeper understanding in this same Epistle, when the Apostle himself, speaking about Abraham, Hagar, and Sarah, says: 'Which things are an allegory.' For these are the two Testaments: one indeed from Mount Sinai, generating into servitude, which is Hagar. For Mount Sinai is in Arabia, which corresponds to the present Jerusalem (Gal. IV, 24, 25). And it teaches the Old Testament, that is, the son of the bondwoman, who was placed in Arabia (which is interpreted as humble and downward). Immediately, therefore, as Paul believed, he turned to the Law, the Prophets, and the sacraments of the old Testament already placed in the west, seeking in them Christ, whom he had been commanded to preach to the Gentiles. And when he found him, he did not stay there any longer; but he returned to Damascus, that is, to the blood and passion of Christ. And strengthened by the prophetic reading, he went to Jerusalem, the place of vision and peace: not so much to learn something from the apostles, as to confer with them about the Gospel that he had taught.


<h2 id='tocuniq17'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) Then after three years, I came to Jerusalem to see Peter. Not to behold his eyes, cheeks, and countenance, whether he was thin or fat, whether he had a hooked or straight nose, and whether he wore his forehead covered with hair or (as Clement relates in his Periods) had baldness on his head. I do not think it was of Apostolic gravity that he wanted to see anything human in Peter after such a preparation of three years. But he looked at him with these eyes, with which he seems to see him now in his Epistles. With his own eyes Paul saw Cephas, whom now by the wise and by all Paul himself is seen. And if anyone does not see, let them connect all these things with the higher sense: that the apostles conferred nothing to themselves. For even the reason why he was commanded to go to Jerusalem, to see the apostle, was not for the sake of learning, because he himself had the same author of preaching; but rather to give honor to the previous apostle.


And I stayed with him for fifteen days. He did not lack great instruction, as he had prepared himself so much time to see Peter. And although it may seem excessive to some, it is also necessary to observe the numbers that are in the Scriptures: nevertheless, I think it is not without reason that the fifteen days, during which Paul stayed with Peter, signify complete knowledge and perfect doctrine. For indeed, fifteen are the psalms in the Psalter, and fifteen are the steps by which the righteous ascends to sing to God, and in His courts the righteous shall dwell. Moreover, Ezechias, having been given fifteen additional years of life, deserved to receive a sign in the degrees (Isa. XXXVIII): and the feasts of God begin on the fifteenth day (Exod. XII). Furthermore (because we follow a double understanding), he adds fifteen days in order to show that there was not a great amount of time for him to learn anything from Peter; so that all things would refer to the same meaning from which he began: that he was not taught by a man, but by God.


<h2 id='tocuniq18'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(v. 19) But I saw no other of the apostles, except James, the brother of the Lord. I remember that while I was in Rome, at the behest of the brothers, I published a book on the perpetual virginity of Saint Mary. In doing so, I had to engage in prolonged debate about those who were called the brothers of the Lord. Therefore, we must be satisfied with whatever we have written. Now let it suffice that, on account of his outstanding character and incomparable faith and wisdom, James was called the brother of the Lord, not in an ordinary sense. And he was the first to be appointed over the Church that was first gathered from the Jews, believing in Christ in the year 396. Indeed, the other apostles are called brothers of the Lord, as it is written in the Gospel: 'Go, tell my brothers: I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God' (John 20:17). And in the psalm: 'I will declare your name to my brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will praise you' (Psalm 22:22). But especially here, this brother is called, to whom the Lord entrusted the sons of his mother as he went to the Father. And just as Job and the other patriarchs were called servants of God, but Moses had something extraordinary about him, so that it was written of him, 'But not like Moses, my servant' (Hebrews 3:5), in the same way, the blessed James is specifically called the brother of the Lord (as we said before). But as for the twelve, they are called apostles for this reason: all who had seen the Lord and then preached about him were called apostles, as is written to the Corinthians: 'He appeared to Cephas, then to the eleven. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.' (1 Corinthians 15:5-7). But gradually, as time went on, and elsewhere from those whom the Lord had chosen, the apostles were ordained; as that sermon to the Philippians declares, saying: But I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, co-worker and comrade, your apostle and minister of my need (Philippians 2:25). And it is written to the Corinthians about such: Whether apostles of the Churches, the glory of God (2 Corinthians 8:23). Silas and Judas were also named apostles by the apostles. Hence the grave error of those who thought that James, the brother of John, was an apostle of the Gospel, when it is well-known that it was him who shed his blood for Christ after Stephen, according to the testimony of the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 12). However, this James, also known as James the Just, was the first bishop of Jerusalem. He was a man of such great holiness and reputation among the people that they strived to touch even the fringe of his garment. And he himself, after being thrown down from the temple by the Jews, had Simon as his successor, whom they also say was crucified as the Lord. He denies that he met with any of the other apostles, so that there would be no hidden contradiction: even if you were not taught by Peter, you had other apostles as teachers. But he did not see them, not because he considered them contemptible, but because they had been scattered throughout the whole world to preach the Gospel.


<h2 id='tocuniq19'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) But the things that I write to you: behold, before God, that I do not lie. Whether to be understood simply, so that it is: The things that I write to you are true, and I confirm by the testimony of God, that they are not deceitful lies by any art of words. Or to be understood in a deeper sense, so that it is read: The things that I write to you are before God, that is, worthy of God's sight. And why are they worthy of God's sight? Because, of course, I do not lie. And as the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous (Psalm 33); but He turns His face away from the wicked: so now the things that are written are before the Lord, with me not lying who writes them; and they would not be before the Lord, if I were lying. However, this can not only be understood about the things he is now writing to the Galatians, but also generally about all his Epistles: because what he writes is not false and his heart and words do not disagree.

<h2 id='tocuniq20'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. After the vision in Jerusalem, I went to Syria, which is called the exalted and lofty one with us. And from there I traveled to Cilicia, which I desired to embrace in the faith of Christ, preaching to it the call to repentance. For Cilicia indeed means 'taken up' or 'a lamentable call'.

<h2 id='tocuniq21'>(Vers. 22-24.)</h2>

(Verses 22-24.) But I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ Jesus. They only heard the report: 'He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once tried to destroy.' And they glorified God in me. The churches in Judea had only heard about Paul, saying that he who had once persecuted them was now preaching the faith. And most of them knew him only as a persecutor, not as an apostle. But in Syria and Cilicia and Arabia and Damascus, they may have recognized him by his appearance as well, because he was preaching the Gospel of Christ to the Gentiles, not to the Jews. But the whole purpose of what he does is this: to show that he could never have existed gloriously in the eyes of those he had previously persecuted unless his preaching had been confirmed by the judgment of those who had known the evil before him as well. And he secretly goes back to his initial purpose, affirming that he spent such a short time in Judea that even those who believed in him did not recognize him by his appearance. From this, he shows that he did not consider Peter, James, and John to be his teachers, but rather Christ, who had revealed the Gospel to him. At the same time, it should be noted that while earlier it was said that the Church attacked, here it is faith: there, people, here, the thing; so now (formerly) it is more opportune (inferretur): it proclaims faith, which it once attacked. For they could not sound alike (similiter) about the Church.

<h2 id='tocuniq22'>(Chap. II.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 2, Verses 1, 2.) Then after fourteen years, I went up to Jerusalem again, this time with Barnabas, taking Titus along also. I went up according to a revelation and presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But privately I discussed it with those who seemed to be leaders, so that I would not be running or have run in vain. What the Latin interpreter had said in the previous passage, I accepted: ‘I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood.’ Instead, I went up and discussed it with them, but to a greater extent than I had accepted, he interpreted. And to speak more truthfully, the Greek word ἀνεθέμην means something different than what is understood among us, namely when we, who know things, discuss them with a friend; and we place them in their lap and conscience, so that together we may decide whether what we know is to be approved or disapproved. Therefore, after fourteen years, he went up to Jerusalem. And he who had previously gone only to see Peter, and had stayed with him for fifteen days, now says that he went there in order to confer with the apostles about the Gospel; taking along Barnabas, who was circumcised, and Titus, who was uncircumcised. And this was done so that every word would be established under the testimony of two or three witnesses (Deut. 19:15). But it is one thing to compare, another to learn. Among those who compare there is equality; between the teacher and the student, the one who learns is inferior. In the beginning of faith, he saw the apostles during his journey. After seventeen years (as he himself says), he speaks fully with them and humbles himself: and lest he should perhaps run in vain or have already run, he inquires. For two reasons, that both the humility of Paul, who had already surpassed the previous apostles as a teacher in the whole world of the Gentiles, might be shown, and that the Galatians might not reject his Gospel, even those who were leading the churches in Judea. But at the same time he also teaches that, for the sake of the faith of Christ and the freedom of the Gospel, he dared to lead Titus, an uncircumcised man, to those who had known more about him, even though he knew that it would infringe the Law, destroy Moses, and completely remove circumcision. And among such a great multitude of Jews and his enemies, who desired to shed his blood out of zeal for the Law, neither he nor Titus gave in to fear and yielded to necessity. What could have obtained forgiveness, either on account of place, or on account of the authority of the elders, or on account of the number of the Churches, which believed in Christ among the Jews, or on account of the time, so that they might not sustain such great envy together. Some say that he went up to Jerusalem fourteen years later, at that time when the dissension arose among the believers in Antioch concerning the observance or omission of the Law, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles; and it was decided to go to Jerusalem and await the opinion of the elders, when Paul and Barnabas themselves were also sent out; and this is what is read in the Latin manuscripts: To whom we gave way for an hour, that the truth of the Gospel might continue among you. Indeed, it is evident that Paul and Barnabas were sent to Jerusalem, as if in doubt, in order to confirm the grace of the Gospel by the judgment of the elders, and to prove to the believers that there was no longer any doubt about the omission of circumcision. This was in accordance with the apostolic letters, which commanded that the yoke of the Law be removed from those who believed in Christ from the Gentiles. And when he says, 'I conferred with them the Gospel that I preach to the Gentiles,' it can be understood that he had discreetly conveyed the grace of the Gospel liberty and the abolition of the old Law, because of the multitude of believing Jews who were not yet able to hear about the fulfillment and end of the Law when Paul was absent, and who had boasted in Jerusalem in vain that he was running or had run, thinking that the old Law did not need to be followed. Not because Paul feared that he had preached a false Gospel among the Gentiles for seventeen years; but to show his predecessors that he was not running or had run in vain, as they had thought in their ignorance.

<h2 id='tocuniq23'>(Vers. 3-5.)</h2>

(Vers. 3-5.) But even Titus, who was with me, though he was a Greek, was not forced to be circumcised. Yet because of false brothers secretly brought in—who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might bring us into slavery—to them we did not yield in submission even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you. And from those who seemed to be influential (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)—those, I say, who seemed influential added nothing to me. But the truth of the Gospel gives way to the hypocrisy of the Jews; and if you consider those things which you esteemed as dung before, and despised as losses, you now observe and consider them to be something, when they are nothing. But even the meaning of the Epistle itself greatly contradicts this, as it calls the Galatians back to circumcision. This is the main point of his argument throughout his whole discourse, to teach that he, being a Hebrew among Hebrews, once observed all the works of the Law, being circumcised on the eighth day according to the Law of the Pharisees: nevertheless, for the sake of Christ's grace, he despised all things. For when he went to Jerusalem, and false brothers who had believed in circumcision wanted to compel him to circumcise Titus: neither Titus, nor did he yield to their violence, in order to preserve the truth of the Gospel. But if he says that he was compelled by necessity to circumcise Titus: how does he call back the Galatians from circumcision, from which neither Titus, who was with him from the Gentiles, could excuse himself in Jerusalem? Therefore, according to the Greek codices, it should be read: To whom we did not yield submission even for an hour, so that the truth of the Gospel might continue among you. But if anyone prefers the authority of Latin exemplars, we must interpret it according to the superior sense: that the giving-in of Titus was not about circumcision, but about going to Jerusalem. So it was that Paul and Barnabas yielded to submission, stirred up by the Law of Antioch, in order to establish their own opinion through the Epistle of the Apostles, and to maintain among the Galatians the truth of the Gospel, which was not in the letter, but in the spirit; not in a carnal sense, but in spiritual understanding; not in an overt form of Judaism, but in a hidden manner. It should be known that the conjunction 'autem' that is placed in the current position is superfluous and, if read, it does not have anything to respond to, and it concludes that it is the order of reading and meaning. But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gentile, was compelled to be circumcised. And immediately it adds the reason why he was urged to be circumcised against his will: 'Because of false brothers secretly brought in, who spied out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might bring us into slavery.' When some men came and wanted to subject us to the slavery of the Law, even for a little while we did not yield to them, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you. And not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek. But because of false brothers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might bring us into slavery— to them we did not yield in submission even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you. And from those who seemed to be influential (whatever they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)—those, I say, who seemed influential added nothing to me. On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised (for he who worked through Peter for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised worked also through me for mine to the Gentiles), and when James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. Only, they asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.


<h2 id='tocuniq24'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) But as for those who seem to be something—whatever they used to be makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism—those who were recognized as important added nothing to my message. On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised (for he who worked through Peter in his apostolic ministry to the circumcised also worked through me in mine to the Gentiles), and recognizing the grace that had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we might go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. They only asked us to remember the poor—the very thing I also was eager to do. (Galatians 2:6-10) For God is not a respecter of persons, and in every nation he that feareth Him and worketh justice is acceptable to Him. And so, cautiously and slowly, he walks the middle ground between praise and criticism of Peter, so as to both defer to the preceding apostle and yet boldly oppose him face to face, compelled by the truth.

For those who seemed important to me contributed nothing. He himself compared with them earlier, and he recounted many things to them, which he would carry out among the nations: they contributed nothing to him, but only confirmed what was said by him, they gave their right hands in partnership, and they affirmed their Gospel and Paul's. Again, it should be noted that 'contributed' is a Greek word, which we discussed earlier.

<h2 id='tocuniq25'>(Vers. 7, 8.)</h2>

(Vers. 7, 8.) But on the contrary, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was entrusted to me, just as the gospel of the circumcision was to Peter (for he who worked effectively in Peter for the apostleship of the circumcision also worked effectively in me toward the Gentiles), and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that had been given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we would go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcision. The expression 'Ὑπέρβατον' can be read briefly as follows: For those who seemed to be something, they contributed nothing to me. On the contrary, they recognized the grace given to me and Barnabas, the fellowship. But certainly, in their own estimation, they were hidden sense. For those who seemed to be something contributed nothing to me. On the contrary, it was from me that they received what they have, as they become stronger in the grace of the Gospel. But the whole idea is this: the Gospel of the uncircumcision is the same for me and Peter, who represents the circumcision. He sent me to the Gentiles, and he placed him in Judea. Neither the Gentiles, who were not able to bear the pain of circumcision at an advanced age and to abstain from the foods to which they had always been accustomed and which God had created for their use, nor those who had believed and been circumcised among the Jews, and who thought that they had an advantage over the other nations by virtue of their custom and almost second nature, could easily despise those things in which they boasted. Therefore, by the providence of God, one apostle was given to the circumcised, who seemed to acquiesce to the shadows of the Law, while another was given to those who were uncircumcised, who did not consider the grace of the Gospel to be servitude, but rather free faith. Lest any occasion of stumbling arise for faith, and because of circumcision or uncircumcision, one would not believe in Christ. Nor do we say this because Peter, who himself testified in the Acts of the Apostles that no man is common (Acts 10), and in that vision, which he saw being sent from heaven with four corners, he is taught that whether someone is Jewish or Gentile makes no difference, as if he had forgotten the prior principles regarding the grace of the Gospel, that the Law should be observed. But rather, in order to lead the Jews away from their ancient way of life, he pretended to also keep the Law, gradually." } For they were not able to suddenly disregard the great effort of observation and the most cautious manner of old life, as if impurities and losses. From this we understand that the right hands were given to Paul and Barnabas by Peter, James, and John, so that the diverse observance might not be considered a different Gospel of Christ; but that both the circumcised and the uncircumcised might be one community. However, he excellently constructed the argument, saying: For the one who worked in Peter for the apostleship of circumcision, so that no one might think less of him, but rather that with praises going before, it might be understood that Peter undertook circumcision in some way, in order to gain profit for those who had been entrusted to him from the Jews, and to maintain them in the faith and Gospel of Christ. He also understands that if he were to do so without fault and by observing the appropriate time, that which is not allowed, he would not lose the trust placed in him; he ought to do more for the truth of the gospel, which has been entrusted to him in foreskin, so that the nations, deterred by the burden and difficulty of the Law, would not depart from the faith and belief in Christ. A hidden question arises here: Therefore, if Peter were to find people from among the Gentiles, did he not lead them to faith? But if Paul found any from circumcision, did he not provoke them to the baptism of Christ? This is solved in such a way that we say the principle was given to each individual, both to the Jews and the Gentiles, that those who defended the Law should have someone to follow, and those who preferred grace to the Law should not lack a teacher and forerunner. But in general, their purpose was to gather a Church for Christ from all the nations. For we read that the gentile Cornelius was baptized by the holy Peter, and that Christ was preached by Paul frequently in the synagogues of the Jews. Peter, John, and James, who seemed to be pillars (Acts 10:13, 15, 17). Thrice we read of the apostles in this connection: (1) "but of these who seemed to be somewhat," (2) "they who seemed to be somewhat," (3) "they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me." Hence I was in doubt as to what they that seemed to be somewhat were, but now I have no scruple, for he added 'who seemed to be pillars.' Therefore, the apostles are the pillars of the Church, especially Peter, James, and John, of whom two are deserving of ascending with the Lord on the mountain, one of whom introduces the speaking Savior in the Apocalypse: 'To him that overcometh, I will make a pillar in the temple of my God' (Rev. III, 12), teaching all believers that those who overcome the adversary can become pillars of the Church. And writing to Timothy, Paul says: 'That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth' (I Tim. II, 15). And so, we are instructed both by the apostles and by all the believers that the Church itself is also called the pillar in the Scriptures, and it does not matter whether it is said of the body or the members, since the body is divided into members, and the members are part of the body. Therefore, Peter, James, and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave the right hand of fellowship to Paul and Barnabas, but they did not give it to Titus, who was with them. For he had not yet reached the point where the goods of Christ could be entrusted to him on equal terms with the elders, and he held the same position in the business as Barnabas and Paul.

<h2 id='tocuniq26'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) As a matter of fact, I was even anxious to do this very thing, so that we would remember the poor. The holy poor, whose care is especially entrusted to the apostles Paul and Barnabas, are those who, as believing Jews, brought the proceeds from the sale of their possessions and laid them at the feet of the apostles to be distributed to the needy. They were considered deserters of the Law and were looked upon with disgust and regarded as criminals because they believed in the crucified man. The Epistles of the holy Apostle Paul are witnesses of how much labor he exerted in this ministry, writing to the Corinthians and to the Thessalonians, and to all the Churches of the Gentiles, so that they might prepare this gift to be brought to Jerusalem either by themselves or by others who pleased them. Hence now he confidently says that he was also anxious to do this very thing. Moreover, the poor can be received in another way, of whom it is said in the Gospel: Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven (Matt. 5:3). Indeed, such deserve to be in the memory of the apostles. Also, those poor ones about whom it is written in Solomon: 'The redemption of a man's soul, his own wealth' (Prov. XIII, 8). However, the poor cannot endure a threat. For he cannot hear the terror of future punishments, being poor in faith, poor in grace, not possessing spiritual wealth nor knowledge of the Scriptures, which are compared to gold, silver, and precious stones. Therefore, since the healthy do not need a doctor, but those who are sick, it is fitting for the apostles to be in communication with those on the right hand, so that they would not despise the poor nor disdain sinners; but always remember them, as Paul remembers that man from Corinth, whom he had saddened temporarily in the previous letter, so that, though his body was afflicted through repentance, he would be saved in spirit (1 Cor. 5); in the second letter, lest he be overwhelmed by excessive grief, he calls him back to the Church. And he asked everyone to confirm their love for him and to give to their brothers as he had given to each of them in the presence of Christ, fulfilling the covenant he had made in Jerusalem to always remember the poor.

<h2 id='tocuniq27'>(Vers. 11 seq.)</h2>

(Vers. 11 seq.) But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong. For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group. The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray. When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, “You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs? We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified. But if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners, doesn’t that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not! If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker. For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!” So when the apostle Paul saw that the grace of Christ was in danger, he employed a new strategy in his fight, using the old art of battle, in order to correct the dispensation of Peter, which aimed at the salvation of the Jews, with a new dispensation of contradiction, and to resist him to his face. Not arguing against his intention, but rather contradicting publicly, so that by Paul opposing him, those who believed from the Gentiles would be saved. And if anyone thinks that Paul truly opposed the apostle Peter, and boldly did wrong to his predecessor for the sake of the truth of the Gospel, then that person will not hold to the fact that Paul himself became a Jew to the Jews, in order to gain Jews, and he will be guilty of the same deception, since he shaved his head in Cenchreae, and made a vow, and offered a sacrifice in Jerusalem (Acts 18), and circumcised Timothy (Acts 16), and exercised naked foot racing, which are clearly Jewish ceremonies. Therefore, if the one who was sent to preach to the Gentiles did not consider it necessary to say: 'Be without offense to the Jews and the Church of God' (I Cor. XIII, 31); how then can I please everyone in all things, not seeking what is advantageous to myself, but what is advantageous to many, that they may be saved? And he did certain things that were contrary to the freedom of the Gospel, so as not to scandalize the Jews. With what authority, with what audacity does he dare to reprimand this in Peter, who was the apostle of circumcision, when the apostle of the Gentiles himself is accused of committing it? But as we have already said, he [Peter] yielded to the public opinion with Peter and the others, so that the hypocrisy of observing the Law, which harmed those who had believed from the Gentiles, could be corrected by the hypocrisy of reproof, and so that both peoples could be saved, as those who praise circumcision follow Peter; and those who do not want to be circumcised, preach Paul's freedom. What he said, however, was reprehensible, therefore he moderated himself because of fasting; so that we understand that it was not so much Paul that was reprehensible, as it was to those brothers with whom he ate before, but later separated from them. But a useful pretense and one to be assumed at the right time, let the example of king Jeliu of Israel teach us, who could not kill the priests of Baal unless he pretended to want to worship the idol, saying: Gather (or, Gather together) to me all the priests of Baal: for if Achab served Baal in few things, I will serve in many (2 Kings 10:18). And David, when he changed his face before Abimelech and let him go, and departed (1 Samuel 21). It is not surprising, therefore, that just men should sometimes, for a time, feign for the sake of their own and others' salvation, since our Lord Himself, though having no sin, nor the flesh of sin, assumed the appearance of sinful flesh, so that, condemning sin in the flesh, He might make us righteous in Himself. Surely Paul had read in the Gospel the Lord commanding: 'But if your brother shall sin against you, go and reprove him between you and him alone.' If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day returns to you, saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive him (Luke 17:3). And how dare he, even in regard to the least of the brothers, publicly and boldly argue with such confidence, unless it had been pleasing to Peter to be argued with, and unless Paul had not done him wrong, of whom he had previously said: I came to Jerusalem to see Peter, and I stayed with him for fifteen days; but I did not see any other of the apostles. And again: For he who worked through Peter for the apostolate of circumcision. And below: Peter and James and John, who seemed to be pillars, and the rest that he speaks about in his praises. Many times, when I was a young man in Rome, I would engage in debates and exercise myself in false lawsuits for the sake of true competitions. I would run to the courts of judges and see the most eloquent orators contending with each other in such bitterness, that often, neglecting their own business, they would turn to personal insults and mock each other, biting with their words. If they do this, so that they do not incur any suspicion of prevarication and deceive the surrounding people: what do we think such great pillars of the Church, Peter and Paul, such vessels of wisdom, ought to have done among the dissident Jews and Gentiles? Was it not so that their simulated argument would result in the peace of the believers, and the faith of the Church would be reconciled through this holy dispute between them? There are some who do not believe that Cephas, whom Paul writes about as opposing him face to face, is the apostle Peter, but rather another disciple from the seventy designated by that name. They said that Peter could by no means hide himself from the company of the Gentiles, who also baptized the centurion Cornelius. And when he had come up to Jerusalem, those who were from the circumcision disputed against him, saying: Why did you go to men who have the uncircumcision and eat with them? (Acts XI, 3) After the narration of the vision, he concluded his response with the following statement: Therefore if God has given them the same grace as he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could hinder God? When they heard this, they fell silent and glorified God, saying: Therefore, God has also granted repentance to the Gentiles leading to life; especially since the writer of the history, Luke, makes no mention of this disagreement and never says that Peter was in Antioch with Paul and that Porphyry was blaspheming; if, however, Peter is believed to have erred or if Paul is believed to have boldly refuted the chief of the apostles. To this, I first respond that I do not know the name of another Cephas, except the one that is written about in the Gospel, in Paul's other Epistles, and even in this very text, sometimes as Cephas and sometimes as Peter. Not that Peter means one thing and Cephas another, but that what we call rock in Latin and Greek, the Hebrew and Syriac call Cephas due to the close proximity of the languages. Furthermore, the entire argument of the epistle, which is indirectly about Peter, James, and John, contradicts this interpretation. It is not surprising that Luke remained silent on this matter, considering that he omitted many other things that Paul himself claims to have endured as a historian's license. It is also not contradictory if one author deemed worthy of mention something that another author omitted among other things. Finally, we have learned that the first bishop of the Church of Antioch was Peter, who was later transferred to Rome, which Luke completely omitted. Finally, if another person has to be invented for us instead of Cephas because of Porphyry's blasphemy, so that Peter is not considered to have erred, countless things from the divine Scriptures will have to be erased, which he criticizes because he does not understand. But against Porphyry, we will fight on another front, if Christ commands it: for now, let us continue with the remaining things.


<h2 id='tocuniq28'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) But when I saw that they were not walking uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of everyone, 'Just as those who simulate a limp in their healthy steps do not have a fault in their feet, but there is some reason why they limp, so also Peter, knowing that circumcision and uncircumcision are nothing, but the observance of God's commandments, indeed used to eat with the Gentiles, but for a time he separated himself from them, so as not to lead the Jews away from the faith in Christ.' And so Paul, using the same skill as him, confronted him openly and spoke in front of everyone; not so much to accuse Peter, as to correct those for whom Peter had pretended, or even to remove pride from the Jews and despair from the Gentiles. But if anyone does not like this interpretation, in which neither Peter is shown to have sinned nor Paul is shown to have rebuked him disrespectfully, they should explain in what way Paul condemns this in the other case, which he himself committed.


If, being a Jew yourself, you live as a gentile and not as a Jew, how do you force the gentiles to judaize? By an unbreakable argument, Peter compels them, or rather through Peter, those who were causing him trouble. He says, 'Peter, if you, by nature, are a Jew, circumcised from a young age, and keeping all the commandments of the Law, now you know that they have no intrinsic value because of the grace of Christ, but they are examples and images of future things. And yet, you eat with those who are from the Gentiles, not in a superstitious manner as before, but freely and without distinction. So why are you compelling those who believed from the Gentiles to now separate from them and judaize?' For if those from whom you separate are unclean, yet you separate yourself because they do not have circumcision, do you compel them to be circumcised and become Jews, when you yourself, born a Jew, live like a Gentile? And joyfully he reveals the reason why he argued against him: namely, because he was compelling the Gentiles to Judaize through his pretense, while they desired to emulate him.

<h2 id='tocuniq29'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Ver. 15.) We, being Jews by nature and not Gentile sinners, have been infiltrated at this point by the heretics who, inventing ridiculous and absurd things, say that nature cannot sin spiritually nor do anything justly in earthly matters. Let us ask them why the branches of the good olive tree were broken off and why the wild olive tree was grafted into the root of the good olive tree, if nothing good can fall or anything evil rise? Or how could Paul have persecuted the Church before he became an Apostle, if he was of a spiritual nature? Or how could he have later become an Apostle if he was generated from earthly waste? But if they claim that he was not earthly, let us consider his words: We were by nature children of wrath, like the others (Ephesians 2:3). It is by nature that one is a Jew, who is of the lineage of Abraham, and is circumcised on the eighth day by his parents. Not by nature is one a Jew, who later becomes one from the Gentiles. But in order to summarize the whole argument in a brief discourse, the sense is this: We, that is, I and you, Peter (for he mixed his own person, lest he should seem to do him wrong), when we were, he says, by nature Jews, doing the things prescribed by the law, and not sinners from the Gentiles, who either generally, because they serve idols, are sinners, or those whom we now think unclean, knowing that we cannot be saved by the work of the Law, but by the faith of Christ, we believed in Christ, so that what the Law did not give us, faith might give us, which we had in Christ. But if departing from the Law, in which we could not be saved, we turn to faith, in which circumcision of the flesh is not sought, but devotion of a pure heart: and now by departing from the Gentiles we do this, so that whoever is not circumcised is unclean: therefore faith in Christ, in which we thought we were saved before, is more of a minister of sin than of righteousness, which removes circumcision, and whoever does not have it is unclean. But it is unthinkable that what I once destroyed and knew to be of no use to me, I should now seek to restore. Once I departed from the Law, dead to the Law, so that I might live in Christ, and I was crucified with him and born anew in the new man, subsisting more by faith than by flesh, and departing with Christ from the world. What I have once embraced, I hold. Christ did not die for me in vain: in him I believed in vain if I could be saved without his faith in the old Law.

(Verse 16) Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ: even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the Law. Some say: if it is true what Paul affirms, that no one is justified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, then the patriarchs, prophets, and saints who lived before the coming of Christ were imperfect. Those whom we must admonish are those who have not attained to righteousness, who believe that they can be justified by works alone. But the saints, who have been justified by the faith of Christ since ancient times. For Abraham saw the day of Christ and rejoiced. And Moses esteemed the greater riches as the treasure of the Egyptians, the reproach of Christ. For he looked forward to the reward. And Isaiah saw the glory of Christ (Isaiah VI), as John the Evangelist recounts, and Jude generally: I want to remind you, knowing all things once: that Jesus, saving the people from the land of Egypt, destroyed them a second time for those who did not believe (Jude V). Where not so much the works of the law are condemned, as those who trust that they can be justified only by their works, Christ also speaking to his disciples said, 'Unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven' (Matthew 5:20). It should be noted at this point how many commandments there are in the law, which no one is able to fulfill. And, on the contrary, it must be said that certain things of the law are also done by those who are unaware of it. But for this reason, his workers are not justified, because they are done without the faith of Christ: for example, not sleeping with a woman in the manner of sleeping with a man, not committing adultery, not stealing, but rather honoring father and mother, and doing other things that are commanded. And if they present to us examples of holy men: that those who were engaged with the Law, committed those things that were of the Law, we will say: Because the Law is not established for the just, but for the unjust and disobedient, the impious and the sinners, the defiled and the unclean (1 Timothy 1). But he who is taught by God does not need to be taught about charity, as Paul says: But concerning charity, I have no need to write to you: for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another (IV Thessalonians 4:9).

<h2 id='tocuniq31'>(Vers. 17, 18.)</h2>

(Verse 17, 18.) Therefore, because of this, every flesh will not be justified by the works of the Law. And if seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are found to be sinners: is Christ then a minister of sin? Certainly not. For if the things I destroyed, I build up again, I make myself a transgressor. That flesh, of which it is written, 'All flesh is grass; and all its glory is like the flower of the field.' (Isaiah 40:6) But that flesh is justified by the faith of Jesus Christ, of which it is said in the sacrament of the resurrection: All flesh shall see the salvation of God (Luke 3:6). But also according to a lower understanding, not all flesh was justified by the Law, but only those men who were in Palestine. Now, however, all flesh is justified by the faith of Jesus Christ, while His Church is founded throughout the whole world.

<h2 id='tocuniq32'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) For I have died to the Law, in order to live to God. To die according to the Law is one thing, to die to the Law is another. He who dies according to the Law lived for it before he died, observing Sabbaths and new moons, and festive days, and the typical curiosity of sacrifices, and Jewish fables, and genealogies. But when Christ and the Law came, of which it is written: 'For we know that the Law is spiritual' (Rom. 7:14), through the Gospel law, he died to the old Law: and the soul, which according to what is written to the Romans, 'If her husband is living, she will be called an adulterer; but if her husband is dead, she is released from the Law, having become dead to her husband, that is, to the old Law, she married the Spiritual Law, in order to bear fruit for God.' And in Hosea it is said: 'From me is your fruit found' (Hosea 14:9). To whom beautifully applies that mystical saying: 'Who is wise and will understand these things? Prudent, and will know them? For the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.' Therefore, by the spiritual law, a person dies to the law of letters and lives for God, since they are not without the law of God but are in the law of Christ. But the person who dies to the law because of sins is indeed dead; however, it cannot be said of them that they follow in order to live for God. But there is another spiritual law outside the law of the letter, as the Apostle teaches elsewhere, saying: Therefore, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, and just, and good (Rom. VII, 12). And Ezekiel, speaking on behalf of God, says: I brought them out, that is, the people of Judah, from the land of Egypt, and I brought them into the desert, and I gave them my precepts, and I showed them my justifications: which if a man do, he shall live in them (Ez. XX, 10). But about that law which works wrath, to which even the Apostle is dead, afterwards brings forth: And I gave them not good precepts, and justifications in which they shall not live in them. The same thing is also signified in the Psalter: Because I have not known literature, I will enter into the strength of the Lord.

I am crucified with Christ. For he said that he was dead to the law, so that how he died he might show: I am crucified with Christ, bearing his cross, and following Christ, and praying in the very passion itself: Remember me, when you come into your kingdom (Luke 23:42, 43). And immediately hearing: Today you shall be with me in paradise. If anyone mortifies his members on earth, and is dead to the world, he is crucified with Jesus, and he affixes the trophy of his mortification to the tree of the Lord's passion.


<h2 id='tocuniq33'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20.) But I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. He who once lived in the Law does not live, for he persecuted the Church. But Christ lives in him, wisdom, strength, speech, peace, joy, and other virtues; whoever does not have these virtues cannot say: Christ lives in me, and all of this he argues against Peter under the guise of Peter.

But to now live in the flesh. It is one thing to be in the flesh, and another to live in the flesh. For those who are in the flesh cannot please God (Rom. VIII, 8, 9). Therefore, it is said to those who live well: But you are not in the flesh.

I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. In Romans, it speaks about God, who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us. And now about Christ, who gave himself up: He loved me, he said, and gave himself for me. In the Gospel, when the apostles are listed, it is mentioned: And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. Again, in the same: See, the one who will betray me is approaching. But Scripture records that the chief priests and elders of the people condemned Jesus to death, and binding him, led him and delivered him to Pilate the governor (Matthew 27, and Mark 15). And then about Pilate: He released Barabbas to them, but Jesus, after being flogged, he delivered to them to be crucified (John 19). Therefore, the Father handed over the Son, and the Son himself handed over: and Judas and the priests handed him over to the chief priests, and finally, having been handed over to him, he himself delivered him Pilate. But the Father handed over, in order to save the lost world: Jesus himself handed himself over, in order to do the will of the Father and his own: But Judas and the priests and elders of the people, and Pilate, ignorant of life and death, handed him over. And when she herself also handed herself over for our salvation, blessed and very happy is the one who, with Christ living in him, can say through every thought and action: I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and handed himself over for me.


<h2 id='tocuniq34'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21.) I do not reject the grace of God: for if justice is through the law, then Christ died in vain. He rejects the grace of God, both he who lives under the law after the Gospel, and he who becomes defiled by sins after baptism. But whoever can say with the Apostle: His grace towards me was not in vain (I Cor. XV, 10), he also speaks confidently: I do not reject the grace of God. But what follows is very necessary against those who think that the commandments of the Law must be observed after the faith of Christ. For, indeed, we must say to them: If by the law righteousness exists, then Christ died in vain. Or certainly they should teach how Christ did not die in vain, if works justify. But even though they may be dull, they will not dare to say that Christ died without cause. Therefore, concerning the particle of the syllogism that is proposed here, that is: If, therefore, righteousness is by the Law, then Christ died in vain, we must accept what is consequentially inferred and cannot be denied: But Christ did not die in vain; and conclude: Therefore, righteousness is not by the Law. Until now he was against Peter, now he is returning to the Galatians.

<h2 id='tocuniq35'>(Chap. III.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter III - Verse 1.) O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you? This passage can be understood in two ways. Either they are called foolish Galatians because they have started in the Spirit and are now being consumed by the flesh, going from higher things to lower; or because each province has its own characteristics. The Apostle approves that the Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons, as the poet Epimenides stated. The historian Latinus strikes at the empty Moors and the fierce Dalmatians. The timid Phrygians, all the poets tear them to pieces. In Athens, more talented minds are born, philosophers boast. Tully dares to slander the light-minded Greeks, saying: Either the light-minded Greeks, or the savage barbarians. And for Flaccus: Inborn levity, he says, and educated vanity. The very Israel, with heavy heart and stiff neck, all the Scriptures accuse. In this manner, I believe even the Apostle Paul challenged the Galatians by the uniqueness of their region. Although some, under the pretext of avoiding heresy, which introduces diverse natures, insert profound questions, they say that even the Tyrians and Sidonians, the Moabites and Ammonites, and the Edomites, the Babylonians and the Egyptians, and all the nations that are mentioned in the Scriptures, have certain languages due to preceding causes and the merits of their ancient works, so that the justice of God does not come into doubt: since each nation is said to have either good or evil, which the others do not have. We will pursue these declining heights: either we will argue that they cannot judge the spirit and letter of the Law due to their foolishness, or we will blame the fault of the people, saying that they are unteachable and foolish, and slower to wisdom. But what follows, 'Who has bewitched you?' (I Cor. XI), we must explain in a worthy manner to Paul (who, although he is unskilled in speech, is not unskilled in knowledge): not because he knows that there is a spell, which is commonly believed to cause harm; but rather that he uses familiar speech, and as in other matters, so also in this place, he takes on the word of everyday conversation. We read in Proverbs: The gift of the envious tortures the eyes. The envious person, among us, is more significantly called a charmer in Greek: and in the Wisdom of Solomon, it is written: The spell of malice obscures good things (Wis. 4:22). By these examples, we are taught that either the envious person is tormented by the success of others, or if someone possesses some good things, they are harmed by another charmer, that is, an envier. It is said that the charmer properly harms infants, and young age, and those who have not yet firmly planted their step. And some from the nations:

I do not know who is bewitching my tender lambs. (Virgil. Eclogues 3.) Whether this is true or not, God knows: because it is possible that even demons serve this sin; and whoever they have known to have begun or advanced in the work of God, they turn away from good works. Now the following is the reason, which we think is taken from the opinion of the common people: just as tender age is said to be harmed by witchcraft, so also the recently born Galatians in the faith of Christ, who have been nursed on milk and not solid food (I Cor. 3), are harmed as it were by some sort of bewitching: and with their faith weakened, they have vomited the food of the Holy Spirit. But if someone contradicts, let them explain how the mention of the Titans' valley is taken from common opinion, in the Books of the Kings (2 Kings 23), the Sirens and Centaurs in Isaiah (Chapter 34), Arcturus and Orion, and the Pleiades in Job (Chapter 9), and other similar things, which certainly have the vocabulary, causes, and origins of Gentile myths. Let us therefore ask Marcion in this place, who rejects the prophets, how he interprets what follows.


Before whose eyes Jesus Christ was set forth, crucified among you, so he is crucified in us. For Christ is rightly prescribed to us, whose gallows and passion, slaps and whips, every chorus of prophets foretells: that his cross is not only from the Gospel, in which he is reported to be crucified; but long before he deigned to descend to the earth, and took on the man who was crucified, we know. Nor is it a small praise of the Galatians that they believed in the crucified one in this way, as it had been prescribed to them beforehand: that is, searching the prophets and understanding all the sacraments of the old Law, they came to believe in the way and order." } It is read in some codices: Who bewitched you not to believe the truth? But because this is not found in the exemplars of Adamantius, we have omitted it.

<h2 id='tocuniq36'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Verse 2.) This only I want to learn from you: did you receive the Spirit from the works of the Law, or from hearing with faith? Indeed, there are many things that can compel you by questioning, that the Gospel should be preferred to the Law. But since you are foolish and cannot hear these things, I speak to you in simple language and inquire about what is clear: Did you receive the Holy Spirit from the works of the Law, the observance of the Sabbath, circumcision, and the superstition of new moons, or from hearing with faith, by which you believed among the gentiles? But if it cannot be denied that the Holy Spirit and the powers, which followed the Spirit received at the beginning of faith, were given not by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Christ, it is evident that you, who began from better things, are falling into worse things. However, let us consider carefully that he did not say: I want to learn from you whether you received the Spirit by works, but he added, by the works of the Law. For he knew that Cornelius the centurion had received the Spirit by works (Acts 10), but not by the works of the Law, which he did not know. But if, on the contrary, it is said: therefore the Spirit can be received without the hearing of faith. We will respond that indeed the Spirit is received, but by the hearing of faith and by the natural law that speaks in our hearts, to do good things and avoid evil things: through which we have already mentioned that Abraham, Moses, and other justified saints have received it, but the observation of works and the justice of the Law ((or rather, also the Law)) can increase it further: not the carnal law which has passed, but the spiritual law, for the Law is spiritual. But indeed, because we prefer faith, we do not destroy the works of the Law (Romans III), nor do we say, according to some: Let us do evil, that good may come (whose condemnation is just), but we give preference to grace over bondage. And we say that what the Jews do out of fear, we do out of love. They are servants, we are sons; they are compelled to do good, we willingly embrace the good. Therefore, it is not from the faith of Christ that the permission to sin arises, but from the love of faith the will for good work is increased, while we do good things not because we fear judgment, but because we know that they please Him in whom we believe. Someone may ask, if faith comes only from hearing, how can those who are born deaf become Christians? For it is possible for someone to understand God the Father from the greatness and beauty of His creatures, and the Creator is consequently recognized from His creations. However, the birth, cross, death, and resurrection of Christ can only be known through hearing. Therefore, either deaf people are not Christians, or if they are Christians, it is false what is said elsewhere by the Apostle: So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of God. To which, those who are satisfied with a simple answer say that he did not speak universally, that faith is a dream from hearing, but faith comes from hearing, which can be understood in part and in whole: namely, the faith of those who hear and believe. However, those who try to satisfy this doubt will first attempt to assert that even the deaf can learn the Gospel through gestures of nodding, daily conversation, and, so to speak, the entire body speaking: second, also that the word of God, to which nothing is deaf, speaks more to those ears about which he himself says in the Gospel: Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear (Luke 8:8). And in the Apocalypse: He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the Churches (Rev. II, 11). And Isaiah: The Lord has given me an ear (Isa. VI, 33 and 35). This is another man to whom God speaks in secret, who cries out in the heart of the believer: Abba, Father (Rom. VIII, 15): and (as we have often explained) just as the body has all its members and senses, so too the soul has all its senses and members, including ears: whoever possesses them will not greatly need the ears of the body to understand the Gospel of Christ. But at the same time, also pay attention to this, that here the Holy Spirit is understood without any addition, which we obtain as a gift from God, and not from man: concerning which it is written elsewhere: 'The Spirit is incorruptible in all things' (Wis. 12:1). And: 'The Spirit himself gives testimony to our spirit' (Rom. 8:16). And in another place: 'No one knows the things that are in a man, except the spirit of the man that is in him' (1 Cor. 2:11). And in Daniel: Bless the Lord, all you spirits and souls of the righteous (Dan. 3:86).

<h2 id='tocuniq37'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3) Are you so foolish, after starting with the Spirit, to now be perfected by the flesh? If the Galatians received the Holy Spirit, how then were they foolish? Truly, it is evident that they began with the Spirit, but when they were being perfected by the flesh, the Spirit was taken away from them. Therefore, they suffered in vain for what they suffered. In order to prevent this from happening to himself after sin, David prays, saying: 'Do not take your Holy Spirit away from me.' (Psalm 51:13) Carefully consider that the one who follows the Scriptures literally is said to be perfected in the flesh. Therefore, what is written to the Corinthians, 'Although we live in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh' (2 Corinthians 10:3), can be better understood as meaning that those who humbly teach the Old Testament are waging war in the flesh. However, those who follow spiritual understanding, although they are in the flesh and have the same letter as the Jews, do not wage war according to the flesh, but transcend from the flesh to the spirit. When you see him who first believes from among the Gentiles, and puts his hand to the plow of Christ, having been preceded by some wise teacher, so as to go through the way of the Law to the Gospel, in order that he may understand all those things that are written there, concerning the Sabbath, concerning unleavened bread, concerning circumcision, concerning sacrifices, in a manner worthy of God, and afterwards, having heard the reading of the Gospel by a Jew or a Jewish associate, may be persuaded, leaving behind the shadows and cloudy allegories, to interpret the Scriptures as they are written: can you say of this: 'Are you so foolish, that when you have begun with the Spirit, you are now to be consumed by the flesh?'


<h2 id='tocuniq38'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) You have suffered so much without reason, if indeed without reason. Let us consider the unhappy Jews, how they live among other nations with so much superstition and the labor of observing, saying 'do not touch, do not taste, do not handle,' and we will prove that what is said is true: You have suffered so much without reason; but the judgment is not immediately applicable to them, and it becomes doubtful if indeed without reason: because it is said of those who can return from the Law to the Gospel. But this can be better understood in the following way: that the Galatians, who believed in the Crucified One, suffered much reproach from both the Jews and the Gentiles, and endured not insignificant persecutions. These persecutions would be in vain if they were to depart from the grace of Christ, for which they have suffered so much. Also, there is hope that whoever labors for the faith of Christ and later falls into sin, just as it is said that they suffered in the past without cause while sinning, likewise will not lose it if they return to their former faith and their former zeal. Otherwise: If you think that circumcision should be followed after grace, then up to the present time living without circumcision, all that you have suffered has been brought to nothing. Indeed, it seems to me that you have not endured in vain, for I know that the Law is not valid after the Gospel. Or certainly like this: It would not be a small loss if, following circumcision, you lost so much of the previous labor of faith. Now, however, in addition to this detriment, there is also the punishment of transgression, so that you have suffered in the past without cause and will be crucified in the future. Some people understand more forcefully: Consider the former freedom of grace and the current burdens of observance in the Law, and you will see how many things you have done in vain with that zeal. Although the complete fruit of that error does not need to be despaired of, as long as with the zeal of God you are led to this very thing. For it can be forgiven for those who are ignorant, if you, having been turned to better things, teach that the knowledge in you wavered, not the zeal.

<h2 id='tocuniq39'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5) So, the one who provides you with the spirit and works miracles in you, is it from the works of the law or from hearing with faith? He provides, that is, administers; it is to be understood as pertaining to the present time, in order to show that at every hour and moment the Holy Spirit is always ministered to the worthy; and the more one progresses in the work and love of God, the more he will have the virtues of the Holy Spirit within himself, which are consummated not by the works of the law but by hearing with faith. Not so that the works of the Law should be despised, and without them simple faith should be sought; but so that the works themselves may be adorned with the faith of Christ. For the sentence of that wise man is known: 'The just shall live by faith, not by righteousness.' Also, it is shown that the Galatians, having received the Holy Spirit after faith, had the gifts of virtues, that is, prophecy, different kinds of tongues, cures of diseases, and other things that are mentioned in the spiritual gifts to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 12). And yet, after all this (because perhaps they did not have the gift of discerning spirits), they were ensnared by false teachers. It is also to be observed that virtues are said to be performed by those who do not hold to the truth of the Gospel: just as in those who, not following the Lord, were performing miracles in His name, with John especially complaining: Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow us (Mark 9:37). This is against the heretics, who believe that if they perform any sign, it is a proof of their faith. They boast that they have eaten and drunk in the name of the Lord (for they themselves have a sacrilegious altar) and have performed many signs, invoking the Savior. But on the day of judgment, they will deserve to hear: 'I never knew you, depart from me, you workers of iniquity' (Matthew VII, 23).

<h2 id='tocuniq40'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6) Just as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness. From this place up to where it is written: Those who are of faith will be blessed with faithful Abraham, Marcion erased it from his Apostle. But what profit was it for him to have taken this away, when the rest of the things he left remain contrary to his madness? However, Abraham believed God, leaving his homeland for a land he did not know (Gen. 12ff.): Trusting that ninety-year-old and barren Sarah would bear a child; And having heard God's promise that his descendants would be called through Isaac, he even offered Isaac as a sacrifice, yet never doubting the Lord's promise. The one who, surpassing the works of the Law, has deserved God's favor not out of fear but out of love, is rightly considered faithful to justice.

<h2 id='tocuniq41'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) Therefore, you know that those who are of faith, these are the sons of Abraham. He argues more fully about this in the letter to the Romans, that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness, not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision (Rom. IV). And diligently observing, he teaches that they are the sons of Abraham, whoever believed with this mind, with which uncircumcised Abraham believed, who rejoiced to see the day of the Lord, and saw it, and was glad (John VIII). And to the unbelieving Jews it is said: If you were the children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham (Ibid. 39). But what other works did the Lord desire from them at that time when these things were said, if not faith in the Son of God, whom the Father had sent to speak: He who believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me (John XII, 44)? Therefore, in another place, in response to those applauding their own noble and ancient ancestry, it is said: And do not say, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham (Matthew 3:9). By these stones, no one doubts that the hardened hearts of the Gentiles are signified, which were softened afterward and received the seal of faith. O diligent reader, enumerate the virtues of Abraham in which he pleased God before circumcision, and whoever you find in a similar work, say that they are children of Abraham, justified in uncircumcision, who received circumcision not on account of the merit of works but as a sign of prior faith. For since Christ was to be born of his seed (in whom the blessing of all nations had been promised from Abraham to Christ, with many centuries to pass), God, foreseeing that the beloved descendants of Abraham would mix with other nations and gradually become uncertain, marked the Israelite flock with a certain circumcision with a branding iron, so that they would be distinguished by this sign while living among the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, and Chaldeans. Finally, for forty years in the wilderness no one was circumcised. Indeed, they lived alone without the mixture of any other nation. As soon as the people crossed the Jordan River and entered the land of Judah in Palestine, circumcision was required to prevent the error arising from the mixing of the Gentiles. The fact that the people were circumcised by Joshua (see Joshua 5) indicates that circumcision ceased in the wilderness, where it was reasonably practiced in Egypt. Instead, those who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ are cleansed through spiritual circumcision.


<h2 id='tocuniq42'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Verses 8, 9.) But the Scripture, foreseeing that God justifies the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, 'In you shall all the nations be blessed.' So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith. Not that the Scripture, ink and parchment, which are senseless, can foresee the future; but rather, the Holy Spirit and the meaning hidden in the written word have foretold things to come many centuries later. Moreover, an example taken from Genesis is contained in its own volume: And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed (Gen. XXVI, 4). The apostle interpreted this concerning Christ and said: It is not written of seeds, as if in many; but as in one, and in your seed, which is Christ. However, in almost all the testimonies that have been taken from the old books and incorporated into the new Testament, we must observe that the evangelists or apostles believed in their memory; and with the meaning explained, they often changed the order, sometimes either detracting words or adding them. But there is no doubt that in Isaac and Jacob, or in the twelve patriarchs, and others who descend from the lineage of Abraham, all nations were not blessed; but in Christ Jesus, through whom all nations praise God, and a new name is blessed upon the earth. However, it can be understood that the apostle also took an example from another place in Genesis, where it is written: And God brought him out (no doubt Abraham), and said to him: Look at the sky and count the stars, if you are able to number them. And he said to him: So shall your seed be; and Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice (Gen. XV, 5, 6). Therefore, whosoever believe, shall be blessed with faithful Abraham, who is reported to have believed in God with excellent faith. Just as Enos is written to have hoped in God for his outstanding hope and to have called upon the Lord God among others (Gen. IV, 26). Not that Abel, of whom the Lord says: The voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me (Ibid. IV, 10), and the rest who followed, did not hope to call upon God; but each one may be called upon from that part which he has in the greatest extent.


<h2 id='tocuniq43'>Second Book</h2>

Second Book

425-426 In the first Commentary on Galatians, when I was discussing the characteristics of the Gentiles, I left this topic untouched. Now in the second Commentary, it seems fitting to address who the Galatians are, and how and from where they immigrated. Whether they were defeated by the natives or whether the land accepted them as newcomers, what language they lost through intermarriage and what new language they learned, and whether they retained their own. Marcus Varro, an extremely diligent researcher of all antiquities, and others who have followed in his footsteps, have revealed many things about this nation worthy of mention. But because our purpose is not to introduce uncircumcised men into the temple of God (and to be frank, it has been many years since we stopped reading these things), we will quote the words of our Lactantius in the third volume to Probus concerning this people: 'The Gauls,' he says, 'were called Galatians in ancient times because of the whiteness of their bodies; and the Sibyl also calls them this. The poet wished to signify this when he said: 'Then milk-white necks are adorned with gold' (Virgil, Book VIII Aeneid): he could have said 'white.'" } From here, indeed, Galatia became a province, into which the Gauls, coming at some time, mixed themselves with the Greeks. Hence, first that region was named Gallograecia, then Galatia. It is not surprising if he said this about the Gauls, and mentioned that the Western peoples settled in the midst of such vast stretches of land, having passed over the furthest parts of the East: since it is well known that they have reached the farthest parts of the West opposite to both the East and Greece. The Phocaeans founded Massilia: whom Varro says are trilingual, because they speak both Greek and Latin and Gallic. The town of Rhoda was founded by the colonists of Rhodes, from which the river Rhone received its name. I pass over the founders of Carthage, the Tyrians, and the city of Agenor; I pass over the Thebes of Liber, which he founded in Africa: which city is now called Theveste. I leave that part of Libya which is full of Greek cities. I cross over to Spain: did not the Greeks, coming from the island of Zacynthus, found the town of Saguntum? And it is said that the Ionian Greeks settled the town of Tartessus, which is now called Carteia. The mountains of the Spanish of course, Calpe, Idrus, Pyrenees: also the islands of Aphrodisiades, and the Gymnesiae, which are called the Balearic Islands, do they not demonstrate indications of the Greek language? Italy itself, once occupied by Greek peoples, was once called Magna Graecia. It is certain that it cannot be denied that the Romans are descended from Aeneas, a Trojan man. From whence it happens, that both in the West the Greeks often find sharp minds, and in the East they smell of barbaric stupidity. And this we say, not that things are not born differently on either side: but that in large part even other things that are not similar are called by the same name. Therefore, it is not surprising that the foolish and slower to understand are called Galatians, since even Hilary, a Gaul himself born in the region of the Rhone, in his Hymn of Songs, calls the Gauls unteachable in Latin eloquence. And the abundance of orators now belongs not so much to the diligence of the region, as to the clamor of the rhetoricians: especially since Aquitania boasts of having a Greek origin, and the Gauls, not from that region of the earth, but from the fiercer Gauls, have come forth. Do you want to know, O Paula and Eustochium, how the Apostle marked each province with its peculiarities? Even to this day, the same traces of virtues or errors remain. The faith of the Roman people is praised (Rom. I). Where else is there such zeal and frequency, gathering at churches and the tombs of martyrs? Where else does the Amen resound like the thunder of heaven, and the empty temples of idols tremble? Not that the Romans have a different faith than all the Churches of Christ, but their devotion is greater and their simplicity in believing. Again they are being accused of ease and arrogance. Of ease, as in this passage: I beseech you, brethren, to take note of those who cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and avoid them; for those who are such do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own belly, and by smooth words and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the innocent. For your obedience has become known to all. So I rejoice in you; I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil (Rom. 16:17-18). Regarding pride: Do not be proud, but fear (Rom. 2:20, 25). And: I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, of this mystery, so that you may not be wise in your own estimation. And in the following: For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of yourself more highly than you ought to think, but to think with sober judgment (Rom. 12:3). And more clearly: Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Sympathize with one another. Be not wise in your own conceits. (Romans XV, 16). He also notes to the Corinthians that their women should have their heads covered, and the men should not cut their hair (I Cor. X): and they should eat indifferently in temples (or at another time) (II Cor. X, 20); and being puffed up with worldly wisdom, they deny the resurrection of the flesh. These things, to some extent, remain until today and cannot be doubted, those who have seen Achaia in 429-430 (1 Corinthians 4). The Macedonians are praised for their love, hospitality, and acceptance of the brothers. Therefore, it is written to them: Regarding brotherly love, we do not need to write to you because you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another. Indeed, you are doing this towards all the brothers in all Macedonia (1 Thessalonians 4:9). But they are criticized because they go around idle houses: and they wait for someone else's food, while they desire to please each individual, and they run here and there, reporting what is happening among each individual. Therefore it follows: But we exhort you, brethren, that you abound more, and that you make an effort to be at peace: that you attend to your own business, and work with your own hands, as we have instructed you: so that you may walk properly toward those who are outside, and that you may not lack anything (Ibid., X, 11). So that no one may think that he is teaching more out of duty than as a warning to the people, he emphasizes and repeats the following to the same people: For when we were with you, we gave you this command: If anyone is unwilling to work, he shall not eat. For we hear that some among you are living in idleness, not busy at work, but busybodies. Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living. (2 Thessalonians 3:10-12) It is a long task if I wish to discuss the Apostle, and all the writings of each individual nation, either the virtues to observe or the vices: since we have turned our attention to these very things themselves because the Galatians have been pronounced foolish and foolish. Let those who have seen Ancyra (also known as Anchira), the metropolis of the city of Galatia, know with me how many schisms it has been torn by now, how many varieties of doctrines it has been defiled by. I omit the Cataphrygians, Ophites, Borborites, and Manichaeans; for these are now well-known terms of human calamity. Who has ever heard of Passaloryncitae, Ascodrobos, Artotyrites, and other names more like monstrosities than deities in any part of the Roman world? The traces of ancient folly remain to this day. One thing we infer, and fulfill the promise from the beginning, that the Galatians, excluding the Greek language, which all the East speaks, have almost the same language as the Treviri, and it does not matter if they have corrupted it in any way, since the Africans themselves have somewhat changed the language of the Phoenicians, and even the Latin language itself and the regions are changing every day and over time. But now let us return to the purpose.

For whoever is of the works of the Law is under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is everyone who does not remain in all the things which are written in the book of the Law, to do them. I have this practice, that whenever something is taken from the Old Testament by the Apostles, I resort to the original books, and diligently examine how they are written in their places. Therefore, I found the same passage in Deuteronomy in this way among the Seventy interpreters: Cursed is every man who does not remain in all the words of this Law, to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen. But with Aquila, it is written this way: Cursed is the one who does not establish the words of this Law to do them, and all the people shall say, 'Amen'. Symmachus: Cursed is the one who does not confirm the words of this Law to do them, and all the people shall say, 'Amen'. But Theodotion translated it this way: Cursed is the one who does not raise up the words of this Law to do them, and all the people shall say, 'Amen'. From this we understand that the Apostle, as in other places, placed more importance on the sense of the testimony rather than the words. And it is uncertain whether the Seventy Interpreters added the words 'every man', and 'in all things', or if it was in the ancient Hebrew and later deleted by the Jews. However, this suspicion is stimulated in me by the fact that the word 'omnis,' which is necessary to express its meaning, is used to prove that whoever is of the works of the Law is under a curse. The Apostle, a man of Hebrew expertise and highly knowledgeable in the Law, would never have stated this unless it was found in Hebrew volumes. Therefore, while examining the Hebrew volumes of the Samaritans, I found that 'Chol,' which means 'omnis' or 'omnibus,' was written and agrees with the Septuagint interpreters. Therefore the Jews took this in vain, so that they would not appear to be under a curse if they could not fulfill all that is written: since the earlier writings of another people also testify to this. But since no one can fulfill the Law and do all that is commanded, as the Apostle also testifies elsewhere, saying: For what was impossible for the Law, in that it was weakened by the flesh: God, sending his Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, condemned sin in the flesh (Rom. VIII). But if it is true, it can be objected to us: Therefore both Moses, and Isaiah, and the other prophets, who were under the works of the Law, are under a curse? Which he will not hesitate to agree with, who has read the Apostle saying: For Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us; and to respond that each of the saints in his time has been made a curse for the people. Not immediately attributing this even to righteous men, it will seem to detract from the Savior, as if he had nothing outstanding and excellent, being made a curse for us, when others have also been made a curse for others. For no one, even if he himself has become a curse, has freed anyone from the curse, except the Lord Jesus Christ alone, who redeemed us all, including Moses and Aaron themselves, and all the prophets and patriarchs, from the curse of the Law. And do not think that this is said based on my own understanding, for the Scripture is a witness: because Christ, by the grace of God, or as it is read in some manuscripts, without God, died for all (II Cor. V). But if for the sake of all, and for Moses, and for all the prophets, of whom none could destroy the old writing, which was written against us, and to fix it to the cross (Colossians 2): All have sinned, and need the glory (that is, the grace) of God (Romans 3:23). Ecclesiastes also confirms this sentence: There is no righteous man on earth who does good and does not sin (Ecclesiastes 7:21). Finally, even the Apostle's statement clearly teaches that neither Moses nor any illustrious man from ancient times could be justified before God through the Law. It follows, therefore:

<h2 id='tocuniq44'>(Vers. 11, 12.)</h2>

(V. 11, 12) But that no one is justified before God by the Law is evident, because the just shall live by faith. However, the Law is not of faith, but he who does them shall live by them. An example that proves the just live by faith and not by works is taken from Habakkuk, as the Seventy interpreters have given it: 'But the just shall live by my faith.' Aquila and Theodotio: 'But the just shall live by his faith,' that is, by God's faith. Therefore, it should be considered that when it is said, 'the just shall live by faith,' the intention is not to give occasion for contempt of good works. Rather, it means that one who is just lives by faith. Thus, whoever is faithful and intends to live by faith cannot come to faith or live in it unless they have first been justified and have ascended to faith through a certain degree of purity of life. Therefore, it is possible for someone to be just and yet not live without the faith of Christ. If someone reading is troubled, let them accept the words of Paul, in which he says about himself: 'According to the righteousness that is in the Law, blameless' (Phil. 3:6). Therefore, Paul was righteous in the Law at that time, but he could not yet live, because he did not have Christ speaking in him: 'I am the life' (John 11:25). Believing in him, he began to live afterwards. Let us also do something similar to what is said, 'the righteous shall live by faith'; and let us say: the chaste live by faith, the wise live by faith, the strong live by faith, and from the other parts of virtue, let us express a similar opinion against those who, not believing in Christ, think themselves strong and wise, or temperate, or righteous: so that they may know that no one lives without Christ, without whom all virtue is in vice. The present testimony can be read and understood as follows: the righteous person lives by faith, as it is further implied. However, when it says that the law is not based on faith, but rather on the one who does the works, they shall live by them, it is clearly demonstrated that it does not simply refer to physical life, but rather to something else. Indeed, the righteous person lives by faith, and it is not added, in them or in those. On the other hand, the one who lives in accordance with the law he performs, lives in them or in those, that is, in the works that he has done, which he considered good: having the reward of his labor through those works alone, either the length of life (as the Jews believe) or the deviation, the punishment by which the transgressor of the law is killed. But to live in them, we cannot think the words of the Apostles, but of the Prophet Ezekiel, who says: And I led them into the desert, and I gave them my commandments and showed them my justifications, which a man shall do and live in them (Ezek. 20:10, 11). And when he had said that those who walked in the commandments and justifications would live, he added: And I gave them commandments that were not good, and justifications in which they would not live (ibid., 25). What a consideration in these words! Where he said: I gave them precepts and justifications to live in them, he did not add good things. But when he placed, in which they would not live in them, he added: And I gave them precepts that are not good, and justifications in which they will not live in them. But these things are explained more fully in Ezekiel: now let us return to the order of the Epistle.

<h2 id='tocuniq45'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) 434 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, becoming a curse for us. At this point, Marcion sneaks in his view of the power of the Creator, whom he falsely accuses of being bloodthirsty, cruel, and avenging, claiming that we are redeemed by Christ, who is supposedly the Son of another God. If he understood the difference between buying and redeeming (because when someone buys, they buy something that belongs to someone else; but when someone redeems, they properly buy back what was their own and had ceased to be), he would never twist the simple words of Scripture to fit his own false doctrine. Therefore, Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, which was established for sinners, whom he rebukes through the prophet, saying: Behold, you have been sold for your sins, and I have sent away your mother in your iniquities (Isaiah 50:1). And the apostle repeats this same thing, saying: But I am of the flesh, sold under sin (Romans 7:14). The curses of the Law written in Leviticus and Deuteronomy are not fulfilled by the authorship of God, but by the prophetic spirit they are announced to those who were going to sin, the things that would happen to them." } But if anyone wants to restrict us apostles by saying: Whoever is of the works of the Law, is under a curse; for it is written: Cursed is everyone who does not remain in all the things written in the book of the Law, to do them (Deut. XXVII, 26), and to assert that all who were under the Law were cursed, let us ask him whether those who are under the Gospel of Christ and do not do his commandments are cursed or not. If he shall have cursed, he shall have it in the Gospel, what we have in the Law. If he shall have denied the cursed, therefore in vain the precepts of the Gospel shall be laid down, and without reward shall be those who have fulfilled them. It is thus solved in both ways: just as Christ Jesus liberated us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us: so he also delivers us from the curse of the Gospel, which is established upon those who have not fulfilled its precepts, being made a curse for us, knowing also not to leave even the smallest portion of the talent, and to demand the last quarter (Matthew 5, and Mark 12).


<h2 id='tocuniq46'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) Because it is written: Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree, so that the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we would receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. Before we discuss the meaning and words of the Apostle, it seems right to briefly respond to the testimony of Deuteronomy, from which the Apostle drew these things (Deut. 21:22-23), and to compare it with other editions. Therefore, the seventy interpreters translated this passage as follows: But if there is any sin and a sentence of death, and he dies, you shall hang him on a tree, his body shall not remain overnight on the tree, but you shall bury him on that day; for cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree, and you shall not defile your land which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance. Aquila: And when there is a sin in a man deserving judgment of death, and he is killed, and you hang him on a tree, his corpse shall not remain overnight on the tree, but you shall bury him on the same day, for a hanging person is cursed by God, and you shall not defile your land which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance. Symmachus: But if a man commits a sin deserving judgment of death, and he is killed, and you hang him on a tree, his corpse shall not remain overnight on the tree, but you shall bury him on the same day, for he is hanged as a blasphemer against God, and you shall not defile your land which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance. Theodotius: And because there will be sin in a man under the judgement of death, and he will die, and you will hang him on a tree, his corpse shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall bury him the same day, for a hanged man is cursed by God; you shall not defile your land, which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance. Moreover, Adam, meaning earth or soil, is called in the Hebrew language. In the place where Aquila and Theodotius also translated similarly, saying, 'for a hanged man is cursed by God,' it is written in Hebrew as Chi Calalath Eloim Thalui. These words were interpreted by Ebion, the heresiarch, as follows: ὅτι ὕβρις Θεοῦ ὁ κρεμάμενος, which means, because it is an insult to God to be hanged. I remember finding this in the Dialogue of Jason and Papiscus, which was written in Greek: λοιδορία Θεοῦ ὁ κρεμάμενος, which means, the curse of God who is hanged. A Hebrew who taught me some Scripture told me that it can also be read as: because God was insulted. We have compiled these things for this reason, because it is a very famous question, and we are often accused by the Jews of infamy, namely that our Savior and Lord was cursed by God. First, it must be understood that not everyone who is hanged on a tree is cursed by God, but only the one who has sinned and has been condemned to death for his crime and lifted up on a cross. He is not cursed because he was crucified, but because he has fallen into such guilt that he deserved to be crucified. Then let us put forward the following argument, that the cause of the crucifixion is more fully explained below, as the Scripture testifies, because he was crucified for the blasphemy and cursing of God. Which Symmachus translated more clearly, saying: because he was hanged for blasphemy against God. Finally, let us ask them whether Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, who refused to worship the idol of Nebuchadnezzar, would have been considered cursed if they had been hanging on a tree (Dan. 3); and whether Eleazar, at ninety years old, under the reign of Antiochus, king of Syria, and the glorious mother with her seven sons, would have been deemed most blessed (2 Macc. 7), or most deserving of every curse? Certainly, if the cross that Haman had prepared for Mordecai (Esther VII) had not been mounted by himself for his own merit, I think that Mordecai would have ascended it, not as cursed, but as a holy man. This and other similar things prove that one is cursed who commits a worthy crime on the gallows: not the one who is crucified by the wickedness of judges, the power of enemies, the outcry of the crowd, the envy of virtues, or the anger of the king. And Naboth (also called Nabutham) was once condemned to death by the whole city of Jezrael at the request of Jezabel, as recorded in 3 Kings 21. But his blood is avenged in the person of Christ, many centuries later, as the Lord says to Osec: Call his name Jezrael, for a little while longer and I will avenge the blood of Jezrael on the house of Jeu, in Hosea 1:4. These things are against the Jews. Now, to return to our discussion, I cannot understand why the Apostle, when quoting Deuteronomy 21:23 which states, 'Cursed is every one who hangs on a tree before the Lord,' adds or subtracts anything. For if he had followed the authority of the Seventy interpreters, he should have, as it is published by them, joined the name of God. But if he thought that the Hebrews, writing in their own language, had that which is most true, and did not take all things as the Hebrew books have them, nor understand by prophesyings things not written in the Hebrew books, as he is esteemed to have done by many (Al. he would have done). From which it seems to me that the ancients among the Hebrews had the books of the prophets differently arranged from what they are now, and that the Apostle (as I said before) put sense into the Scripture, but not words: or, what is most to be admired, that after the passion of Christ, God's name was put to the Hebrew and to our copies by some one in order to disparage, as we said above, the believers in Christ who were offered to God as a curse. Therefore, with bold step I proceed to this contest, to challenge the books, nowhere is it written that anyone is cursed by God, and wherever a curse is placed, the name of God is never attached. 'Cursed are you above all beasts,' it is said to the serpent. And to Adam: 'Cursed is the earth in your works.' And to Cain: 'Cursed are you upon the earth.' And elsewhere: 'Cursed is Canaan, a slave shall he be to his brothers.' Moreover, in another place: Cursed be their fury, because it is bold, and their wrath, because it is harsh (Gen. XLIX, 7). It would be long if I were to enumerate all the curses that are written in Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Joshua; yet in none of them is the name of God added, to the extent that even Satan himself, when he promised concerning Job that if he were to be afflicted with great distress, he would blaspheme, hinted at this from a better perspective, saying: Unless you bless him to his face (Job I, 11). And in the Books of the Kings, Naboth, also known as Nabutham, is reported to have been stoned because he blessed God and the king (3 Kings 21). However, no one should be disturbed by the fact that Christ was cursed for us, because even God, who is said to have cursed him, made him a curse for us, although Christ did not know sin. And the Savior emptied himself of the fullness of the Father, taking on the form of a servant (Philippians 2): he died in life, and the wisdom of God was called foolishness, so that what was foolish to God might become wiser for men (1 Corinthians 1). And in the sixty-eighth psalm it says about himself: O God, you know my foolishness, and my sins are not hidden from you (Psalm 68, 7). Therefore, the insult of the Lord is our glory. He died so that we may live. He descended to hell so that we may ascend to heaven. He became foolishness so that we may become wise. He emptied himself of the fullness and form of God, taking on the form of a servant, so that the fullness of divinity may dwell in us, and we may become servants of the Lord. He hung on a tree, so that the sin we committed on the tree of the knowledge of good and evil would be erased by the hanging on the tree. His cross turned bitter waters into a sweet taste, and a lost axe, immersed in the depths and thrown into the waters of the Jordan, was lifted up. In the end, he became a curse, I say, one who was born not of a woman: so that the blessings that were promised to Abraham would be transferred to the nations, with him as the author and forerunner, and the promise of the Spirit would be fulfilled through faith in us. We must receive this in two ways, either in the gifts of spiritual virtues or in the understanding of spiritual Scriptures.


<h2 id='tocuniq47'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 15 seq.) Brothers, I speak according to man: yet no one rejects or adds to a man's testament. The promises were made to Abraham and to his seed. It does not say "and to seeds," as if referring to many, but referring to one, "and to your seed," who is Christ. Now I say this: the testament confirmed by God, which was given four hundred and thirty years later, does not nullify the promise, so as to abolish it. For if the inheritance is from the law, it is no longer from the promise. But God gave to Abraham through a promise. The apostle, who became all things to all people in order to gain all, is a debtor to both Greeks and barbarians, to the wise and the foolish. He even became foolish for the Galatians, whom he had recently called foolish. For he did not use the same arguments with them as he did with the Romans, but simpler ones; things that even fools could understand, and almost from the roadside. And so that he would not appear to have done it out of ignorance and not skill, he appeases the wise reader in advance, and he tempers what he is about to say with a preface: Brothers, I am speaking as a man. For what I am about to say, I do not say according to God: I do not speak according to hidden wisdom, and those who can eat solid food, but according to those who are nourished by the milk of a tender stomach, and are not able to bear the great things that are said. Hence, even to the Corinthians, among whom fornication was heard of, and such fornication that not even among the Gentiles, he says: I say, and not the Lord. And to the same in the second (letter): What I speak, I do not speak according to the Lord, but as if in foolishness (2 Cor. 11:17). Some people think that, using examples of human similarity, he speaks about the testament of a man and the death of the testator and other human things. He said: Brothers, I speak according to human understanding: but to me it seems, and indeed because of what they think, but especially because of what follows as a preface, that is: He does not say 'and to the seeds', as if it referred to many, but as if it referred to one, and to your seed, who is Christ. While perusing all the Scriptures in meaning and memory, I have never found the word 'testamentum' written in the plural number, but whether in a positive or negative sense, it is always in the singular number. Moreover, it is also stated that 'This is the testament confirmed by God,' if someone compares diligently the Hebrew volumes and other editions with the translation of the Seventy Interpreters, they will find that where 'testamentum' is written, it does not mean 'testament' but rather 'pact,' which is said in the Hebrew language as 'Berith' (). Hence it is evident that the Apostle did what he promised, and that the senses used by the Galatians were not hidden but everyday and ordinary, and that which, had he not anticipated it, I would say would displease the wise. In calculating the years in this passage from the time when the Lord spoke to Abraham, saying, 'And in your seed all nations shall be blessed' (Gen. 22:18), until the lawgiver Moses - whether they be four hundred and thirty, or in what way the Lord promised to Abraham in Genesis that his descendants would come out of the land of bondage after four hundred years. For it is not a small matter, and sought after by many, I do not know whether it was invented by someone. Also, what is read in the same book about Thamar and her two little ones (Genesis 38), that is, that the first, who is called Zara, extended his hand and the midwife tied a scarlet thread on it, and then when he withdrew his hand, the posterior hand, called Phares, reached out, it is fitting in this present place that it showed Israel putting their hand in the work of the Law, and with it the blood of the prophets and of the Savior himself contaminated. But afterward, the people of the Gentiles burst forth, for whom it is often said that it was destroyed, and the middle wall that was between the Jews and the Gentiles was broken down, so that there would be one flock and one shepherd, and there would be glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. However, the simple meaning that is hidden in this passage has this force, that the Apostle teaches that the promises which were made to Abraham cannot be destroyed by the Law, which was given afterward, and that the later things do not take precedence over the earlier ones, since the promises were given to Abraham four hundred and thirty years before, that all the nations would be blessed in him. But the observance of the law, which whoever had done it, should live in it, was given four hundred and thirty years after Moses on Mount Sinai. On the other hand, it could be said here: Why then was it necessary to give the law after so long a time of promise, when even with the law, the suspicion of a broken promise could arise, and the law given not being profitable, while the promise remained? Anticipating this question, the Apostle himself poses and explains it in the following, saying:

<h2 id='tocuniq48'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Verse 19, 20.) What then? The law was given because of transgressions until the seed should come to whom the promise was made; it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. Indeed, the law was not given for the just but for the unjust and those who are not subject, for the impious and sinners (I Tim. II, 9): and to reiterate at a deeper level, after idolatry, to which they were enslaved in Egypt, so that they would forget the God of their fathers and thereafter say, These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, the rites of worshipping God and the punishment for transgressors were established in the hands of the mediator, Christ Jesus, because all things were made through him, and without him was made nothing: not only the heavens, earth, sea, and all the things that we see, but also those things that were imposed on the stubborn people like the yoke of the Law through Moses (Joan. I). And it is written to Timothy: For there is one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus (I Tim. II, 5). After he deigned to be born of the Virgin for our salvation, the mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus, is called the intercessor. But before he assumed a human body, and was with the Father as the Word of God in the beginning, he is called mediator without the addition of man, whom he had not yet assumed, only being designated as such for all the saints to whom the Word of God was made known, specifically Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and later Moses and all the Prophets mentioned in Scripture. But when it says, 'The law was ordained by angels,' it means that in every old Testament passage where an angel is first seen and then as if God speaking is introduced, the angel is indeed seen from among the many ministers, but it is the mediator who speaks, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' (Exodus 3:6). It is not surprising if God speaks in angels, since God also speaks in the prophets through the angels who are in humans, as Zachariah says. And the angel who spoke in me said (Zach. II, 3); and subsequently it continues: Thus says the Lord Almighty. For the angel who had been called in the prophet did not dare to speak on his own behalf: Thus says the Lord Almighty. We ought to understand the hand of the mediator, his power and strength. For although he is one with the Father according to his divinity, he is understood to be distinct from him according to the office of mediator. However, since the order of the reading is confused and disrupted by hyperbaton, it seems to be rendered to us as follows: The law was given through angels into the hand of the mediator, ordained by angels for transgressions until the promised seed should come. But there is no doubt that semen signifies Christ, who is also proved to be the son of Abraham from the beginning of Matthew, as the Scripture says: The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

<h2 id='tocuniq49'>(Vers. 21 seqq.)</h2>

(V. 21 seqq.) So is the law against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness would have been by the law. But the Scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. The promise should not be considered excluded for the reason that what followed it seems to abolish what came before it, but rather because it could not give life, nor grant what the initial promise had promised, it is evident that it was given to guard the promise, not to overthrow it. For if a law had been given that could give life and fulfill what the promise had pledged, then the promise would truly be excluded by the law. But now, because of transgressions, as we have said before, it even more accuses those sinners to whom the promise was given, who were imprisoned, so to speak, in custody, because they did not want to wait for the promised innocence through the freedom of their will, hindered by legal restraints, and reduced to the servitude of commandments, in order to be preserved until the coming of future faith in Christ, which would bring about the fulfillment of the promise. Nor indeed should it be considered that Scripture is the author of sin, because it is said to have concluded all things under sin, since the commandment which is prescribed by the law rather reveals and accuses sin, than is the cause of sin. Just as a judge is not the author of crime by punishing wicked men: but he convicts them, and by the authority of his condemning sentence pronounces them guilty, so that he may afterwards absolve those deserving of punishment by his mercy if he wishes.


<h2 id='tocuniq50'>(Vers. 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 24 seqq.) Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. A tutor is appointed for infants, to restrain their youthful behavior and keep their hearts inclined toward vice, while their tender childhood is educated with studies, and they are prepared, through fear of punishment, for the greater disciplines of philosophy and the rule of the state. However, the teacher and father is not the same as the tutor, nor does the one who is being taught expect the inheritance and knowledge of the tutor; but the tutor guards the son who is not his own, and will depart from him once he reaches the proper time to receive the inheritance. Finally, even the name 'tutor' itself signifies this, as it is derived from the fact that he guides and leads the boys. Therefore, the law of Moses was given to the unruly people like a strict tutor, in order to watch over them and prepare them for the future faith, which has now come and we have believed in Christ. We are no longer under the tutor, the guardians and caretakers depart from us, and as we enter the proper time of maturity, we are called true sons of God, who were not born by an abolished law, but by the mother of Faith, which is in Christ Jesus. But if someone, after the completion of the time of their age, when they are already called an heir and a free person and a son, wishes to be under a pedagogue, let them know that they cannot live according to the laws of children. For where can that be fulfilled now: Three times a year all your males shall appear in the presence of the Lord your God (Exodus 23:17), with Jerusalem overthrown and the temple completely destroyed to ashes? Where are the salvific offerings for sin? Where is the eternal fire of holocausts for the celestial stars, with the altar utterly demolished? But what punishment can be decreed for wickedness, as Scripture says: Remove that evil from your midst (Deut. XIII, 5), for both the Jews who are subject to servitude and the Roman rulers? And thus it will be, that they shall not live under the authority of a father or a tutor: for the law cannot be fulfilled after the succession of faith, and while faith is sought as a tutor, the law is not binding.

<h2 id='tocuniq51'>(Vers. 27, 28.)</h2>

(Verse 27, 28.) For whoever is baptized in Christ, has put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus. As the Son of God demonstrates through faith, which is in Christ Jesus, we are born, saying: For whoever is baptized in Christ, has put on Christ. And that Christ is our garment is not only proven in this place, but also in another, with the same urging from Paul: Put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans XIII, 14). Therefore, if those who have been baptized in Christ have put on Christ, it is clear that those who have not put on Christ have not been baptized in Christ. For it was said to those who were thought to be faithful and to have received the baptism of Christ: Put on the Lord Jesus Christ. If anyone receives only the bodily water that is seen with the eyes as a washing, they have not put on the Lord Jesus Christ. For even Simon in the Acts of the Apostles received the washing of water, but because he did not have the Holy Spirit, he was not clothed with Christ. And heretics or hypocrites, and those who live in filth, indeed seem to receive baptism, but I know not if they have the garment of Christ. Therefore, let us consider lest perhaps someone is found in us, who, because he does not have the garment of Christ, is accused of not being baptized in Christ. But when someone has once put on Christ, and has been thrown into the flame, shining with the heat of the Holy Spirit, it is not understood whether it is gold or silver. As long as heat possesses matter in this way, it is an igneous color, and all diversity of race, condition, and bodies is taken away by this kind of garment. For neither is the Jew, nor is the Greek. We must consider a Gentile to be Greek, because Ἕλλην signifies both Greek and Gentile. Nor is the Jew therefore better because he is circumcised; nor is the Gentile therefore worse because he has a foreskin; but he is better or worse depending on the quality of his faith, whether he is a Jew or a Greek. Greetings and freedom are not separated by status, but by faith, because a slave can be better than a free person, and a free person can be morally corrupt. Similarly, male and female are separated by physical strength and weakness. However, faith is considered a matter of devotion of the mind, and it often happens that a woman becomes the cause of salvation for a man, and a man leads a woman in matters of religion. But when things are like this, and all the diversity of gender, status, and bodies is taken away by the baptism of Christ and his garment, we are all one in Christ Jesus, just as the Father and Son are one in themselves, so we may be one in them.


<h2 id='tocuniq52'>(Vers 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29) But if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise. For the promises were made to Abraham and to his seed, which is Christ Jesus. Therefore, those who are Christ's children, that is, his seed, are also called Abraham's seed, since they are descendants from his seed. However, whenever our Lord Jesus is referred to as Abraham's seed, it should be understood in a physical sense, that he is generated from his lineage. However, as often as we, who have believed in Him after receiving the word of the Savior, have embraced the nobility of the ancestry of Abraham, to whom the promise was made, we must spiritually receive the seed of faith and preaching. Furthermore, it should also be considered that when speaking of the Lord, the promises are said to be to Abraham and his seed, that is, to Christ Jesus, in the plural. But when referring to those who are Abraham's seed through Christ, the promise is referred to in the singular, as in the present passage: Therefore you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to the promise. For it was fitting that what was said in the plural in Christ should be placed in the singular in many people. It follows:

<h2 id='tocuniq53'>(Chap. IV.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 4 - Verses 1, 2) But I say, as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, though he is the lord of all; but he is under tutors and administrators until the appointed time by the father. This little heir, who is no different from a slave though he is the lord of all, is under tutors and administrators until the appointed time by the father, signifying the whole human race up to the coming of Christ, and, to speak more broadly, until the end of the world. For just as all die in the first man Adam, so too shall all be made alive in the second man, Christ, even those who were born before Christ's coming. And so it happens that we, the descendants of the fathers, were subject to the Law, while they were saved by grace through their descendants. This understanding is in agreement with the Catholic Church, which affirms the one providence of the Old and New Testaments and does not distinguish in time those whom it has united in condition. We are all built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Jesus Christ himself as the chief cornerstone. In him, the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord. In him, you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit. (Ephesians 2:20-22) Truly in Christ, we are all one bread, and we have come to an agreement upon the earth. And just as we are founded upon the prophets, so too did the patriarchs stand on the foundation of the apostles. Moreover, prophets can also be understood as tutors and actors, whose words we were daily instructed in for the coming of the Savior, just as the Law of Moses was expounded by the pedagogue. And also the angels of the little ones, who daily see the face of the Father and intercede for them. Concerning whom it is said: He will send his angels around those who fear him, and he will deliver them (Ps. 33:8). Both priests and princes can be understood to now provide a form, who then ruled the people. And rightly so, these are said to be under tutors and actors, who, having the spirit of fear, have not yet deserved to receive the spirit of freedom and adoption. For the age of infancy fears sin, dreads a tutor, does not believe itself to be free, although by nature it is the master. And according to both interpretations, which we have called tutors and actors, or prophets, or angels, this little one remains under tutors and actors until the legitimate time of the perfect man is fulfilled. But the legitimate time, as according to Roman laws, is limited by a period of twenty-five years, so Christ's advent is considered the perfection of the human race. As soon as he comes, and we all grow into mature men, the pedagogues and tutors depart from us. Then we will enjoy the authority of the Lord and the possession of our inheritance, in which previously we were considered somewhat strangers.

<h2 id='tocuniq54'>(Vers 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) And so, when we were little children, we were enslaved under the elements of this world. The elements of the world, whom he had previously called tutors and guardians, he named: because we were not yet able to receive the coming of the Son of God, we were being instructed in their midst. Some think that they are angels who preside over the four elements of the world: namely, earth, water, fire, and air: and it is necessary that before anyone believes in Christ, they are governed by those judges. They believe that the elements of the world are the sky and the earth, and what is within them, which are commonly called the sun, moon, seas, forests, and mountains, and that the Greeks and the nations of the barbarians and the Romans, the sink of all superstitions, worship them as gods, as do the wise men of Greece. But when Christ comes, we are set free, understanding that these are creatures, not deities. Others interpret the elements of the world as the Law of Moses and the words of the prophets, so that through them we may receive the fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom, as if through the beginnings and introductions of literature. Finally, to those who should already have been perfect, and having neglected the truth, were still clinging to the principles of learning, the Apostle writes in his Epistle to the Hebrews: For when by this time you ought to be teachers, you have need again that someone teach you the first principles of the oracles of God (Heb. V, 12). On the other hand, it can be objected to us that the Apostle Paul, writing to the Colossians, called other things the elements of the world: Beware, he says, lest any man cheat you by philosophy and vain deceit, according to the tradition of men: according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ (Coloss. II, 8). But in addition to this, according to the tradition of men and empty deception, he shows that not the same elements are named for the Colossians and the Galatians. For by these elements, when the fullness of time comes, we are redeemed and, advancing to greater things, we receive the adoption of sons. But nothing is said regarding what follows from those elements; rather, they are simply understood as letters. Therefore, as we have said, the Law of Moses and the prophets can be understood as elements of letters, in that they are joined together by dissyllables and names are learned not for their own sake, but for the benefit of another thing, so that we may be able to read a discourse with a connected meaning, in which the sense and order of words are considered more than the beginnings of letters. But we have interpreted the Law and the prophets as the elements of the world, which are usually accepted by those who are in the world, as Paul himself says: God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself (2 Cor. 5:19). And in the Gospel: And the world was made through him, and the world did not receive him (John 1:10). Some also stray more freely in this matter, seeking whether the Law has a shadow of future goods in another world, of which the Savior says: I am not from this world (John 8:23), that we may first be like little children and be placed under the elements of the beginnings, and gradually proceed to the highest rank, and receive the place of adoption, which we once lost.


<h2 id='tocuniq55'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. Pay close attention to the fact that it does not say "born through woman," which Marcion and other heresies desire, who pretend to simulate the flesh of Christ. But it says "born of woman," so that it may be believed that He was born not through her, but from her. And the fact that the Holy and Blessed Mother of the Lord is called woman and not Virgin, is also written in the Gospel according to Matthew: when Joseph's wife is mentioned (Luke 2), and when she is rebuked by the Lord Himself as a woman (John 2). For it was not necessary to always refer to the Virgin as if cautious and timid, since 'woman' signifies the sex more than the coupling with a man. And according to the understanding of the Greeks, γυνὴ can be interpreted as both 'wife' and 'woman'. But leaving aside all of that: just as he became subject to the law in order to redeem those who were under the law, so too he desired to be born from a woman for the sake of those who were born of a woman. For even though he was free from sin, he received baptism in the Jordan river as if in repentance, in order to teach others that they must be cleansed through baptism and be reborn as children through the new adoption of the Spirit. Not understanding at all, John the Baptist prevented him from approaching the baptism, saying: I should be baptized by you (Matt. III, 14). And immediately the sacrament is taught: Unconditionally: for it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness, so that he who came for the salvation of mankind would not omit anything from human conduct. Let someone ask and say: If he became under the Law for this reason, in order to redeem those who were under the Law: it would indeed have been impossible to redeem those who were under the Law unless he himself had become under the Law; or he became without the Law, in order to redeem those who were not under the Law: or if he did not become without the Law, he does not redeem those who were not under the Law. But if it was possible to redeem those who were without the Law, so that he himself would not be made without the Law: therefore, he was made under the Law unnecessarily, in order to redeem those who were under the Law. He will solve this question shortly, if anyone uses that example: and he was considered with those who were without the Law. For although it is incorrectly edited in Latin codices due to the simplicity of the interpreters: And he was considered with the wicked (Luke 22:37); yet it should be known that ἄνομον, which is written here, means something else among the Greeks, and ἄδικον, which is found in Latin volumes, means something else. Anomos is derived from the Greek word ἄνομος, which means one who is without law and is not bound by any right. Adikos, on the other hand, means unjust or unfair. The Apostle himself, in another place, said: 'When I was not under the Law of God; but under the Law of Christ' (I Cor. IX); and certainly in this testimony, ἄνομος is written in Greek. And the one who has interpreted it well could have similarly interpreted the same word there, if he had not been deceived by the ambiguity. But the word itself, when examined more closely, means those who were redeemed but later ceased to be on God's side: those who were not under the Law were not so much redeemed as bought. Hence, to the Corinthians, among whom fornication was heard, and such fornication which not even among the Gentiles (Ibid.V), it is written: You were bought with a price, not redeemed: for they were not under the Law. Therefore, we receive the adoption of the children of God: and being redeemed by Christ, we cease to be under the servitude of the elements of the world and the power of tutors. Just as we have shown the difference between redeeming and buying, let us also consider what it means to receive and accept the adoption of children.

<h2 id='tocuniq56'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6) But because you are children of God, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!” Clearly the Apostle Paul names three spirits, the Spirit of the Son of God, as in the present place, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts (Romans 8:14). And the Spirit of God, as in that place: All who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. And the Holy Spirit, as in that place: Your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you (1 Corinthians 6:19). That the Holy Spirit is distinct from the Son of God is clearly and demonstrated in the Gospel: Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, neither in this age nor in the age to come will it be forgiven him (Luke 12:10). This is because, due to their ignorance of the Scriptures (as Firmianus also states in his eighth letter to Demetrianus), many affirm that the Holy Spirit is often referred to as the Father and sometimes as the Son. And when we believe clearly in the Trinity, removing the third person, they do not want his substance, but his name. But so as not to make it long (for it is not a dialogue, but a commentary is written), I will briefly show that the fifty psalm mentioned three spirits, the prophet saying: Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Do not cast me away from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Give me the joy of your salvation, and strengthen me with the principal spirit. The principal spirit is called Father, because the Son is from the Father, and not the Father from the Son. However, the spirit of righteousness, truth, and justice signifies the Lord Christ. For the Father has given all judgment to the Son (John 5:22), as David says: O God, give your judgment to the king, and your power to the son of the king (Psalm 72:1). Furthermore, he calls the Holy Spirit by its open name. These, although they differ in terms and persons, are united in substance and nature: and the same Spirit is called at one time the Father, at another time the Son, by reason of the union of nature. But the argument by which he endeavours to prove that we are no longer under the Law but under the grace of the Lord Jesus, is concluded with this purpose. He had said before that we should receive the adoption of sons: now he proves that we are sons of God, by the Spirit which we have in us. For never, he says, would we dare to say: Our Father who art in heaven: Hallowed be thy Name, unless from the conscience of the Holy Spirit dwelling within us, and with a loud voice crying out the great things of sense and doctrine: Abba, Father (Rom. VIII, 15) . Abba is Hebrew, signifying the same as Father. And the Sacred Scripture preserves this custom in several places, to put the Hebrew word with its interpretation. Aser, wealth. Tabitha, Dorcas (Acts 9): and in Genesis, Mesech, servant (Gen. 15), and other similar things. However, when Abba Father is said in Hebrew or Syriac language: and our Lord in the Gospel commands, that no one should be called father except God (Matt. 23), by some liberty in monasteries either we may call others by this name, or we may be satisfied to be called. And certainly he himself commanded this when he said not to swear (Matt. 5). If we do not swear, we should not even mention anyone's father. If we interpret differently about the father, we will be forced to have a different opinion about swearing. It should also be noted that in the Scriptures, a cry does not refer to a loud voice, but to understanding and the greatness of teachings. For in Exodus, the Lord replied to Moses: Why do you cry out to me? (Exodus 14:15) when Moses' voice did not precede at all. However, with a heart pierced and groaning deeply for the people, the Scripture called it a cry. So then, whoever has the Spirit of the Son of God is a son of God; likewise, on the other hand, whoever does not have the Spirit of the Son of God cannot be called a son of God.

<h2 id='tocuniq57'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) So now you are no longer a slave but a son. And if a son, then an heir through Christ. And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!” So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God. Ask of me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance, and the ends of the earth as your possession (Ps. 2:7-8). But what we say in this place, we must also observe in other cases, that we should discuss the whole human race in the singular number. For all who believe, we are one in Christ Jesus, and members of His body, and being brought to the perfect man, we have Him as our head, for the head of man is Christ (1 Cor. 11:2).


<h2 id='tocuniq58'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Vv. 8, 9) But at that time, indeed, unknowingly you served those who were not gods by nature. But now, truly knowing God, or rather being known by Him, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire to be in bondage again? He reproaches the Galatians for having turned from idolatry to the faith in the true God, and asks how they can go back to the weak and beggarly elements, after abandoning idols which were not gods by nature, and after knowing God, or rather being known by Him, and even receiving the Spirit of adoption as children. He compares them to little children under guardians and tutors, who desire to go back to the weak and beggarly elements, which were given in the desert to the people with weak and poor understanding, because they were not able to receive and endure anything greater. But the same elements that he now called weak and needy, he placed the elements of the world only above. And where the elements of the world are said, there it is not added, weak and needy. Hence again where they are called weak, worldly, as we said above, the name is silent. Therefore, I think as long as someone is a child, and has not fulfilled the appointed time from their father, so that they can be called a son and heir, they are under the elements of the world, namely, under the Law of Moses. But when, after having returned to the Law, which he owed to his son, he desired to be circumcised and follow the whole letter of Jewish superstition, then the things which previously had been for him only the elements of the world, are also called weak and needy beginnings. For they are of such little use to their worshippers that they are not even able to provide them with what they had previously provided, Jerusalem, the temple and the altar having been destroyed. Let someone respond and say: If the law and precepts that are written in the Law are weak and needy elements, and those who have known God, or rather, have been known by Him, should not be obligated to observe the Law (so that they may not begin to worship not so much the God by whom they have been known, but rather turn back to those who are not gods by nature), then Moses and the prophets observed the Law and did not know God, nor were they known by Him; or if they knew God, they did not fulfill the commands of the Law to a minimum extent. To say both is dangerous: Either they did not do what the Law commands and thus did not know God, or they did not know God while holding fast to the weak and beggarly elements of the Law. This can be resolved by saying that they, like Paul, became Jews in order to gain Jews and, in accordance with a vow, shaved their heads in order to appease the Jews who had been instructed about them, accusing them of acting against the Law of Moses and God. Thus, the holy men did indeed observe the things prescribed by the Law, but they focused more on the spirit of the Law than on the letter. Just as Abraham desired to see the day of Christ, the veil being lifted from his face, and saw it and rejoiced: They were made weak with a weak people, so that they might make the weak gainful. (1 Corinthians IX)  And to those who were under the Law, it was as if they themselves were under the Law, in order to separate them from the idols to which they had become accustomed in Egypt. Indeed, it is absurd to think that Moses and the others who spoke with God were in a condition such that we should not believe them, and that the predetermined time had come from the Father, and that they had been redeemed from the legal bondage, and had obtained the adoption of sons, and had inherited with Christ. For whatever wisdom God has bestowed on the entire human race, like a only-begotten Son, the same He has also bestowed on each of the saints in their own order and dispensation. Heretics find occasion to detract from the Creator, because He created the world and gave the Law, by saying that the Law given to us by Moses is weak and lacking. To them we will respond, as we have already said, that it is weak and lacking for those who turn back to it after the grace of the Gospel. But before the predetermined time came from the Father, the elements were called not so much weak and needy as the world. Finally, before the Gospel of Christ was proclaimed throughout the whole world, they had their brightness from the legal precepts. But after the greater light of the grace of the Gospel shone forth and the Sun of righteousness revealed Himself to the whole world, the light of the stars was hidden, and their rays grew dim, so that the Apostle said in another place: For that which was glorified had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth (2 Cor. 3). What he now says in other words, to declare, that the Law of Moses which before the Gospel was rich, and wealthy, and glorious, after the coming of Christ, in comparison with it, was as it were weak and poor, diminished and destroyed by him who was greater than Solomon, and the temple, and Jonah. For what is written: He must increase, but I must decrease (John 3:30): I think it is said not so much from John, as from the standpoint of the Law, because lesser things always yield to greater ones, and perfect things are put before beginnings. But on the other hand, we will confirm the weak and poor elements, the traditions of the Jews, and the literal understanding which are not good justifications and not good commandments. For truly, the understanding of the Law is strong and rich in spirituality, so that it should not be called a mere element or compared to the element of the future age and the life in Christ Jesus, which the angels and heavenly powers now live. But when compared with the Jewish interpretation, it is called not so much an element, that is, a beginning, as a perfection. And when he says: Now truly knowing God, or rather known by him, he shows that the Galatians understood God after the worship of idols, or rather they were judged worthy of that knowledge. Not that God, the Creator of all things, is ignorant of anything; but it is said that only those who have changed error for piety are said to know. The Lord knows those who are His (2 Timothy 2:19). And the Savior in the Gospel says: 'I am the good shepherd, and I know mine, and mine know me' (John 10:14). On the other hand, to the wicked He says: 'I do not know you, depart from me, workers of iniquity' (Luke 13:27). And to the foolish virgins He says: 'I do not know you, (be) away' (Matthew 25:12).

<h2 id='tocuniq59'>(Vers. 10, 11.)</h2>

(Verse 10, 11.) Observing days, and months, and times, and years, I fear for you, lest I have labored in vain among you. Whoever does not worship the Father in spirit and truth, does not know the Sabbath rest that is reserved for the holy ones, about which God speaks: 'If they shall enter into my rest' (Psalm 94:11). And he does not remember those times about which it is written: 'Remember the days of old' (Isaiah 46:9). And elsewhere: 'I have remembered the days of old, I have considered the years of eternity' (Psalm 76:6). He observes Jewish days and months and times and years. He observes days like the Sabbath and the new moons, and from the tenth day of the first month to the fourteenth day, when the physical lamb of the sacrifice is reserved, and from the fourteenth day to the twenty-first day of the same month, when unleavened bread is eaten, not of sincerity and truth, but in the old leaven of malice and wickedness of the Pharisees. He also observes the seven weeks, which he counts according to the Jewish rite after the unleavened bread, and celebrates the Israelite Pentecost. Also in the seventh month, on the first of the month, there is the sound of trumpets. Also on the tenth of the same month, they observe expiation and fasting, and they celebrate the festival of tents according to custom, imitating the Jewish days. They also observe the months, the first and seventh month, not understanding the mystery of the truth. They also worship the seasons, who come to Jerusalem three times each year, thinking that they fulfill the commandment of the Lord, who says, 'Three times in the year you shall keep a feast to me: the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of the Firstfruits of Harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year' (Exodus 23:14, following). And elsewhere: In three times of the year your male will appear in the presence of the Lord your God (Ibid. XVII). But what he says, and years, I think is said about the seventh year of remission, and about the fiftieth, which they call Jubilee. The Apostle explains this place more fully to the Colossians, saying: Therefore let no one judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of a festival day or the new moon or the sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come (Coloss. II, 16). He placed a part of the feast to signify the distinction of perpetual festivity, so that we may have not a brief and, so to speak, a certain portion of the whole body, but the entire span of our life a perpetual solemnity in Christ. And in order to connect the following with the preceding, he immediately adds and speaks: If indeed you died with Christ from the elements of this world, why do you still submit to decrees as if you were living in this world? You shall not touch, neither taste, nor handle, which all are to perish with the using, after the commandments and doctrines of men. Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh. To which someone who responds simply will say: the Jewish observance days are not the same as ours. For we do not celebrate the unleavened Passover, but the resurrection and the cross. Nor do we count seven weeks according to the custom of Israel in Pentecost, but we honor the coming of the Holy Spirit. And so that the disorderly gathering of the people would not diminish faith in Christ, certain days were established so that we all would come together as one. Not that the day on which we gather is more famous, but that on whatever day we gather, 457 may mutual joy arise. However, one who tries to answer the opposing question more sharply affirms that all days are equal, and that Christ is not crucified only on Good Friday and does not rise on Sunday, but that every day is holy and every day we partake of the flesh of the Lord. Fasting and assemblies on certain days are established by wise men who are more occupied with the world than with God, and they cannot, or rather do not want to, gather in the Church for the whole time of their life, and before human actions, offer their sacrifice of prayers to God. For how many are there who at least practice these few things that are established, either the times of prayer or the times of fasting? And so, just as it is permitted for us either to fast always or to pray always, and to celebrate without interruption the Lord's Day with the receiving of the Lord's body, rejoicing: not so is it allowed for the Jews to sacrifice a lamb at all times, to observe Pentecost, to erect tabernacles, to fast every day. But indeed, he cautiously moderated his words between the authority of an Apostle and the gentleness of a holy man, bringing forth: I fear, lest perhaps I have labored in vain among you without cause. For if he had desired to condemn abruptly, he would certainly have said: I fear you: for without cause I have labored among you. But now seeing that they have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge, he did not completely despair of their salvation, who had been deceived by pious error, nor did he leave them reproachable, so as not to give them and others the occasion to similarly err. But I fear you, he says, for what you are, I fear for you. The teacher works without cause, when he himself challenges the students to greater things, and they, having fallen back, revert to lesser and humble things.

<h2 id='tocuniq60'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12) Be like me, because I am also like you. When I say this, it is like when I became weak for your sake and was unable to speak as a spiritual person, but as a weak and immature person in Christ. And because you were not yet able to eat solid food, I only fed you with milk, like infants. I did not want you to remain in a state of infancy forever, but to gradually grow into adolescence and adulthood, so that you could eat solid food. Therefore, you should also be like me, having a higher understanding and moving beyond milk to stronger nourishment and greater sustenance. But this is said as if the imitator of the Savior, who did not consider himself equal to God, but humbled himself, taking on the form of a servant; and he was found in appearance as a man, so that we might become gods from men, and no longer die; but rising with Christ, we would be called his friends and brothers, and be disciples like the master, and servants like the Lord. And it can also be understood in this way: I beseech you, he says, brothers, that you imitate me, disregarding Jewish observance of days, months, seasons, and years, which are shadows of what is to come. I, who lived without complaint under the Law, considered everything as rubbish and trash, so that I may gain Christ. Indeed, I was once like you are now, tightly bound by the same narrow observations, and I persecuted and devastated the Church of Christ because it did not adhere to those things.

<h2 id='tocuniq61'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) Brothers, I beseech you, you have not wronged me. But you know that because of the weakness of the flesh I proclaimed the Gospel to you before. Join the previous sentence to what follows, so that it may be clearer, in this order which we have constructed: I beseech you, brothers, be like me, for I am like you. This is similar to the following: We beseech you for Christ, be reconciled to God (2 Cor. 5:20). And also elsewhere: I beseech, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made (1 Tim. 2:1)." } Peter also says these words: I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ (1 Peter 5:1). These words indeed provoke us to humility and shake off the arrogance of bishops, who, as if standing on some lofty pedestal, hardly deign to see mortals and speak to their fellow servants. Let them learn from the Apostle that the erring and foolish Galatians are called brothers. Let them learn from the gentle words of admonition: I beseech you (1 Corinthians 11). But what he asks is that they become imitators of him, just as he is of Christ;indeed, to follow in his footsteps is not a great demand: just as he became lower for their sake, so they should ascend from the lower to the higher. 'You have not harmed me,' he says. A disciple harms his teacher if he squanders his teachings and efforts through his own negligence. The Galatians had not harmed the Apostle, for they had faithfully kept his Gospel and commandments up to the present time. Certainly, when I first proclaimed the Gospel to you, because of the weakness of your flesh, since you were not able to receive greater sacraments, I preached to you as if you were children, and I pretended to be weak myself, so that I might make you weak. Did you not receive me as an angel, as Christ Jesus? Therefore, since in no way did you harm me during that time, and you considered me humble and lowly for your sake, similar to the Son of God: how am I now attacked by you, provoking me to greater things, and grieving over the loss of my labor and that arrangement by which I had pretended to be small, now rendered in vain? But because of the weakness of the flesh, not their own, but of those who hear, Paul announces to the Galatians: those who were unable to subject the flesh to the word of God, but rather as fleshly, received nothing of spiritual understanding. So that it may be made more evident, let us set forth an example. Through the weakness of the flesh, he teaches, who says: If they cannot contain themselves, let them marry. And: If a woman's husband dies, she is free: she may marry whom she wishes, only in the Lord (I Cor. VII, 9, 39). But he certainly does not teach through the weakness of the flesh, saying these things: You are free from your wife; do not seek a wife. And: It is time, that those who have wives, be as if they do not have them (Ibid. 27, 29). For some precepts are given for the spiritual, others for the carnal. And there is a difference between what is commanded according to authority, and what is commanded according to indulgence.

<h2 id='tocuniq62'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) And you did not despise or reject your temptation, which was in my flesh, but you received me as the angel of God, as Christ Jesus. It is a difficult passage and deserves careful attention. Indeed, I have preached to you as little children and infants, because of the weakness of your flesh. I started with the basics and, so to speak, stumbled among you. This style of preaching and feigned weakness was my way of guiding you. But your temptation was whether you would accept and appreciate things that seemed small and humble compared to what others were offering. You, who are capable of grasping not small but great things, were so amazed that you received me when I spoke to you as if I were an angel, and, if I may say so, as if I were the Son of God. Therefore, this temptation of yours, by which I tested you in the announcement of my carnal speech, was not despised or insignificant; but it had more worth than I estimated. This place can also be explained in this way: when I came to you, I did not come with wise words, but as a humble and despised man, not bringing anything great, but Christ crucified. So when you saw me in a body subject to weakness, offering the kingdom of heaven, you did not ridicule me or consider me worthy of contempt; for you understood the humility of my flesh and the lowliness of my appearance, which I took on for your sake. Or perhaps you thought I should be despised, as someone pitied by unbelievers. But on the contrary, you received me as humble, lowly, and despised, even as an angel or more than an angel. Certainly, we can suspect that the Apostle, at the time when he first came to the Galatians, was sick; and although he was held back by the weakness of his body, he did not stop or suppress his voice, so as not to preach the Gospel that he had begun. For they report that he often endured a severe headache, and that this was the angel of Satan, who was sent to him to strike him in the flesh, so that he would not become conceited. This weakness and bodily suffering was a temptation among those to whom the Gospel was being preached: whether they should despise him, who promised lofty things, when they saw him subjected to bodily illnesses. And it can also be said that, at the beginning of his coming to the Galatians, he endured insults, persecutions, and bodily afflictions from those who opposed the Gospel; and this was the greatest temptation for the Galatians, as they saw the Apostle of Christ being beaten. And when he says, 'you received me as an angel, as Christ Jesus,' he shows that Christ is greater than an angel, whom the Psalmist had sung as being slightly lower than angels according to the dispensation of the body; and he demonstrates that his words at the beginning had such power that they were considered both angelic and Christ-like.


<h2 id='tocuniq63'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Vers. 15, 16.) Where, then, is your blessedness? For I testify to you that, if it were possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me. So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth? Blessed is the one who walks in the way of virtues, but only if they have reached the virtues themselves. It is not enough to have turned away from vices, unless you embrace what is best. For it is not the beginnings that are worthy of praise in good pursuits, but rather the ends. For just as in a vineyard there are many stages of grapes up to the winepress: first it is necessary for the vine to bud in the tendrils, to show promise in the flowers: then, with the flower shaken off, the future bunch of grapes is deformed, and gradually swelling, the grape gives birth, so that the sweet must sweats under the presses. This is also true in learning: individuals go through stages of blessedness, so that one may hear the word of God, conceive it, grow within the womb of their soul, and reach childbirth. So that when he is born, she may nourish him with milk, and guide him through infancy, childhood, adolescence, youth, until he becomes a perfect man. Therefore, if each stage, as we said, has its own happiness according to its progress: if the end, and so to speak, the final touch is missing from the work, the entire labor will be in vain; and it will be said: Where, then, is your happiness? Although, he says, at the time when you received the Gospel in the flesh, I would call you blessed because you were fervent at the beginning: now, because I do not see the pinnacle placed on the building, and the foundations almost not laid at all, I am forced to say: Where, then, is your happiness, which I praised you for considering yourselves blessed before? For truly, even I myself confess, that when I preached to you in such lowly circumstances or amidst persecutions, you loved me at the beginning, so much so that, if possible (but these things should be understood hyperbolically), you would have plucked out your eyes for me; and you would have given them to me, so that I might have seen more clearly than all of you. For indeed, you wished to be blind through an ineffable love for me, so that the light of the Gospel might shine more brightly in my heart, and my benefit might increase through your losses. And it was during that time when, as if to little children still nursing, either because of the weakness of your flesh or because of the injuries to my own flesh, I seemed unworthy of trust. But now, because I have begun to challenge you with greater studies, concerning the elements and syllables and childish reading, so that you may hold books in your hands, so that you may learn the words full of erudition and meanings, you resist, you get angry, you consider the perfection of knowledge to be burdensome: and to such an extent have your affections changed towards others, that you, who had received me as an angel and Christ, to whom you wanted to entrust your eyes, now have me as an enemy, because I announce the full truth to you. But he elegantly ended his statement, saying: So I have become your enemy by telling you the truth? to demonstrate that the beginnings of preaching were not so much truth as shadow and image of truth. Similar to this is that famous saying among the Roman poets (Terent. in And. I, 1):

Favor creates friends, but truth breeds hatred. But see how much better this is than that; for the Apostle tempered and made specific this statement when he spoke specifically to the Galatians, whom he called foolish and childish. But he erred greatly in making it general and declaring that it applied to everyone. For favor, when it is given without truth, is not so much favor as flattery and sycophancy, which should be recognized as hidden enmities rather than friendships. However, it must also be considered that even today, as long as they remain infants and sucklings, and in those in whose hearts Christ never grows, neither age nor wisdom, nor grace with God and men, do they profit, we explain, praise, suspect, and admire according to the literal sense of the Scriptures. But when we begin to challenge them a little, to move on to greater things, our adversaries become our heralds; and they prefer to follow the Jews rather than the apostles, who, departing from the doctrine and traditions of the Pharisees, have entered into Christ Himself as the propitiation and perfection of the Law: and they are not willing to receive the divine word, which commands the teachers of the Church to ascend to higher doctrines and elevate their voice with all their might, nor to fear the noise of barking dogs, saying: “Go up to a high mountain, O one who evangelizes Zion.” Lift up your voice with strength, proclaiming good news to Jerusalem. Lift it up, do not fear. (Isaiah 40:9)

<h2 id='tocuniq64'>(Vers. 17, 18.)</h2>

(Vers. 17, 18.) They are imitating you not well: but they want to exclude you, so that you may imitate them. But always imitate the good in good things: and not only when I am present among you. They imitate well, who when they see that there are gratitudes, gifts, virtues in some people, they themselves desire to be such: and strive to imitate their faith, life and industry through which they have earned those things, so that they may also achieve those things which are worthy of good emulation. About which the Apostle says: Emulate spiritual gifts: but above all, that you may prophesy. And furthermore: So you also, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, strive to excel in building up the church. And again: Therefore, brethren, strive to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. But those who emulate do not do well if they do not desire to be better themselves, so as to imitate those who are worthy of emulation, rather than wanting to make them worse and deviating from emulation. For example, let it be said: a Christian is someone who reads Moses and the prophets; he knows that everything happened in shadow and in image for that people who preceded us. But the scriptures were written for us, for whom the ends of the ages have come. He understands circumcision not so much as a foreskin, but as ears and heart. He is raised with Christ: he seeks the things that are above. He is freed from the burden and slavery of the Law, which commands not to touch, not to taste, not to handle: if anyone wants to persuade him with the words of the Scriptures, let him receive them not as a figure of speech, but as the literal words that are written, so that he is made manifest as a Jew, not in secret, imitating him not well, but he hastens to pull back one who is progressing towards greater things; he rather imitates himself who walks backwards: or certainly he does not advance much further. Therefore he speaks to the Galatians, who had been led astray by the advocates of the Law, to imitate them, when in fact it should have been the Galatians imitating them. For it is natural for the greater to be made from the lesser, not the lesser from the greater, and he says: Imitate the good in goodness, that is, do not imitate the advocates of Jewish observance, but imitate those things which are good. For just as one who imitates someone's wealth, power, and dignity, imitates not the good, but rather those things which should be avoided: likewise you, on the contrary, imitate the good in goodness: seeking spiritual things more than carnal things; so that you may teach not to be Jews, but to be Christians. But do this always, so that you may be able to reach the end of a good work with a persevering step. For indeed I was imitating good while I was with you, before: but after I had left you, you lost everything that I had handed over to you, from a secure position and a faithful harbor, again being swept back into the high sea. And it is not surprising if, with the Apostle departing, the Galatians were changed from a chosen vessel, and in which Christ the Lord was speaking: since we even now see the same thing happening in the Churches. For when a doctor happens to be endowed both in word and in life, who in his words stirs his listeners to virtue as if with certain goads, we see that everyone is in a hurry, is fervent, and runs about concerning acts of charity, fasting, chastity, the reception of the poor, burials, and other similar things. But when that person departs, gradually things begin to wither, and with food taken away, they become weak, pale, feeble, and the destruction of all the things that previously flourished follows. Therefore, because the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few (Matthew 9:37), let us pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers to gather the ears of the Christian people, which are prepared for future wheat, and to gather them, bring them into the barns, and not let them perish. This is about that perverse zeal and envy, of which it is also said elsewhere: Do not envy evildoers (Psalm 37:1), and here: They envy you, but not rightly. But we find another kind of zeal, with which the sons of Jacob were zealous for their brother Joseph (Gen. XXXVII and following): and Mary and Aaron were zealous for the friend of the Lord, Moses (Num. XII). Neither the former nor the latter were incited to zeal in order to be better than Joseph and Moses, but because they were grieved that those two were better. This zeal is close to envy. It would be long if I wanted to enumerate all the kinds of zeal, good or bad, from the treasure of the Scriptures. We read about the good zeal of Phinehas (Num. XXV), Elijah (III Reg. XIX), Mathathias (I Mach. II), and the apostle Jude (but not the betrayer) who, because of the remarkable virtue of zeal in himself, also received the name Zealot (Acts I). But we also read about the evil zeal, like that of Cain towards Abel (Gen. IV), and of others towards each other. And the zeal of a man, of which it is written: 'And the spirit of zeal came upon him' (Num. V). Unless perhaps this middle zeal can be neither positively nor negatively received; rather, it is called jealousy between both sides. On the other hand, those who were from the circumcision group saw that the Galatians, who were Gentiles, were filled with the abundant powers of the Holy Spirit, but they themselves did not speak in tongues, did not have the gift of healing, and did not possess the grace of prophecy. Fueled by jealousy and driven by zeal, they desired to impose the burdens of the Law on them, so that they would become like themselves.

<h2 id='tocuniq65'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) My little children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you. Just as a curse declares through pain and difficulty, 'In pain you shall bring forth children' (Gen. III, 16). Therefore, Paul, wanting to show the concern of teachers for their disciples, the emotions they suffer, so that their followers do not fall away from salvation, says: My little children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth. For in another place he had said as a father, 'If you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers' (I Cor. IV, 15), now he speaks as a mother in Christ, so that they may recognize the anxiety and devotion of both parents in him." } And Moses said of the people: Have I conceived all this people in my womb (Num. XI, 12)? Who, do you think, among us is so anxious for the salvation of his disciples, that he is not tormented for a few hours, or for much of two or three days, but is tormented for the whole time of his life, until Christ is formed in them? The example of the pregnant woman which he took, diligently preserving the seeds of the one conceiving and forming within herself, should be understood, so that we may understand what is said. Nature is not to be blushed at, but to be venerated. For just as in the womb of a woman, the first formless seed is cast, so that it may adhere by some kind of glue to its furrows and bottom: from which the prophet, remembering the beginning of himself, says: Your eyes saw my unformed substance (Ps. CXXXVIII, 16): then, for nine months, the future human is formed, shaped, nourished and distinguished by restricted blood; so that after it has pulsated in the womb, it is founded in the light at the appointed time, and is born with such difficulties that, lest it perish, it is nurtured: thus also the seed of the word of Christ, when it falls upon a receptive soul, grows through its own stages, and, to mention many things (for we can easily transfer a physical description to a spiritual understanding), it is in uncertainty as long as the one who conceived gives birth. The end of learning is not to have learned immediately, but rather the beginning of another work, so that diligent nourishment and studies lead the suckling infancy to the full age of Christ. And just as in marriage often the man's seed is the cause of not producing children, sometimes the barren wife does not conceive, and frequently neither is suited for procreation, and on the contrary both are fertile: so also in those who sow the word of God, this fourfold division is observed, so that indeed they fulfill their duty as teachers, but the listener remains barren: either the listener may be of good disposition but the seed of the word perishes due to the incompetence of the teacher, or the one being taught may be so insane as the one giving the instruction; and rarely does it happen that both the master and the disciple agree with each other, namely, that the former teaches only as much as the latter can absorb, or the latter learns only as much as the former imparts. But now we are all judges. We do not know which psalm, which part of the prophecy, which chapter of the Law, and we interpret boldly the ease of speaking, which we absolutely do not understand. It does not pertain to us for Christ to be formed in the people: so that each one, returning to his own house, may have the seed of the word of God, which when he has conceived, he may be able to say with the prophet: From your fear, O Lord, we have conceived and brought forth, we have made sons of your salvation upon the earth. The apostles passed down these stories, and they deserve to be heard by the Savior. Whoever does the will of my Father is my brother, and sister, and mother (Matt. XXII, 50): with the diversity of accomplishments, revealed in different names. Christ is also formed in the hearts of believers when all the sacraments are presented to them, and things that seemed obscure become clear. But it should also be observed that the one who, through sin, had ceased to be a man in a way, is conceived through repentance by the teacher, and again in him the formation of Christ is promised. This is against the Novatians, who do not want those who have once fallen into sin to be reformed.

<h2 id='tocuniq66'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) But I wish to be with you now and change my voice, for I am perplexed about you. Divine scripture builds and is read; but it is much more beneficial if it is translated from letters into voice, so that the one who taught through the letter may instruct those present. Indeed, the living voice has great power: a voice resounding from its own author's mouth, which is produced and distinguished by the same pronunciation as it was generated in the author's heart. Therefore, knowing that the Apostle has greater power in his speech which is made to the present, he desires to change the Epistolary voice, the voice comprehended in letters, into presence: and because this was more expedient for those who had been corrupted in error, to lead them back to the truth while they are alive by speech. This, however, was because he was confounded ((the alternate version says 'is confounded')) in them: which indeed properly speaking is said in Greek. For Ἀποροῦμαι signifies not so much confusion, which is called αἰσχύνη or σύγχυσις among them, as it signifies need and poverty. Therefore, this is the sense; I wish I could be present with you now and speak the voice of letters myself, because I am in need among you. For I do not have the fruits that teachers usually have from their disciples; and without reason, the seed of teachings has been cast, and I am compelled to suffer poverty among you: so that I can burst forth with the voice of Jeremiah: I have not profited, nor has anyone profited me. (Jeremiah 23:23). This passage can also be interpreted differently: Paul the Apostle, who became a Jew to the Jews, in order to gain the Jews. (1 Corinthians 9), and to those who were under the Law, as if he himself were under the Law, and to the weak, as if he were weak, in order to gain the weak. Depending on the quality of those whom he desired to save, he changed his voice and transformed himself into the likeness of actors (indeed, he made the world a theater for angels and men (1 Corinthians 4)), assuming various forms and voices. Not because it was what it pretended to be; but because it only seemed to be what it professed to be to others. He sees that the Galatians need one kind of teaching and another kind of way to be saved, not the kind by which they were first converted to the faith of Christ from their Gentile state. And he is compelled to say: I wish I could be with you now, and change my voice, because I am confused by you. No, he says, I do not see myself benefiting, if I speak the things that I have spoken before, because being ignorant of what I should do, and being pulled in different directions, I am torn apart, confused, and torn to pieces. And how doctors, when they see that the force of their art is not able to cure in the first place, they move on to something else, and they experiment with many things until they arrive at a cure: just as something that could not be healed by the softness of a certain plaster may be healed by a more biting powder and a harsher treatment: likewise I, because I am confounded among you and am distracted in various directions by ignorance, wish that the voice of letters could be spoken directly from my mouth, so that I myself might rebuke you with a more severe admonition; since a letter is not able to express the voice of one reproaching; it is not able to resound with the outcry of an angry person, or to explain the pain of the heart by the peaks of words. However, it can also be understood more simply: I have used sweet words among you, saying: Brothers, I beseech you. And: My little children, whom I am in travail of again until Christ be formed in you; but I am sweet and gentle, who have spoken unto you as a father, for that charity whereby I do not suffer my children to perish and to wander forever, I would wish to be present now if the chains of my confession did not bind me, and to change a sweet voice into the words of one reproaching. It is not a matter of frivolity, whether I now flatter or now become angry; love impels me, pain impels me, to speak with different emotions. For I do not know into which words I should first burst forth, and by what remedy I should heal you, because I am confused regarding you.

<h2 id='tocuniq67'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) Tell me, those of you who want to be under the Law, have you not heard the Law? Note that the Law mentioned here is the history of Genesis, not as commonly believed, what should be done or avoided, but everything that is covered about Abraham, his wives, and children is called the Law (John 15). We also read in another place that the prophets are also called the Law. Therefore, one who looks into the Law, according to Paul, not just its surface but its essence. He who follows only the external shell is not following the Law, similar to the Galatians.

<h2 id='tocuniq68'>(Vers. 22, 23.)</h2>

(Verse 22, 23.) For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondwoman and one by the free woman. But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh: but he who was of the free woman was by promise. It is a matter of great difficulty to demonstrate that only Isaac, who was born of Sarah, was generated by promise, and not also Ishmael, who was born of the Egyptian bondwoman, Hagar. For the scripture relates that when Hagar, being pursued by Sarah, had fled and come to her in the desert, an angel appeared to her and advised her to submit to her mistress's authority. The same angel also spoke these words: I will multiply your seed exceedingly, so that it shall not be numbered for multitude (Genesis 16:10). And afterwards, concerning Ishmael (which indeed no one doubts is a promise): This man will be a wild ass of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone's hand against him; and he will live in defiance of all his kin. But it can be argued that the angel's promise is of lesser authority than that of God himself. Just as a star, when the sun rises, does not sparkle, so too do the words of angels pale in comparison to God's promise, and they fade away and are considered as nothing. Indeed, this response seems to have some significance; but it is immediately refuted by the authority of the following Scripture. For it is written: And God said to Abraham: Let Ismael live in your presence (Ibid., XVII, 18 seqq.); and God responded to him thus: Behold, your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac, and I will establish my covenant with him, as an everlasting covenant, and with his descendants after him. And concerning Ismael: Behold, I have heard you, and behold, I have blessed him, and I will greatly increase him and multiply him. Twelve nations will he beget, and I will make him into a great nation. But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this time next year. From these things it is clear in God's own words that Ishmael was born according to the promise. But this is also explained by the fact that the promise is properly fulfilled in the giving of the covenant, and that to bless, increase, and multiply greatly is something different, as is written of Ishmael. To make an heir through a covenant is something different, as is said of Isaac: I will establish my covenant with him, as an everlasting covenant, and to his seed after him. And in the following passages: 'But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you' (Gen. XVII, 19). And how different are gifts from possessions: different are legacies from inheritances (for we read that gifts were given to the sons of Abraham's concubines, but to the son of Sarah the inheritance of the entire substance was left); so also blessings and legacies are different from a testament, as we have said. But this can also be said of Ishmael, after his conception, whether it was an angel or God who spoke. But indeed, before Isaac was conceived in Sarah's womb, God had promised it. These things, however, should be said to the extent that the mediocrity of our intellect allows. Moreover, if anyone can find something greater, how is it that Ishmael, who was born of a slave woman, is not the son of the promise, but Isaac, who was born of a free woman? He should rather be listened to. And if you think differently, the Apostle says, God has also revealed this to you. Now we must briefly strive for higher things, so that we may say that each one of us is first born not in accordance with the promise, as long as he is instructed by the simple words of the Scriptures and is still delighted with Jewish explanations. But once he has transcended to higher things and understood the spiritual law, then he is said to be born of the promise. And, to speak more clearly, those who do the works of Abraham are born of Abraham daily. But those who have the spirit of slavery, once again in fear, are generated from the Egyptian maidservant; but those who have received the spirit of adoption, are free from Sarah: by this freedom we are given by Christ. The Lord speaks to the Jews, who still desired to be the sons of the maidservant: If you remain in my word, you will truly be my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. (John VIII, 31, 32). And they, not understanding what was said, said: We are the seed of Abraham, and we have never been in bondage to anyone. How can you say, you will be made free? Jesus answered them: Amen, amen, I say to you, that whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin. Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever; but the son abideth for ever. If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed. If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed. If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed. If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.

(Verse. 24.) The things which are said in allegory. Allegory properly belongs to the art of grammar, and we learn in elementary schools how it differs from metaphor or other tropes. It presents one thing in words, but signifies another in meaning. The books of orators (especially abundant in allegories) and poets are full of them. Even divine scripture is connected in a significant way through this. The intelligent Apostle Paul (who had also touched upon secular literature to some extent) used the very word 'figure' in order to designate allegory, as it is called among his own people: by which he intended to show more clearly the abuse of this Greek expression. However, Paul, although not to perfection, knew secular literature. His own words testify: One of their own prophets has said, 'Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons' (Titus 1:12). This is a verse from the heroic poem of the poet Epimenides, which both Plato and other ancient writers mention. Also, when he was addressing the Athenians in the Areopagus, he added this: 'For in him we live and move and have our being' (Acts 17:28), as some of your own poets have said. This half-line is attributed to Aratus, who wrote about the sky and the stars. Also this: 'Evil company corrupts good morals' (1 Corinthians 15:33); it is a trimeter iambic from Menander's comedy. From these and other examples, it is clear that Paul was not ignorant of secular literature, and that here he called it an allegory, elsewhere he called it spiritual understanding. As in this passage: 'For we know that the law is spiritual' (Romans 7:14), meaning that it is an allegory or allegorically depicted. And elsewhere: All ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink. They drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ (1 Corinthians 10:4). It is beyond doubt that the manna, the sudden gushing forth of the spring, and the rock itself which follows, are to be understood allegorically. I know what objection can be raised against this: Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently (Galatians 6:1). And in another place: But the spiritual man judges all things; yet he himself is judged by no man (I Cor. II, 15): in order that the word 'spiritual' may sound different from what we have just said. But we call him a spiritual man, because he judges all things and is judged by no one, who, having knowledge of all the sacraments of the Scriptures, understands them in a sublime manner; and seeing Christ in the divine books, does not accept anything of Jewish tradition in them.


<h2 id='tocuniq70'>(Vers. 25, 26.)</h2>

(Vers. 25, 26.) For these are the two covenants, one indeed from Mount Sinai, bringing forth to bondage, which is Hagar. For Sinai is a mount in Arabia, which hath a close affinity to that Jerusalem which now is, and is in servitude with her children. But that Jerusalem which is above, is free: which is our mother. For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband. These things did not bear fruit for a long time, before Christ was born from the Virgin, and she was sterile: nor did Isaac, the chosen father, yet laugh with the voice of lofty teachings resounding. Indeed, even Abraham, in our language, is referred to as the chosen father with a resounding sound. But Hagar, who is interpreted as 'sojourning,' that is, dwelling, or sojourn, generates Ishmael, who only hears God's commands and does not become a rustic, bloodthirsty, desert-dweller. He shall be an enemy to all his brothers, born of free women, and oppose them with a hostile face. It is not surprising that the Old Testament, which was established and written on Mount Sinai in Arabia, which is adjacent to the present-day Jerusalem, is not perpetual: since the people who inhabit it are different from those who possess it perpetually, and the name Sinai of the mountain signifies temptation, and Arabia signifies the sunset; and in contrast, the Jerusalem that is above, which is the free and mother of the saints, demonstrates that the current Jerusalem is below, and submerged in lowliness and humbleness. There are those who understand both the Old and New Testaments in two different ways: that they may interpret the divine Scripture, both the old and the new, according to the diversity of their senses and understanding, either as an allegory, or as a literal interpretation, and that they may desire to be born of the Egyptian slave woman Hagar, those who still serve the letter and have the spirit of fear in servitude: but those who ascend to higher things, and who desire to understand allegorically what is written, are the children of Sarah, which in our language is interpreted as 'princess,' in the feminine gender. And they assert this, out of that necessity (as Al. asserts), that it would be unjust to consider Moses and all the prophets as being born of a slave woman, and likewise any of the gentiles as being born of a free woman. Hence it is better, not only to consider some as slaves and others as free according to the diversity of understandings in the Church, as we have said above, but also to consider the same man as a son of a slave woman as long as he follows the historical account; but when Jesus opens the Scriptures and his heart is set on fire, and he sees Him in the breaking of the bread whom he did not see before (Luke 24), then he is named the son of Sarah. Marcion and Manichaeus did not want to remove this passage, in which the Apostle said, 'Now these are allegorical', and the rest that follows, from their own book, thinking that it was left against us: namely, that the Law is to be understood differently than it is written; since surely, even if it is to be understood allegorically (which we also acknowledge, and Paul teaches), it is not to be understood according to the will of the reader, and it is founded on the authority of the writer: and in fact, what they seemed to preserve against us, they actually destroy: that Moses, the servant of the creator God, wrote spiritual things, as also their own Apostle teaches, whom themselves assert to be the preacher of another Christ and a better God.


<h2 id='tocuniq71'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) For it is written: rejoice, O barren one, who does not bear; break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor! For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband. (Isaiah 54:1.) The Synagogue had a husband, the Law; and according to the prophecy of Anna, once she was fertile in children. (1 Samuel 1.) But the Church, barren without Christ, without any conversation of the bridegroom's words, laid in the desert for a long time. But after she received the book of divorce into her hands, and turned all the ornaments of the husband into the ornament of idols, then, with the previous belt rotten, she wove another belt around her loins, and she wove another loincloth from the Gentiles. As soon as she was joined to the man, she conceived and gave birth. And the Lord exclaims through the prophet Isaiah: If a nation is born together (Isaiah 49:54): when in one day in the Acts of the Apostles three thousand and five thousand men believed (Acts 3 ff.). I do not think it necessary to speak about the multitude of Christians and the paucity of Jews, when the banners of the cross shine throughout the whole world: and a Jew appears scarcely and notably in cities.

<h2 id='tocuniq72'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28.) But we, brethren, are children of promise, just as Isaac was. There is no difficulty in understanding that the Apostle and those like him are children of promise, according to Isaac. However, because Origen, explaining this passage, used the Apostle as an example, saying: But you, brethren, are children of promise, according to Isaac, it is questioned how he now calls the Galatians, whom he had called foolish and said had begun in the Spirit but were ending in the flesh, children of promise, according to Isaac. Therefore, we say that the Apostle calls them the children of the promise according to Isaac, because he does not completely despair of their salvation, and he thinks that they will return to the spirit from which they began, and they become children of freedom. Although they were conceived in the flesh, they are the children of the maidservant.

<h2 id='tocuniq73'>(Vers. 29-31.)</h2>

(Vers. 29-31.) But as at that time the one born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now also. But what does the Scripture say? Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman. So then, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman. It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. I do not think it is impossible to find a parallel between Ishmael persecuting Isaac, but only that when the son of the Egyptian, who was older, played with Isaac, Sarah became angry and said to Abraham, "Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac" (Gen. XXI, 10). And certainly, a simple game among children is unworthy of expulsion and abandonment. But the Apostle, like a Hebrew among Hebrews, and taught at the feet of the teacher Gamaliel, who once restrained the raging Pharisees against the Lord with the words of Sarah saying, 'For the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with my son Isaac,' understood that that simple game was not so. But because perhaps Ishmael, being older, and at that time being circumcised when he was able to understand and feel what he had suffered, claimed it as his birthright, the Scripture called the quarrel of the little ones a game. And Sarah, not able to bear these words, and not being patient with the custom of the firstborn slave woman claiming her son from a young age, burst into voice saying: Cast out the slave woman with her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with my son Isaac. When this seemed harsh to Abraham (for greater things are always due to the firstborn), not only did he cease Ismael from being his firstborn, but he did not even give him an equal portion with his younger brother: God, who wanted the free one to be inside and the slave woman to be expelled outside, confirms Sarah's words and speaks to Abraham: Let it not be harsh in your sight concerning the boy and the slave woman. Everything that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice: for in Isaac your seed shall be called. Therefore, just as at that time the elder brother Ishmael persecuted Isaac, who was still nursing and young, claiming the privilege of circumcision and vindicating his primogeniture, so now according to the flesh the nation of Israel, descended from Ishmael, rises up against the younger brother, the Christian people, causing trouble and pride. Let us consider the madness of the Jews, who killed the Lord, persecuted the prophets and apostles, and opposed the will of God: and we will see much greater persecutions, which even History teaches us, instigated by the Jews against the Christians than by the Gentiles. Are we amazed about the Jews? Today also, those who are still little ones in Christ and live according to the flesh, persecute those who are born of water and the Spirit; and, rising again with Christ, they seek the things that are above, not those that are below. Let them do what they want. Let them persecute Isaac with Ishmael; let them cast out the bondwoman, the Egyptian mother, with her child. They will not receive the inheritance, which only those who are born of the promise will obtain. And elegantly also, that he who is born according to the flesh persecutes the spiritual. For the spiritual never persecutes the fleshly; but forgives him as a rustic brother: knowing that he is able to profit for a time. And if at any time he sees the son of Egypt angry, he remembers the one father who created light, cattle, and the gnat: and in a great house, there are not only golden and silver vessels; but also wooden and earthen vessels. Therefore, let us say with the apostle Paul: We are not the maidservants of the son, but free (II Tim. II); and being renewed in Christ, let us hear the words of the Lord speaking to the Jews: If you abide in my word, you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free (John VIII, 31, 32). With this freedom, the Apostle, who was set free, said: For though I am free from all. Whoever commits sin is a slave of sin (1 Corinthians 9:19). Because he knew himself to be free from all vices, from every desire and error, he rightly rejoiced in the freedom of Christ, saying: We are not slaves, but free: by this freedom Christ has set us free (John 8:34).

<h2 id='tocuniq74'>(Chap. V.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 5, Verse 1) Stand fast, and be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage. And from this it is shown that he who adheres to the yoke of servitude does not stand. And because he who has been granted freedom by Christ was under the yoke as long as he had the spirit of servitude in fear, and followed the beginnings of the Law. But when he says, stand fast, he encourages a firm and stable faith in Christ, so that the churches of Galatia may remain steadfast in the Savior. Concerning this, and in another place, the righteous man speaks: 'He set my feet upon a rock' (Ps. XXXIX, 3), that is, upon Christ: lest they be carried about by every wind of doctrine, and be carried away into various errors (Ephes. IV). Therefore, it is said to those who are standing firm: 'Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall' (I Cor. X, 12). And in another place: 'Stand firm, act like men, be strong!' (Ibid. XVI, 13), so that they may stand with Him, whom Stephen saw standing at the right hand of the Father, persevering in martyrdom (Act. VII), and He who spoke to Moses: 'But you, stand with Me' (Exod. XXXIV, 2). But the yoke of servitude, he calls the law hard, difficult, laborious, which consumes its worshippers with heavy work day and night. Just as Peter also says in the Acts of the Apostles: 'Why do you attempt to impose a heavy yoke on the neck of the brothers, which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear?' (Acts 15:10) That which he added, 'Do not again impose,' not that the Galatians had previously observed the law, but that the yoke of idolatry is also heavy, by which the people of Egypt, oppressed, like lead were submerged in the Red Sea (Exodus 15). According to the meaning he had expressed earlier: How can you turn back again to weak and beggarly elemental spirits? Do you want to be enslaved to them all over again? You observe days and months and seasons and years! I am afraid that my work for you may have been wasted. For they say, both the Egyptian priests and the Ishmaelites and the Midianites, do not have a foreskin. But as for the nations observing days, months, and years, may we never know, so that we may never have a mixed celebration with them.

<h2 id='tocuniq75'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Verse 2.) Behold, I Paul say to you: that if you get circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you. In the Gospel, the Savior speaks to the disciples. Whoever hears you, hears me: whoever receives you, receives me. (Luke 10:16). And the Apostle testifies, saying: I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me (Galatians 2:20); and elsewhere: Do you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me? (2 Corinthians 13:3)? From this it is clear that what he now says: 'Behold, I, Paul, say to you, not only as Paul's words, but the Lord's. For when he had previously stated in the first Epistle to the Corinthians: 'But to the married I give charge (not I, but the Lord)' (1 Cor. 7:10), and immediately added: 'To the rest I say (I, not the Lord)' (ibid., 12), so that his authority might not be considered of little worth; he says, 'But I think that I also have the Spirit of God' (ibid.), that he might not be regarded with contempt, who, imitating the prophets, might say: 'Thus says the Lord Almighty.' But that which has been said will become even greater: Behold, I Paul say to you: if you are circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you; if you are bound to the law, you are separated from Christ, in which it is said: Paul, an apostle not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and so on: that hearing, they may be moved not so much by the authority of one who is sent as by the authority of the one who sends. Someone may say: But what about the passage in Romans: Circumcision indeed is profitable if you keep the law (Rom. II, 25); and further on: What advantage then has the Jew; or what is the value of circumcision? In many ways. First of all, because the words of God were entrusted to them (Ibid., 1, 2). For if Christ is of no benefit to those who have been circumcised, how does circumcision benefit those who keep the Law? This will be resolved by this answer, that is to say, the Epistle which was written to the Romans, was written to those who believed from among the Jews and the Gentiles: and Paul did this so that neither people would be offended: so that each people would possess their own privilege: so that the Gentiles would not be circumcised, nor would the circumcised undergo the foreskin. But in writing to the Galatians he used a different argument. For they were not of the circumcision, but of the Gentiles who believed. And circumcision could not profit them, who after the grace of the Gospel would turn again to the elements of the Law. And in the Acts of the Apostles it is related (Acts 15): when certain men who were of the circumcision rose up, asserting that those who believed from the Gentiles should be circumcised and keep the law of Moses, the elders who were at Jerusalem, together with the apostles, gathered to deliberate, and decided by letters that no burden of the Law should be imposed upon them, and that they should no longer observe it, except to keep themselves from idols, and from blood, and from fornication, or as it is written in some copies, and from things strangled. And let no doubt remain that circumcision is of no avail, but for the sake of those who believed from the Jews, he moderated his opinion regarding circumcision to the Romans, gradually descending to the later Epistles, and showed that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value, saying: Circumcision therefore is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the observance of the commandments of God (I Cor. VII, 19). For circumcision is so meaningless that it has not profited even the house of Israel, boasting in circumcision, as the prophet says: All uncircumcised nations in flesh, but the house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart (Ezech. XLIV, 9), and the uncircumcised Melchisedec blessed the circumcised Abraham. For as he says, 'If you are circumcised' (Gen. 44), it is the same as if he had wanted to say, 'If you are circumcised in the flesh'. He refers to it as not circumcision, but cutting of the flesh in another place, saying, 'Beware of cutting'. For we are the circumcision, who serve in the spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh (Phil. 3:2-3). He does not have confidence in the flesh, who expects all benefit from Christ, and does not sow in the flesh, so as to reap corruption from the flesh; but in the spirit, from which eternal life is generated. The meaning must be examined more subtly: If you are circumcised, Christ profits you nothing. Not only does circumcision not profit those who are circumcised, but even if they seem to have other virtues apart from circumcision in Christ, they will all perish after they have been circumcised following their faith in Christ. So then, did circumcision not profit Timothy at all? Very much in every way. For he was not circumcised in order to estimate that he could obtain any advantage from circumcision itself, but rather to benefit others. A Jew became a Jew in order to convert Jews to the faith of Christ through their circumcision. Indeed, circumcision is not profitable when it is thought to bring any benefit by itself.

<h2 id='tocuniq76'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Vers. 3.) But I testify to every man who circumcises himself that he is a debtor to the whole law. God who first commanded circumcision to Abraham, and afterwards through Moses in the law, not only appointed circumcision, but also many other things to be observed: the frequenting of feast days in Jerusalem, the offering of holocausts every morning and evening, the sacrifice of the lamb in one place only, the seventh-year rest of the land, the fiftieth year of remission, and other things which it is easy to extract for oneself from the scriptures as a reader. Therefore, we will refute Ebion and his followers, who believe that after accepting the Gospel, believers in Christ must be circumcised, in order to either undergo circumcision and fulfill the other requirements of the Law, or, if it is impossible to do everything, then let circumcision also cease, along with the other requirements that were neglected like a mutilated limb. And if they respond by saying that we should only do what is possible (for God does not demand from us what we cannot do, but rather what we can fulfill), we will tell them that it is not the same God who desires the observance of the Law and yet forsakes those who observe it. But how can the Law make guilty those who, even if they want to, cannot fulfill all its requirements? We, on the other hand, follow the spiritual law that says: 'You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain' (Deuteronomy 25:4) and understand, with the Apostle, 'Is it for oxen that God is concerned?' (1 Timothy 5:18; 1 Corinthians 9:9). But surely He says this for our sake, and to keep the delicate Sabbath (Isaiah 58:13), not so that our ox and donkey and lowly livestock rejoice on the Sabbath; but rather, for those people and animals about whom it is written: 'You save both humans and animals, O Lord' (Psalm 36:7). Reasonable and spiritual men are educated, as are animals, those who are of slower intelligence, and from spiritual things to the observance of the Lord's Sabbaths. And it is not contradictory to what has been said above: If you are circumcised, Christ profits you nothing. And what follows: I testify to every man that circumcises himself, that he is a debtor to do the whole law, to the one that is imposed on us. For the hearers of the law are not just before God, but the doers of the law will be justified. Since that one is the Lawgiver, who can say: We are not circumcision; and, In secret a Jew: and, we know that the Law is spiritual. But whoever follows the letter of circumcision and kills, he is not a maker of the Law, but truly an enemy of the Law, especially after the advent of the Savior, who takes away the veil from the heart of those who turn to him, so that all, with the face of the Lord's glory revealed, may be transformed from the oldness of the letter to the newness of the spirit.


<h2 id='tocuniq77'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) You have fallen away from Christ: you who seek justification in the Law have fallen from grace. Just as no one can serve two masters (Matthew 6), it is difficult to fulfill both the shadow and the truth of the Law. The shadow is found in the old Law until the day dawns and the shadows are removed, while the truth is found in the Gospel of Christ. For grace and truth came through Jesus Christ (John 1:17). Therefore, one who thinks they can be justified by observing the Law loses the grace of Christ and forfeits the Gospel they once held. And when they lose grace, they are deprived of faith in Christ and rely on their own works. For you have been severed (κατηργήθητε) from Christ, not as poorly interpreted in Latin as "evacuati estis a Christo," but rather, you have fallen away from Christ. It is more clearly understood, therefore, that you have ceased from works, when He says a little before, 'If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing;' that is, now that the whole Law is comprehended generally, that they profit nothing in Christ's work, who believe themselves to be justified by any observation of the Law.

(Verse 5.) For we, by the Spirit, from faith, await the hope of righteousness. He placed the Spirit to distinguish it from the letter. But the hope of righteousness is to be understood as Christ, because He Himself is the truth, patience, hope, righteousness, and all virtues, whose coming we await according to the second advent, which will judge all things, and He will no longer come in patience, but in righteousness, to render to each one according to his works. The presence of God, which the apostle and those who are like him await, they say: Let Your kingdom come (Matthew 6:10), so that when the Son has delivered the kingdom to God the Father, and has become subject in all things, then the head will be subjected in the body, and God will be all in all (1 Corinthians 15)." } Because he who is now in part, through individuals, will then begin to be whole through all.

<h2 id='tocuniq79'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6) For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love. For those who desire to live in Christ Jesus, virtues are to be sought after, vices are to be avoided. But the things in between virtues and vices, neither to be avoided nor sought after, such as circumcision and uncircumcision, and other similar things. Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the Law. Therefore, it was beneficial for those who lived under the Law, not because they were circumcised, but because they believed in the words of God and carried them out in their actions, not being strangers to salvation. And let it not move us that Sephora, while taking up a flintstone, circumcised her son, and prevented the angel from suffocating her husband (Exod. IV), or as it is otherwise written in Hebrew, because now circumcision is not at all profitable, as it has been testified in Christ Jesus that it does not hold value. Since the time when the Gospel spread throughout the whole world, the injury of circumcision is superfluous. At that time, like other laws, it was valid when carnal blessings were promised to those who kept the law; namely, that if they fulfilled it, they would be blessed in the city, blessed in the fields, they would have full storehouses, and many other things that are included in the promises (Deut. XXVIII). But we wish to be strong and comforted in Christ Jesus, that is, in true circumcision, and not in Jewish circumcision. For neither is he who is openly a Jew, nor is circumcision manifest in the flesh, but one is a Jew inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart in the spirit, not in the letter (Rom. II, 28, 29). Therefore, the circumcision of the flesh does not profit anything in Christ, but the circumcision of the heart and ears, which removes that reproach of the Jews: Behold, your ears are uncircumcised, and you cannot hear (Exod. VI, 12). The circumcision of the lips is profitable, as Moses himself attested, who claimed to possess a metaphorical "foreskin" on his lips, as it is written in Hebrew: 'But I am a man with uncircumcised lips.' Circumcision provides great utility, and in matters of sexual immorality, circumcision is profaned through chastity. Therefore, in Christ Jesus, neither physical circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value, because they are located in the midst, that is, between vices and virtues. However, it is faith that operates through love, as the faith that was considered righteous for Abraham is proven, and every work of faith is based in love, with the entire Law and Prophets depending on love. Indeed, in these two commandments: You shall love your God, and you shall love your neighbor, the Savior asserted that the Law and the Prophets consist. And Paul in another place: For you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not covet, and if there is any other commandment, it is summarized in this saying: You shall love your neighbor as yourself (Rom. XIII, 9). Therefore, if every commandment is summarized in what was said: You shall love your neighbor as yourself, and faith operates through love to a great extent, it is evident that the work of faith through love contains the fullness of all the commandments. But according to the apostle James, faith without works is dead (James 2:26): so without faith, even though good works are present, they are considered dead. Therefore, those who do not believe in Christ, yet have good morals, have something other than works of virtue. Let that example of faith which works through charity be attributed to that prostitute from the Gospel who, while reclining at the table of the Pharisee, washed the feet of the Lord with her tears, wiped them with her hair, anointed them with perfume. And to the murmuring Pharisee, the Lord presented the parable of the two debtors, one owing fifty and the other five hundred denarii, and added: For this reason, I tell you: Her many sins have been forgiven, for she loved much (Luke 7:47 and 50). And turning to the woman, he said: Your faith has saved you, go in peace. Clearly it has been demonstrated in this place that this woman had faith through charity, which has greatly helped her in Christ. If anyone were to say: Well, circumcision in Christ has shown to be worthless, which he knew at one time was valuable; is anyone also in doubt about the foreskin, to say that it is not necessary? But if we consider the many Christians, that is, those of us who have been grafted onto the good olive tree (Rom. 11) from the wild olive tree, rejoicing over the broken branches of the Jewish people, and saying that the foreskin, in which Abraham pleased God, is more valuable than circumcision, which was given as a sign of faith and did not benefit the one who had it, the Israelite: we will also see this certain argument being carefully excluded now.


<h2 id='tocuniq80'>Third Book</h2>

Third Book

483-484 We now publish this volume, the third to the Galatians, O Paula and Eustochium, not unaware of our weakness and the feeble stream of our talent, barely whispering with a low murmur. For these things are now sought after even in the churches, and the simplicity and purity of the apostolic words have been abandoned, as if we were gathering at the Academy and the lecture halls, to arouse the applause of those standing by. So that rhetorical art, smeared with the paint of falsehood, may proceed like a certain harlot into public, seeking not so much to educate the people but to win the favor of the people, and by its sweet singing, like that of a well-tuned psaltery and pipe, may soothe the senses of the listeners. Thus the saying of the prophet Ezekiel may truly be applied to our times, as the Lord said to him: "Thou hast been unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument. For they hear thy words, but they do them not." (Ez. 33:32). But what should I do? Should I remain silent? But it is written: You shall not appear before your Lord empty-handed. And Isaiah (as it is held in Hebrew volumes) laments: Woe is me, for I remained silent. Should I speak? 485-486 But the harshness of reading Hebrew has tarnished all the elegance of speech and the charm of Latin eloquence. For even you yourselves know that it has been more than fifteen years since I have held in my hands any works by Tullius, any works by Maro, any works by any author of pagan literature. And if by chance something from that time sneaks in as we speak, it is as if we recall the ancient through the fog of a dream. But as for what progress I have made from my untiring study of that language, I leave it to the judgment of others: what I have lost in my own, I know. Furthermore, it is added to this, that because of the weakness of my eyes and my whole body, I do not write with my own hand: nor can I compensate for the slowness of my speech with labor and diligence: which they also relate about Virgil, that he shaped his books by licking them like bear cubs: but calling for a notary, or immediately speaking whatever comes to my mouth: or if I want to think a little longer, about to utter something better, then that silent one reproaches me, he clenches his hand, furrows his brow, and testifies with his whole body gesture that he is being frustrated in vain. However, although the speech is derived from a good-natured genius and is distinguished by its inventions and adorned with the flower of words, it is not polished and refined unless it has been shaped and polished by the hand of its author. It is not shining, it does not possess a mixture of gravity with beauty, but rather, it betrays its wealth like that of rustic rich people, rather than adorning it. What is the purpose of this? Evidently, so that both you and others (who may want to read it) may have an answer: I am not writing a eulogy or a controversy, but a commentary, that is, I have this intention, not for my words to be praised, but for those things which were well said by another to be understood as they were said. It is the duty of my office to discuss obscure matters, to clarify the obvious, to dwell in uncertainties. Hence, by many, the work of commentators is called an explanation. If anyone seeks eloquence, or takes pleasure in declamations, they have in both languages Demosthenes and Cicero, Polemo and Quintilian. The Church of Christ is gathered not from the Academy and the Lyceum, but from the common people. Hence the Apostle says: 'Consider your calling, brothers, that not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are' (I Corinthians 1:26-28). For since the world, through its wisdom, did not know God, it pleased God to save believers through the foolishness of preaching. For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. Therefore, the Apostle himself also spoke to the same Corinthians: And I, coming to you, brothers, came not with excellency of speech, or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of the Lord. For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ, and him crucified. (1 Corinthians 2:1-2). And lest, perhaps, it should be thought that he, speaking these things, was a foolish preacher, with a presaging mind, he overturns that which could be opposed. But, he says, God's wisdom is spoken in mystery, which is hidden: which no prince of this world has known. How many people now read Aristotle? How much do they know of Plato, either his books or his name? Only idle old men in corners scarcely remember them. But everyone speaks of our country farmers and fishermen, the whole world resounds. Therefore, in simple language, their simple words must be explained. Words, I say, not meanings. Moreover, if, while you pray, I can have the same inspiration in explaining their letters that they had in dictating them, then you will see how great a majesty and breadth of true wisdom was in them, compared to the arrogance and vanity of worldly writings. In short, I reveal to you the secret of my mind: I do not want the one who understands the Apostle through me to have difficulty understanding my writings and have to seek another interpreter to find out. But now it is time for us to pursue the rest.

<h2 id='tocuniq81'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? This phrase, which the Latin interpreter has now inserted, 'to not obey the truth,' is written in Greek as τῇ ἀληθείᾳ μὴ πείθεσθαι, and it was interpreted in the previous passage as 'to not believe the truth.' Indeed, we noted in its proper place that we do not have this in the ancient manuscripts, although the Greek copies are also confused by this error. The meaning, however, is this: You were worshiping the Father in spirit and truth, and receiving from the fullness of Christ, you knew that the Law was given only to the people through Moses, and did not become a reality. But grace and truth were not only given, but also made through Jesus Christ. Therefore, since you were running so well, serving truth rather than images, why do you, hindered by a corrupt teacher, follow the shadow of the Law and abandon the truth of the Gospel? It follows.

You have not agreed with anyone. But because we have not found this written either in Greek books or in those who have written commentaries on the Apostle, it seems that it should be passed over.

<h2 id='tocuniq82'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) Your persuasion is not from Him who called you. In the Latin manuscripts, I find it written this way: Your persuasion is from God, who called you. Indeed, I think that the phrase 'from Him' was added gradually, due to similarity, 'from God,' so that it would be, 'from Him.' But even so, the meaning cannot stand, as he had just accused them of not obeying the truth, showing that it was within their power to obey or not obey, now he asserts, on the contrary, that their persuasion and obedience are not so much from those who are called, but from Him who calls. Therefore, it is better and truer to read it as follows: Your persuasion is not from the one who called you. For the work of God is one thing, and the work of humans is another. The work of God is to call, while the work of humans is either to believe or not to believe. And wherever the free will of a human being is affirmed in the Scriptures, it is evident in this passage: If you will and hear me (Exodus 19:5). And again: Now therefore, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you (Deuteronomy 10:12), and this is especially confirmed from this passage. But simpler people, thinking that they submit themselves to God in such a way that even our belief is in his power, have removed a part of the prayer and rendered a meaning contrary to the Apostle. Therefore, whether in a good or bad sense, neither God nor the devil is at fault, because our belief is not from the one who called us, but from ourselves, who either consent or do not consent to the one calling. Otherwise: This belief that you are now following is not from God, who called you in the beginning, but from those who have since troubled you.


<h2 id='tocuniq83'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Ver. 9.) A little leaven leavens the whole lump. It is wrongly stated in our codices: A little leaven corrupts the whole mass, and the interpreter has translated the meaning rather than the words of the Apostle. However, Paul himself uses this same statement to the Corinthians: where he commanded the one who had his father's wife to be taken away and handed over to destruction and affliction of the flesh through fasting and sickness, so that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ. He says, indeed: Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? (I Cor. 5:6) Or (as we have now corrected) leavens the entire mixture? And immediately he added: Cleanse out the old leaven, that you may be a new mixture, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. But now he teaches by this same sentiment that the spiritual bread of the Church, which descends from heaven, should not be violated by the Jewish interpretation: and the Lord himself commanded the disciples to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees (John 6). And the evangelist, making it more clear, added: He had said to them about the teaching of the Pharisees (Matthew 16). Moreover, what is this other teaching of the Pharisees, if not the observance of the Law according to the flesh? Therefore, this is the meaning: Do not think lightly of those men, who coming from Judea, teach another doctrine, disregarding the dangers. A spark is a small thing, and when it is not noticed, it does not seem significant; but if it catches hold of tinder, and finds even the smallest fuel, it consumes walls, cities, vast forests, and regions. Also, the yeast, which is mentioned in the Gospel as a parable (Luke 13), seems insignificant and of no importance; but when it is mixed with flour, it corrupts the entire mass with its strength, and everything that is mixed with it succumbs to its power: in the same way, twisted doctrine, starting with just one fool, hardly finds two or three listeners at first; but slowly it spreads like a cancer in the body, and according to the common proverb, the itch of one sheep contaminates the whole flock. Therefore, as soon as the spark appears, it must be extinguished, and the ferment must be removed from the vicinity of the dough, the putrid flesh must be cut, and the scabbed animal must be kept away from the sheepfold, lest the whole house, dough, body, and livestock burn, become corrupted, putrefy, and perish. Arius was a spark in Alexandria; but because he was not immediately oppressed, his flame devastated the whole world.

<h2 id='tocuniq84'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) I trust in you in the Lord, because you will understand nothing else. Not by conjecture, as some wish, but by the prophetic spirit, Paul pronounces that the Galatians will return to the way of truth, which they had lost. (I Cor. XII). For he who urged others to emulate the charisms, but especially to prophesy: he himself also spoke with the same fullness of grace: In part we know, and in part we prophesy (Ibid., XIII, 9). Therefore, foreseeing by the Spirit that they would believe nothing except what they were taught through the Epistle, he said: I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will think nothing else. For even the addition of the Lord's name signifies the same thing. For if he had estimated this by conjecture, he could have said: I have confidence in you. But now, adding in the Lord, with a certain divine confidence, which he had known would come to pass, he prophesied.

<h2 id='tocuniq85'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10) But whoever disturbs you will bear judgment, whoever he may be. They say in secret that he tears apart Peter, to whom he writes that he did not walk in a straight path toward the truth of the Gospel. But neither would Paul speak with such insolent slander against the prince of the Church (Galatians II), nor would Peter, worthy as he is, become accused of disturbing the Church. From this, it must be understood that someone else is being referred to, who either was with the Apostles, or came from Judea, or believed in the Pharisees, or certainly was highly valued by the Galatians, so that he bears judgment upon the disturbed Church, whoever he may be. But carrying a burden, that is, what he said in the following words: Each one will bear his own burden. And I think in the Scriptures, burden can be taken in both a good and a bad sense, that is, both for those who are burdened by serious sins and for those who bear the light burdens of virtues. Regarding sins, the penitent speaks in the psalm: My iniquities have risen above my head, like a heavy burden they have weighed upon me (Psalm 37:5). Concerning virtues and the teaching of virtues, the Savior says: For my yoke is easy and my burden is light (Matthew 11:30). And that doctrine is also understood as a burden is made clear in the Gospel. Indeed, the Pharisees bind heavy burdens that cannot be carried and place them on the shoulders of others, but they themselves are not willing to touch them with one finger (Matthew 23). How serious it is to disturb someone's tranquility and to agitate peaceful hearts with certain waves is attested by the words of the Savior to the apostles, saying: Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid (John 14). For it would be better for him who troubles and scandalizes someone in the Church, that a millstone be hung around his neck and he be thrown into the sea, than to scandalize one of these little ones who are shown by the Savior (Luke 17). Therefore, the Galatians were disturbed between the spirit and the letter, circumcision and uncircumcision, hidden and manifest Judaism, not knowing what to do. However, it can be understood more briefly like this: Whoever is the one who leads you back to the doctrine of the Pharisees, and desires to be circumcised in the flesh even though he is eloquent and boasts in knowledge of the Law, I say nothing more except this (which you cannot deny) that he will bear judgment for this work, and will receive reward for his labor.


<h2 id='tocuniq86'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11) But I, brothers, if I preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed (or as it is better stated in Greek, ceased). We read in the Acts of the Apostles, and even the apostle Paul himself often mentions in his letters, that he endured frequent persecutions from the Jews because he taught those who believed in Christ from the Gentiles that they should not be circumcised. Therefore, about those mentioned above, he says: Whoever disturbs you will bear judgment, whoever he may be, in order to deceive the Galatians. They also added this: Not only Peter, James, John, and the rest of the apostles in Judea observe circumcision and other precepts of the Law, but even Paul himself, who taught you differently than the truth of the matter is, circumcised Timothy and often became a Jew to the Jews, compelled by the truth. To remove the opinion about the minds of the Galatians, Paul says: 'But I, brothers, if I preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed. I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!' For through the law, I died to the law, so that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.' For I suffer not so much persecution from the Jews because I preach the crucified, and say that Jesus is the Christ, whom the Law and the prophets have foretold, as because I teach that the Law is complete. But that the cross is a stumbling-block to the Jews, and foolishness to the Gentiles, our Lord Himself shows, who is called the stone of stumbling, and the rock of offence (Matt. 21; Luke 20): for I think it is because the preaching, when it has advanced with full sails to the hearers, immediately on coming to the cross, strikes against it, and can by no means go on further in free course. But this cross which is a scandal to the Jews and folly to the Gentiles is to us who believe the power and wisdom of God. For Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God (1 Corinthians 1:24), so that because of what was called folly, the foolishness of God might become wiser to men; and because of what was weakness and scandal, the weakness of God might become stronger to men. But as it is said, the scandal of the cross of Christ remains, and I will suffer persecution, which I would not suffer if the scandal did not remain: in vain do some boast that I preach circumcision, which by opposing I sustain persecution.


<h2 id='tocuniq87'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) I wish those who trouble you would be cut off. It is questioned how Paul, his disciple, to whom he says, 'Bless those who curse you.' And he himself speaking, 'Bless and do not curse' (Romans 12:14). And in another place, 'Neither will revilers inherit the kingdom of God' (1 Corinthians 15): now, if he curses those who trouble the churches of Galatia, and with a wishful vow curses them, 'I wish those who trouble you would be cut off.' For the passion of castration is so detestable that anyone who inflicts it against someone's will shall be punished by public laws, and anyone who castrates himself shall be considered infamous. For, as they say, this is true: Christ lives in me (II Cor. XIII, 3); and this: Do you seek a proof of him speaking in me, Christ? Certainly the voice of a curse cannot be understood of him who says: Learn from me, for I am humble and gentle in heart (Matth. XI, 29). And it is more believed that he could not restrain himself from Jewish fury and a certain unrestrained madness, rather than imitating him who, like a lamb before his shearer, did not open his mouth and did not curse those who reviled him (Isaiah 53). However, he handed himself over to death, condemned. To this, those who respond for Paul will say: the words he spoke were not expressions of fury against his adversaries, but of love for the churches of God. For he saw indeed the whole province, which he himself had led to the faith of Christ by his own blood and dangers from idolatry, suddenly disturbed by a sudden persuasion and apostolic grief, he could not hold himself: he changed his voice, and he who had spoken kindly, became angry, so that he could retain those whom he could not retain by gentleness, at least by reproach. And no wonder if the Apostle, as a man, and still held in a weak vessel, seeing another law in his body capturing him and leading him in the law of sin, spoke once about this, into which we often see holy men fall. But it can also be said (although it may seem superfluous to some) that Paul did not so much curse them as he prayed for them to lose those parts of the body through which they were compelled to sin. And just as it is said in the Gospel: it is better for someone to enter the kingdom of heaven with one eye, and one hand, and one foot, and any other part of the body, than to go into hell with the whole body (Matthew 18); so now I would rather wish for them to lose one part of the body than to be forever condemned by the fire through the opportunity of having an intact body. Here we have shown how this argument can be answered whenever it is brought up by opponents. Now let it be directed against heretics, namely Marcion, and Valentinus, and all those who bark against the old Testament. Let them show in what way they can excuse themselves for condemning the Creator as a bloody, severe warrior, and a mere judge, in the Apostle of the good God. And certainly, I think there is no sentence in the old Law that is so fierce and bloody as this one: 'Would that those who trouble you could cut themselves off!' They cannot say that the Apostle prayed for the enemies of Christ, who were disturbing his Churches. Nor can it be attributed to love, because it is clear from the weight of the words themselves that it is filled with pride and indignation. Therefore, whatever excuse they may present on behalf of the Apostle, we will not defend it with reference to the old Law.

<h2 id='tocuniq88'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. The interpreter added the phrase 'which is not in the Greek' because it is missing in the Greek text. Because this passage is very obscure, it was decided to transfer it word for word from the tenth book of the Stromateis. Not that the individual parts cannot be explained in their own places and meanings, but that they may form one difficult whole when separated from the previous subject. And if they are understood in a way that makes sense, they appear to contradict and overflow inconsistently and abruptly. Therefore, these are the words of Origen: 'The place is difficult and seems to us to be therefore to be discussed. The book follows a higher sense and truth, disregarding the preceding types and figures and the letter, not therefore despising the lesser ones and giving opportunity to those who cannot perceive more sublime things, to completely despair of themselves. For although they are weak and may be called flesh in comparison with the Spirit, they are nevertheless the flesh of Christ.' For if one understands the mystery of love serving the weaker ones, let them do something for the weak: lest their brother perish in their knowledge, for whom Christ died. Therefore, pay close attention to whether this meaning is woven from the consequences. You, brothers, are called to freedom: perhaps because not everyone was able to receive the call to freedom. Therefore, now you hear: Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh. For through love one must serve the lesser to the greater: for whoever wants to be greater, will be the servant of all (Matt. 20:26; Mark 10:43). Therefore, let not the spiritual man wound the flesh of Christ, nor give occasion to them to bite back, lest they be consumed by one another. Therefore, the one who walks by the spirit and follows the words of the Scriptures should not fulfill the desire of their flesh. But if we understand simply what is said: Walk by the spirit, and you will not fulfill the desire of the flesh, as most people think, against the argument and hypothesis of the entire Epistle, Paul will suddenly burst out into this: But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law. And although up to this point there is some consistency in what he is saying, if we follow a simple understanding, he suddenly transfers us to disorderly precepts, discussing flesh and spirit, that is: But the works of the flesh are evident, and so on. And on the contrary: But the fruit of the Spirit is love, and so on. But we should not despair of consistency in these matters; because the history of divine writings contains the works of the flesh, not helping much those who understand it in this way, as it is written. Who indeed will not be taught to serve luxury, and to have fornication as nothing: since he has read of Judah entering to a harlot (Gen. XXVIII); and that the patriarchs had many wives at the same time? How will he not be provoked to idolatry, who thinks that the blood of bulls and the other sacrifices of Leviticus signify no more than what is stated in the letter? But that enmities are taught openly in the words of Scripture, and this is proven from this passage: Daughter of Babylon, miserable, blessed is he who will repay you your recompense, which you have repaid to us. Blessed is he who holds, and dashes your little ones against the rock (Ps. CXXXVI, 8, 9). And from that: In the morning I would destroy all the sinners of the earth (Ps. C, 8), and so on with similar things: namely, contentions, emulation, wrath, quarrels, dissensions. To these (if we do not understand anything deeper) examples from history rather provoke us than prevent. Moreover, heresies have arisen more from a carnal understanding of Scripture than from the work of our flesh, as many believe. We also learn about envy and drunkenness through the letter of the Law. Noah becomes intoxicated after the flood, and the patriarchs feast with their brother Joseph in Egypt (Gen. IX and XLIII). But even feasts are written in the book of Kings; David dances and plays the timbrels before the Ark of the Covenant of God (I Sam. VI), and similar things. It is asked how the simple divine speech of Scripture, which is called flesh, provokes us to witchcraft and evil arts, unless we transcend to the same spirit of Scripture. I think this means that Daniel and three young men were found wiser than the magicians and Chaldeans, and Moses was educated in all the wisdom and teaching of the Egyptians. Therefore, there is an opportunity for many evils if one remains in the flesh of Scripture. Those who do so will not inherit the kingdom of God. Therefore, let us seek the spirit and fruits of Scripture, which are not said to be lacking. Indeed, with much labor and sweat, and with worthy cultivation, the fruit of the spirit is found in the Scriptures. Therefore, I believe that Paul spoke diligently and cautiously about the meaning of the Scriptures for the carnal: 'Now the works of the flesh are obvious' (Galatians 5:19). But about the spiritual, he did not place it there as he did before; rather, the fruit of the spirit is evident: 'But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, and so on' (ibid., 5:22). And if we leave behind the symbols and move on to the truth of the Scriptures and the spirit, immediately the first love is revealed to us, and as we progress towards joy, we reach peace, through which we attain patience. But who is not educated by pity and goodness, when even those things which are considered sad by some, I say, in the Law, are punishments, and battles, and destructions of nations, and threats to peoples through prophets, he will understand that remedies are more beneficial than punishments? For the Lord will not be angry forever (Isaiah 57). Therefore, when these things have been made clear to us, we will have a more reasonable faith, and our corrected behavior will be accompanied by temperance, which will be followed by continence and chastity. And after all these things, the Law will begin to be for us. Up to this point, the origins. To which we can add, so that we may say that those called from legal servitude to the freedom of the Gospel (as it is said above: Stand, and do not again be bound by the yoke of servitude) are also now warned not to think that it is permissible for them to use this very freedom of living as an occasion for the flesh: namely, to live according to the flesh, to be circumcised according to the flesh; but rather, to stand in the Spirit, to cut off the foreskin of the flesh by the Spirit, and, aiming for higher things of the Spirit, to forsake the humility of the letter. However, it can also be understood in another way. Let someone learn: If I have ceased, O Paul, to be under the Law, and have been called to freedom from servitude: therefore, I must live in a manner that is fitting for freedom, not being bound by any precepts, but doing and fulfilling whatever pleases and suggests my will. To which the Apostle responded: We are indeed called to freedom in the spirit, but in such a way that freedom itself does not serve the flesh. And let us not think that because all things are lawful for us, all things are expedient: but rather because we have ceased to be servants of the Law and have become free, let us serve one another through charity, so that the multifarious precepts of the Law may be summarized in one chapter of love.

<h2 id='tocuniq89'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) But serve one another through love, for the entire law is fulfilled in one statement: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. When he was free from all, he made himself a servant to all for the sake of love, so that he might gain more. (1 Corinthians 13) He rightly urges and exhorts others to serve him through love, which does not seek its own interests, but the interests of others. For whoever wants to become first, shall be the servant of all. (Mark 10:44) Just as the Savior, though in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be used for his own advantage. Instead, he emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, and being made in human likeness. And when he was found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. (Philippians 2) So let us also realize that whatever we seemed to be obligated to do under the necessity of the Law, it is now known that it should be done by us, who are free, through love. But charity is the greatest good, so that all the law is summed up in it. The Apostle also enumerates the goods of charity in another place, saying: Love is not jealous, love does not act improperly (I Cor. XIII, 7, 8). After mentioning many things in between, he concludes: Love hopes all things, endures all things, charity never fails. And the Savior in the Gospel says that this is the sign of his disciples, if they love their neighbor (Matth. XXII). Which indeed I think not only applies to humans, but also to angels. In other words, it is said: What you do not want done to you, do not do to others, and what you want others to do to you, do the same to them (Ibid., VII, 12). I do not want to commit adultery with my wife, I do not want to rob others of their possessions, I do not want to be falsely accused, and to summarize everything in a few words, I feel indignation when something unjust is done to me. If these same things, whether done by me for the sake of charity or done by me for another, or simply willed by me, the entire law is fulfilled. And it is not difficult to show how all the commandments, such as 'you shall not kill,' 'you shall not commit adultery,' 'you shall not steal,' 'you shall not bear false witness,' and others similar to these, are all upheld by the observance of charity alone. It is difficult to demonstrate, however, how the various sacrifices prescribed in Leviticus, along with the regulations concerning clean and unclean foods, and the yearly celebration of festivals, are summarized in one commandment of charity. Unless someone argues that the Law is spiritual and that we served the heavenly things through images and examples before the true Pontiff came, who, after offering himself as a victim once, redeemed us with his own blood, all that complexity and difficulty of the ancient Law is fulfilled in his love for humanity. For the Father loved the world so much that he gave his most beloved and only Son for us. But he, who once living in spirit, mortified the works of the flesh, and being beloved by the Savior, is no longer called a servant, but a friend, there is no longer any law imposed, which is established for the impious and sinful, and those who are not subject and wicked. But now, although we do all things that are more difficult or even in part, we do not do this one thing, which is easier to do and without which all the things we do are in vain. The body feels the injury of fasting; vigils afflict the flesh; alms are obtained through hard work; blood is shed in Martyrdom, although faith may burn, it is not shed without pain and fear. All these things are done by those who have love alone without work. And because love alone makes the heart clean, it is attacked by the devil within us, so that we do not see God with a pure mind. For when I am seated and speak against my brother, and set a stumbling block before the son of my mother (Ps. XLIX, 20), when I am tormented by another's happiness, and I make another's good my own evil, is it not this that is fulfilled in me: If you bite and devour one another, take heed that you are not consumed by one another? Charity is a rare possession. Who wants to be cursed by Christ for his brothers, following the Apostle? Who, when mourning with those who mourn, rejoices with those who rejoice, is wounded by someone else's wound? Who is destroyed by the death of his brother? We are all more lovers of ourselves than lovers of God. See how great the good of charity is. If we have martyred ourselves so that we want our relics to be honored by men: if, following the opinion of the crowd, we have fearlessly shed our blood and given up our possessions to our own beggary, to this work not a reward is owed but a punishment: and the torments of betrayal are more than the crown of victory.


<h2 id='tocuniq90'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another. This can be taken simply as not to harm one another, lest we seek revenge with curses, lest we desire to make others sorrowful when we are sorrowful, and like beasts, to bite and be bitten in return, so that after biting comes destruction and annihilation. However, it is better, in line with reason and the overall context of the Epistle, not to suddenly break into extraordinary precepts, but to understand it in this way, that we refer everything back to the observation of circumcision and the Law. If others disturb you, but you are disturbed. If you read the whole of the Old Scripture, and understand it as it is written: Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth (Deuteronomy 19:21), and anger desires vengeance, but revenge imposes pain, which the law not only does not prohibit, but even commands, restoring justice in retaliation, it follows that the one who is stripped naked will strip, the one who is wounded will wound again, the one who is eaten will bite back, and what appears to be justice will become destruction, not avenging one, but consuming both.


<h2 id='tocuniq91'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. And this should be understood in two ways according to the previous context: that those who have put to death the deeds of the flesh by the Spirit, and have sown in the Spirit, will reap eternal life, whenever they feel the urge of the flesh for pleasure, they will not fulfill its desire (which, if fulfilled, seems to flatter for a time), but rather restrain it by the Spirit, and live more in accordance with the command of the mind (as Sallust, the historian, says) by the rule of the soul and the service of the body. And also this, because it is a spiritual law (Rom. VII), and not one that is outwardly Jewish, but one that is hidden, and circumcision of the heart in spirit, not in the letter, we say that they walk in the Spirit and do not fulfill the desires of the flesh, those who spiritually depart from Egypt, and draw from the spiritual rock the spiritual food and drink, who are not judged in food or drink or in any part of a festival day, or new moon, or sabbath, but walk in all things spiritually, not fulfilling the desires of the fleshly law or of the letter, but reaping the fruits of spiritual understanding. A third interpretation has also been spoken of by some in this place, but it does not differ much from the second, as they assert that the desire of the flesh is in those who are little children in Christ, but the journey of the spirit is in the perfect men, and it means having understanding. Walk in the gravity of the spirit, that is, in the journey of the perfect man, and you will not fulfill the desires of the little children.

<h2 id='tocuniq92'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) For the flesh desires against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh. For these are opposed to each other, so that you do not do what you want. The flesh is delighted by present and temporary things, but the spirit by eternal and future things. Amidst this conflict, the soul stands, having in its power both good and evil, to want and not to want, but not having perpetual wanting and not wanting itself: because it can happen that when it agrees with the flesh and does its works, it, remorseful through repentance, will join with the spirit and do its works. This is therefore what he says: For these oppose each other, that is, the flesh and the spirit: so that you may not do whatever you desire. Not that we have our own authority, by which we either agree with the flesh or the spirit: but because what we do is not properly ours, but the work itself is attributed to either the flesh or the spirit. It is a great labor and dispute to find something in-between, after the works of the flesh and spirit have been shown, which neither seems to pertain to the flesh nor to the spirit. We are called carnal when we give ourselves entirely to pleasures. We are called spiritual when we follow the Holy Spirit, that is, when we understand with Him as our teacher and learn from Him as our author. I consider philosophers to be carnal, who think that their own thoughts are wisdom, concerning whom it is rightly said: A carnal man does not receive (or perceive) the things of the spirit. For it is foolishness to him. In order for this to be made more clear, let us take some examples: Flesh, earth, soul, gold, spirit, fire can be called. As long as gold is in the earth, it loses its name, and when mixed with the earth, it is called by the name of the earth itself. But when separated from the soil, it receives both its appearance and name as gold, although it is not yet proven. However, if it is heated and purified by fire, then it acquires the splendor of gold and its own dignity. Similarly, the soul, which is composed of both matter and spirit, namely the flesh and the spirit, is called flesh when it submits itself to the flesh, and spirit when it does so to the spirit. But if he believes his own thought and considers himself to have found the truth without the grace of the Holy Spirit, he is marked as a base man by the appellation of a mere animal. This place can be better explained and become like a single series and body, interweaving and not contradicting itself. Brothers, you have been called from the bondage of the Law to the freedom of the Gospel. But I beg you, do not abuse this freedom for license and think that everything that is permissible is expedient for you, and give no opportunity to the flesh and to indulgence. Rather learn that this freedom is greater than servitude, so that what the Law previously extorted from the unwilling, now you serve to one another through charity. For all the burden of the Law and its many precepts are not so much excluded by the grace of the Gospel as they are condensed in one brief message of charity, that we love our neighbor as ourselves. For whoever loves their neighbor fulfills the whole law (Matthew 22), giving them good and not causing harm. But if love ceases to exist, and there is no charity by which the whole law is fulfilled, there will be a kind of public robbery among men, as they devour and bite each other, and are consumed by one another. But you, brothers, must live according to the spiritual law, so that you do not fulfill the desires of the flesh. For the flesh fears cold, despises hunger, weakens through sleeplessness, burns with lust, and desires all things soft and pleasant. On the contrary, the spirit seeks those things which are contrary to the flesh, and those which are able to weaken it. And thus it happens that not because you have ceased to be under the bondage of the Law, do you think yourselves to be free: but rather you should know that you are held captive by nature, by the law of nature, because even if the law does not command, and nature has ceased, not your will, of course, follows after your works, but you are frequently compelled to do them, the flesh resisting the spirit, those things which you do not want to do. From this, brothers, I beg you not to give your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but rather to serve the spirit, so that you may begin to do what you want and owe nothing to the law, that is, not to be under the flesh. Because only then will you truly have the freedom of the law abolished in the Gospel, when the flesh no longer compels you to do what you do not want, but serving the spirit, you will teach yourselves that you are not under the Law. And because we began to explain this passage according to two different interpretations above, what we omitted must be returned. The flesh desires against the spirit, that is, a carnal understanding of the stories and teachings of Scripture, which opposes allegory and spiritual doctrine. But the spirit opposes the flesh, that is, it rejects lower things in favor of eternal things, and truth opposes shadows. And the carnal sense of Scripture, which cannot be fulfilled (for we are not able to do everything that is written), shows us that we are not placed in the power of fulfilling the Law, even if we want to follow the letter, because impossibility does not allow it.


<h2 id='tocuniq93'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law. The Spirit he is not referring to is the one about whom the Apostle speaks elsewhere: The Spirit Himself testifies to our spirit that we are children of God (Romans 8:16), that is, it does not signify the spirit of a man who is within himself, but rather the Holy Spirit: by following Him, we become spiritual and cease to be under the Law. It should be noted that here the word 'spirit' is not used with the definite article or any other modifier, as we see in other cases, such as 'the spirit of gentleness' or 'the spirit of faith,' but rather it is simply called the Spirit. This seems to have some significance, which is more observed in Greek than in our language (since we do not have definite articles). The question is raised here, if anyone who is led by the Spirit is not under the Law, whether Moses and the prophets, being led by the Spirit, lived under the Law, which the Apostle denies; or if, having the Spirit, they were not under the Law, which the Apostle affirms here; or if, while living under the Law, they did not have the Spirit, which it is wicked to believe of such men. To this we will respond briefly: It is not the same thing to be under the Law and to be as if under the Law; just as it is not the same thing to be in the likeness of sinful flesh and to be in actual sinful flesh. And the true serpent does not have the same meaning. And the resemblance of a bronze serpent, which Moses hung in the wilderness (Num. XXI). Therefore, holy prophets and Moses, walking in the spirit and living in the spirit, lived not under the Law, but as if under the Law, so that they seemed to be under the Law; but they would benefit those who were under the Law, and would provoke them from the lowliness of the letter to the height of the spirit. For even Paul, who became a Jew to the Jews, and all things to all men, to benefit all (I Cor. IX): he did not say he became under the Law, but as if under the Law, to show that he kept not the truth of the Law, but the resemblance. We seem to have solved the proposed question. But what about that passage from Paul's chapter 504 saying: 'But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law' (Galatians 4:4)? For if Christ was under the law, and not just as if under the law, the whole preceding argument will be in vain. But this objection will be resolved in its proper place. For he who was made under the law in order to redeem those who were under the law, certainly subjected himself to the law willingly, even though he was free from the law. And Paul was much freer, for he testified that he was not under the law, but as if under the law." } And how did he descend into the filth and abyss of death for our sake, we who were praying and saying: Who will free me from the body of this death? (Rom. VII, 14) Likewise, he willingly chose to be born from a woman and to be under the Law, so that he might save those who were born from a woman and under the Law. And certainly, he was not born from a woman, that is, from a married woman, but from a virgin. However, the term "virgin" was erroneously applied to a woman because of those who did not know that she was a virgin. And so, because of those who considered Mary to have a husband, a woman was placed in the role of a virgin: in the same way, because of those who thought that Christ was under the Law, not knowing that he had been made for those who were under the Law, he is said to have been made under the Law himself.

<h2 id='tocuniq94'>(Vers. 19-21.)</h2>

(Verses 19-21.) Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are: fornication, uncleanness, lust, idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dissensions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like. Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God. When I explained the difference between flesh and spirit, I said that there are three possible interpretations: either those who are fleshly, who are young and carnal and cannot receive solid food and the nourishment of mature age in Christ; or those who are carnal, who follow only the Jewish tradition and the letter of the law; or, according to a simple understanding, to subsist in the flesh and the spirit in the fiction of man, and according to the diversity of substance, either the works of the flesh or the spirit. Now, therefore, those things which are called the works of the flesh, namely, fornication, uncleanness, lust, and other things that follow, seem to me to pertain more to the simple understanding of the flesh and spirit than to the flesh of the Law and the little ones in Christ, although in that place where we translated the word of Origen's Stromate exactly word for word above, it is expressed what can also be thought of these things. But what he says: But the works of the flesh are manifest, or shows that they are known to all: because they are inherently evil and to be avoided, to such an extent that even those who do them desire to hide what they do. Certainly, these things are evident only to those who have believed in Christ. For many of the Gentiles boast in their shame and think that if they have fulfilled pleasure, they have achieved a sort of victory over vices. But also, he eloquently points out that works are done in the flesh, whereas the fruits are in the spirit: because vices end and perish in themselves, while virtues sprout and overflow with fruits. And let us not think that the soul has no work, if vices are attributed to the flesh and virtues to the spirit. Because the soul (as we have said) is placed in a certain middle part, it is joined to the flesh, and it is said of it: My spirit will not remain in these men, because they are flesh (Gen. 6:3); or it is united to the spirit, and it passes into the name of spirit. For whoever is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Therefore, the first work of the flesh is fornication. He sets it forth plainly at the beginning, so that we may not be uncertain about the middle parts. For whatever a man does, it is outside the body, but the one who commits fornication sins against his own body. And we are not our own: for we are bought with a price. Therefore let us glorify and bear God in our body. In this the fornicator is of greater sin: for he takes the members of Christ and makes them the members of a prostitute. For indeed, they will be two in one flesh. He who is not faithful, nor believes in Christ, makes his members the members of a prostitute. But he who believes and commits fornication, makes the members of Christ the members of a prostitute. On the other hand, I do not know whether an unbeliever in fornication violates or builds a temple to an idol. For through vices, especially demons are worshipped. This one thing I know: that those who fornicate after the faith of Christ violate the temple of God. According to the work of the flesh, it is called impurity, and it is followed by lust. For just as in the old Law, Scripture generally includes the unspeakable crimes that are done in secret (for it is most shameful even to mention them, lest the mouth of the speaker and the ears of the listeners be defiled), saying: 'Make the children of Israel abstain from all impurity' (Leviticus 15:31). So in this place, it has named other extraordinary pleasures, even the works of marriage, if they are not done modestly and with honor, as though under the eyes of God, so that only for the purpose of procreation may they be performed, impurity and lust. Fourth, in the catalog of the works of the flesh, idolatry holds a place. For whoever once gives themselves over to luxury and pleasure, does not regard the Creator. Furthermore, all idolatry, revelry, gluttony, excess, and those things that are beneath the belly, are enjoyed. And lest perhaps sorceries and wicked arts are not seen to be prohibited in the new Testament, they are also named among the works of the flesh. For often through magical arts, it happens to both love the wretched and be loved by them. Enmity, moreover, which is established after sorceries, reveals upon whom the liability rests, subjecting it to a clear accusation of a crime. For as much as it is within our power, we should have no enemies, but rather be at peace with everyone. Yet if, by speaking the truth, we earn some enemies, it is not so much that we are their enemies, as they are enemies of the truth. For what is also said in Genesis to Abraham: 'I will be an enemy to your enemies, and I will oppose those who oppose you,' is to be understood above all that Abraham was not so much an enemy to them, as they were enemies to his virtues and religion, through which he, having trampled upon idols, worshipped God." } And also what is commanded to the people of Israel, that they should be enemies to the Midianites with perpetual hatred, and transmit discord to future generations (Num. XXXI), as if to say to those who were under the law and deserved to hear in another place: You shall hate your enemy (Matth. V, 43). Or certainly not so much of persons as of morals is the dissension made: just as God wisely placed enmities between the serpent and the woman, so that their friendship might be useless to man, and through which he was cast out of Paradise: so also in the case of the Israelites and the Midianites, the difference in their way of life was greater than that between two nations that are condemned. The seventh place among the works of the flesh is occupied by contention, placed in a certain as if sacred and eminent position among the vices, number 507. But it is not fitting for a servant of the Lord to quarrel, but rather to be gentle towards all, a teacher, patient, instructing with gentleness even those who oppose (II Tim. II, 24, 25). After contention, the eighth place is taken by emulation, which is more significantly and noticeably called ζῆλος in Greek. Indeed, I do not know who among us lacks this evil. For they were jealous, even Joseph's brothers, and Mary, Aaron the prophet of God and priest, were deceived by such passion against Moses (Genesis 37, Numbers 12): so much so that what Scripture has narrated, saying, 'And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine' (Exodus 15:20), and so on, afterwards she was thrown out of the camp, stained with the blemish of leprosy, and marked with a longer penance of separation for seven days (Numbers 12). Then anger follows, which does not carry out the justice of God (James 1), and is a type of fury. However, there is a difference between anger and wrath: the angry person is always angry, while the wrathful person is only stirred up for a time. And I do not know who can possess the kingdom of God, since someone who is angry is separated from the kingdom (Matthew 5). They also prohibit the quarrels, which the Greeks specify as ἐριθείας (since rixa means fighting), from the kingdom of God. But ἐριθεία, on the other hand, is when someone is always ready to contradict and takes delight in someone else's anger and engages in quarrels that are characteristic of women, and provokes the one who is disputing. This is also called φιλονεικία by the Greeks. Moreover, divisions are also the works of the flesh: when someone is not at all perfect and speaks with the same mind and the same judgment, saying, 'I am of Paul,' 'I am of Apollo,' 'I am of Cephas,' 'I am of Christ' (1 Cor. 1:12). And this same dissension is found among households as well: namely, husbands against wives, fathers against sons, brothers against brothers, fellow servants against fellow servants, soldiers against tentmates, artisans against fellow artisans of the same work. Sometimes it happens that there is a disagreement even in the interpretation of the Scriptures, from which heresies, which are now being manifested in the work of the flesh, arise. For if the wisdom of the flesh is hostile to God (Rom. VIII) (and all doctrines of falsehood that are opposed to God are also hostile), then heresies are consequently hostile to God and are attributed to the works of the flesh. Αἵρεσις, however, is Greek and is derived from choice, namely, that each person chooses for themselves the discipline they consider to be better. Therefore whoever understands Scripture differently from what the sense of the Holy Spirit demands, which it was written in, though he may not have departed from the Church, he can still be called a heretic, and he is choosing the works of the flesh, preferring what is worse. Envy follows heresies, which we cannot believe to be the same as zeal. For zeal can be taken in a good sense when someone strives to emulate what is better. But envy is tormented by the happiness of others, and it is divided into a double passion: either when one is something in which he does not want another to be, or seeing another as better, he grieves that he is not like him. A certain skilled person, translating a Greek verse, composed in elegiac meter about envy, saying:

Injustice is nothing but envy: which immediately gnaws at the author himself, and torments the soul. The blessed Cyprian also wrote a very excellent book on Zeal and Resentment: anyone who reads it will not hesitate to attribute envy to the deeds of the flesh. However, there is a difference between being envious and being envied: the envious person envies someone who is happier. But the envied person is the one who suffers envy from another. Drunkenness holds the fourteenth place among the works of the flesh. For indeed, drunkards will not possess the kingdom of God. And the Lord said to the disciples: Take heed, lest your hearts be weighed down with [the] wine and [excessive] revelry (Luke 21:34). Wine overturns a person's understanding: [their] feet stumble: [their] mind wavers: [their] desire is kindled: Hence the Apostle cries out: And wine in which is debauchery (Ephesians 5:18). Each person has the power of their own opinion. I follow the Apostle: in wine there is luxury, in wine there is drunkenness. But drunkenness and luxury are counted among the works of the flesh, and he cannot deny it who is overcome by these same passions. And although some may criticize me in that book, which I wrote about the preservation of virginity, for saying that young women should avoid wine as if it were poison, I do not regret my opinion. For in that work wine is more condemned than God's creature, and we have allowed a license for the virgin who is fervent with the heat of her own age, so that she may not drink too little under the pretext of moderation, and perish. Furthermore, we knew that wine is consecrated into the blood of Christ, and wine was ordered to be given to Timothy to drink. However, drunkenness can come from wine as well as from other types of alcoholic beverages that are made in various ways; from which it is said about the holy one: 'He shall not drink wine or strong drink' (Luke 1:15). Strong drink is interpreted as drunkenness. And so that no one, not drinking wine, might think that something else should be drunk, the cause is excluded; since everything that can cause drunkenness is equally removed with wine. The fifteenth, and also the last, of the works of the flesh is revelry. For the people ate and drank, and they rose up to play (Exod. XXXII, 6). Drunkenness is always joined to luxury. A certain eloquent and not unknown speaker, when describing an awakened drunkard from his sleep, said: 'He could not be awakened from his sleep, nor could he be sober while awake.' With this statement, he expressed in a way that he was neither dead nor alive. It would be lengthy to repeat all the works of the flesh and make a list of vices. Therefore, he concluded everything in his speech, saying these things and others similar to them. Oh, how I wish we could avoid these things as easily as we understand them! I warn you, as I previously warned: those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. As he had previously said, 'Let not sin reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions' (Rom. VI, 12). All of these things have sin, in which we have perhaps lingered longer than necessary, while distinguishing them. Therefore, in the soul in which sin reigns, the kingdom of God cannot reign. For what participation is there between righteousness and iniquity? What communion is there between light and darkness? What agreement is there between Christ and Belial? (2 Corinthians 6:14-15). And we think that we will obtain the kingdom of God if we are free from fornication, idolatry, and sorcery. Behold, enmities, contentions, anger, quarrels, dissensions, drunkenness, and other things which we consider to be small, exclude us from the kingdom of God. It doesn't matter whether someone is excluded from happiness alone or with others, since all things equally exclude. In Latin codices, adultery, impurity, and homicide are also included in this list of vices. But it should be noted that not more than fifteen works of the flesh are mentioned, about which we have also discussed.

<h2 id='tocuniq95'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. And what other fruit of the Spirit should have the primacy, if not love, without which the other virtues are not considered virtues and from which all good things are born? For indeed, in the Law and in the Gospel, it holds the primacy: You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself (Deuteronomy 6:5; Matthew 22:37)." } The charity is filled with so many good things, and above briefly we have depicted it, and now even if it suffices to say a little: that love does not seek its own things, but the things of others (I Cor. XIII). And although someone may be hostile to the diligent person due to their own fault, and may try to provoke their tranquility with waves of hatred: nevertheless, that person is never disturbed: they never consider a creature of God worthy of hatred. For charity covers a multitude of sins (I Petr. IV, 8). That which is also said by Jesus: A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit (Matthew 7:18), I believe applies not so much to men as to the fruits of the flesh and the spirit. For the spirit can never produce the vices that are enumerated in the works of the flesh, nor can the flesh produce the fruits that arise from the spirit. However, it is possible through the negligence of the possessor that the spirit dwelling in a person may not have its fruits, and on the other hand, the flesh, when its works are mortified, may cease from sinning. However, they do not proceed to the point where the neglected tree produces the fruit of the spirit, and the cultivated tree bears spiritual fruits. In the second place of spiritual fruits, joy is placed: which even the Stoics, who distinguish subtly between words, consider to be something different from happiness. For they say that joy is the elation of the soul over things worthy of rejoicing, while happiness is the unrestrained elation of the soul that does not know moderation, and even rejoices in things that are mixed with vice. Others in the region place pleasure in delight: not the kind that excites the body to lust, tickles the senses, or flatters with sweet affection; but another equivalent pleasure, which without moderation and any beauty of joy, raises its voice in laughter. If this is true, and the distinction between their words is not deceptive but is, let us consider that perhaps this is why it is said: The wicked do not rejoice, says the Lord (Isai. LVII, 21). Moreover, it must also be noted that after love, joy follows. For whoever loves someone, always rejoices in their happiness. And if they see them deceived by some error and falling into the slippery slope of sin, they will indeed grieve and hasten to rescue them, but they will not be able to change joy into sadness, knowing that no rational creature can perish eternally in the sight of God. The third fruit of the spirit is peace, from which Solomon, who preceded Christ in the foreshadowing, also received his name. And the Psalmist sings about the Church: His place has become peaceful (Ps. 75:2). And among the eight blessings of the Gospel, it is written: Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God (Matt. 5:9). In the first psalm of the degrees, it is also sung: With those who hated peace, I was peaceful (Ps. 120:6). And we should not seek peace only in that we are not in conflict with others, but then the peace of Christ, that is, our inheritance, is with us, if a tranquil mind is not disturbed by any passions. After peace comes longanimity, or patience: because we can interpret both in the same way. The opposite of this is pusillanimity, about which it is written: The pusillanimous person is exceedingly foolish, but the patient person endures all things, a wise man (Eccli, VII). And when someone is called much wise, he is also called longanimous, as it is written in Proverbs: A longanimous man is much wise (Prov. XIV, 29). Also, kindness or gentleness, because in Greek Χρηστότης signifies both, is a virtue that is gentle, pleasing, tranquil, and suitable for the company of all good things, inviting to familiarity, sweet in discourse, and temperate in manners. Finally, Stoics define kindness as a virtue that is willingly inclined towards doing good. Kindness is not much different from goodness itself, because it also seems to be inclined towards doing good. However, it differs in that goodness can be more serious, with a stern expression and strict behavior, indeed doing and fulfilling what is demanded, but not being pleasant in social interactions and not inviting everyone with sweetness. Followers of Zeno also define kindness as a virtue that is beneficial, or a virtue from which usefulness arises, or a virtue for its own sake, or an affection that is the source of benefits.


Among the fruits of the Spirit, faith holds the seventh and most sacred place, which is also listed elsewhere among the three: hope, faith, charity. It is not surprising if hope is not mentioned in this list, since it is in faith that what is hoped for resides: and so the Apostle, writing to the Hebrews, defines it thus: Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen (Heb. XI, 1). For what we hope for is yet to come, and we possess it by faith, hoping to hold what we believe. It is also asked how faith is placed in charity. The one who loves never considers themselves to be harmed: they suspect nothing except what they love and are loved in return. But when love is absent, faith also departs. After faith, gentleness is counted, which is opposed to anger, fights, and discord: and is never provoked by its opposite, truly like a good tree bearing good fruit. Through this, the servant of God Moses earned the testimony of Scripture, which says: Moses was meek, more than all men on the earth (Num. XII, 3). Above the earth, He says. For He could not be above those who saw God face to face, because we are often compelled to do many things through the weakness of the flesh. Concerning David, though many consider him a prophet of our Lord, which we do not deny, the Holy Spirit sings in a foreshadowing of His coming: Remember, O Lord, David, and all his meekness (Ps. 104:15). Whose meekness shone most brightly against Saul, Absalom, and Shimei (1 Sam. 24; 2 Sam. 15)? When one wanted to kill him, another was plotting new things, another was trying to deceive the authority. One was throwing stones at him, scattering dust, shouting and saying: 'Get out, get out, wicked man.' Extreme self-restraint is placed in the fruits of the spirit. Which we should not only embrace in chastity, but also in food and drink, in anger and mental distress, and in the desire to slander. However, there is a difference between moderation and self-restraint, that moderation is in perfect and accomplished men, of whom the Savior says: 'Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth' (Matthew 5:4). And about himself: Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart (Matt. XI, 29). Continence, indeed, is a virtue in progress, but has not yet reached its goal, because desires still arise in the mind of the one who practices continence and defile the soul, although they do not prevail or lead the thinker to action. However, continence is necessary not only in desires and cravings, but also in the other three disturbances: sorrow, joy, and fear. Against such fruits of the spirit, there is no law. For indeed the Law is not given for the righteous: but for the unjust and disobedient, for the impious and sinful (1 Timothy 1:9). The Law tells me: You shall not commit adultery; you shall not kill; you shall not bear false witness; you shall not steal; you shall not covet; you shall not swear falsely; you shall not steal (Exodus 20:12-17): if I do not do all these things, with the fruit of the spirit reigning in me with love, the precepts of the Law are unnecessary for me. Finally, the wise men of the world have believed this about philosophy, that what public laws force people to do out of necessity, philosophy persuades them to do willingly.

<h2 id='tocuniq96'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24.) But those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its vices and lusts. Origen, connecting this passage to the previous ones, reads it as follows: 'There is no Law against such, who have crucified the flesh of Christ with its vices and lusts,' so that it does not say, as it sounds in Latin, that those who belong to Christ have crucified their own flesh with vices and lusts, but that the flesh of Christ has been crucified by them with its vices and lusts. And he asks how the crucifixion of the flesh of the Lord is put in praise, concerning those who have the fruits of the Spirit and against whom the Law ceased to be, when it is mentioned in Hebrews to their derogation: Crucifying again in themselves the Son of God, and making a show (Hebrews 6:6). Instead of 'crucifying again', a better compound word in Greek is 'ἀνασταυροῦντες', which can be interpretted as 'recrucifying'. First, therefore, it must be noted that to crucify is one thing, to crucify again is another. Then, because to crucify the Son of God again is not the same as to crucify the flesh of Christ with vices and desires. For the flesh of Christ is not principally and properly the Son of God, but Jesus Christ, who, being in the beginning with the Father, God the Word became flesh and emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, in order to crucify the flesh and strip the principalities and powers, triumphing over them on the cross (Phil. 2), to fulfill the saying of the Apostle: For he who is dead, he is dead once, to sin (Rom. 6:10). Therefore, if our bodies are members of Christ, then our flesh is also the flesh of Christ, which we crucify, mortifying through it on earth, fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed. And about us it is now said in praise, who have crucified the flesh of Christ Jesus with vices and desires, and always carry the mortification of Jesus in our body, so that his life may also be manifested in our flesh. But it is not a small labor to live in the present age, so that the life of Jesus may already be revealed in our flesh. For in this way our mortal bodies will be brought to life through the Spirit dwelling within us. Where the Latin interpreter has put vices, in Greek they are read as παθήματα, that is, passions. And because passion can signify both pain and other bodily necessities, the Apostle carefully introduced desires: so as not to seem to deny the nature of the body in spiritual men, but vices. And let this be so understood, if we follow the Vulgate edition, reading: But they who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the vices and concupiscences: that we may say, not that they have crucified the flesh of Christ, but their own. I have almost forgotten the second interpretation. For I had declared that all things which follow are to be referred to the Law and to circumcision. Therefore, the sense is as follows: In those who have the fruits of the Spirit, charity, joy, and the rest, these have crucified with his 515 passions and desires that bodily understanding of the Scripture, which is now called the flesh of Christ, which produces nourishment for the vices in little children and infants. He crucified the flesh of Christ, which does not militate according to the flesh of history, but follows the spirit of the preceding allegory.

<h2 id='tocuniq97'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) If we live by the spirit, let us also walk by the spirit. Let us use this testimony against those who do not want to understand the Scriptures spiritually. But who is the one who lives by the spirit, if not our hidden man, who sometimes also tends to live according to the flesh? But when he lives by the spirit, he walks by the spirit. When he wishes to walk in the flesh, he is living as one who is dead. The perfect man in Christ always lives in the spirit: he obeys the spirit, he never lives in the flesh. And on the other hand: Whoever gives himself entirely to the flesh and assigns himself to passions never lives in the spirit. Among these are those who we cannot call spiritual or carnal; but those who fluctuate between virtues and vices, sometimes drawn towards better things and are spirit: sometimes they are overpowered by the slippery nature of the flesh and they are flesh.

<h2 id='tocuniq98'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26.) We will not become vain glory seekers, provoking one another, envying one another. The Greek word κενόδοξοι, translated by the Latin interpreter with three words, expresses the idea. The numerous definitions and meanings of glory, the countless books of philosophers, and Cicero's two volumes on glory bear witness to this. But because we strive to discuss not the etymology of words, but the meaning of Scripture, we will connect this passage with the previous ones: If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit, not by the Law, but by serving one another in love. We should not argue about the interpretation of the Scriptures and say: Circumcision is better, no, but foreskin. History should be disregarded, and allegory should be followed instead, even though allegory is empty and shadowy, and has no firm roots in truth. Therefore, it happens that envy arises among us. For they wish to exclude you, saying that you should imitate them, not desiring to teach the truth of the Law, but to conquer. But in order not to completely omit the word of glory, leaving their foolishness to the philosophers, let us reconsider some things concerning the Scriptures. The opinion of the crowd, and the praise sought after by the favor of men, sounds like the name of glory, where it is said: But they do all their deeds to be seen by others (Matt. XXIII, 5). And elsewhere: How can you believe, when you seek the glory that comes from one another (John V, 44)? But in a positive sense in the same place: And do not seek the glory that comes from the only God. From this we understand that the same word can mean virtue or vice. If I seek glory from men, it is vice; if from God, it is virtue, who also encourages us towards true glory, saying: But I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks it and judges (John V, 44). In the divine scriptures, glory signifies something else, when it presents itself to human sight as more majestic and divine. The glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle, and in the temple that was constructed by Solomon, there was glory (1 Kings 8). And in the face of Moses, when he did not know that his face had been glorified (Exodus 40). I think the Apostle also speaks of this glory, saying: But we all, with unveiled faces, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord (2 Corinthians 3:18). And the Savior himself, called the splendor of glory and the representation of the substance of God (Heb. 1). Stephen also saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at his right hand (Acts 7). But in order that we may presume the liberty of inventing names for ourselves, for new things (as a certain person says) new names are to be invented: because it is said here: Let us not become desirous of vain or empty glory: let us assert that those are desirous of full glory, who desire the glory of God, and praise worthy of virtue, and something showing a more divine aspect." } And in many places. Our people transferred power for glory. I have long desired to speak out, but I am held back by the fear of speaking. Nevertheless, I will speak, and I will not be silent about my passion, a passion almost common to all, not about wealth, not about power, not about beauty and physical attractiveness; for these things are clearly called the works of the flesh. If charity is done for the sake of praise, the glory is empty: a long prayer followed by a pale face from fasting. These are not my words, but those of the Savior in the Gospel (Matt. VI). Chastity itself also often seeks human applause in marriage, widowhood, and among virgins. And what I have long been afraid to say, but it must be said, even martyrdom, if done for the purpose of admiration and praise from our brothers, is in vain that blood is shed. Let the Apostle speak, let the vessel of election speak: If I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me nothing (1 Cor. XIII, 3). He who said: 'I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago, whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not, God knows, he was caught up to the third heaven' (2 Corinthians 12:2). And after a little while: 'Caught up into Paradise, he heard secret words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter: to him, I say, who has labored more than all, that the greatness of the revelations might not lift him up, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to buffet me, lest I be exalted.' And certainly three times he asked the Lord that he depart from him; but it was said to him: My grace is sufficient for you; for power is made perfect in weakness. What work is so much of God as to read the Scriptures, to preach in the Church, to desire the priesthood, to minister at the altar of the Lord? But even these, unless someone carefully guards his heart, arise from the desire for praise. You may see many (which even Cicero said) inscribing their books with titles about despising glory, and for the sake of glory, marking the titles with their own names. We interpret the Scriptures: often we translate the style: we write what is worthy of reading; and if they are not done for the sake of Christ, but for the memory of future generations and the reputation amongst people, all our labor will be in vain: and we will be like a sounding gong and clanging cymbal (1 Corinthians 13). You may see many people arguing about the Scriptures among themselves: making God's word a wrestling match: they challenge each other, and if they are defeated, they envy: for they are eager for empty glory. I know from the Latin manuscripts, in the testimony that we have cited above 518, that if I deliver my body to be burned, I may have glory; but due to a similarity of words, both in Greek and Latin, 'burned' and 'to have glory' are distinguished by only one letter, and this error has also crept in among us. But even among the Greeks themselves, there are different versions.

<h2 id='tocuniq99'>(Chap. VI.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter VI, Verse 1) Brothers, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted. Knowing that Paul is a servant of God who desires not the death of a sinner but his repentance (Ezekiel XVIII, XXXIII): and except for the Trinity, every creature, although it does not sin, is capable of sinning. He also exhorts those who are spiritual to extend a helping hand to the one who is falling, lest they themselves sin out of fear. And beautifully, he calls the man, who can die, preoccupied in the crime: showing from his very name the fragility of his condition; so that he may be worthy of forgiveness, who, like a man deceived by error, and engulfed in a whirlpool, cannot raise himself without help and without an assistant. However, a man is not added to the spiritual, but it is commanded as if to God, that he may instruct the man preoccupied in the crime: or (as is better understood in Greek) perfect in the spirit of gentleness. However, when someone is being perfected, not everything is lacking for them, but some things. In fact, if they have not erred due to many sins, but because of some fault that has preoccupied them, let them employ the spirit of gentleness and meekness in correcting the spiritually erring sinner, so that they may not desire to correct the one who is straying in a harsh, angry, and sad manner; but rather, let them provoke them, promising salvation and forgiveness. Let them bring forth the testimony of Christ, that he invites those who are burdened by the heavy load of the law and sins to his sweet and light yoke, so that they may learn to be humble and meek, and find rest for their souls. Let us use this testimony against heretics: who, inventing diverse fables of nature, say that a spiritual, good tree produces never bad fruits. Behold the Apostle, whose authority they themselves follow, says that those who are spiritual can sin, if they are inflated by the height of their heart and fall. This we also acknowledge; and we say that those who are earthly can become spiritual, if they turn to what is better. We can oppose to ourselves what is written to the Corinthians: What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in charity, and the spirit of meekness? (1 Corinthians 4:21) For if there he says that he comes to sinners, not in the spirit of meekness, but with a rod: how does he here not apply a rod, but the spirit of meekness to those who have been prevented from sinning in any way? However, there it is said to those who, after sinning and not realizing their error, did not want to be subjected to their superiors and corrected by penance. But when a sinner, understanding his wound, entrusts himself for healing to the physician, there the rod is not necessary, but the spirit of gentleness. But it might also be asked whether someone should instruct a sinner in the spirit of gentleness for this reason: that he should consider himself, lest he too be tempted. Therefore, the righteous person, who is certain in his own mind and knows that he cannot be led astray, should not instruct the sinner in the spirit of gentleness? To this we will say, even if the righteous person has overcome, knowing how much labor he has overcome, he will be all the more forgiving to the one who sins. For even the Savior was tempted, in all things like us, without sin: so that he might be able to sympathize and condole with our weaknesses, taught by his own example, how difficult victory is in the flesh. If anyone remains a virgin until old age; let him forgive one who was deceived by the heat of youth, knowing the difficulties he passed through at that age. If anyone is tortured for the confession of the name of Christ, and sees someone else denying him in torments, let him sympathize with the wounds of the denier, and not so much admire that he himself conquered, as that he conquered himself. Also beware of the writer's caution, because he did not say: Considering yourself, lest you fall; but, lest you also be tempted. For to conquer or to be conquered is sometimes within our power: but to be tempted is within the power of the one tempting. If indeed the Savior was tempted, who can be sure that the one who is untempted can pass through the storms of this life? Those who believe that Paul spoke not in truth but out of ignorance of language, yet not of knowledge, defend the consistency of this passage. For he should have spoken in order: You who are spiritual, instruct those of such a kind in the spirit of gentleness, considering yourselves, lest you also be tempted; and do not bring a plural number into a singular one. Therefore, a Hebrew from among the Hebrews, and one who was very learned in the vernacular language, was not able to express profound meanings in a foreign language; nor did he greatly care about the words, since he had the meaning in safety. These things according to simple understanding. Furthermore, in order to continue the order of the second exposition, this passage about the end of the Epistle to the Romans must be explained. For there, when he writes similarly about the customs and observances of the Jews, and those who would despise the precepts of the Law according to the letter, he distinguishes between the strong and perfect ones, and those who are still led by old customs, the weak and little ones, and he sees there to be a dispute between the spiritual ones and the carnal ones. He warns the spiritual ones not to despise the carnal ones, and he says: Receive the weak in faith, not for the purpose of disputing opinions. For another believes that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs. He that eateth, let him not despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him. Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? To his own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand. For one esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. Let not then your good be evil spoken of: For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men. Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. And again: But we who are stronger ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let every one of you please his neighbor for his good to edification (Rom. XV, 1, 2).

<h2 id='tocuniq100'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Vers. 2.) Carry the burdens of one another, and thus you will fulfill the law of Christ. For sin is a burden, and the Psalmist testifies, saying: My iniquities have risen above my head, like a heavy burden they have weighed upon me (Psalm 37:5). And Zacharias, in a vision, saw in the form of a woman a lead weight sitting on the talent, representing wickedness (Zechariah 5). The Savior bore this burden for us, teaching us by His example what we should do. For he himself carries our iniquities, and he grieves for us, and he invites those who are burdened by the weight of sin and the Law to a light burden of virtue, saying: My yoke is easy, and my burden is light. Therefore, he who does not despair of his brother's salvation, but extends a helping hand to the one who prays, and as much as he can, weeps with the weeping, is weak with the weak, and judges the sins of others as his own, he fulfills the law of Christ through charity. What is the law of Christ? This is my commandment, that you love one another (John XIII, 34). What is the law of the Son of God? Love one another, even as I have loved you. How did the Son of God love us? Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends (John XV, 13). Whoever does not have mercy, nor is clothed with the bowels of mercy and tears, even if he is spiritual, will not fulfill the law of Christ. But let us also link this place with the previous ones. For we follow a twofold understanding. If anyone is weak in faith and still nourished by the milk of infancy, they cannot so quickly transition from legal observance to spiritual sacraments. You who are stronger, bear their burdens, lest through your knowledge a brother stumble, for whom Christ died. Also bear the necessity of a brother who assists the oppressed poor burdened by destitution, and he makes friends for himself with unrighteous mammon (Luke 16), whom Christ addresses after His resurrection: Come to me, you blessed of my Father, possess the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink (Matt. 25:34, 35). In another Epistle, Paul teaches Timothy, saying: Command the rich of this world not to be haughty (because of what they have), nor to hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in God who abundantly provides for all to enjoy: to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, to share, to store up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may lay hold of true life (1 Tim. 6:1ff). He who grasps true life, that is to say, he who speaks: I am the life (John 14:6), has fulfilled the law of Christ, which leads to life.

<h2 id='tocuniq101'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3) 522 For if anyone thinks they are something, when they are nothing, they deceive themselves. If anyone does not want to bear the burdens of others, and is merciless, satisfied only with their own works and virtues, not seeking what belongs to others, but what belongs to themselves, that is, a lover only of themselves, and not also of God, they deceive themselves. However, it can be read and distinguished in two ways: Either, if anyone thinks they are something, when they are nothing; or in this way: If anyone thinks they are something, as we will infer later, when they are nothing, they deceive themselves. And this distinction resonates more in Greek than in Latin. The meaning of the first distinction here is: Whoever considers themselves to be something, and is nothing, deceives themselves. The second meaning is deeper, and pleases us more: If someone considers themselves to be something, in that they believe themselves to be something, not out of kindness towards others, but out of their own work and effort they judge themselves, content only with their own virtue, they become nothing from this very arrogance, and deceive themselves: which is better expressed in Greek as φρεναπατᾷ, that is, deceiving their own mind: for which the Latin Translator used the phrase, deceives themselves. But he deceives his own mind, who thinks himself to be wise, and according to Isaiah, he is wise in himself and intelligent in his own sight (Isa. 5). The understanding of this passage is connected to circumcision and the Law: Whoever is spiritual and does not have mercy on his neighbor, despising the humble because he himself is higher, deceives himself, not knowing that this is the law of the spirit, that we should love one another.

<h2 id='tocuniq102'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) However, let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor. The meaning is this: You who consider yourself spiritual and stronger in the weakness of others, you should not consider the weakness of the fallen, but your own strength. For if someone else cannot fully transition from Judaism to Christianity, it does not mean that you are a perfect Christian. But if your conscience does not bother you, you have glory in yourself and not in others. The athlete is not strong merely because he has conquered the weak and overcome the feeble limbs of his opponent; but if he is strong in his own strength, not in the weakness of another, he does not glory. It can also be understood differently: he who has a consciousness of good work and, considering himself, does not criticize his own work, should not boast of this before others and pour out his praise abroad, and share it with all, and seek vainglory from the favor of men. Instead, he should have glory within himself and say: But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. The one who seeks glory from another, the world is not crucified to him, nor is he crucified with Christ. For he receives his reward, which he sought from men.

<h2 id='tocuniq103'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Version 5.) For each person will carry their own burden. It seems to contradict what was said before, where it says: Bear one another's burdens: for if each person carries their own burden, they will not be able to bear the burdens of others. But it must be noted that there, it commanded us to support one another as sinners in this life and to help each other in the present age: but here it speaks of the judgment of the Lord upon us, not based on comparison with the sin of others or the comparison to someone worse off; rather, each one is judged according to their own work, whether they are sinners or saints, with each one receiving their due reward." } Although we are taught by this little saying, a new doctrine that is hidden: while we are in this present age, whether by prayers or by advice, we are able to assist one another. But when we come before the tribunal of Christ, neither Job, nor Daniel, nor Noah can intercede for anyone, but each one must bear his own work (Ezek. XIV).

<h2 id='tocuniq104'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Ver. 6.) But let the one who is being catechized communicate the word to the one who is catechizing him in all good things. Marcion interpreted this passage in such a way that he thought the faithful and the catechumens should pray together and the teacher should participate in prayer with the disciples, especially because it follows 'in all good things.' Certainly, if the subject had been prayer, the one who is being catechized should not have been instructed, but rather the one who is catechizing himself, that is, not the disciple, but the teacher. Furthermore, the rest of what follows does not agree with his exposition: What a person sows, they will also reap. And: As for those who do good, let us not grow weary, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. The sense of this is as follows: Because previously he had commanded spiritual people, who were preoccupied with some wrongdoing, to instruct them in the spirit of gentleness and to bear one another's burdens, fulfilling the law of Christ, now on the contrary, he commands those who are still weaker, and disciples, and carnal, to give carnal things to their spiritual masters, just as they themselves reap spiritual things from their masters. They who completely devote themselves to the study of divine teachings are in need of the necessities of this life; and let that which is written about the manna be accomplished: He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack (2 Cor. 8:15). But in the present place, according to the custom of the common people, he called food and clothing, and other things that are counted among good things, good. For having food and clothing, we are content with these (I Tim. VI, 8). And it is not surprising that Paul referred to those things that are necessary for the body as good: since even our Savior, to those who had not yet reached the summit of virtue but were still walking humbly and asked to have faith added to them, said: Therefore, if you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to those who ask Him (Matth. VII, 11)! I think that Job, when he was speaking to his wife, was speaking as if to one of the foolish women, in regard to her belief that he was speaking about material riches: 'If we have received good things from the hand of the Lord' (Job 2:10), and again about troubles and afflictions, which bring victory: 'Why do we not endure evil?' For surely good and evil are not placed in riches and afflictions, but in virtues and vices, as the righteous one speaks in the psalm: 'Who is the man who wants life, who desires to see good days?' Restrain your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking deceit. Turn away from evil and do good (Psalm 34:13-14 and Psalm 37:27). Evil properly refers to what should be avoided, and good to what we should do. Also, in the Gospel, the rich man who had no knowledge of good and evil correctly regarded the fertility of his fields as good, saying: Soul, you have many good things laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry (Luke 12:19). And another who lay in purple and lived in luxury, heard in the underworld from Abraham: You received good things in your life (Luke 16:25). It should also be noted that care must be taken lest this be understood as a command to the disciples to share the word with those who instruct them, to be obedient, docile, and accommodating. However, this applies only to those things that are good, that are spiritual, and that are not corrupted by heretical or Judaic wickedness.


<h2 id='tocuniq105'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) Do not be deceived, God is not mocked: whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. Being wise in the spirit, they who are taught should also provide for the needs of their teachers and assist with the necessities of life, being able to endure poverty and say, 'My field has dried up this year due to drought; my vineyard has been destroyed by hail; the taxes that could be paid have been seized.' I have no means to give what is commanded. He knows, he says, your hearts, he is not ignorant of your abilities. A plausible excuse can appease a man in any way, but it cannot deceive God. And at the same time, he encourages you to do what is commanded, mentioning the seed, so that you do not think it is lost, because you will receive it back with increased interest. He also gives the example of the exchange of gifts and the principle of sowing and reaping: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows in blessing will also reap in blessing. Each one should have in their heart a proposed plan, not out of sadness or necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver (I Cor. IX, 6, 7).

<h2 id='tocuniq106'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) For he who sows in his flesh, from the flesh he will reap corruption. But he who sows in the Spirit, from the Spirit he will reap eternal life. Everything we speak, do, and think is sown in two fields, the flesh and the Spirit. If the things that are spoken, done, and thought are good and sown in the Spirit, they will abound with the fruits of eternal life. But if they are bad and taken from the field of the flesh, they will produce a harvest of corruption for us. Another way: whoever understands the law in a carnal manner, also expects carnal promises and those that are corruptible in the present age. But whoever is a spiritual listener, sows in the spirit and will reap eternal life from the spirit. At the same time, let us note the consistency of the argument and connect it with the previous statements: the person is called a sower in the spirit, who perhaps ceases to be a human when they begin to reap eternal life. Cassianus, who introduces the supposed flesh of Christ, considers every union of male with female as unclean, being a fierce heresiarch of the Encratites, he uses the following argument against us under the occasion of the present testimony: If anyone sows in the flesh, they will reap corruption from the flesh. But it is in the flesh that one sows who is joined to a woman. Therefore, even the one who uses a wife and sows in her flesh will reap corruption from the flesh. He will be answered, first, that Paul did not say those who sow in the flesh, but in their own flesh. But, no one sleeps with themselves, and sows in their own flesh. Furthermore, to this observation that we have noted, in their own flesh, let us also grant those who eat and drink, and sleep and do something for the refreshment of the body, to sow in the flesh, and reap corruption from it. If he resorts to this, saying that those who, whether they drink, or eat, or sleep, do all things with reason in the name of the Lord, sow not in the flesh, but in the spirit; and we will respond similarly, to those who follow God's first sentence, doing things with reason: Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth (Genesis 1:22), sow not in the flesh, but in the spirit. Therefore, the syllogism is futile and transitory; first, it deceives the listener with sophistry. However, when carefully examined, it is easily solved: for we cannot say that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and other holy men, who were born from the promise, also sprung from the corrupt seed of the Lord's precursor, 527 because he was born in the flesh. It should also be noted that the one who sows in the flesh is included with the addition of their flesh, but the one who sows in the spirit is not said to sow in their own spirit, but simply in the spirit. For whoever sows good things, sows not something of his own, but sows in the Spirit of God, from whom he shall also reap eternal life.

<h2 id='tocuniq107'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) But let us not grow weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. He encourages those who are expecting the reward of good works in this life, not knowing that just as there is a different time for sowing and harvesting in seed, so it is in the present life, where the works are the seed (which are reaped either in the spirit or in the flesh), but the harvest is the future judgment, and depending on the quality or diversity of the seed, it will produce different measures for us, a hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold fruit, which no one can harvest while growing weary. For whoever perseveres until the end, will be saved. As it is also commanded in another place: Do not fail. But what is it, that while sinners increase daily in evil works, we grow weary in good works?

<h2 id='tocuniq108'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10) Therefore, while we have time, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith. It is the time of sowing, as we have said, it is the present time, and it is the life that we are living. In this life, we are allowed to sow what we desire; when this life passes, the time for action is taken away. And so the Savior says: Work while it is day; the night is coming when no one can work (John 9:4). The word of God has risen for us, the true sun, and the beasts that had withdrawn into their dens are gathered: let us proceed as men to our work, and let us labor until evening, as is mystically sung in the psalm: You have placed darkness, and it has become night. In the very act of passing, the wild beasts of the forest will come, the lion cubs roaring, to snatch away and seek from God their food. The sun rises, and they are gathered together, and in their dens they sleep. Man goes out to his work, and to his labor until evening (Ps. CIII, 20 seqq.). Whether we are sick or healthy, humble or powerful, poor or wealthy, lowly or honored, hungry or well-fed, let us do all things in the name of the Lord with patience and equanimity, and that which is written will be fulfilled in us: For those who love the Lord, all things work together for good. Anger itself and desire, and the injury that seeks revenge, if I restrain myself: if I keep quiet for God's sake: if through the sting of each provocation, and the incentives of vices, I remember that God sees me, they become an opportunity for triumph for me. Let us not say in giving: This one is a friend, I do not know this one: this one should receive, that one should be despised. Let us imitate our Father, who causes his sun to rise on the good and the evil, and rains on the just and the unjust (Matt. 5). The fountain of goodness is open to all. Both servant and free, commoner and king, rich and poor, alike drink from it. When a lamp is lit in a house, it shines equally for all. And if the reins of generosity are loosened towards all indiscriminately, how much more so towards the members of the household of faith, and towards Christians, who have the same Father and are considered by the appellation of his disciples! However, it seems to me that this place can be connected to the previous ones, so as to designate the members of the household of faith as teachers, to whom he had commanded that above all things that are considered good, be administered by their hearers. The course of this life is short. This very thing that I speak, that I dictate, that I write, that I correct, that I re-read, either grows or perishes from my time. Titus, the son of Vespasian, who, after the destruction of Jerusalem, entered Rome as a victorious avenger of the death of Domitian, is said to have been of such great kindness that on a certain night, while remembering late in the evening at dinner that he had done nothing good that day, he said to his friends: 'Today I have lost a day.' Do we think that we will not be held accountable for the hour, the day, the moments, the time, the ages when we speak idle words, for which we will have to give an account on the day of judgment (Matt. 12)? But if he said and did this without the Law, without the Gospel, without the Savior, and the doctrine of the apostles naturally: what should we do, who are condemned by both Juno and all the virgins of Vesta, and other idols containing them? Blessed John the Evangelist, while he was staying in Ephesus until his old age, and scarcely carried to the church among the hands of the disciples, and unable to weave words into longer sentences, he used to utter nothing else but this through individual gatherings: Little children, love one another. Finally, the students and brothers who were present, tired and weary of always hearing the same thing, said: Master, why do you always speak this way? He responded with a worthy statement from John: Because it is the commandment of the Lord, and if it is done alone, it is enough. This is why, because of the present mandate of the Apostles: Let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the household of faith.

<h2 id='tocuniq109'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) See with what letters I have written to you in my own hand. Those who wanted to compel the Galatians to be circumcised had spread rumors that Paul was doing some things and preaching others, and by their own works were destroying the message that anyone who asserted the abolition of the Law would be found to be under the Law. Because Paul could not personally refute this opinion everywhere (since he was imprisoned for the sake of Christ's martyrdom), he represents himself through letters. And so that no suspicion of forged letters would arise, from this place until the end, he himself wrote by his own hand, showing that the previous [letters] were written by someone else. But that letters were being sent under his name by false teachers, he also demonstrates by writing to the Thessalonians: But we ask you, brothers, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together to Him, not to be easily disturbed from your understanding, nor to be terrified, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as if it were from us, as though the day of the Lord is imminent, so that no one deceives you in any way (2 Thess. 2:1ff). And to confirm the entire letter that he was sending, to dispel any suspicion of falsehood, he signed with his own hand at the end, saying: 'The greeting of me, Paul, which is a sign in every letter; thus I write: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all' (2 Thess. 3:17-18). He also marked the letter to the Colossians, which he dictated, with his own hand, saying: 'The greeting of me, Paul: Remember my chains.' And wherever he knew that false teachers were present, who could spread new doctrines by the authority of the Apostles, he subscribed the letter with his own hand. And finally, writing to the Corinthians, among whom there were schisms and heresies, with each one saying, 'I am of Paul,' 'I am of Apollos,' 'I am of Cephas' (1 Cor. 1:12), he signed his letter with the following annotation: 'The greeting is in my own hand, Paul's. If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Maranatha.' In order to remove any opportunity for false teachers who had corrupted the Galatians from the truth of the Gospel, he concluded the end of the letter with his own hand, saying, 'See with what large letters I have written to you, not because the letters were large (which in Greek signifies 'how great'), but because they were the distinguishing marks of his own hand, so that while they recognize the marks of the letters, they might think they see the very person who wrote them.' In this place, a man highly educated in our times, I wonder how he spoke of a ridiculous thing. Paul, he said, was a Hebrew and did not know Greek letters. And because necessity demanded that he subscribe to the letter with his own hand, contrary to the usual curved paths of letters, he barely expressed them with large strokes: even in this he showed the signs of his love for the Galatians, in that he tried to do also that which he was not able to do for their sake. Paul wrote a letter in large letters, because there was great meaning in the letters, and it was not written with ink or a pen, but with the living spirit of God. And what he added, with my own hand, let us understand in practice. For this reason, it is often written in the prophets: The word of God that was made in the hand of Jeremiah, or Haggai, so that we may also know by this similarity that the word of God was made in the hand of Paul. Paul writes large letters not only to the Galatians at that time, but also to everyone today, and although the tips with which his Epistles are written are small, the letters are large, because there is great meaning in the letters.


<h2 id='tocuniq110'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12) Whoever wishes to please in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only so that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. He indicates above from where he has subscribed with his own hand: now he repeats what he has written. Gaius Caesar, and Octavian Augustus, and Tiberius, successor of Augustus, had enacted laws so that the Jews who were scattered throughout the entire Roman empire might live according to their own customs and serve their ancestral ceremonies. Therefore whoever was circumcised, even if he believed in Christ, was considered as a Jew to the Gentiles. But whoever, without circumcision, claimed not to be a Jew, was subject to the persecutions of both the Gentiles and the Jews. Therefore, those who had corrupted the Galatians wanted to avoid these persecutions and were persuading the disciples to undergo circumcision for protection. Now the Apostle refers to this circumcision as confidence in the flesh, because they were proposing circumcision in persecution to both the Gentiles (whom they feared) and the Jews (who wanted to please). Neither the Jews could persecute them, nor the Gentiles, whom they (also wanted to) see and circumcise the proselytes, and to themselves obey the precepts of the Law.

For neither do those who are circumcised keep the Law, but they desire to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh. For he says, 'The Law cannot be fulfilled because of the weakness of the flesh.' Therefore, the Jews keep the precepts and teachings of men rather than the commandments of God, since it is impossible for them to fulfill the Law both in its physical and spiritual aspects, as they do not understand the spiritual. This is why they strive, act, and exert themselves, so that they may boast among the Jews about the harm done to your flesh, and brag about having converted Gentiles to their teaching through circumcision." } However, all of this is done in order to please the Jews, and to appease the envy of the defeated Law.

<h2 id='tocuniq111'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. Only in the cross of Christ can one boast, who takes it up and follows the Savior, who crucified his flesh with its vices and desires, who died to the world and does not contemplate the things that are seen, but the things that are unseen: seeing the world crucified and its passing figure. But that world is crucified to the righteous, of which the Savior says: I have conquered the world (John 16:33). And: Do not love the world. And: You have not received the spirit of the world. To whom the world was crucified, to him the world also died: and now the end of the world has come to him, and he is worthy of the new heaven, and the new earth, and the new Testament. He sings a new song and receives a new name written on a stone, which no one knows except the one who receives it. It is asked how now Paul says: But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, where in another place he boasts of other things, as he says: Through your glory, which I have in Christ Jesus (1 Corinthians 15:31). And again: I will gladly boast of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me (2 Corinthians 12:9). And in another place: For it is better for me to die than that anyone should make my boast void (1 Corinthians 9:15), and other things that are written in this manner. But it must be known that any boasting related to the cross is glory to the cross: and whatever worthy is accomplished in virtues, this is done because of the Lord's passion.

<h2 id='tocuniq112'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Ver. 15.) For neither circumcision is anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. How the faithful and the unbelieving are divided, when they are one as to substance, according to the diversity of understanding, the Apostle says: Putting off the old man, with his works, and putting on the new, who is renewed unto knowledge, according to the image of the Creator (Coloss. III, 9, 10): so also the world, though it is one in substance, is made different and different in perception. To the sinner, the world is old; to the saint, it is new. For when the world was crucified to the saint, there is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision: neither Jew nor Gentile. But a new creature, into which the body of our humility is transformed, conformed to the glory of the body of Christ. For the old things have passed away, behold all things have become new (2 Corinthians 5). And just as the glory of the sun is different from the glory of the moon and the stars, for one star differs from another in glory, so is the resurrection of the dead (1 Corinthians 15:41-42). Daniel agrees with this, saying: Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt (Dan. XII, 2); and: Those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above. And concerning the righteous: Many shall be like the stars forever. For circumcision is not of any value, nor is uncircumcision, but a new creation without these bodily parts that can be cut off. So also we, who love God, and have prepared for us things which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man. (I Cor. II) When we shall have been transformed from the body of humility into the body of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall possess that body which neither a Jew can cut off, nor a Gentile can retain with the foreskin. Not that it is different in substance, but that it is different in glory. For it behooves this mortal to be clothed with immortality, and this corruptible to be clothed with incorruption (1 Cor. 15:53). To this, blessed evangelist John also speaks, sensing something similar: Beloved, now we are children of God and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be. We know that when it is revealed, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is (1 John 3:2). Therefore, since that body of the glory of Jesus Christ, which also had the marks of the nails after the resurrection, and entered through closed doors, has not yet been revealed, let us who have already been raised together with Christ in baptism, as a new man reborn, serve neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, but let us believe that we are already what we shall be.


<h2 id='tocuniq113'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16) And whoever follows this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. Everything is directed according to the standard; and whether things are right or wrong, they are judged when the rule is applied. Likewise, the doctrine of God is like a standard of speech, which distinguishes between what is just and unjust: whoever follows it will have peace within themselves that surpasses all understanding; and after peace, they will have mercy, which is the foremost quality of God's Israel. But the true Israel is called, in distinction from those who have ceased to be God's Israel. For they claim to be Jews and they are not, but they lie, since they belong to the synagogue of Satan. Do not be surprised, then, if just as there is a spiritual Israel, there is also a fleshly Israel, which does not have peace or mercy; concerning which it is also written to the Corinthians: 'Consider Israel according to the flesh' (I Cor. X, 18); for just as there are many gods and many lords imitating God and the Lord, whether in heaven or on earth. But beautifully, in one argument, in order to conclude the letter according to the proposed theme, he named it 'Israel of God'; so that all the things that have been said above, would be taught not outside the cause, but from the cause that has been discussed.

<h2 id='tocuniq114'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) Henceforth let no one be troublesome to me. Not as if he had failed in teaching; but just as a farmer has this trouble, if the saplings he has planted wither; and a shepherd has anxiety, if the flock he has gathered is scattered and torn apart. It is better therefore in Greek it is read, Henceforth let no one show me his troubles; so that I may not have the necessity to work among you again. The teacher is superior in his work, who lives and feels differently than the teacher who taught and did. He can also anticipate their objection, if anyone wishes to contradict afterwards, which he has also addressed to the Corinthians regarding the veiling of a woman's head and the unveiling of a man's head, after many arguments, saying: But if anyone seems to be contentious: we do not have such a custom, nor does the Church of God (I Cor. XI, 16): that is, we have spoken what seemed honorable and just to us; but if anyone is unwilling to acquiesce to the truth, he seeks what to reply and on what grounds to argue against, let him know that he is not worthy of a response, who is more ready to argue than to be taught.


But I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body. For whoever is circumcised after the coming of Christ does not bear the marks of the Lord Jesus; but he has glory in his shame. But he who has been severely wounded, often whipped in prison, stoned once, and other things that are written in the list of boasting, he bears the marks of the Lord Jesus in his body. Perhaps even he who afflicts his own body, and subjects himself to servitude, so that he may not be found preaching to others while he himself is rejected, bears the marks of the Lord Jesus in his body (1 Corinthians 9)." } The apostles were rejoicing because they had been worthy of suffering disgrace for the name of Jesus (Acts 5).

<h2 id='tocuniq115'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, be with your spirit, brothers, Amen. No dissension, no servitude to the Law, no quarrel, no debate, but may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Not at all with the flesh, not at all with the soul; whether it is because you have become spiritual, ceasing to be flesh and soul, or because even the lesser things are contained in the principal ones. For the soul and the flesh are subject to the spirit. Regarding this, Ecclesiastes speaks: The spirit will return to the one who gave it (Eccl. XII, 7). And in another place, Paul says: The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit (Rom. VIII, 16). But this grace of the Lord Jesus is not for everyone, but for those who deserve to be called brothers by the apostle, faithful brothers, and true brothers, which the Hebrew word Amen signifies. For the Septuagint translators rendered Amen as 'fiat'; Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotio faithfully or truly interpreted it. And how God confirms his words in the Old Testament by a certain custom of swearing, saying: 'As I live, says the Lord' (Num. 14:28); so also our Savior in the Gospel shows by the word Amen (536) that what he speaks is true. And that Amen signifies the agreement of the listener and is the seal of truth, the first letter to the Corinthians also teaches us, in which Paul says: 'If you bless with the spirit, how will anyone who is in the position of an outsider say Amen?' How can someone say 'Amen' to your blessing when they do not understand what you are saying? This shows that an ignorant person cannot truly respond unless they understand what they are being taught.
