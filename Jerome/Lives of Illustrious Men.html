</UL><P>You have urged me, Dexter,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6910_1809838">1</A></SUP> , to follow the example of Tranquillus<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6911_1809918">2</A></SUP> in giving a systematic account of ecclesiastical writers, and to do for our writers what he did for the illustrious men of letters among the Gentiles, namely, to briefly set before you all those who have published<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6912_1810241">3</A></SUP> any memorable writing on the Holy Scriptures, from the time of our Lord's passion until the fourteenth year of the Emperor Theodosius.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6913_1810495">4</A></SUP> A similar work has been done by Hermippus<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6914_1810593">5</A></SUP> the peripatetic, Antigonus Carystius,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6915_1810702">6</A></SUP> the learned Satyrus,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6916_1810793">7</A></SUP> and most learned of all, Aristoxenus the Musician,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6917_1810937">8</A></SUP> among the Greeks, and among the Latins by Varro,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6918_1811087">9</A></SUP> Santra,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6919_1811297">10</A></SUP> Nepos,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6920_1811340">11</A></SUP> Hyginus,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6921_1811426">12</A></SUP> and by him through whose example you seek to stimulate<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6922_1811558">13</A></SUP> us,-Tranquillus.</P>

<P>But their situation and mine is not the same, for they, opening the old histories and chronicles could as if gathering from some great meadow, weave some<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6924_1811833">14</A></SUP> small crown at least for their work. As for me, what shall I do, who, having no predecessor, have, as the saying is, the worst possible master, namely myself, and yet I must acknowledge that Eusebius Pamphilus in the ten books of his Church History has been of the utmost assistance, and the works of various among those of whom we are to write, often testify to the dates of their authors. And so I pray the Lord Jesus,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6925_1812310">15</A></SUP> that what your Cicero, who stood at the summit of Roman eloquence, did not scorn to do, compiling in his <I>Brutus,</I> a catalogue of Latin orators, this I too may accomplish in the enumeration of ecclesiastical writers, and accomplish in a fashion worthy of the exhortation which you made. But if, perchance any of those who are yet writing have been overlooked by me in his volume, they ought to ascribe it to themselves, rather than to me, for among those whom I have not read, I could not, in the first place, know those who concealed their own writings, and, in the second place, what is perhaps well known to others, would be quite unknown to me in this out of the way corner of the earth.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn69.htm#P6926_1813123">16</A></SUP> But surely when they are distinguished by their Celsus, Porphyry, and Julian learn, rabid as they are against Christ, let their followers, they who think the church has had no philosophers or orators or men of learning, learn how many and what sort of men founded, built and adorned it, and cease to accuse our faith of such rustic simplicity, and recognize rather their own ignorance.</P>

At his hands he received the crown of martyrdom being nailed to the cross with his head towards the ground and his feet raised on high, asserting that he was unworthy to be crucified in the same manner as his Lord. He wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him. Then too the Gospel according to Mark, who was his disciple and interpreter, is ascribed to him. On the other hand, the books, of which one is entitled his Acts, another his Gospel, a third his Preaching, a fourth his Revelation, a fifth his "Judgment" are rejected as apocryphal.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn70.htm#P7073_1818490">22</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>James,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn70.htm#P7079_1819455">24</A></SUP> who is called the brother of the Lord,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn70.htm#P7080_1819568">25</A></SUP> surnamed the Just, the son of Joseph by another wife, as some think, but, as appears to me, the son of Mary sister of the mother of our Lord of whom John makes mention in his book,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn70.htm#P7081_1819787">26</A></SUP> after our Lord's passion at once ordained by the apostles bishop of Jerusalem, wrote a single epistle, which is reckoned among the seven Catholic Epistles and even this is claimed by some to have been published by some one else under his name, and gradually, as time went on, to have gained authority. Hegesippus who lived near the apostolic age, in the fifth book of his Commentaries, writing of James. says "After the apostles, James the brother of the Lord surnamed the Just was made head of the Church at Jerusalem. Many indeed are called James. This one was holy from his mother's womb. He drank neither wine nor strong drink, ate no flesh, never shaved or anointed himself with ointment or bathed. He alone halt the privilege of entering the Holy of Holies, since indeed he did not use woolen vestments but linen and went alone into the temple and prayed in behalf of the people, insomuch that his knees were reputed to have acquired the hardness of camels' knees." He says also many other things, too numerous to mention. Josephus also in the 20th book of his Antiquities, and Clement in the 7th of his Outlines mention that on the death of Fetus who reigned over Judea, Albinus was sent by Nero as his successor. Before he had reached his province, Ananias the high priest, the youthful son of Ananus of the priestly class taking advantage of the state of anarchy, assembled a council and publicly tried to force James to deny that Christ is the son of God. When he refused Ananius ordered him to be stoned. Cast down from a pinnacle of the temple, his legs broken, but still half alive, raising his hands to heaven he said, "Lord forgive them for they know not what they do." Then struck on the head by the club of a fuller such a club as fullers are accustomed to wring out garments<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn70.htm#P7082_1821611">27</A></SUP> with-he died. This same Josephus records the tradition that this James was of so great sanctity and reputation among the people that the downfall of Jerusalem was believed to be on account of his death. He it is of whom the apostle Paul writes to the Galatians that "No one else of the apostles did I see except James the brother of the Lord," and shortly after the event the Acts of the apostles bear witness to the matter. The Gospel also which is called the Gospel according to the Hebrews,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn70.htm#P7083_1822156">28</A></SUP> and which I have recently translated into Greek and Latin and which also Origen<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn70.htm#P7084_1822347">29</A></SUP> often makes use of, after the account of the resurrection of the Saviour says, "but the Lord, after he had given his grave clothes to the servant of the priest, appeared to James(for James had. sworn that he would not eat bread from that hour in which he drank the cup of the Lord until he should see him rising again from among those that sleep)" and again, a little later, it says "`Bring a table and bread,' said the Lord." And immediately it is added, "He brought bread and blessed and brake and gave to James the Just and said to him, `my brother eat thy bread, for the son of man is risen from among those that sleep.'" And so he ruled the church of Jerusalem thirty years, that is until the seventh year of Nero, and was buried near the temple from which he had been cast down. His tombstone with its inscription was well known until the siege of Titus and the end of Hadrian's reign. Some of our writers think he was buried in Mount Olivet, but they are mistaken.</P>

In this it is to be noted that wherever the Evangelist, whether on his own account or in the person of our Lord the Saviour quotes the testimony of the Old Testament he does not follow the authority of the translators of the Septuagint but the Hebrew. Wherefore these two forms exist "Out of Egypt have I called my son," and "for he shall be called a Nazarene."</P>

</UL><P>Paul,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7100_1824945">36</A></SUP> formerly called Saul, an apostle outside the number of the twelve apostles, was of the tribe of Benjamin and the town of Giscalis<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7101_1825118">37</A></SUP> in Judea. When this was taken by the Romans he removed with his parents to Tarsus in Cilicia. Sent by them to Jerusalem to study law he was educated by Gamaliel a most learned man whom Luke mentions. But after he had been present at the death of the martyr Stephen and had received letters from the high priest of the temple for the persecution of those who believed in Christ, he proceeded to Damascus, where constrained to faith by a revelation, as it is written in the Acts of the apostles, he was transformed from a persecutor into an elect vessel. As Sergius Paulus Proconsul of Cyprus was the first to believe on his preaching, he took his name from him because he had subdued him to faith in Christ, and having been joined by Barnabas, after traversing many cities, he returned to Jerusalem and was ordained apostle to the Gentiles by Peter, James and John. And because a full account of his life is given in the Acts of the Apostles, I only say this, that the twenty-fifth year after our Lord's passion, that is the second of Nero, at the time when Fetus Procurator of Judea succeeded Felix, he was sent bound to Rome, and remaining for two years in free custody, disputed daily with the Jews concerning the advent of Christ. It ought to be said that at the first defence, the power of Nero having not yet been confirmed, nor his wickedness broken forth to such a degree as the histories relate concerning him, Paul was dismissed by Nero, that the gospel of Christ might be preached also in the West. As he himself writes in the second epistle to Timothy, at the time when he was about to be put to death dictating his epistle as he did while in chains; "At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account. But the Lord stood by<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7102_1827037">38</A></SUP> me and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and that all the Gentiles might hear, and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7103_1827254">39</A></SUP> -clearly indicating Nero as lion on account of his cruelty. And directly following he says "The Lord delivered me from the month of the lion" and again shortly "The Lord delivered me<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7104_1827465">40</A></SUP> from every evil work and saved me unto his heavenly kingdom,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7105_1827758">41</A></SUP> for indeed he felt within himself that his martyrdom was near at hand, for in the same epistle he announced "for I am already being offered and the time of my departure is at hand."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7106_1827977">42</A></SUP> He then, in the fourteenth year of Nero on the same day with Peter, was beheaded at Rome for Christ's sake and was buried in the Ostian way, the twenty-seventh year after our Lord's passion. He wrote nine epistles to seven churches: <I>To the Romans</I> one, <I>To the Corinthians</I> two, <I>To the Galatians</I> one, <I>To the Ephesians</I> one, <I>To the Philippians</I> one, <I>To the Colossians</I> one, <I>To the Thessalonians</I> two; and besides these to his disciples, <I>To Timothy</I> two, <I>To Titus</I> one, <I>To Philemon</I> one. The epistle which is called the <I>Epistle to the Hebrews</I> is not considered his, on account of its difference from the others in style and language, but it is reckoned, either according to Tertullian to be the work of Barnabas, or according to others, to be by Luke the Evangelist or Clement afterwards bishop of the church at Rome, who, they say, arranged and adorned the ideas of Paul in his own language, though to be sure, since Paul was writing to Hebrews and was indisrepute among them he may have omittedhis name from the salvation on this account.He being a Hebrew wrote Hebrew, that ishis own tongue and most fluently while the things which were eloquently written in Hebrew were more eloquently turned into Greek<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7107_1829206">43</A></SUP> and this is the reason why it seems todiffer from other epistles of Paul. Some read one also to<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7108_1829353">44</A></SUP> the Laodiceans but it is rejected by everyone.</P>

An adherent of the apostle Paul, and companion of all his journeying, he wrote a <I>Gospel,</I> concerning which the same Paul says, "We send with him a brother whose praise in the gospel is among all the churches"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7118_1830471">48</A></SUP> and to the Colossians "Luke the beloved physician salutes you,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7119_1830572">49</A></SUP> and to Timothy "Luke only is with me."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7120_1830646">50</A></SUP> He also wrote another excellent volume to which he prefixed the title <I>Acts of the Apostles,</I> a history which extends to the second year of Paul's sojourn at Rome, that is to the fourth<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7121_1830863">51</A></SUP> year of Nero, from which we learn that the book was composed in that same city. Therefore the <I>Acts of Paul and Thecla</I><SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7122_1831056">52</A></SUP> and all the fable about the lion baptized by him we reckon among the apocryphal writings,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7123_1831265">53</A></SUP> for how is it possible that the inseparable companion of the apostle in his other affairs, alone should have been ignorant of this thing. Moreover Tertullian who lived near those times, mentions a certain presbyter in Asia, an adherent of the apostle Paul,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7124_1831606">54</A></SUP> who was convicted by John of having been the author of the book, and who, confessing that he did this for love of Paul, resigned his office of presbyter. Some suppose that whenever Paul in his epistle says "according to my gospel" he means the book of Luke and that Luke not only was taught the gospel history by the apostle Paul who was not with the Lord in the flesh, but also by other apostles. This he too at the beginning of his work declares, saying "Even as they delivered unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word." So he wrote the gospel as he had heard it, but composed the Acts of the apostles as he himself had seen. He was buried at Constantinople to which city, in the twentieth year of Constantius, his bones together with the remains of Andrew the apostle were transferred.</P>

</UL><P>Mark<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7128_1832512">55</A></SUP> the disciple and interpreter of Peter wrote a short gospel at the request of the brethren at Rome embodying what he had heard Peter tell. When Peter had heard this, he approved it and published it to the churches to be read by his authority as Clemens in the sixth book of his Hypotyposes and Papias, bishop of Hierapolis, record. Peter also mentions this Mark in his first epistle, figuratively indicating Rome under the name of Babylon "She who<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7129_1832986">56</A></SUP> is in Babylon elect together with you saluteth you<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7130_1833159">57</A></SUP> and so doth Mark my son." So, taking the gospel which he himself composed, he went to Egypt and first preaching Christ at Alexandria he formed a church so admirable in doctrine and continence of living that he constrained all followers of Christ to his example. Philo most learned of the Jews seeing the first church at Alexandria still Jewish in a degree, wrote a book<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7131_1833571">58</A></SUP> on their manner of life as something creditable to his nation telling how, as Luke says, the believers had all things in common<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7132_1833853">59</A></SUP> at Jerusalem, so he recorded that he saw<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7133_1833936">60</A></SUP> was done at Alexandria, under the learned Mark.

On this account he was compelled to maintain His divine nativity. But there is said to be yet another reason for this work, in that when he had read Matthew, Mark, and Luke, he approved indeed the substance of the history and declared that the things they said were true, but that they had given the history of only one year, the one, that is, which follows the imprisonment of John and in which he was put to death. So passing by this year the events of which had been set forth by these, he related the events of the earlier period before John was shut up in prison, so that it might be manifest to those who should diligently read the volumes of the four Evangelists. This also takes away the discrepancy which there seems to be between John and the others. He wrote also one <I>Epistle</I> which begins as follows "That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes and our hands handled concerning the word of life" which is esteemed of by all men who are interested in the church or in learning.

In this last<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7184_1845952">87</A></SUP> he bore witness to the Gospel which I have recently translated, in respect of the person of Christ saying, "I indeed saw him in the flesh after the resurrection and I believe that he is," and when he came to Peter and those who were with Peter, he said to them "Behold! touch me and see me bow that I am not an incorporeal spirit" and straightway they touched him and believed. Moreover it seems worth while inasmuch as we have made mention of such a man and of the <I>Epistle</I> which he wrote<I> to the Romans,</I> to give a few "quotations"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn71.htm#P7185_1846624">88</A></SUP> : "From Syria even unto Rome I fight with wild beasts, by land and by sea, by night and by day, being bound amidst ten leopards, that is to say soldiers who guard me and who only become worse when they are well treated. Their wrong doing, however is my schoolmaster, but I am not thereby justified. May I have joy of the beasts that are prepared for me; and I pray that I may find them ready; I will even coax them to devour me quickly that they may not treat me as they have some whom they have refused to touch through fear. And if they are unwilling, I will compel them to devour me. Forgive me my children, I know what is expedient for me. Now do I begin to be a disciple, and desire none of the things visible that I may attain unto Jesus Christ.

<P>When he had been condemned to the wild beasts and with zeal for martyrdom heard the lions roaring, he said "I am the grain of Christ.

Tell me, does a prophet dye his hair? Does a prophet stain her eyelids with antimony? Is a prophet adorned with fine garments and precious stones? Does a prophet play with dice and tables?

From this we make the following brief quotations, "We therefore celebrate the day according to usage, inviolably, neither adding anything to nor taking anything from it, for in Asia lie the remains of the greatest saints of those who shall rise again on the day of the Lord, when he shall come in majesty from heaven and shall quicken all the saints, I mean Philip one of the twelve apostles who sleeps at Hierapolis and his two daughters who were virgins until their death and another daughter of his who died at Ephesus full of the Holy Spirit. And John too, who lay on Our Lord's breast and was his high priest carrying the golden frontlet on his forehead, both martyr and doctor, fell asleep at Ephesus and Polycarp bishop and martyr died at Smyrna. Thraseas of Eumenia also, bishop and martyr, rests in the same Smyrna. What need is there of mentioning Sagaris, bishop and martyr, who sleeps in Laodicea and the blessed Papyrus and Melito, eunuch in the Holy Spirit, who, ever serving the Lord, was laid to rest in Sardis and there awaits his resurrection at Christ's advent. These all observed the day of the passover on the fourteenth of the month, in nowise departing from the evangelical tradition and following the ecclesiastical canon. I also, Polycrates, the least of all your servants, according to the doctrine of my relatives which I also have followed (for there were seven of my relatives bishops indeed and I the eighth) have always celebrated the passover when the Jewish people celebrated the putting away of the leaven. And so brethren being sixty-five years old in the Lord and instructed by many brethren from all parts of the world, and having searched all the Scriptures, I will not fear those who threaten us, for my predecessors said "It is fitting to obey God rather than men." I quote this to show through a small example the genius and authority of the man. He flourished in the reign of the emperor Severus in the same period as Narcissus of Jerusalem.</P>

When only eighteen years old, he undertook the work of instructing the Catechetes in the scattered churches of Alexandria. Afterwards appointed by Demetrius. bishop of this city. successor to the presbyter Clement, he flourished many years. When he had already reached middle life, on account of the churches of Achaia, which were torn with many heresies, he was journeying to Athens, by way of Palestine, under the authority of an ecclesiastical letter, and having been ordained presbyter by Theoctistus and Alexander, bishops of Caesarea and Jerusalem, he offended Demetrius, who was so wildly enraged at him that he wrote everywhere to injure his reputation. It is known that before he went to Caesarea, he had been at Rome, trader bishop Zephyrinus. Immediately on his return to Alexandria he made Heraclas the presbyter, who continued to wear his philosopher's garb, his assistant in the school for catechetes. Heraclas became bishop of the church of Alexandria, after Demetrius. How great the glory of Origen was, appears from the fact that Firmilianus, bishop of Caesarea, with all the Cappadocian bishops, sought a visit from him, and entertained him for a long while. Sometime afterwards, going to Palestine to visit the holy places, he came to Caesarea<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn73.htm#P7358_1877711">144</A></SUP> and was instructed at length by Origen in the Holy Scriptures. It appears also from the fact that he went to Antioch, on the request of Mammaea, mother of the Emperor Alexander, and a woman religiously disposed, and was there held in great honour, and sent letters to the Emperor Philip, who was the first among the Roman rulers, to become a christian, and to his mother, letters which are still extant. Who is there, who does not also know that he was so assiduous in the study of Holy Scriptures, that contrary to the spirit of his time, and of his people, he learned the Hebrew language, and taking the Septuagint translation, he gathered the other translations also in a single work, namely, that of Aquila, of Ponticus the Proselyte, and Theodotian the Ebonite, and Symmachus an adherent of the same sect who wrote commentaries also on the gospel according to Matthew, from which he tried to establish his doctrine. And besides these, a fifth, sixth, and seventh translation, which we also have from his library, he sought out with great diligence, and compared with other editions. And since I have given a list of his works, in the volumes of letters which I have written to Paula, in a letter which I wrote against the works of Varro, I pass this by now, not failing however, to make mention of his immortal genius, how that he understood dialectics, as well as geometry, arithmetic, music, grammar, and rhetoric, and taught all the schools of philosophers, in such wise that he had also diligent students in secular literature, and lectured to them daily, and the crowds which flocked to him were marvellous. These, he received in the hope that through the instrumentality of this secular literature, he might establish them in the faith of Christ.</P>

<P>It is unnecessary to speak of the cruelty of that persecution which was raised against the Christians and under Decius, who was mad against the religion of Philip, whom he had slain,-the persecution in which Fabianus, bishop of the Roman church, perished at Rome, and Alexander and Babylas, Pontifs of the churches of Jerusalem and Antioch, were imprisoned for their confession of Christ. If any one wishes to know what was done in regard to the position of Origen, he can clearly learn, first indeed from his own epistles, which after the persecution, were sent to different ones, and secondly, from the sixth book of the church history of Eusebius of Caesarea, and from his six volumes in behalf of the same Origen.</P>

<P>He lived until the time of Gallus and Volusianus, that is, until his sixty-ninth year, and died at Tyre, in which city he also was buried.</P>
