<h2>PREFACE</h2>

I remember just five years ago when I was still at Rome[^1]
and studying virtuous Blesilla's book of Ecclesiastes that I taught her to
think lightly of her generation and to esteem futile everything that she saw in
the world. I remember too being asked by
her to examine individually all the difficult passages in a short treatise so
that she might be able to understand what she was reading without me always
being present. Accordingly, since she
was taken from us by her sudden death while I was still doing the preparation
for my work, and since we, it seems, dear Paula and Eustochium, did not deserve
to have such a companion in our lives, I then ceased from my work, silenced by
the terrible grief of such a misfortune. 
Now though, situated in Bethlehem, clearly a more holy city, I can
fulfil that promise to the memory of Blesilla and to you, and remind you
briefly that I have used no authority in this work, but have rather translated
directly from the Hebrew itself and have adapted it to the traditional language
of the Septuagint in those passages which do not differ greatly from the
Hebrew. Occasionally I have taken
account of the Greek versions, those of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion so
that I do not deter the reader's enthusiasm with too much novelty. I have also not pursued those streams of
conjecture, which lack a factual basis, for I do not believe this to be
sensible.

<h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<b>1:1. <i>The words of Ecclesiastes, son of David, King in Jerusalem.</i></b> The
Scriptures state very clearly that Solomon was known by three names: 'Peace-making', that is 'Solomon'; 'Yedidia',
that is 'beloved of Yahweh'; and the name used here 'Qoheleth', that is
Ecclesiastes. He is called Ecclesiastes
in Greek because he gathered together a crowd of people, <i>a congregation</i>, which we can call a demagogue because he spoke to
the people and his sermon was not addressed specifically to one man but more
usually to all men. Moreover he is
called 'peace-making' and 'beloved of Yahweh' because there was peace during
his reign and the Lord loved him. For
also Psalms 44, and 71, are known by titles connected with love and
peace-making. Although these psalms
pertain to Christ and the Church they exhibit Solomon's joy and strength, and
according to tradition were composed concerning Solomon.

He also produced an equal number of titles to the three volumes: <i>Proverbs</i>, <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, and <i>Song of
Songs</i>. He teaches for children in <i>Proverbs</i> and gives instruction in the
form of maxims almost with a sense of duty, and his sermons here are repeated
continually to his son. In <i>Ecclesiastes</i> he teaches a man of mature
age that he should not think anything in the world to be perpetual, but that
all things that we perceive are in fact vain and fleeting. In <i>Song
of Songs</i> he embraces an elderly man in the covenant, who has already been
prepared in spurning his times. For
unless we first abandon our moral failings and renounce the pomposity of our
world, and prepare ourselves so we are ready for the arrival of Christ, we will
not be able to say: "let him kiss
me from the kiss of his mouth"[^2]. Philosophers educate their followers in a
manner similar to this type of instruction: first of all they teach ethics,
then explain physics, and then anyone whom they see to excel in these first two
they then go on to teach theology. 
Moreover even this should be examined more closely because Solomon is
named differently in the three books. In
<i>Proverbs</i> for example he is thus
named: <i>The Proverbs of Solomon, the son
of David, King of Israel.</i>[^3] But in Ecclesiastes: <i>The words of Ecclesiastes, son of David, King of Jerusalem. </i>'Israel'
in fact is unnecessary here because it is not found in the Greek or Latin
manuscripts. But in <i>Song of Songs</i> he is neither named 'son of David', not 'King of
Israel' or 'King of Jerusalem', but only as <i>The
Song of Songs of Solomon</i>. This is
just as the Proverbs and the crude arrangement pertain to the twelve tribes and
to the whole of Israel. And although the
contempt of the world only comes to city-dwellers, these are the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, therefore Solomon intends <i>Song
of Songs</i> particularly for those who desire spiritual enlightenment. To those readers just embarking on their
education paternal honour and the authority of the king are claimed in their
own merit, but to those who have completed their learning, and in the case
where the disciple has been enlightened not by fear, but by love, his own name
suffices. Then, he is equal to his
teacher and he is unaware that he is a king. 
This is the case here. But in a
more spiritual understanding Solomon was peace making and beloved of the Lord
God, and Ecclesiastes can be seen as our Christ too, who destroying the inner
wall and expelling evil from his flesh, makes each of them one, saying -
"I give you my peace, I relinquish my peace to you"[^4],
about which the Lord says to his disciples "This is my chosen son whom I
love: listen to him" [^5],
and that is he who is father of the Church. 
Speaking by no means to the Synagogue of the Jews but to the crowd of
people the King of Jerusalem (that which was built out of the living rocks, not
that about which he says "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill
prophets" [^6],
and "Look, let your empty house be left for us" [^7]),
but that by which it is forbidden to swear because it is the city of a great
king. This is the son of David, to whom
the blind cried out in the Gospel: "pity us, son of David"; and the
whole crowd sang out in unison: "Hosanna to the son of David". Then there is the fact that the word of God
does not come to him as is the case with Jeremiah and the other prophets, but
on account of his being rich, being a king, holding power, his wisdom and his
other virtues, he speaks to the men of the church himself, and he speaks words
to the apostles about which Psalm 18.5 tells us: "their sound went out to
the whole world and their words went to the ends of the earth". Some scholars think wrongly, therefore, that
we are tempted into desire and luxury by this book, when it teaches quite to
the contrary: everything we perceive in the world is vain; nor is it fitting
for us to seek those things eagerly which perish while we possess them.

<b>1:2. <i>Vanity of vanities</i></b> said Ecclesiastes<i>,<b> Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</b></i> If all things that God made are truly good
then how can all things be considered vanity, and not only vanity, but even
vanity of vanities? Just as Song of
Songs means a song that stands out from amongst all songs, so we see that in
"vanity of vanities" the degree of vanity is shown. It is also written similarly in Psalm 38.6:
"Nevertheless every living man is vanity." If living man is vanity then a dead man must
be vanity of vanities. We read in Exodus
that Moses' face is glorified so much that the children of Israel are not able
to see him[^8]. Paul the apostle said that his glory was not
really glory when compared to the glory of righteousness: "For even that
which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory
that excelleth." [^9] We are therefore able to say that even we in
this respect, heaven, earth, the seas and all things that are contained within
its compass can be said to be good in themselves, but compared to God they are
nothing. And if I look at the candle in
a lamp and am content with its light, then afterwards when the sun has risen I
cannot discern anymore what was once bright; I will also see the light of the
stars by the light of the setting sun, so in looking at the world and the
multitudinous varieties of nature I am amazed at the greatness of the world,
but I also remember that all things will pass away and the world will grow old,
and that only God is that which has always been. On account of this realisation I am compelled
to say, not once but twice: <b>Vanity of
vanities, all is vanity.</b> Instead of
"vanity of vanities" the Hebrew text reads 'abal abalim' which all
manuscripts excepting that of the Septuagint translate similarly in Greek as <i>atmos atmidon </i>or<i> atmon </i>which we are able to translate as 'a breath' and 'a light
wind which is quickly dispersed'. In
this way it is shown to be vain and in no way universal by this phrase. For those things which seem to be temporal,
in fact are; but those which do not are eternal. Or since that which will give rise to vanity
has been exposed, he groans and is anxious and awaits the revelation of the
sons of God, and "now we know in part, and we prophesy in part" [^10]. All things are and will be vain, until we
find that which is complete and perfect.

<b>1:3. <i>What
profit is there for a man in exchange for all his toil, which he toils under
the sun?</i></b> After the general opinion that all things are
vain Solomon begins to explain with regard to mankind: because men exert
themselves in vain in the toil of the world, amassing wealth, teaching
children, working their way towards glory, constructing buildings, and then are
taken away in the midst of their work by sudden death, they hear the words:
"Thou fool, this night your soul shall be required of you, then whose will
be those things that you have amassed?" [^11] Just as they make nothing for themselves in
exchange for all this toil, so they return naked to the earth from whence they
were taken.

<b>1:4. <i>A
generation goes, a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.</i></b> 
While some men die, others are born, and those you had seen, are not
seen anymore, and you then see those who have not been before. What is more vain than this vanity, than that
the earth remains, which was made on account of mankind? And that man himself, the master of the earth,
should be suddenly returned to the dust? 
Another meaning of this is: the first generation of Jews dies and a
generation formed from all peoples takes its place; but the earth however will
remain for so long as the Synagogue's influence slips away, and the Church
becomes more powerful. For when it was
predicted that the Gospel would be known all around the world, then, it was
said, would be the end. When the end is
approaching, it is true, the sky and the earth will pass away. Solomon very precisely does not say the earth
remains <i>through the ages</i>[^12]
but <i>through that age</i>[^13]. More precisely we praise the Lord not in one
age, but throughout the ages.

<b>1:5. <i>The sun
rises and the sun sets, then it rushes to its place, where it rises again.</i></b> The
sun itself, which is given as light for mankind, shows the orbit of the world
by its rising and it setting every day. 
After the sun has soaked its burning orb in the ocean, it returns by
routes unknown to me to that place whence it had come; and when the period of
night is over, it again bursts out quickly from its bed. In place of "rushes to its place"
though, because we are following the Vulgate version, the Hebrew reads "<i>soeph</i>" which Aquila interpreted as <i>eispnei</i> in Greek, that is <i>pants[^14]</i>;
Symmachus and Theodotion write '<i>returns</i>'
because the sun clearly turns around to its original place and it aspires to
return there, from whence it had come earlier. 
But all of this is explained so that he can teach that with the passage
of time and the rising and the setting of the stars man's age slips away and
perishes, yet he does not know this for certain. Another meaning of this is: the sun of
righteousness, in whose wings lies reason, rises from those who fear and sets
midday in the false prophets. But when
it has risen it takes us to its place. 
Where is that? Evidently it means
to the Lord himself, for it happens that he raises us from the earth to heaven,
saying, "when the son of man is lifted up, he will lift up all things to
him".[^15] Nor is it surprising that the son lifts up
men to himself, when even the Lord himself lifts up to his son: "for no
one", he says "comes to me except the Father, who sent me, draw
him".[^16] That sun therefore, which we have said sets
for some and rises for other, and once set for Jacob the patriarch as he was
leaving the Holy Land, rose again for him when he entered the promised land
from Syria. When Lot too left Sodom and
came to the city, which he was commanded to hasten to, he climbed a mountain
and the sun came out above Segor[^17].

<b>1:6. <i>It goes
to the South and rotates to the North; turning, revolving, the wind goes and
returns upon its circuits.</i></b>  From this we are able to believe
that the sun approaches the meridian quarter in the time of winter, and in the
summer is near to the Great Bear, and does not commence its movements in the
equinox of autumn, but when the west wind is blowing in the time of spring,
when all things give birth. But he
actually says "turning, revolving, the wind goes and returns upon its
circuits" as if he calls the sun itself a breath, like an animal that
breathes and lives, completing its annual orbit in its course, just like the
poet Vergil says: "Meanwhile the sun flies around the great year"[^18]
and elsewhere[^19]
"and the year flies through its own footsteps" or that bright sphere
of the moon and Titan's star: "The breath nourishes within: and the
intelligence stirs the whole mass infused through the limbs, and mingles itself
with the mighty body"[^20]. He is not speaking about the annual course of
the sun, but its daily path. For it
proceeds sidelong and towards the North, and thus turns to the East. Another meaning of this verse is: when the
sun moves to the South it is closer to the Earth; when it moves to the North it
is raised to higher orbits. Perhaps
therefore it moves to those parts, which are compressed together by the cold of
atmospheric disturbances, and of winter. 
Severe heat indeed blazes out from the North above the Earth, and that
sun is closer to righteousness than those men who in fact live in the Northern
region, and who are deprived of summer's heat. 
The sun then moves far away and turns by its circuits to the place
whence it set out. For when it has
subdued all things to it and illuminated all things with its rays, let there be
the first restoration and "God may be all in all".[^21] Symmachus interpreted this phrase saying, 'it
goes to the meridian, and turns around to the North; turning the wind goes, and
the wind returns by those routes by which it had come around'. 

<b>1:7. <i>All torrents flow into the sea but the sea is not filled. To the place from which the torrents come,
there they return to go.</i></b> Some men believe that the fresh waters that
flow into the sea are either dried up by the burning sun above, or are feed for
the salt-thirsty sea. Here our Ecclesiastes,
the creator of the very waters, says that they return to the heads of the
springs by means of hidden passages, and always boil out from their deep
channels into their springs. The Hebrews
believed that the rivers or sea had more significance in the metaphor of man,
because they return to the earth, whence they originated. They are also called torrents not rivers
because they flow that much more forcefully, yet the earth however is not
filled with a great number of dead men. 
More precisely if we go down to the deeper parts, the turbid waters
return to the sea where they used to remain. 
And unless I am mistaken, apart from the additions to the text, nowhere
is the word 'torrent' found in a good context. 
For "you will drink those with the torrent of your desire" [^22],
although "of desire" is written in an addition. On the contrary the Saviour was taken to the
brook Cedron[^23],
and Elisha at the time of persecution hid away in the brook of Chorat, which
even dried up. But the sea is not filled
up completely, in the same manner as the bloodthirsty daughters in Proverbs[^24].

<b>1:8. <i>All
things are full of toil, man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with
seeing, nor is the ear filled with hearing. 
</i></b>It is difficult
to know not just about physics but also about ethics. And discourse is not able to explain the
natural causes of things, nor to see those things that are hidden, (as the
scope of this work demands); nor, once you have begun to learn is it possible to
arrive at the greatest understanding by listening alone. For if we now look in the mirror in mystery
and in part know and in part prophesy, consequently discourse will not be able
to explain what it does not know; nor is the eye able to see where it is blind;
nor are the ears filled by what they do not hear. At the same time this must be noted, that all
words are wearying and are learnt with great difficulty, contrary to those who
idly make prayers that an acquaintance with the Scriptures will come to them.

<b>1:9. <i>The
thing that has been, it is that which will be. 
And that which is done is that which shall be done. And there is no new thing under the sun.</i></b> It seems to me that he now speaks generally about those
things that he enumerated above: about generation after generation, the globe
of the earth, the rising and setting of the sun, the course of rivers, the
vastness of the ocean and all things which we learn either through thought or
through sight or hearing, because there is nothing in nature that has not been
before. For from the beginning of the
world men have been born and have died, and the earth stood level above the
waters and the sun lay in its origin. 
And lest I should go on to list more things, it is left to God as
creator to fly with the birds, to swim with the fish, and walk with the
creatures of the earth and slide with snakes. 
And the comic[^25]
said something similar to this: "Nothing has been said, which has not been
said before", about which my teacher Donatus, when he was lecturing about
this verse, said: "Let them die, who have said our words before us." [^26]
Then if is possible to say nothing new in discourse, how great the creation of
the world must have been, which has been complete right from the start, that
God was able to rest from his work on the seventh day! Read also in another book: "If
everything that is done under the sun has already been done is past centuries,
and man was already made when the sun was made: then man existed before he came
under the sun."[^27] But he is excluded, because by this reasoning
even packhorses, gnats, and each insect and large animal is said to have been
made before the sky. Unless however he
should reply that talking comes from the consequences of speaking not about
other animals but about the man Ecclesiastes, for he says "there is nothing
new under the sun about which one can say 'look this is new!' But he does not speak of animals but of man
alone, because if he means animals to be new, then he refutes his own opinion
that nothing is new under the sun.

<b>1:10. <i>Is
there anything whereof it may be said, see this is new? It has already been for
ages, which were before us. </i></b>Symmachus translated this more clearly:
"Do you think there is a man who is able to say: look this is new, it has
already been done before because it was before us." But he agrees with his predecessors that
there is nothing new in the world, and that there is none that is able to live
and say: 'look this is new', since everything that he thought he had shown to
be new, already existed in former times. 
But we ought not to think that the signs, prodigies and the many deeds
which are done for the first time by God's judgement in the world today, have
already been done before in former ages, or that it was Epicurus who found
this, asserting that these same things were done in innumerable periods and in
these places and by these same men. 
Besides, both Judas betrayed <i>repeatedly</i>
and Christ <i>often</i> suffered for us; and
other things which have been done and will be done, are continually repeated in
these times. But it could be said too,
that those things, which will be done have already been done, decided out of
foreknowledge and the predestination of God. 
For those who have been chosen in Christ before the constitution of the
world existed already in previous times.

<b>1:11. <i>There is
no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of
things that are to come with those that shall come after.</i></b>  In the same
way as the past is concealed for us in forgetfulness, thus it is with those
things which are either done now, or will be done. And because of this those men who have yet to
be born, will not be able to know these things, and will live life in silence,
and will be obscured as if they never existed, and that verse will be
fulfilled, which says, "vanity of vanities, all is vanity", for even
the Seraphim, the first and last, cover up their feet on account of the
appearance of God. The Septuagint is
similar here: "There is no memory of former things, and even of things
which are to come, there will be no memory for them with those who will come
after." That is observed from the
Gospel because those who were first in time are first <i>before all others</i>.[^28] And because God who is benevolent and
forgiving remembers all things no matter how insignificant, he will not give as
much glory to those who deserve to be first on account of their faults, as he
will give to those who humbly wanted to be first. And so it says consequently: "there is
no memory of the wise more than of the fool for ever." [^29]

<b>1:12. <i>I,
Ecclesiastes, was King over Israel in Jerusalem. </i></b>Until now the preface has spoken only generally about
all arguments; but here he returns to the subject of himself, and reveals who
he was, and how he knew and experienced all things. The Hebrews say that Solomon, who was doing
repentance, wrote this book, and who, having put his trust in wisdom and
riches, failed God because of his wives.

<b>1:13. <i>I
applied my mind to seek and probe by wisdom all that happens beneath the sky -
it is a sorry task that God has given to the sons of man with which to be
concerned.</i></b> Aquila, the Septuagint, and Theodotion have
all translated the Hebrew word <i>anian </i>similarly
as <i>peristasmon</i>, which the interpreter
expressed as <i>occupied</i> in Latin[^30],
because the mind of man is torn asunder when occupied by several
anxieties. But Symmachus uses the Greek
word <i>ascholian</i>, which means business[^31]. Since therefore in this book it is more often
called either <i>occupationem</i>, or <i>distentionem</i>, or whatever else we have
called it, they all refer to the higher senses.  Ecclesiastes therefore set his mind first of
all to the acquisition of wisdom, and pursuing this beyond what is allowed,
wanted to know the causes and reasoning why children are easily snatched by the
Devil; why the righteous and the wicked are equally punished in shipwrecks; and
whether these events happen as a result of fate, or by the decree of God. And if by fate, where is providence? If by
decree, where is God's justice? With
such desire to know these things, he said, I understand the great care and
torturing anxiety experienced in many things, which was given to man by God, in
order that he might desire to know that which he is not allowed to know. But the cause is inborn first, and God then
gives vexation. For it is written
similarly in the epistles to the Romans: "<i>On account of what did God give them up to the suffering of dishonour?</i>"
[^32]
then again he says: "<i>On account of
what did He give them up to uncleanness, so that they did what was not allowed</i>".[^33] And then: "<i>On account of which God gave them up to desire for their uncleanness</i>".[^34] And to the Thessalonians: "<i>And for this cause God will send them strong
delusion.</i>" [^35] But the causes why they succumb were revealed
earlier: either by the suffering of dishonour, or by vile affections, or by the
longing in their heart, or whatever it is they do to receive strong
delusion. In this way and because of
their effectiveness God gave this wicked 'occupation' to man, with which to be
concerned, because he did these things first voluntarily and entirely of his
own will. 

<b>1:14. <i>I have
seen all the deeds done underneath the sun, and behold all is futile and a
vexation of the spirit.</i></b> We are compelled here by necessity to examine
the Hebrew words more closely than we wish. 
It is also not possible to know the real meaning of the text, unless we
learn it through studying the original Hebrew words. Aquila and Theodotion translate <i>routh<b>
</b></i>as the Greek <i>nomen</i>, Symmachus
has <i>boskesin</i><b>. </b>The Septuagint does not
express the Hebrew meaning, but the Syriac, as shown in the Greek word <i>proairesin</i>. Therefore either <i>nome</i>, or <i>boskesis</i>, is the
noun coming from <i>vexation.</i> <i>Proairesis
</i>sounds more like 'will' than 'vexation'. 
Every single man however is said to do what he <i>wishes</i>, and what seems right to him; and men are borne with different dispositions (i.e.
good and wicked) of their own free will. 
And all things under the sun are vain, when we displease each other by
doing what is the greatest good and greatest evil. A Hebrew, who was instructing me as I read
the Holy Scriptures, said to me that above the word <i>routh</i> was written "<i>it
means rather suffering and wickedness in this place than vexation and will</i>",
and the meaning does not come from the evil which is contrary to good, but from
that which is written in the Gospel: "<i>Sufficient
to the day is its wickedness.</i>" [^36] The Greeks call this more significantly <i>kakouchian</i>, so the verse essentially
means: "I have considered all things, which are done in the world, and I
discovered nothing except vanity and wickedness, that is distress of the soul,
by which the spirit is afflicted in contrary thoughts.

<b>1:15. <i>A
twisted thing cannot be made straight, and what is not there cannot be
numbered. </i></b>Whoever is wicked cannot be corrected,
unless he was corrected beforehand. 
Anything that is already correct will receive embellishment; and that
which is deviated will receive correction. 
A man is not called wrong unless he has been diverted from the correct
path. This is contrary to the heretics,
who entertained certain characteristics, which do not seem to be sane. And since what is missing is lacking, it
cannot be numbered. Besides, only the
firstborn of Israel were counted. The
women, slaves, children and the people from Egypt, although of a great number,
were largely overlooked, being referred to as a reduction from the army,
without a number. The meaning of this
can also be: such wickedness is done in the sphere of the world that the world
is scarcely able to return to its completely good condition; nor is it able to
regain easily its order and complete state, in which it was first created. Another meaning of this is: when all men have
been restored to goodness through repentance, only the devil will remain in his
wickedness. For all things which are
done under the sun are done by his will and in the spirit of malevolence, while
sins are piled on sins at his instigation. 
Then it can also mean: so great is the number of deviants and of those
who have been taken away from God's flock by the devil that it is impossible to
count them.

<b>1:16. <i>I said
to myself: here I have acquired great wisdom, more than any of my predecessors
over Jerusalem, and my mind has had much experience with wisdom and
knowledge.</i></b> Solomon was not greater than Abraham and
Moses, and other saints, but than those who were before him in Jerusalem. We read in the book of Kings that Solomon was
very wise, and he claimed this wisdom to have been given by God before all
others.[^37] It was then the eye of his heart that saw
great wisdom and knowledge in the world, since he does not say <i>I spoke much wisdom and knowledge</i> but <i>my heart saw much wisdom and knowledge.</i> For indeed we are not able to speak out all
those things which we feel.

<b>1:17. <i>I
applied my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this, too, is a vexation of
the spirit.</i></b> Contrary abstract ideas are understood by
looking at contrary facts; and " wisdom is the first to be lacking in
foolishness" [^38],
but it is not possible to be lacking in foolishness, unless one has understood
it. Many dangerous things are also
created from foolishness, so that while we try to avoid them, we are actually
instructed in wisdom. Solomon wanted to
know wisdom and knowledge with equal enthusiasm, and equally madness and folly,
so that whilst seeking some things and shunning others, his true wisdom might
be proved. But in this too, as in other
things, he said he found great difficulties and was not able to grasp the exact
truth of matters. What I have said above
about <i>vexation of the spirit</i> or <i>suffering of the soul</i>, as it is more
often written in this book, should be sufficient to understand the rest of this
verse. 

<b>1:18. <i>For
with much wisdom comes much grief, and he who increases knowledge increases
pain.</i></b> The more a man seeks wisdom, the more he finds himself
in vice and far from those virtues, which he is seeking. For those who are powerful suffer torments
more gravely[^39],
and more is demanded of the man, to whom more is entrusted. Because of this he increases his pain who
increases his knowledge, and is saddened by grief according to God, and suffers
beyond his offences. The apostle said
concerning this: "and who is there, who gladdens me, unless he is saddened
by me?" [^40] Unless perchance, and this must be
understood, that a wise man would suffer so much for his wisdom, in secret and
deep in his flank, nor would he show himself to prosper in intelligence, as
light is to seeing; but rather through certain torments and intolerable toil,
and through perpetual meditation and enthusiasm.

<h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>

<b>2:1. <i>I said to myself: Come, I will experiment with joy and enjoy pleasure. That, too, turned out to be futile.</i></b> After I detected that pain and labour were in the
essence of wisdom and the accumulation of knowledge, and nothing else except
vain and endless struggle, I felt joyful that I would overflow with excess,
accrue riches, amass great wealth, and take temporary pleasures before I
die. But even in this I saw my vanity,
for past pleasures do not help the present, and do not fill up what is
empty. It is not just the pleasures of
the flesh however, but also spiritual joys that are a temptation for one who
possesses them. Hence I desired greatly,
because I had been grabbed by this incentive and the angel of Satan too, who
had knocked me down with such force that I could not recover. Solomon says about this "Don't give me
riches and poverty" [^41],
and immediately writes underneath "lest I be full and a liar"[^42],
and lest I should ask, "who is looking at me?"[^43],
for the devil strikes down in abundance righteous men. In the apostles it is also written,
"lest enraptured by his pride, he should fall into the judgement of the
devil "[^44],
that is 'into such a judgement, as the Devil himself falls ". But having said this, spiritual joy, just as
the other kinds, is claimed to be vanity, because we see it through a mirror
and in mystery. But when it has been
seen for what it is, then it is called vanity for no reason, but rather
truth. 

<b>2:2. <i>I said
of laughter, It is madness! And of joy, What does it accomplish?</i></b> Wherever we read <i>madness</i>
the Hebrew text has <i>molal</i>, which
Aquila took to be <i>planesin</i>, that is
'delusion'[^45],
Symmachus has <i>thorubon</i>, 'commotions'[^46]. But the Septuagint and Theodotion as in many
places, so too in this, also agree and translate it as <i>periphoran</i>, which we, expressing word for word, can call
'revolution'.[^47] Those men therefore, who are carried around
on the 'breeze' of all doctrines, are unstable and fluctuate between
interpretations. Thus those who guffaw
with that laugh, which the Lord says must be muted in holy weeping, are seized
by the delusion of time and its whirlwind, not understanding the disaster that
their sins will cause, nor bewailing their former faults, but thinking that
brief joys are going to be perpetual. 
Then they exult in these, which are more worthy of lamentation than joy. Heretics also believe this, who agree with
false doctrines and promise themselves happiness and prosperity.

<b>2:3. <i>I
thought to stimulate my body with wine while my heart is involved with wisdom,
and to grasp folly, until I can discern which is best for mankind to do under
the heavens during the brief span of their lives. </i></b> I wanted to
stimulate my life with enjoyment, and to lull my body, as if freed from all
worries by wine, in the same way with desire; but my deep consideration and
inborn reasoning, which God the creator mingled even into my sins, drew me away
from the idea and led me back to seek wisdom and to spurn foolishness, so that
I was able to see what was good, that men can do in the span of their
lives. But he has compared desire
eloquently with intoxication. Since he
intoxicates and destroys the vitality of his spirit, which he was able to
change into wisdom and obtains spiritual happiness, (as it is written in
certain manuscripts), he is able to discern which things ought to be sought out
in this life, and which avoided. 

<b>2:4. <i>I acted
in grand style: I built myself houses, I planted vineyards; </i></b>and others such until the point where he says: <b><i>The
wise man has his eyes in his head, whereas the fool walks in darkness. </i></b>Before I discuss each of these in
turn it seems useful to me to encompass all of them in a short paragraph, and
to reduce their meanings to just one explanation, so that it is easier to
understand what is being said. I had all
things that have been considered good through the ages. I built myself a palace on high, and covered
the hills and mountains with vines. And
lest anything be lacking from my excess I planted gardens and orchards of
different kinds of trees, which were watered from above by water stored in
pools, so that the growth was fed for longer periods with continual
moisture. I also had an uncountable
number of slaves, buyers and natives, and many flocks of animals, cows of
course, and sheep- no king before me in Jerusalem had such a number. I also amassed a huge number of treasure
houses of gold and of silver, which I obtained as gifts from various kings and
as tributes from conquered races. And
because of this it happened that I was prompted by having too much wealth to
even more pleasures, and they called to me in choirs of music, flutes, lyres
and in songs, and each sex served in entertainment. Those temptations grew in such quantity as I
was lacking in wisdom. For desire had
dragged me to each and every pleasure and I was being carried along unbridled
and headlong, and I thought that that was the fruit of my labours, if I myself
was consumed with lust and luxury. 
Having then at last returned to my senses, and as if waking from a deep
sleep, I looked at my hands and saw that my work was full of vanity, full of
squalor, and full of the character of my folly. 
For I found nothing to be good that was considered good in the
world. Considering therefore those
things which were good for wisdom and which were bad for foolishness I rushed
to praise any man, who then refrained from his sins and was able to pursue true
virtues. Certainly there is a great
diversity between wisdom and foolishness, and virtues are as much separated
from vices as day differs from night. It
seems to me then that he that follows that path of wisdom always lifts his eyes
to heaven and raises his face aloft, and considers those things which are above
his head; but he that gives in to foolishness and vices fumbles in the darkness
and flounders in his ignorance of the world.  <b><i>I acted in grand style: I built houses for myself, I planted
vineyards. </i></b> He, who is raised up equal to the face of God
in the heavens, makes his work great; and he builds houses so that the Father
and the Son will come, and will live in them. 
And he plants vineyards to which Jesus will tie up his ass.

<b>2:5. <i>I made
for myself gardens and orchards and planted in them every kind of fruit
tree. </i></b>In my treasure house are not only gold and silver
dishes but even some that are made from wood and pottery. And even the gardens therefore are made on
account of certain weaker and sick men, for anyone who is sick will eat
vegetables. Trees are planted, not all
of them fruit-bearing as we have in the Latin manuscripts, but of all fruits,
that is of varied fruits and fruit-trees, because the grace of the Church is also
varied. Thus one type of tree is the
eye, one the hand and another the foot, and on those things which are most
prized we bestow our greatest glory. And
amongst those fruit-trees I esteem the wood itself to be primal in life because
it is wisdom, for unless that is planted in their midst the other trees will
dry up.

<b>2:6. <i>I
constructed pools from which to irrigate a grove of young trees. </i></b>The wood in glades and in forests, which is not
fruit-bearing, are not nourished by rain from the sky, not by such rain waters
but by water which is collected in pools from rivers. Even low-lying Egypt is situated low in the
land like a vegetable patch, and is irrigated by waters, which come from
Ethiopia. But the Promised Land which is
mountainous and raised up waits for timely or late-coming rain from the sky.

<b>2:7. <i>I
bought slaves, male and female, and natives too; I also owned more possessions,
both cattle and sheep, than all of my predecessors in Jerusalem.</i></b>  If we want
Ecclesiastes, as we have said before, to refer to the person of Christ here
too, then we are able to say <i>his slaves</i>
who have the spirit of fear in servitude and desire more spiritual things in
life than they already have. But we can
also call the slave-girls <i>hearts[^48]</b></i>
that till now have been bestowed upon the body and upon the earth. They surpass also those natives, who are
certain of the Church, both slaves and slave-girls, about whom I have spoken. And the Lord has not yet bestowed upon them freedom
or noble-birth. But there are others in
the estate of Ecclesiastes like oxen and sheep, who are kept on account of work
and their innocence, and who work even in the church without reason and
knowledge of the Scriptures. But they
have not yet attained such an understanding, that they deserve to be men and
return to the appearance of their creator. If you look more diligently too, you
will notice that the number is not added in the case of slaves, slave-girls and
natives, but in the case of cows and sheep it is said: "I owned more
possessions of cattle and sheep". There is more silver in fact in the
Church than men: more sheep than slaves, slave-girls and natives. But that which is said at the end- "more
than all those who were before me in Jerusalem" does not pertain to the
glory of Solomon, or that he was richer than his father the King, since Saul
did not rule in Jerusalem, and the city was held by the Jebusites who had
themselves occupied the city at that time. 
Ecclesiastes however was richer at a younger age than were all men, who
had preceded him as kings in Jerusalem. 

<b>2:8. <i>I
amassed even silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and the
provinces; I provided myself with various singers and musical instruments, and
with every human luxury- chests and chests of them.</i></b>  Divine scripture
always places silver and gold above speech and meaning. The dove in the sixty-seventh Psalm
represents this too, which is interpreted as a spirit, and is more noticeable
because of its silver wings, so that it hides the underlying significance of
the pallor of gold. But he gathers the
treasures of kings and of the provinces or kingdoms into the Church of
believers. He refers to those kings
about whom the psalmist writes "the kings of the earth were there and the
chiefs gathered together"[^49]. And he refers to those kingdoms to which the
Saviour orders us to raise our eyes[^50],
since now they burn with fear. The
treasures of kings can be called both the doctrines of philosophers and also
secular knowledge[^51],
which Ecclesiastes understands well: he takes hold of the wise men in their
wisdom, and squanders the wisdom of the wise, and reproves the discretion of
the prudent. The choirboys and girls are
those who sing with vitality and with intelligence. A male singer sings like a man who is both
strong and spiritual about heavenly matters. 
But a girl flits about the matter, which the Greeks call <i>hulen</i>. 
Nor is she able to raise her voice loudly into the air. Therefore wherever a woman is mentioned in
the Scriptures and the weaker sex, we are to translate it according to an
understanding of the context. Pharaoh
does not want the male children to be allowed to live for example, but only the
females in this matter.[^52] And another point is that none of the saints
is said to have had a daughter[^53],
and it is only Salphaat, who died for his sins, that had all girls. Jacob is the father of one daughter amongst
the twelve patriarchs, but is endangered by her.[^54] The pleasures also of mankind over wisdom
must be understood, which have many fruits and desires like paradise. We are admonished against them, saying,
"take delight in the Lord and he will give you the request of your
heart"[^55],
and in another place, "you will drink them as the torrent of your
desire".[^56] (I had wanted to shun reference to the female
sex, and even now use the distinction of the male, because the Latin language
does not take readily to this.) Aquila
explains about the wine-pourers, male and female, in a manner very different to
the fashion written here. For Solomon is
not naming the sexes of man, clearly either male or female, but types of dish,
and he calls them <i>kulikion</i> and <i>kulikia</i>, which is written in Hebrew as <i>sadda </i>and <i>saddoth</i>. Then Symmachus, who
was not able to express the idea word for word, translates this in a similar
way: <i>types of table and equipment</i>. Therefore Solomon is believed to have had
either pitchers, wine goblets, or bowls arranged in chests, and which were
ornate with gold and with jewels. And he
drank from a <i>kulikio</i> in one, (that
is, a bowl) and from <i>kilikiois</i> in
other places, which are clearly smaller dishes; and the crowd of drinkers
received wine at the hands of his servants. 
Because we explain Ecclesiastes as being Christ, therefore wisdom,
having mingled her wine (as it says in Proverbs) calls out to those who wander
to come to her. [^57] Now we must see the body of the Lord as a
very great bowl, in which is not pure divinity as there is in heaven, but there
God is blended with humanity on account of us, and wisdom is then poured out by
the apostles to smaller <i>kulikia</i>,
small goblets and bowls held by believers throughout the world. 

<b>2:9. <i>Thus I
grew and surpassed any of my predecessors in Jerusalem; still, my wisdom stayed
with me.</i></b> It seems to me that Ecclesiastes, acting
grandly, agrees less with the Lord, unless by chance we adapt this to him:
"He [Jesus] increased in wisdom and age and grace"[^58]. And, "on account of which God took him
on high[^59]". He also says "those who were before me
in Jerusalem" and is referring to those who, before he arrived, steered
the congregation of holy men and the Church. 
If we explain the text in a spiritual way then Christ is richer than all
men; and he only perceives the Synagogue better in bodily form than the
Church. Therefore he wears a veil,
because it was placed over the face of Moses and he let us see his face in
daylight.[^60] More precisely "wisdom has stayed with
me", means even in respect to the temptations of the body wisdom stayed
with him. For he who receives a profit
from his wisdom will not keep wisdom long, but he who does not receive a gain,
nor grows through change, but always has plenty- he is able to say, "and
wisdom has stayed with me". 

<b>2:10. <i>Whatever
my eyes desired I did not deny them; I did not deprive myself of any joy. Indeed my heart drew joy from all my
activities, and this was my reward for all my endeavours. </i></b>The eyes of the heart and the sight of the mind desire
to gaze on spiritual matters, which the sinner does not see, so forbids his
heart from true happiness. Therefore
Ecclesiastes gave himself completely over to this cause and balanced eternal
glory lightly in an world of discord. 
This is our lot, and our continual reward if we work for our virtues.

<b>2:11. <i>Then I
looked at all things that I had done and the energy I had expended in doing
them. </i></b>He who does all things with diligence and wariness is
able to say this. <b><i>It was clear that it was all
futile and a vexation of the spirit, [and there is no profit under the sun.]</i></b> As if he considers that in comparison with
other things, all things are cheap which are under the sun, and are different
according to the variety of desires. <b><i>And
there is no profit under the sun</i></b>. 
Christ placed his tabernacle in the sun. 
So Christ will not be able to live, nor be plentiful in whoever has not
yet obtained the lucidity of the sun, its regularity and constancy. 

<b>2:12.<i> Then I turned my attention to
appraising wisdom with madness and folly - for what can man who comes after the
king do?</i></b> This seems to discuss heavenly matters until
the place where he says, "the eyes of a wise man are in his
head". I had summed up all things
in one explanation, intending to show the meaning briefly, and because of that,
again according to <i>anagoge[^61]</b>,</i>
I had only touched lightly on some things, but now I ought to explain in a
manner similar to that in which I began. 
For the meaning is quite different here from the interpretation found in
the Septuagint. But he says he had
returned to seeking wisdom after pleasures and those desires he had condemned,
in which he found more foolishness and stupidity than true and recognised
knowledge. For man, he said, is not able
to know so clearly and truly the wisdom of his creator and of his king, as his
creator knows it himself. And so he says
that those things that we know, we only think we have grasped and value more
than know what is true. 

<b>2:13. <i>And I
perceived that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness. </i></b>I am allowed, he says, to see through that very wisdom
of mankind, which is mixed with uncertainty. 
Nor is it possible, he adds, for it to flow into our minds so clearly as
it does into the king and our creator. I
know however that the difference between wisdom and folly is great even as much
as one can differentiate between day and night, between light and dark. 

<b>2:14. <i>The
wise man has his eyes in his head, whereas a fool walks in darkness. But I also realised that the same fate awaits
them all. </i></b>Whoever attains complete wisdom and has
deserved Christ to be his aim always raises his eyes to the heavens and will
therefore never think about terrestrial matters. When these things are considered in this way
and there is such a distinction between a wise man and a fool, one being
compared with day and the other with darkness, the former raises his eyes to
heaven, the latter looks on the ground. 
Suddenly this thought occurred to me, why both the wise man and the fool
are constrained by a common mortality - why the same wounds, the same fate, the
same death and equal troubles confine each one.

<b>2:15-16. <i>So I
said to myself: the fate of the fool will befall me also; to what advantage
then have I become wise? But I concluded
that this, too, was vanity. For there is
no comparison between the remembrance of the wise and of the fool at all, for
as the succeeding days roll by, is all forgotten? How can the wise man's death be like the
fool's? </i></b>I have stated that the wise man and the fool, the
righteous and wicked are destined to die by the same fate and all wicked things
in this world will suffer a similar fate; what profit is there for me then,
that I have sought wisdom and worked more than others? On reconsidering the matter and applying
myself to it diligently I saw that my opinion was unfounded. For the wise and foolish will not have
similar remembrance in the future when the end of the world comes; and they
will be confined for no reason by equal death because the wise man will
continue to the joys of heaven and the fool to his punishment. The Septuagint translates the meaning of the
Hebrew here more clearly, for it doesn't necessarily follow the Hebrew word
order: "and to what purpose have I become wise?" Then I said to myself copiously, (for the
fool is he, who speaks too much), 'for this is also vanity, because there is no
remembrance of the wise with the fool for ever, and so on.' Since he tried to convince us that his prior
thoughts were foolish, he bore witness that he had spoken foolishly, and that
he had erred, and it was by doing this that he realised his folly. 

<b>2:17. <i>So I
hated life, for I was depressed by all that goes on under the sun, because
everything is vain and a vexation of the spirit.</i></b> The world has been given over to unkindness[^62]
and the apostle moans about the tabernacle saying "I am a wretched man,
who will free me from the body of this death?"[^63],
and he hates quite rightly everything that is done under the sun. That is however only in comparison with
paradise and the beatitude of that life, in which we would enjoy the fruits of
wisdom and the pleasures of virtues. But
now as if we are in a prison camp or cell, and with a wall of tears, we eat our
bread in the sweat of our brow.

<b>2:18-19. <i>Thus I
hated all my achievements labouring under the sun, for I must leave it to the
man who succeeds me. And who knows
whether he will be wise or foolish? - And he will control all my possessions
which I toiled and have shown myself wise under the sun. This, too, is vanity. </i></b>He seems to be reconsidering wealth and riches, because
according to the Gospel, being snatched by sudden death, we do not know with
which kind of heir we die - whether he will be a fool or wise who will enjoy
the fruits of our toil. This was also
the case with Solomon: for he did not regard his son Roboam as similar to himself. We learn from this that a son is not worthy
of his father's heredity if he is foolish. 
But to me studying the work it seems that he is speaking more about
spiritual labour, because a wise man will work on the Scriptures for days and
nights, and will compose books and will hand down his memory to his
descendants, and nonetheless all this will come into the hands of fools, who
repeatedly find in them the seeds of heresy, according to the perversity of
their own mind, and waste other men's efforts. 
For if the text now refers to Ecclesiastes' personal wealth, it was
necessary to say about toil and wealth: "and he will control all my
possessions which I toiled and have shown myself wise under the sun." For what is wise in the pursuit of earthly
riches? 

<b>2:20-23. <i>So I
turned my heart to despair of all that I had achieved by toiling under the
sun. For there is a man who laboured
with wisdom, knowledge and skill, yet he must hand on his portion to one who
has not toiled for it. This too is
vanity and a great evil. For what has a
man in return for all his toil and his stress, which he toils beneath the
sun? For all his days are painful, and
his business is a vexation; even at night his mind has no rest. This, too, is vanity!</i></b> Previously he has spoken about the uncertainty of an
heir and not knowing whether he will be foolish or wise, the master of the
works of another. But even now he seeks
the same things but this time the meaning is different, because he might leave
his wealth and labours perhaps to his son, to a neighbour, or someone he knows. Nevertheless it happens time and time again
that one man enjoys in the work of another, and <i>sweet toil is to the dead while pleasures are for the living.</i> He thinks of himself as every single one and
he will see with how much toil he composes his books, how "often he turns
his pen, again he will write those things which are worthy of law"[^64],
and for the man who does not work he will give him his own share. For what good to the wealth of the earth, as
I have said clearly, are wisdom, knowledge and virtue, in which he said he had
laboured? For although he may be
virtuous, wise and knowledgeable he spurns worldly things. 

<b>2:24-26. <i>Is it
not good for man that he eats and drinks and shows his soul satisfaction in his
labour? And even that, I perceived, is
from the hand of God. For who should eat
and who should make haste except me? To
the man who pleases Him He has given wisdom, knowledge and joy; but to the
sinner He has given the urge to gather and amass - that he may hand it on to
one who is pleasing to God. That, too,
is vanity and a vexation of the spirit.</i></b> After I examined all things and saw that
nothing was more unjust than one man enjoying the work of another, then this
work seemed to me to be the most righteous, and like a gift of God, seeing that
a man may enjoy his own labour, drinking and eating, and for a time refraining
from amassed wealth. And sometimes it is a gift of God, that such a mind as is
bestowed upon righteous men, that they squander those things, which they have
sought with great attention and vigilance. 
In fact on the other hand, it is the character of the anger of God,
which is set against the sinner, so he amasses wealth day and night and uses if
for no purpose, then he bequeaths it to those men who are righteous in the sight
of God. But, he says, looking at this
more closely and noticing that all things come to a common end with death, I
have judged it to be the most vain of all. 
These readings are very close to the text though, so that I do not seem
to completely miss the plain meaning of the words, and while I follow spiritual
riches, disdain the poverty of history. 
For what is good then, or what kind of gift of God is it, either to
covet his wealth and like a man in flight gather desire prematurely, or to turn
someone else's work to ones own pleasures, and then to think that this is a
gift of God, if we take pleasure in others' discomfort and toil? It is good though, to take our own food and
drink, which we have found by divine will, from the flesh and blood of a Lamb. For who is either able to eat or when there
is need to spare in the absence of God? 
He warned that sacred food must not be given to the dogs[^65],
and he teaches how rations ought on occasion to be given to slaves[^66],
and similar to another meaning, that is we ought to eat only honey that has
been found, and only as much as is needed. 
But God gives wisdom and knowledge and happiness to the man who is good.[^67] For unless he was good and corrected his ways
beforehand by his own judgement, he will not be worthy of that wisdom,
knowledge and happiness, according to that which is said in another place:
"Plant for yourselves in justice, make a vintage of the fruit of life,
enlighten for yourselves the light of knowledge."[^68] In fact, righteousness ought to be planted
first, and the fruit of life must be reaped, only then, afterwards the light of
knowledge will be able to appear. 
Therefore just as God gave the good man wisdom and other gifts, in the
same way he has forsaken the sinner according to his own judgement, and made
him amass riches and contrive false doctrines therefrom. When a saintly man who is pleasing to God
sees these things, he understands them, since they are vain and composed of the
conceit of the spirit. Nor should we
admire what he has said: "he gave vexation to the sinner" and so
on. For this must be seen in concordance
with that meaning which I have often explained: that for this reason anxiety or
vexation has been given to him, since he was a sinner, and the cause of
vexation was not in God, but in himself, who had sinned previously by his own
volition. 

<h2>CHAPTER 3</h2>
 

<b>3:1. <i>Everything
has its season, and there is a time for everything under the heavens. </i></b>He has taught in the previous verses the doubtful and
changeable state of humanity; now he wants to show that all things are opposed
to each other in the world, and that nothing remains forever of those things,
which are under the heavens and beyond time, since the other spiritual
substances are contained neither in the heavens nor in time.

<b>3:2.  <i>A time
to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to uproot that which
has been planted.</i></b> No one doubts that men are born and die, and
God knows that what he has planted will grow full and well; for to pull out
what has been planted is to die. But
since we read in Isaiah[^69]
"we have conceived, laboured with and given birth out of a fear for
You", this must be said, because when a man is ready, that man in
particular, who was born from fear, will die as soon as he has begun to love
God. Since indeed "perfect love
sends fear outside"[^70]. The Hebrews understand all that he has
written about the contradiction of times, (until it says " a time for war
and a time for peace") as concerning Israel. Because it is not necessary to go through
each verse in turn here, commenting on how they are to be interpreted and what
they mean, I will list them briefly, leaving a more detailed study to the
reader's discretion. There was a time for growing and planting in Israel, a
time for dying and leading it into bondage. A time for killing them in Egypt,
and a time for freeing them from Egypt. A time for destroying the Temple under
Nebuchadnezer, and a time for rebuilding under Darius. A time for bewailing the plundering of the
city and a time for laughing and dancing under Zorobabel, Esdra, and
Nehemiah. A time for dissemination from
Israel and a time for gathering them together again. A time like a belt or harness put around the
Jews by God, and a time for leading them into bondage in Babylon and there for
them to rot across the Euphrates. Read <i>perizoma</i> of Jeremiah[^71]. A time for seeking them out and rescuing, a
time for losing and a time for forsaking. 
A time for schism in Israel and a time for reunification. A time for hushing the prophets, now when in
Roman bondage and a time for proclaiming them aloud, when even in enemy lands
they weren't lacking in God's presence or comfort. A time for loving, in which He loved those
men before our fathers, a time for hating, since they threw their hands up
against Christ. A time for war, only not
for those who are doing repentance for themselves and a time for peace in the
future, when all the tribes return, and all Israel will be safe. 

<b>3:3. <i>A time
for killing and a time for healing.</i></b> It is both the time for killing and the time
for healing, he says: "I will kill, and I will revive"[^72]. He cures, provoking one to repentance. 'I killed' has the same meaning as "in
the morning I murdered all the sinners of the Earth."[^73] <b><i>A time for destroying and a time for
building. </i></b>We are not able to
build anything good unless we have first destroyed what is bad. Just as the word of Jeremiah came from God so
that he first rooted out, undermined and killed; then he built and planted.[^74]

<b>3:4. <i>A time
for weeping and a time for laughter.</i></b> Now is the time for weeping and in the
future it will be the time for laughter: for "the blessed weep, since they
themselves will laugh."[^75] <b><i>A time for bewailing and a time for
dancing. </i></b>For this reason they
are seized in the Gospel, those to whom God says " I have lamented for you
and you have not moaned; I sang and you did not dance."[^76] We must moan at present so that afterwards we
can dance that dance, which David danced before the arc of the covenant[^77],
and displeasing to the daughter of Saul he was more pleasing to God. 

<b>3:5. <i>A time
for dispersing stones and a time for collecting stones.</i></b> I marvel how an learned man could have said this
ridiculous note about this passage: "this passage speaks about the
destruction and killing of Solomon's houses, because men first destroy, then
build". Some amass stones to
construct buildings, others destroy those buildings which have been erected,
according to Horace's lines "he demolished, he builds, exchanges squares with
wheels, he fluctuates and disagrees with the whole order of life itself." [^78] Whether he is correct in saying this or not I
leave up to the reader to decide. 
Nonetheless we should follow the sequence of the prior explanation-they
say it is a time for scattering and collecting stones, similar to what is
written in the Gospel: "God is powerful enough to raise up the sons of
Abraham from these stones".[^79] For there was a time for dispersing the
nation and a time for gathering them again into the Church. I have read in a certain book, (like the
Septuagint however, which says "there was a time for throwing stones and a
time for collecting them") that the harshness of the ancient law of the
Gospel was tempered by grace. In fact
the stern law, unkind and unforgiving, murders the sinner, he pities with the
grace of the Gospel and provokes men to repentance. And there is a time for throwing stones, or
collecting them, because stones are thrown in law and are collected in the
Gospel. Whether this is true fact or not
is credited to the author.  <b><i>A time for embracing and a time for being far from
embrace. </i></b>The meaning of this is seemingly the
simplest understanding- the apostle agrees with the same words: "do not
cheat each other, unless by chance it is agreed for a time that you give
yourselves to fasting and to prayer."[^80] Attention must be given to children, and
again to self-control. Or perhaps it was
the time for embrace when the opinion was flourishing that we ought to
"grow and multiply, and fill up the Earth"[^81]. And the time became far from one of embracing
when it passed away: "the times are hard; it remains that both they that
have wives be as though they had none".[^82] But if we wanted to climb to the higher
parts, we would see wisdom embracing its lovers: for he says "honour it
and it will embrace you"[^83],
and hold them in its arms and lap in a tighter embrace. More precisely, it is not always possible to
stretch the human mind to heaven and think about the divine and higher things,
or continually consider celestial matters, but meanwhile to indulge in the necessities
of the flesh. On account of this there
is a time for embracing wisdom, and holding it more tightly, and a time for
relaxing the mind from the study and embrace of wisdom, just as of the care of
the body, and we have those things that our life needs in the absence of
sin. 

<b>3:6-7. <i>A time
to acquire and a time to lose. A time to
keep and a time to throw away. </i></b>As is in many verses before the meaning is
the same here too, which is apparent before and following this verse, in that
he says: <b><i>A time to destroy and a time to build. 
</i></b> And then <b><i>A
time to rend and a time to mend. </i></b>Just
as the Synagogue is destroyed so that the Church can be built and schism is
only brought about by the law so that the Gospels are unified, because each
preacher has carried it out one by one, unifying from the law and the prophets
the testimonies of the arrival of the Lord. 
And thus there was a time for seeking and guarding Israel, a time for
losing and discarding it. Or perhaps in
fact a time for seeking a nation in the tribes and a time for losing the people
of the Jews. A time for guarding the
believers of the nations and a time for dismissing the faithless from
Israel. <b><i>A time for silence and a time for
speaking. </i></b>I think that the
Pythagoreans, whose discipline is to remain silent for five years and
afterwards to speak to learned men, took the origin of their decree from
this. Let us learn therefore and so
remain silent first, so that afterwards we open our mouths only to speak. Let us be silent for a set period and depend
on the utterances of our teacher. 
Nothing seems right to us unless we learn that after much silence we are
made into teachers by our pupils. Now
though instead of the world slipping day by day into a far worse situation, we
teach in churches what we do not know. 
And if by composing words or at the bidding of the devil, who is the
patron of madness, we have aroused the applause of the common people, then we
think we understand, (contrary to our conscience), what it is we were able to
dissuade others from. We do not learn all the arts without a teacher, only
those which are so common and easy that they don't require a tutor. 

<b>3:8. <i>A time
for loving and a time for hating.</i></b> The time for loving God, children, wife, and
relatives is afterwards, and the time for hating those in martyrdom since
hostile piety attacks those steadfast men for the sake of the confession of
Christ. Or maybe there is a time for
loving the law, and those things that the law decrees- that is circumcision,
sacrifices, the Sabbath, Neumania[^84],
and a time for hating them when the grace of the Gospel has been lost. But we cannot say this, since now we look
through the mirror in mystery, the time for loving is the present, and in the
future there will come a time when we will see face to face and then, more
accomplished, we will begin to hate and despise what we love.[^85] <b><i>A time for war and a time for peace. </i></b>Although we are in the present world,
it is the time for war: when we have left this world the time for peace will
come. For the place of God is in peace
and so too is our city of Jerusalem, for it is called 'chosen in peace'. Therefore no one now thinks he is safe: you
must prepare yourselves in the time of war and put on the apostles arms, so
that we may rest in peace at last victorious.

<b>3:9-11. <i>What
gain, then, has the worker in exchange for all his toil? I have observed the task which God has given
the sons of man to be concerned with: He made everything beautiful in its time;
He has also put an enigma into their minds so that man cannot comprehend what
God has done from the beginning to end.</i></b>  The
opinion of many other scholars on this passage does not escape me, because in
this world God conceded to the teachers of perverse doctrines their true
occupation, lest man's idle mind should become slow and while thinking that
God's creations are good, yet nonetheless not be able to see them as the
natural knowledge of the world. But the
Hebrew who taught me the Scriptures explained it in this way: when all things
are placed in their own time and there is a time for destroying or building,
weeping and laughing, silence and speaking, and others things which are said
about time, why do we try to survive in vain and believe the labours of this
short life to be perpetual? And
according to the Gospel we are not even happy, and it is called wickedness
since we think nothing of tomorrow.[^86] For what more are we able to have in this
world than continual striving in that toil, which God has given to man, so that
one man may gain more by following others, in a situation where he is able to
learn and exercise himself? For all that
God does is good, but good in his world. 
It is good to wake and to sleep, but it is not good to be always awake
or asleep, since in turn each and every thing can be considered good, when
there is need, according to God's plan. 
Moreover God also created the world to be inhabited by men, so that they
should enjoy the variation of time, and not seek the causes nature, how all
things are made, why He made this or that grow or change from the beginning of
the world until now.

<b>3:12-13. <i>Thus I
perceived that there is nothing good for each of them than to rejoice and do
what is good in his life. Indeed every
man who eats and drinks and finds satisfaction in all his labour- it is a gift
from God.</i></b>  Therefore the settler and the foreigner of the
world has been charged that he should enjoy the time of his short life, and
when the hope of a longer life has been removed, he sees everything that he has
as if he is about leave this life, and he sees also what he can do well in his
life. And his thoughts are not in vain
thus twisted, on account of his amassed wealth. 
And he doesn't think that he is able to acquire more from his toil than
his food and drink and if he expends anything from his wealth into good work,
then only this is a gift of God. We are
not provoked, as some scholars think, by such words into luxury, pleasures, and
desperation as are animals, according to that phrase of Isaiah: "let us
gorge ourselves and drink, for tomorrow we will die."[^87] But according to the apostle: "having
sustenance and clothing, we are content with these."[^88] And whatever we have that is more than this,
we use in feeding the poor and our need for charity. More to the point, since the true food is the
flesh of the Lord, and his blood is the true drink, according to <i>anagoge[^89]</b></i>,
we only regard this as good in the present world, if we actually do feed from
his flesh and drink from his blood, not only in secret but even in reading the
Scriptures. For true food and drink,
which is taken from the word of God, is knowledge of the Scriptures. But no one believes the word of Balaam of the
prophets, who says "there will be no toil against Jacob, no suffering in Israel"[^90]. It is in fact contrary to this, because it is
said to be a gift of God: "If anyone eats and drinks and shows he is good
in all of his work"[^91]. In fact these are the many troubles of the
righteous. And the apostle complains
about these, saying he has sweated in toil and suffering. But the Lord freed us for our future in toil
and suffering also: "there will be
no toil against Jacob, no suffering in Israel". And we read how " the blessed weep,
since they will laugh"[^92],
and our laughter follows the words of Job the prophet: for the "mouth will
be filled with the joy of truths"[^93]. Thus now we enjoy our toil in good work, by
which we restrict and restrain ourselves so that afterwards we may cease from
working.

<b>3:14. <i>I
realised that whatever God does will endure forever: nothing can be added to it
and nothing taken away, and God has acted so that man should fear Him. </i></b>There is nothing in the world that is
new. The course of the sun and moon in
turn and the dryness and verdure of the earth and trees are born and take shape
with the world itself. And therefore God
governed all things by a defined plan and commanded the elements to be at the
disposal of man, for his use, so that when men see these things they know that
there is providence and fear the appearance of God; while from the equality of
the world, the natural season, order, and constancy they understand their
creator. "For his invisible work in
the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things
which are made, even his eternal virtue and power"[^94]. If we want we can read this as if from the
beginning, with the meaning of the first part already understood: "and God
has acted so that man should fear Him" then this is the meaning: God made
all these things, so that men fear him, and reject for another what God once
created for man. But he governed
perfectly, saying: "so that they should fear his appearance".[^95] The image of the Lord, indeed, is powerful
over those who are wicked. 

<b>3:15. <i>What
has been, already exists, and what is still to be, has already been, and God
seeks him that suffers persecution.</i></b> All things we perceive in the past, present
or future, they themselves have been, are, and will be. That same sun which now rises, existed before
we were in this world, and after we die, it will rise again. But we have mentioned the sun, so that we
understand other things to be the same as they have been before. Because if they are seen to die by what we
call death, they do not really die, but grow again given a second life, and
nothing dies forever but is reborn and relives as if with a certain new
seed. For this is what he says:
"and God seeks him that suffers persecution", which is said better in
Greek <i>kai ho theos zetesei to diokomenon </i>that
is what dies, what has perished, and has ceased to be. But if that speaks about all that are in the
world there is no doubt about man, that having died he will be reborn. But if anyone likes to choose a beginning as
if his own, "and God seeks him that suffers persecution", he uses
this evidence in the persecution of certain people: to comfort him, who had
persevered in martyrdom. And since all
in this world, who want to live religiously, follow the apostle, they suffer
persecution and take consolation in the fact that God seeks him that suffers
persecution, just as he seeks out the blood of a man who has been murdered, and
comes to seek what has perished, and carry the wandering sheep back to the
flock on his shoulders.[^96]

<b>3:16-17. <i>Furthermore,
I have observed beneath the sun: in the place of justice there is wickedness,
and in the place of righteousness there is wickedness. I mused: God will judge the righteous and the
wicked, for there is a time for everything and for every deed, there.</i></b> The
meaning of this is clear but is cloaked by the cloud of interpretation. He says: I sought truth and righteousness
under the sun and I saw that even among the benches of judges truth is not
valued, but gifts. Or differently: I
thought some kind of justice present in this world and either took the pious
man on his own merit, or punished the impious for his crimes; and I found the
opposite to that which I had been thinking. 
For I saw a righteous man here suffer much injustice and an impious man
made to rule instead of being punished for his crime. But thinking to myself afterwards and
considering it carefully I understood that they judge not in respect of God and
treating each case one by one, but rather reserve judgement for the future, so
that all are judged equally and receive there according to their will and
effort. For this is what he says:
"and there is a time for everything and for every deed, there", that
is, in judgement when God will have begun to judge, then there will be truth,
now injustice prevails in the world. 
Such as when we read in Wisdom, Sirach wrote: "lest you say, what
is this or what is that? For all things are sought in their own time"[^97].

<b>3:18-21. <i>Then I
said to myself concerning men: God has chosen them out, but only to see that
they themselves are as beasts. For the
fate of men and the fate of beast - they have one and the same fate: as one
dies so the other dies, and they all have the same spirit. Man has no superiority over beast, for all is
futile. All go to the same place; all
originate from dust and return to dust. 
Who perceives that the spirit of man is the one that ascends on high
while the spirit of the beast is the one that descends down into the
earth?</i></b> It is not surprising that there is no distinction in
this life between righteous and wicked, nor that none values virtues, but all
things occur with uncertain outcome, where nothing seems to differ according to
the worthlessness of the body between sheep and men: there is the same birth,
common end in death; we proceed similarly towards the light and are equally
dissolved into the dust. But there seems
to be this difference, that the spirit of man ascends to the heavens, and the
spirit of animals goes down into the earth, but from where do we know this for
certain? Who can know whether what is
hoped is true or false? But he says
this, not because he thinks the spirit dies with the body, or that there's one
place set aside for beasts and for man, but because before the arrival of
Christ all were led equally to the nether regions. Jacob said that he was about to go down to
those regions.[^98] And Job complains that the pious and impious
are held back in the lower world.[^99] And the Gospel says that with an abyss
blocking the way even Abraham and Lazarus were rich in prayers in the underworld.[^100] And in fact before Christ accompanied by a
robber opened the wheel of flames, and the fiery rumpias[^101]
and the gates of paradise, the heavens were closed and the equal unworthiness
of the spirits of sheep and of men was abridged. One also seems to be dispersed and the other
saved; but there is not much of a difference between dying with the body or
being held in the darkness of the underworld. 
Let us look over these things one by one in paragraphs, and discuss them
briefly. I considered the eloquence of
the sons of man, whom God chose. Only
this eloquence, he says, God wanted to be between men and beasts, since we
speak, they are mute; we possess the will for conversation, they are stupefied
with silence. And though we only differ
from beasts in language, though it is shown to us, how we are like the beasts -
weak in body. Just as a beast dies, thus
man dies, and one breath is for all, and that is the air that we breathe. For he says this: "and one spirit is for
both, and there is nothing more for man than for beast." Since lest we think the text refers to the
soul he adds: "all are made from earth and return to the earth." But nothing else except the body is made from
earth, and quite relevant, regarding the body he continues: "you are earth
and to the earth you will return."[^102] But this seems to be blasphemy: for who knows
if the spirit of the sons of man ascends upwards, or if the spirit of beasts
goes downwards into the earth? He does
not contend that there is no difference between animals and men in reference to
the dignity of the soul, but in adding "who?" he wants to show the
difficulty of the matter. For the
pronoun "who" is used in the Holy Scriptures not on account of impossibility,
but a difficulty. So here it is said in
that passage, "who will describe that man's generation?"[^103],
and in the psalm: "Lord, who ascends in your tabernacle, and onto your
sacred mountain?"[^104],
and other examples that follow this pattern. 
And in Jeremiah it can be said differently in Hebrew: "And he is a
man, and who knows him?"[^105]. This then, is the only difference between
beast and men, that the spirit of man ascends to the heaven, and the spirit of
the beast descends into the earth and is dispersed with the flesh; but let any
man, who is of the Church and learned in the religious disciplines, be the real
champion of the matter, which is rather doubtful. Then he adds just how much it refers to a
spiritual understanding: "since the Lord will keep both men and beasts
safe"[^106],
and in another place he says, "beasts, I am among you"[^107],
and all the prophets say that both men and beasts will be saved in Jerusalem,
and that the promised land will be filled with sheep and cattle. Who knows whether the saintly man, who is
worthy of the name of man, will ascend to heaven, and whether the sinner, who
is called beast, will go down into the earth? 
For it is possible in light of the uncertain and dangerous condition of
his life, that the righteous man falls and the sinner rises, and it sometimes
happens that man, having more reason and learned in the Scriptures, does not
look about himself, and although worthy of his knowledge lives out his life and
is led down to the nether world; and the simpler and unlearned man, who is said
to be compared to the beasts of men, lives better and is crowned in martyrdom,
and he is then to live in paradise.

<b>3:22. <i>I
therefore observed that there is nothing better for man than to be happy in
what he is doing, for that is his lot. 
For who can enable him to see what will be after him? </i></b> Instead of that
which we have as "to see what will be after him", Symmachus
interprets it more clearly saying, "so that he sees those things which
will be after these ones". 
Therefore nothing is good in life, unless a man is happy in his work,
doing acts of sympathy<u>, and obtaining his future reward in the realm of
heaven. We have this one lot, which nor
neither thief nor robber values, nor any tyrant has the power to take away, and
which follows us after our death. And we
will not be able to enjoy our toil again when this life will be over, or know
what things will be afterwards in the world. 
Another explanation of this is: I am disturbed by the wickedness of what
I have said above, that I think there is no difference between men and beasts,
and I have been led into this opinion by wrong conclusions, so that I said
nothing else was good, except grasping ones present desire. Nor when death has destroyed us is it
possible to enjoy these things, which we, ungrateful, leave behind. Some have referred to that understanding
because it says, "for who leads him, so that he sees those things, which
will be after him", so that they say, "it is better for a man to
enjoy his work" because it is only this that he is able to take away with
him from his possessions. For when death
comes he will not know what kind of heir he will die with, whether worthy or
unworthy, who will enjoy his wealth.


<h2>CHAPTER 4</h2>

<b>4:1. <i>And I
returned and contemplated all the acts of oppression that are committed beneath
the sun: Behold! Tears of the oppressed with none to comfort them, and their
oppressors have the power - with none to comfort them. </i></b>After considering this I turned my eyes and attention
to this, so that I saw the slanderers and those sustaining chicanery. And look on those who, oppressed unjustly by
more powerful men, are not able to find a comforter for their tears. For this is only permitted in disasters and
in protest at the ill will of the matter. 
And wherever there is more distress and inconsolable suffering they see
the slanderers as stronger in their difficulties. And this is the cause: because they are not
worthy of consolation. He describes this
idea more fully in the seventy-second psalm of David, and Jeremiah in his own
book.

<b>4:2-3. <i>So I
consider more fortunate the dead, who have already died, than the living, who
are still alive. But better than either
of them is he who has not yet been, and has never witnessed the evil that is
committed under the sun.</i></b> In comparison with the difficulties, which
trouble mortal men in this world, I had judged the dead to be happier than the
living according to that which Job says in his argument regarding the dead:
" there they rested with tired bodies, with those who had been in chains,
now without cares, not hearing the voice of the expeller."[^108] But it is better for these two, for the
living it seems and for the deceased, who has not yet been born. For one man will suffer ill, another
unclothed will escape it as if from a shipwreck. Moreover he who has not yet been born is
happier in that, becausehe has not
yet experienced the ill of the world. 
But he says this, not because he who has not yet been born, exists
before he has been born, and he is happier in this, since he has not yet been
weighed down by his body; but better to be sure is not existing, or not having
a sense of wealth, than either being unhappy or living unhappily. Just as the Lord speaks to Judas, referring
to his coming anguish: "it was better for that man never to have been
born"[^109],
since it would have been better for sure for him not to have existed, than to
suffer eternal torture. Some people in
fact understand this passage in this way: they say they are better, who have
died, than those who are living, it is permitted to them before they were
sinners[^110]. For until now the living were in battle and
were held back as if closed in by the prison of the body; but those who have
opposed death are already without cares and have stopped sinning. Just like John, in which he was not greater
in respect to the sons of women, he is less than him, who is the lowest in the
realm of heaven and is freed from the burden of the body. He does not know how to say like the apostle:
"I am a wretched man, who will free me from the body of this death?"[^111]. But he says he is better than those two, who
has not yet been born, nor does not see the wickedness, by which men are
oppressed in the world. For our souls mingle among the gods, before descending
to these bodies and are blessed so long as the heavenly ones are held in
Jerusalem and in the choir of angels.

<b>4:4. <i>And I
saw that all labour and skilful enterprise spring from man's rivalry with his
neighbour. This, too, is futility and a
vexation of the spirit! </i> </b>I turned my attention once again to other
things and I saw the strength and honour of those men who were toiling, and I
discovered the good of one man to be the evil of another, while the envious one
is tortured by another's happiness, and the boastful lies open to
trickery. For what is more vain, what is
for nothing like the spirit in this way, than for man to weep for misfortunes
that are not his own, or to bemoan his own sins, or be envious of better
men. 

<b>4:5. <i>The fool
folds his hands and eats his own flesh.</i></b> This is the man that is described as slow to
comprehend in Proverbs[^112],
holding his chest in his hands. For
poverty, although he is a fast runner, catches up with him and he eats his own
flesh because of the extent of his hunger, but this is said in
exaggeration. He is the sort of man who
thinks that having one fist of corn and living idly and in a stupor is better
than filling each hand by working. But
he sows everything so that he can show that he that both works and acquires
possessions leaves himself open in the world to envy. Conversely he that desires to live a simple
life is oppressed by poverty and because of this both of these two is poor:
while the one runs a risk on account of his wealth, the other is consumed by
want because of his poverty. Or indeed
perhaps it is to be understood in this way: he who envies the happiness of
another man is seized as if by the fury of the spirit, and takes envy into his
lap, and nourishes it in his heart: thus it is he eats his soul and his
flesh. For as much as he sees that man
whom he envies as happier, he himself more so wastes away and perishes, and
little by little becomes more full of envy and jealousy. Another way of reading this is: his hands are
taken on many occasions to lead him to work, just as the passage which states,
"the act of the Lord which is done in the hand of Haggai"[^113],
or of Ecclesiastes, or of his prophet, because he has done such work, that he
appears to be worthy, in whose work is the speech of the Lord. And the man, who corresponds to this man is
David, "who leads my hands in battle"[^114]. Therefore the fool embraces his hands, that
is he draws them together and doesn't want to open them, and so does not eat
the toil of his hands, which he does not have, but his flesh, living by the
wisdom of his flesh and eating the toil of his flesh. 

<b>4:6. <i>Better
is one handful of pleasantness than two fistfuls of labour and vexation of the
spirit.</i></b> It is better to have modest power, than great riches of
sins. And in Proverbs it says, "To
receive a little through righteousness is better than gaining much by
injustice."[^115] Justice rightly has rest, injustice
toil. And since a single number is
always seen in a good context and a dual seen as wickedness, therefore one fist
has rest, and two hands are full of toil. 


<b>4:7-8. <i>Then I
returned and contemplated futility beneath the sun: a lone and solitary man who
has neither son nor brother, yet there is no end to his toil, nor is his eye
ever sated with riches, nor does he ask himself, 'For whom am I toiling and
depriving myself of goodness.' This too
is futility, indeed, it is a sorry task.</i></b> I turned to
other people and I saw that they work more than is necessary and amass wealth
by good and bad means and do not use it once accumulated; they have all things,
brood over their riches, keep it for another, and do not enjoy their work. Then at the end of their life they have
neither son nor brother, nor close friend so that the pious work seems reserved
for necessities only. And so I
discovered nothing more vain than that man, who collects riches, or to whom an
ignorant man bequeaths them. We are even
able to understand this in a religious interpretation, and understand it as
those, who write books and leave them to fastidious readers. Some say that this passage from where it says
"there is one, but there is not a second" is about the Saviour,
because he came down to save the world alone and without any companion. And although there are many sons of God, they
are called his brothers by adoption, though not one remains worthy, who should
be joined to him in this work. There is
no end to this work, for those carrying our faults and sins and suffering for
us; and his eye will not be filled by riches, but always with those desiring
our safety, and the more you see his sins, the more he encourages him to
repent.

<b>4:9-12. <i>Two are
better than one, for they get a greater return for their labour. For should they fall, one can raise the
other; but woe to him who is alone when he falls and there is no one to raise
him! Also, if two sleep together they keep warm, but how can one be warm
alone? Where one can be overpowered, two
can resist attack; A three-ply cord is not easily severed!</i></b> 
After the misfortunes of loneliness in which he has been seized, and he
who torments himself in acquiring wealth without a definite heir, now the
subject of companionship is treated. And
it asks what good ther is in a tent of friends and what comfort there is in
company, since one man's distress or domestic strife is lifted by another's
help, (any man who has a faithful friend will sleep better all that night, than
he who sleeps only with his wealth which he has amassed. And if a stronger enemy rises up against one
man, the weakness of one is sustained by the comfort of friends. And just as two differ from one if they are
joined in love, so the tent of three is stronger. For even true charity, which has been
violated by no envy increases as much in number as it grows in strength. And this idea is conveyed in relatively few
words. But since previously we have
placed the discussion of the intelligence of certain men before Christ, those
things which are still left must be discussed by the same order. It is better for two to be equal, than
one. For it is better for a man who
lives alone to have Christ, than alone to leave himself vulnerable to
ill-intentioned plots. Since the reward
of the tent is shown at once in the very usefulness of society. For if one man fell, Christ would raise up
his partner. Woe indeed to him who
collapses, he will not have Christ rising up in him. For if one sleeps, that is, if he had been
dissolved by death and had Christ with him, he will revive more quickly having
been made warm and given life once again. 
And if the devil, being stronger in his attack, should attack a man, the
man will stand, and Christ will stand in place of this man, in place of his
companion. Not because virtue is weak
(the virtue of Christ alone) against the devil, but because the decision of man
is left free and for us, who are dependent, but virtue itself will become
stronger through fighting. And even if
the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit should come, that friendship is
not broken easily. But although it is
not broken easily, it will be broken nonetheless at some point. And the cord from the apostle to Judas was
threefold: but after the breaking of the bread Satan entered him and that cord
was broken. More precisely what he says
above is, "and even if two are sleeping, then they will be warm: and how
will one keep warm on his own?" We
can take an example from Elisha, because he is in a pact with a lad, and slept
with him and warmed his body, and in this way revived the recovering boy.[^116] Unless therefore Christ sleeps with us and rests
in death, we are not able to receive the heart of eternal life. 

<b>4:13-16. <i>Better
is a poor but wise youth, than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how
to take care of himself; because from the prison-house he emerged to reign,
while even in his reign he was born poor. 
I saw all the living that wander beneath the sun throng to the
succeeding youth that steps into his place. 
There is no end to the entire nation, to all that was before them;
similarly the ones that come later will not rejoice in him. For this too is futility and a vexation of
the spirit.</i></b>  Symmachus translates this passage in this
way: "better a poor man who has wisdom, than an old and foolish king who
does not know to beware of change". 
For the one leaves the body to reign in heaven, and the other indeed,
although he had been born a king, is restricted by poverty. I saw all men living, who grow up under the
sun in propitious adolescence, which increases in them. Each and every nation that was before is
unending, and those that come after do not rejoice in the previous. But this too is empty and a vexation of the
spirit. My Hebrew tutor, whose teachings
I often refer to, bore witness while he was reading Ecclesiastes with me, that
Bar Akiba wrote these things above the present passage, and he is greatly
admired by other scholars: better is the inner part of man, which arises in us
after the fourteenth year of puberty, than the outer, physical man, who is born
from his mother's womb, and he does not know how to abstain from vice because
it comes to this that he rules over his vices from the house of chains, that is
from his mother's womb. For he is made
poor because of his power and by carrying out all wicked deeds. I saw those men, who lived as those former
men, and were changed afterwards into that second man, in him that has been
born in place of the former. And I
understood that all men sinned in that prior manhood, before the second is
born, when they become two men. But once
these men have changed for the better, and after the learning of philosophers,
they leave the left path and hurry towards the right, and they follow the
second man, that is the newest man, and do not rejoice in him that is the
former. The apostle agrees with these
two types of men[^117]
and Leviticus also mentioned them: "Man, man"[^118]
who desired this or that. That saintly
man Gregorius Pontus the bishop, to whom Origen preached, understands the
passage in the following way in his<i>
Metaphrasis of Ecclesiastes:</i> "I however prefer a youth who is poor yet
is growing wise, to an old king who is foolish, to whom it never occurs that it
is possible for someone from those whom he has conquered, will leave the body
to reign in heaven; and then he destroys himself from his unjust power. For it happens though that those who were
growing wise at the time of youth are without sadness; but that they changed
before the time of becoming an old king. 
For those that have been born afterwards, since they do not know the
wickedness that has gone before, they are not able to praise youth, which
arises afterwards, and are led astray by perverse ideas and by the force of the
opposing arguments."[^119] Laodicenus has asserted that great matters
are expressed in this short passage, and he wrote here in his accustomed
fashion: "Ecclesiastes now speaks about the change of good men into
wicked, expressing the foolish man as he who tries, and who not thinking of the
future, enjoys the transient and failing things as if they are great and
perpetual. And after the many things
which usually happen (or change) to men in their life, he asserts something of
a general opinion of death, since the great number perishes and little by
little is consumed and pass across, with each one leaving the other in his
place, and another's successor dying."[^120]
 Origines and Victorinus[^121]
did not think very differently on this matter. 
After the general statement that reveals to all that the poor yet wise
youth is better than an old king who is foolish, and that it often happens that
the lad leaves the prison of the king because of his wisdom, and commands in
place of a cruel dictator, and as a foolish king loses all his power, which he
had obtained. They saw this passage in
relation to Christ and the devil, because they wished to view the poor and wise
boy as Christ. The poor boy is the same
as that one in "it is great for you to be called my boy"[^122],
but the poor man, since he has been made poor[^123],
when once he was rich and wise, because "he was proficient in age and
wisdom and thankful to God and men."[^124] That man is born in the reign of an old man
and therefore he says, "if this was my rule in the world, that my servants
struggle on my behalf so that I am not handed over to the Jews. But now it is not my rule."[^125] So in the reign of that foolish old man who
displays all the rule of the whole world and his glory, the most excellent boy
comes from the house of chains, about which Jeremiah speaks in Lamentations,
saying, "so that he lowers to the feet of that man all those who have been
conquered in the world."[^126] And that boy goes on to rule and goes away to
a far off region, and as king after some time is turned against those, who do
not want to rule. So with some insight
Ecclesiastes saw that all men who are alive and who are able to be part of
youth, say, "I am life"[^127],
having left behind them that old foolish king, to follow Christ. At the same time the two nations of Israel
are to be understood here. The first,
which was before the arrival of the Lord, and the next, which will support the
Antichrist in place of Christ, for the first is not deep down despondent, since
the first church was formed from Jews and the apostles; and in the end the
Jews, who will support the Antichrist, will not rejoice in Christ.

<b>4:17. <i>Guard
your foot when you go to the House of God; better to draw near and hearken than
to offer the sacrifices of fools, for they do not consider that they do
evil.</i></b> He gives some general precepts for life, and does not
want to offend us, who go to church. 
Since it is praiseworthy in his view, not just to enter the House of
God, but to enter without offence. And
if it was intended for all who are in the church of God to hear this passage,
he would never have added, "and approach so that you might hear". But then it was only Moses who approached near
to God to hear[^128],
the other men were not allowed. For the
foolish commit sins, not knowing that there is a remedy; they think that they
can satisfy God with the offering of gifts, and do not know that this is also
evil and a sin; for they want to make correction for what they have done, not
with obedience and good work, but with gifts and sacrifice. What others have said elsewhere agrees with
this too: "obedience above sacrifice"[^129]. And "I want pity and not
sacrifice".[^130]


<h2>CHAPTER 5</h2>

<b>5:1-2. <i>Be not
rash with your mouth, and let not your heart be hasty to utter a word before
God; for God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few. For a dream comes from much concern, and
foolish talk from many words.</i></b> Several men think that this teaches here
that we should not promise something too quickly in the presence of God, and
without due consideration of our strengths we vow things, which we cannot then
fulfil. God though is present in heaven,
but we seem to be on earth, yet he hears what we say and accuses that our
foolishness comes from our love of speech. 
But some men understand this better, affirming that this teaches that,
either speaking or thinking more about God than we are able, we hold to our opinions;
but we know our stupidity, since, as much as the heavens differ from the earth,
so our thoughts are separated from His character. And therefore our words ought to be
checked. Just as he that is much in
thought frequently dreams about those things about which he thinks during the
day; thus he, who wanted to teach more from divinity, falls into
foolishness. Or indeed it could mean
this: our words ought to be few therefore, since even those things, which we
think we know, we see through a mirror and in mystery, and as we understand a
dream, which we think we can grasp. 
Although we have done many things, as it appears to us, the end of our
argument is foolishness. For we do not
escape sin by too much speaking[^131]. 

<b>5:3-4. <i>When
you make a vow to God, do not delay paying it, for He has no liking for fools;
what you vow, pay. Better that you not
vow at all, than that you vow and not pay. 
</i></b>A simple man
does not need understanding by interpretation. 
It is better not to promise than not to keep promises, since they
displease God and are numbered among fools, who do not fulfil their vows. But since he says, "There is no will in fools"
underneath we hear "of God", like the word of the apostle, who says,
"and just as there was no will, that I should now come to you"[^132]. For even if we want to say something more
inquiring, it is taught to a Christian, that he should fulfil his faith by
work, and not be like the Jews, who pledge and say, "we will do all that
God commands"[^133],
and yet worship idols. And afterwards
they beat those slaves and cast stones at them, and immediately killed the very
son of the father of their house. It is
better therefore to hold a doubtful opinion for a while, which is easy to say
in words, but difficult to put into practice. 
For the slave, who knows the will of his God and will not do it will be
defeated by many. <b><i> </i></b>

<b>5:5. <i>Let not
your mouth bring guilt on your flesh, and do not tell the messenger that it was
an error. Why should God be angered by
your speech and destroy the work of your hands? 
</i></b>What the Hebrew
means is that if you are not able to do these things, do not promise to do
them. For the words do not transgress to
the spirit but are carried at once to the Lord by the angel present, who sticks
to one man only as a companion. You who
think to disregard God, since you have promised, you will anger Him, with the
result that all your work will be destroyed. 
But in that place where he says: "to bring guilt upon your
flesh" and he understood this, though not caring diligently, as if he had
said "let not your mouth cause you not to sin." But there seems to me however another
meaning, which is argued by those, who complain about the strength of the flesh
and say they are compelled by the necessity of the body to do those things that
they don't want to do, according to the apostle: "for I do not do what I
want, but what I do not wish" and so on.[^134] And so he says, 'don't seek vain excuses and
give occasion to your flesh to sin'. 
Then in that place where he says "and do not tell the angel that it
was a madness" Aquila takes the Hebrew word <i>segaga</i> to mean ignorance, and translates it with the Greek word <i>akousion</i>, that is, not of ones
will. For if you say this, he says, you
provoke God, as if to say He is like the creator of evil and sin, and anger
Him, so that if you seem to have anything good, He will take it from your
possession. Or indeed he translates such
things with the meaning of reproof, so that you do those things, which are not
appropriate. 

<b>5:6. <i>In
spite of all dreams, futility and idle chatter, rather: Fear God! </i></b>The Hebrews explain this passage in great detail, and
in the following way: and you should not do the things detailed above, about
which he has already spoken, lest you believe too readily in dreams. For when you see different things, your mind
will be troubled by many fears throughout your night's rest, or aroused by
promises, you despise those things that are dream-like. You should only fear God. For he, who believes in dreams, gives himself
over to vanities and nonsense. Another
meaning of this passage is, since I have said and admonished, "you should
not let your mouth bring guilt on your flesh", and to seek this or that
excuse; I introduce this now, since in the dream of that life, and in the
appearance, shade, cloud in which we live, we are able to find many things,
which seem true to life to us and excuse our sins. Therefore I advise that you beware that
alone, lest you think God is absent, but fear Him, and know He is present in
all your toil, and do not force yourself to be hidden in free will, but want
whatever it is that you do. 

<b>5:7-8. <i>If you
see oppression of the poor, and the suppression of justice and right of the
State, do not be astonished at the fact, for there is One higher than the high
Who watches and there are high ones above them. 
The advantage of land is supreme; even a king is indebted to the
soil.</i></b> Christ's garment, woven on top, was not able to be torn
by those who crucified him; and the Saviour threw him from that demon, and
advised him to go away having put on the clothes of the apostles. So we believe that the clothes of our
Ecclesiastes are not to be torn, nor should we sew on here and there patches in
place of our free-will of opinion, but use the one text itself in dispute, and
follow the same meaning and arrangement all the way through. Above this he had said: "do not tell the
messenger that it was a madness, lest God become angry over your speech",
and regarding the remaining things, he had spoken against those, who do not
know that providence rules over human affairs. 
Since therefore the question arises many times about the precept, why
the righteous sustain disaster, and why the unjust become judges over all the
world, but God is not vengeful: now he introduces and finishes this argument,
saying, 'if you see the calamity of a pauper, who is said to be blessed in the
Gospel, and the situation is assessed according to his strength and not in
justice, do not be astonished or let anything seem new to you. God, who is highest above the high, sees
these things, He that placed His angels above the judges and kings of the
earth, to prevent injustice and they are more important on earth, than any of
man's potentates. But since he will be
the Saviour at the end of the judges, and in the end of the world when the
cornfield will be ripe, and the harvesters will come, he will be ordered that
the wheat be separated and the darnel thrown on the fire. Therefore he now awaits and differs in
opinion, although the field of the world is cultivated carefully more
fully. But since that field is
interpreted as the world, the Lord expounds about them in the parable of darnel
and wheat.[^135]

<b>5:9-10. <i>A lover
of money will never be satisfied with money; a lover of abundance has no
wheat. This too, is futility! As goods increase, so do those who consume
them; what advantage, then, has the owner except what hi eyes see?</i></b> Wherever we read 'silver', according to the ambiguity
of the Greek term, it can be translated as 'money', since each has the meaning
of the Greek <i>argurion. </i>More precisely Tullius is said to have
called these men 'pecuniary', who have many small savings, that is wealth in
cattle.[^136] For they were called this in antiquity. But little by little the word devolved into
the one used here through misuse. 
Therefore he is described as greedy because he is never sated by wealth,
and the more he has, the more he desires. 
Horace also agrees with this sentiment, who says, "always the miser
is wanting"[^137],
and too the noble historian, since "avarice is diminished neither by
possessions, nor by lack of them"[^138]. Nothing therefore, says Ecclesiastes can aid
a man who possesses riches, unless only this: that he sees what he
possesses. For the greater his wealth,
the more he will have a larger number of servants, who use up his amassed
wealth. But if he will only see what he
has, he will be able to take more than the food of one man. 

<b>5:11. <i>Sweet
is the sleep of the labourer, whether he eats little or much; the satiety of
the rich does not let him sleep.</i></b> So far the discourse has treated of riches
and greed, and it is compared to a man who works and one who sleeps without
worry, or eats little or a great deal. 
Because he eats any food obtained from the toil of work and from his
sweat, he enjoys peaceful sleep. For a
rich man indeed is busy with banquets and lacerated by many thoughts, is not
able to sleep, and abounds in hangovers and uncooked food boils in the
intestines of his stomach. More
precisely, since it is called sleep, and is a common exit from life, that rest
will be better for him, who is busy at present and reserves his strength for
good work, than the riches of those men, about whom it is written: "woe to
you, O rich, for you have received your consolation".[^139] 

<b>5:12-16. <i>There
is a sickening evil that I have seen under the sun; riches hoarded by their
owner to his misfortune, and he loses those riches in some bad venture. If he begets a son, he has nothing in
hand. As he had come from his mother's
womb, naked will he return, as he had come; he can salvage nothing from his
labour to take with him. This too, is a
sickening evil: Exactly as he came he must depart, and what did he gain in exchange
for toiling for the wind? Indeed, all
his life he eats in darkness; he is greatly grieved, and has illness and
anger.</i></b> Take what follows as linked to what is written above:
while Ecclesiastes describes wealth, even he is not able to enjoy his riches and
on many occasions endangers himself on account of them. Nor to his heir does he leave what he has
amassed; but even he and his son, just as they came nude, will return nude to
the earth and nothing of their toil will accompany them. Surely apathy is the worst, to be tortured by
thought on account of riches, and wealth will perish. And are we able to take it with us when we
die, in sadness, in mourning, in indignation, in laws or to seek it in vain
toil? And all this is according to the
apparent simple meaning of the text. But
as we are lifted higher, it seems to me that it speaks about the philosophers,
or the heretics, who amass riches of doctrines into their wickedness, and nor
are authors able to follow any usefulness, nor leave perpetual fruit for their
followers. But even they and their
disciples return to the earth and lose their riches, from him who said, "I
will lose the wisdom of the wise men, and I will reprove the prudence of the
careful."[^140]
Truly
in fact, just as they left their mother's womb, (apparently as from a heretical
church), contrary to this about which it is written: "but Jerusalem which
is above is free, which is the mother of all."[^141]
Thus
they go nude to become a spirit, and work for nothing. Those who examine, lack examination, and they
are carried on every wind of doctrine, nor do they have the light, but eat
their sacraments in the darkness. They
are always ill, and are easily moved to anger, storing up anger for themselves
for the day of anger, and they do not have the favour of God.

<b>5:17-19. <i>So what
I have seen to be good is that it is suitable to eat and drink and enjoy
pleasure with all one's labour that he toils beneath the sun during the brief
span of his life that God has given him, for that is his lot. Furthermore, every man to whom God has given
riches and possessions and has given him the power to enjoy them, possess his
share and be happy in his work: this is the gift of God. For he shall remember that the days of his
life are not many, while God provides him with the joy of his heart.</i></b> This is in comparison to him, who consumes his wealth
in the darkness of his worries, and carries those things which are about to die
throughout the great tedium of his life, and says that that man is better, who
enjoys what he has. For here there is
but a small desire of enjoyment, but there in the latter indeed there is a
great magnitude of worries. He also
gives the reasons why the gift of God is to be able to enjoy riches. Since "he will not remember much of the
days of his life". For God turns
him to the happiness of his heart's desire: he will not be sad, he will not be
worried by thought, since he is led away by happiness and desire for present
things. But it is better understood as according to the apostle[^142],
seen as spiritual food and spiritual drink which is given by God and I
understood to see goodness in all of his toil, since we are only able to
consider true good things with great toil and enthusiasm. For what is permitted to be good, though,
until Christ appears in our life, is not yet openly considered good. And therefore God will not remember much of
the days of our life. We should also
note that here <i>perispasmos</i> is used in
a better way, in the place of the occupation of the spirit and true
happiness. 

<h2>CHAPTER 6</h2>

<b>6:1-6. <i>There
is an evil I have observed beneath the sun, and it is prevalent among mankind;
a man to whom God has given riches, wealth and honour, and he lacks nothing
that his heart could desire, yet God did not give him the power to enjoy it. This is futility and an evil disease. If a man begets an hundred children and lives
many years - great being the days of his life - and his soul is not content
with the good - and he even is deprived of burial; I say: the stillborn is
better off than he. Though its coming is
futile and it departs in darkness, though its very name is enveloped in
darkness, though it never saw the sun nor knew; it has more satisfaction than
he. Even if he should live a thousand
years twice over, but find no contentment - do not all go to the same
place?</i></b> He describes the riches of misers and asserts that this
evil is often in men, since none of those things, which are thought to be good
in the world, is lacking in him, and nonetheless he torments himself with the
most inane sparing, saving those things to be devoured by others. Nor does he say this in exaggeration, for
even if he produced an hundred books and lived longer than Adam, that is almost
one thousand years, but lived two thousand years, he would rot his mind with
desire and avarice. He is born
prematurely in a worse state that dies, as soon as he seems born. For he did not see evil things or good
things; but although he used to possess good things, he was tormented by
thoughts and sadness, and having been born prematurely he has more rest, than a
greedy man who is old. But both however
are seized by the same fate, while both the first and the last are taken away
by the same death. This could also refer
to Israel, because God gave Israel the law, which speaks about the prophets,
the testament, the Promised Land and the Saviour: "let the reign of God be
removed from you and given to a nation that brings forth his fruit"[^143]. All these things have been given to a foreign
and pilgrim people from peoples who see their good yet do not enjoy it. They say we are of much better condition, who
are considered to be as new-born and premature by those, who praised themselves
in antiquity, finding glory in their fathers, saying: "our father was
Abraham"[^144],
but however both we and they hasten to one place, that is to the judgement of
God. But what Ecclesiastes says in the
middle is this: "but there was no tomb for him". This either means that that rich man does not
think of his death, and while he possesses all, is greedy even in building a
tomb; or that often he is killed on account of those riches, by plots against
his life, and is left unburied, or, what I think is a better interpretation, he
needs nothing of good deeds, from which he is able to obtain for himself memory
among those who come after him. And so
that he will not pass through life in silence, just as cattle, although he had
a means, by which he was able to show that he had lived. 

<b>6:7-8. <i>All
man's toil is for his mouth, yet his wants are never satisfied. What advantage then has the wise man over the
fool? What less has the pauper who knows
how to conduct himself among the living? 
</i></b>All that men
toil at in this world is consumed by the mouth and taken to be digested in the
stomach after it has been ground down by the teeth. And when a little bit has pleased the
palette, it seems to create a desire, so long as it is held in the mouth. But when it has passed down to the stomach
the difference between foods is no longer distinguishable. And after all these things the spirit of a
man who eats is not filled up; or then he desires again what he has eaten, and
is as wise as the fool without food, who does not know how to live, and the
poor man asks for nothing else but for how he is to sustain the organs of his
meagre body, and not die through starvation. 
Or because the spirit takes no gain from the food of the body, and food
is of equal use to a wise man and a fool, and the pauper wanders therefrom, to
where he has seen wealth to be. This is
better understood regarding a man of the church, who learned in the heavenly
Scriptures, holds all his toil in his mouth yet his spirit is not filled, for
he always desires to learn. And in that
respect the wise man has more than the fool, since when he feels himself to be
poor, he presses that pauper, who is called blessed in the Gospel, to
understand those things which are of life, and walks the restricted and narrow
path, which leads to life, and he is poor from wicked deeds and knows where
Christ, (who is life) is to be found. 

<b>6:9. <i>Better
is what the eyes see than what is imagined. 
That, too, is futility and a vexation of the spirit.</i></b> Symmachus interpreted this clearly, he says: "it
is better to make provision, than to walk about as it pleases you". That is, it is better to do all things
according to what you know to be right in your mind, which is the eye of the
soul, than to follow the desire of your heart. 
For this is to wander in spirit, just as Ezekiel says: "he who
walks by the desire of his heart"[^145]. For indeed he denounced that man is proud and
only pleases himself and says he is better, who makes provision for all days,
than he, whom nothing pleases, unless he has made it himself. Nothing is worse than him, and more vane than
any breath. And again here
"vexation of the spirit" has been interpreted by Theodotion and
Aquila as 'suffering of the soul'. 
Symmachus too has "affliction of the spirit". More precisely we must remember that in
Hebrew 'spirit' and 'breath' are similar in usage - that is <i>ruha</i>.  


<b>6:10. <i>What
has been was already named, and it is known that he is but a man. He cannot contend with one who is mightier
than him.</i></b> Clearly this is predicting the arrival of
the Saviour, since he writes 'he will be'; before he was seen in body his name
was already written in the Scriptures and was known by prophets and holy men of
God, since he was a man; and similar to this, since he is a man, he is not able
to walk with his Father. And in the
Gospel it says: "the Father, who sent me, is greater than me."[^146] In the following passages it teaches not to
ask more than is written for us by Him, so that a man may not wish to know more
than is attested in the Scriptures. For
although we are ignorant of our condition and our life passes us by like a
shadow, and our future is undecided, it is not useful for us to strive for more
than we are able to attain. Some think
that this passage means that God already knows the names of all the men, who
will be in the future, and who will be enclosed within the body of
mankind. Nor is a man able to reply to
his creator, and ask why he has been made in this way or that. For however much more we seek, our vanity and
our unnecessary words are exposed all the more. 
Our choice does not come free from the foreknowledge of God, but precedes
the causes, why any one thing is done in a particular way. 


<h2>CHAPTER 7</h2>


<b>7:1. <i>How does it benefit man? For who knows what is good for man in this
life, all the days of his vain life, which he spends as a shadow? For who can tell a man what will be after him
under the sun? </i></b>When he says<b><i> </i></b>that man is ignorant of
his condition, and does not actually know whatever he seems to know and
discern, as if the truth of the matter is not seen, he does see however the
shadow and image as if through a mirror, and he cannot know what will come, or
escape his sin by talkativeness. He
should silence his mouth and believe that He who is written has come, and not
ask by what means, how much, or what kind of man he is that has come.


<b>7:1-2. <i>A good name is better than precious
ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth. </i></b>Consider, he says, man, your short days since you will
cease to be quickly when your body gives out; fast longer, so that however
perfume delights your nostrils with its smell, in the same way posterity will
delight in all things to your name. 
Symmachus interpreted this very clearly, saying, "a good name is
better than a perfume that smells pleasant". We must remember that it is the custom of the
Hebrews to call good perfume 'oil'. He
also says<b>, "and the day of death
than the day of one's birth</b>", this shows that it is better to die, and
no longer be troubled, or be in an unsteady condition of life, than sustain all
these things while being born into the world. 
For in our death we know what we have been like, but when we are born we
cannot know what we will be like or do in life. 
Since birth is also linked to the freedom of the spirit in the body, it
abolishes moral customs.


<b>7:3. <i>It is
better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for
that is the end of all men; and the living will take it to his heart. </i></b>It is more useful to go to the rites of a funeral than
to the house where there is a party, since at the house of mourning we are
warned of our creator and of our mortality on account of seeing the dead
body. But in the happiness of a party,
even if we seem to have any fear, we lose it. 
Symmachus interpreted the last verse by saying, "and he who lives,
will look back in his mind". There
is proof in these verses, in that God is seen to approve food and drink, but
not seen to prefer desire to all these things, with the result that many men
value them wrongly. But in comparison
with avarice and too much sparing, feasting is allowed in a small way, or
allowed to him, who enjoys his work completely every moment. For he had never preferred the sadness of
mourning to the enjoyment of a party, if he had thought at any moment to drink
and eat.


<b>7:4. <i>Anger is better than laughter, for through a sad face the heart is
improved. </i></b>Laughter weakens the mind, anger reproves
and corrects it. Both let us become
angry with ourselves when we sin, and let us get angry with others. Through the sadness of the face, even the
spirit becomes better, as Symmachus saw it. 
And therefore "woe now to those who laugh, since they will
mourn."[^147] 


<b>7:5. <i>The
heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the
house of enjoyment. </i></b>"Blessed", says the Saviour,
"are the mourning, since they will be consoled".[^148] And Samuel mourned King Saul all the days of
his life[^149]
and Paul said he had mourned over those who did not want to repent their many
sins[^150]. Therefore the heart of a wise man goes to the
house of such a man, who reproves himself when he is doing wrong, so that he
brings forth tears and causes himself to weep for his own sins; and he does not
go to the house of joy, where the learned man flatters and deceives, not
changing the listeners so they are together as one, but asking for praise and
applause from them. Such a teacher, who
is rich in speeches and words, is mourned, and being filled by his knowledge,
receives his consolation. Then the
following verses agree with this explanation too, because he says:


<b>7:6-7. <i>It is
better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of
fools. For as the crackling of thorns
under the pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this too is vanity. </i></b>For it is better to be rebuked by a wise man, than to
be deceived by flattering praise. 
Similar to this is the passage which says, "better are the wounds
of a friend, than the free kisses of an enemy"[^151]. Just as the sound of sharp thorns under the
pot gives out a harsh sound, so the words of a flattering teacher are not of
any use, or the worries of the world, which are interpreted as 'thorns', or the
sound of one who encourages his listeners, or of one who prepares them for the
fire which is to come. Let us look at
what Symmachus has to say about the passage that we have as "since just as
the sound…fool." Understanding the
meaning which we have already explained above, he says, 'for a man is bound in
chains by the voice of the ignorant". 
This means that one listener is tied up to the word of such teachers,
while the chains of his sins restrain another.


<b>7:8. <i>Surely
oppression makes a wise man mad; and a gift destroys the heart. </i></b>Now see the wise man as if regarding profit, according
to that passage which says, "accuse the wise and he will love you"[^152]. Wise, or even having completed his training,
he knows no accusation, and is perturbed by no disaster. We should use this verse if we see disaster
befall a righteous and wise man, and he is perturbed by the unlawfulness of the
judgement, and in that case when God does not come to his mind readily. Instead of this though the Septuagint, and
Aquila and Theodotion interpret the phrase "destroys the heart" as <i>eutonias</i> <i>autou </i>that is 'his strength', or 'his vigour'. Symmachus says, "and <i>matthana</i> destroys his heart' (that is 'a
gift'), using the Hebrew word in his interpretation, and making the same
meaning as is written elsewhere: "gifts, too, blind the eyes of the
wise".[^153] 


<b>7:9. <i>Better
is the end of a thing than the beginning; </i></b>Perorations are better in speaking, than just the
introductory section. For worry comes to
and end in the former, and commences in the latter. Or it could even mean this: he who begins to
hear a speech, and goes to the teacher, is in first place. For indeed he who listens until the last is
consumed and complete in learning. But
this can also be understood in this way: while we are in this world, all that
we know is as a beginning; but when that age is completed, we will understand
everything as newest and completed. My
Hebrew tutor explained this passage together with the following verse as
follows: it is better for you to ponder the end of your business, than the
beginning, and be patient, rather than being seized by the frenzy of
impatience. We learn too from this
reading that there is no wisdom in men, although it is better to do than to
only say that you will do. And since,
when the talk had finished, the listener thinks over for himself what has been
said, and though he begins to speak, he has not yet understood what he can
learn from it. <b><i>And the patient in spirit is better than the proud in
spirit. </i></b>Since the heavenly one conceded to anger, saying,
"anger is better than laughter", lest we think anger is to be praised
in suffering, now he says that anger must be removed from deep down inside
us. For there he assigns anger instead
of correction in sinners, and learning in children. But here he checks
impatience. But patience is not only
necessary in difficult times, but also in happier times, in case we rejoice
more than we should. It seems to me that
he who is now called high in the spirit of the Gospel, is in contrast poor in
spirit, and is even blessed.


<b>7:10. <i>Be not
hasty in your spirit to be angry: for anger rests in the lap of fools. </i></b>He does not grant here that anger should be tempered,
therefore he now says, "Be not hasty in your spirit to be angry"; but
that when anger is mad and new, it is more easily tempered because it is
dispersed easily and can be removed. And
since anger is linked to pride, and the desire for vengeance, he says it is
better and above suffering, than he who is exalted in his spirit, and now shows
the sign of foolishness, since however powerful or wise someone is esteemed, if
he is made angry he will seem foolish in his words: "for anger lies in the
lap of fools".


<b>7:11. <i>Do not
ask,' what is the cause that the former days were better than these?' For you do not enquire wisely about
this. </i></b>Do not prefer the previous age to this one, since God
created both one and the other. Virtues
create good days for man, and vices make bad days. Do not say therefore that the days were
better in the time of Moses and Christ, than now they are. For even in that time there were more
disbelievers and their days were made wicked by this; now there are more believers,
about whom the Saviour said, "more blessed are they, who did not see or
believe"[^154]. Or differently: thus you ought to live so
that the days that you live in are always better than those passed, lest you
begin to decrease little by little, it should then be said to you, "you
did run well, who hindered you that you should not have obeyed the truth?"[^155];
and again: "you who began in spirit are now consumed by flesh"[^156]. Or another meaning of this: do not say that
the times of old are better than now, those of Moses better than Christ, that
they were more lawful than full of grace. 
For if you were to ask this, you would do it unwisely, not seeing how
much the Gospel differs from the Old Testament.


<b>7:12-13. <i>Wisdom
is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the
sun. For wisdom is a defence, and money
is a defence: but the advantage of knowledge is, that wisdom gives life to
those that have it. </i></b>A wise man with riches has more glory than
just a wise man alone. For some men need
wisdom, some wealth, but he who is both wise and not rich is able to teach what
is good, but meanwhile he can't show what is to be sought. Therefore he says, since the protection of
wisdom is the protection of money, then just as wisdom protects, so too money
also protects. And lest he seem to
detract from wisdom, while he adds to it by good fortune, (for it is not in our
power to obtain riches, which often the unrighteous own in greater quantity),
he therefore shows wisdom to be greater, saying "but the advantage of
knowledge is, that wisdom gives life to those that have it." In that respect, he says, wisdom is greater
than riches, because without any wealth it preserves those who think themselves
rich. Certain scholars see this passage
in a different way: they say that he places heredity in place of good
association, by which we are the heirs of God, and co-heirs of Christ. Therefore Ecclesiastes wants to teach how
much of a difference there is between those who merit seeing the sun (of
justice), and have wisdom by their good association, and those in contrast, who
without wisdom have only enthusiasm for vice and association. Since even David shows this, saying "the
intelligent shine out by their speech, as the shining bodies of the sky"[^157],
or as Theodotion interpreted this, "just as the brightness of the
firmament. Indeed those who wrote my
speeches are as the stars of the sky". 
But we ought to take that protection of silver (or money) according to <i>anagoge[^158]</b>
</i>from which talents and coins are collected in the parables of the Gospels[^159],
just as when we were under the protection of wisdom and under the protection of
such money: "the sun does not burn us by day, nor the moon by night".[^160] But this can even be said to be true since
protection is our life on the earth: "the breath of our nostrils, the
anointed Christ our Lord of whom we said: under His shadow we should live among
the heathen".[^161] All of our protection in this life is like a
shade, or like wisdom, or as is said about money, until the day moves on and
the shadows move away. Symmachus
interprets this more clearly in his usual manner, saying, "just as wisdom
protects, so too money protects in a similar fashion". But the following verse openly encourages the
enthusiasm for knowledge.


<b>7:14. <i>Consider
the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he has made
crooked? </i></b>Symmachus translates this passage in this
way: "learn the word of God, because no one can correct what He has
ruined". That is he supplies from
the Holy Scriptures, or from thinking of the elements, to know and understand
those things, which are done; but not to ask the causes and reasons why one
thing is done in this way, or why it ought to have been done differently from
the way in which it has been done. For
the sake of this passage, if anyone should ask why God spoke to Moses in this
way: "who makes the dumb and the deaf, the seeing and the blind, am I not
the Lord God?"[^162],
and if he should say, why are the blind, the deaf, the mute created in this
way, and others similar to these? This
passage must be seen in reference to 
Psalm 17, in which it is said to the Lord: "You will be Holy with
the holy man, and with the wicked You
will err"[^163]. And it must be added that the Holy Lord is
with him, who is holy; and the wicked are with him, who was previously wicked
by his own will. This is similar also to
that which is written in Leviticus: "if the wicked came to me I will go to
them, wicked in my madness".[^164] Even this can explain why God hardened the
heart of Pharaoh. For just as one and
the same quality of the sun melts wax and dries clay, and on account of each
one's constitution, both wax melts and clay dries;[^165]
so too the one quality of the portents of God in Egypt softened the heart of
those who believed, and hardened that of the incredulous, who just as their
hardness and impatient heart, began to store up for themselves anger for the
day of anger from those portents, which they didn't believe, though yet they
saw them happen.


<b>7:15. <i>In the
day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also has
set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing
after him. </i></b>I have heard from a certain man in the
Church, who was thought to have a knowledge of the Scriptures, that these
verses are to be explained in this way: while you remain in the present world,
and while you are able to do good work, work hard so that afterwards you may be
without worry in the day of wickedness, that is the day of judgement, when you
will see others to be tormented.  For
just as God made the present world, in which we can obtain for ourselves the
benefits of good work; so too he made the future age, in which no opportunity
will be given for us to do good work. 
This man of the Church even seemed to convince those he was preaching
to, but to me there seems a different meaning to this, which Symmachus has
translated, saying, 'in the good day, be good; but be wary of the day of
wickedness'. All the same, God made this
world similar to the next, so that man should not be able to find that which he
complains against Him. Suffer both the
good things, he says, and the bad, as they happen to you in your life. And do not think that there is only the
nature of good or bad alone in the world, especially when the world itself consists
of opposites: hot and cold, dry and wet, hard and soft, dark and light, bad and
good. [^166] But God made this ambivalence so that wisdom
might have a place, and it is found by choosing good and avoiding bad: man is
given free will, lest he argue that he has been made unfeeling, and stupid by
God. But God has made man so diverse
that man is unable to complain of his manner of being. At the same time this argument is to be taken
with the previous verses, in which he says 'who is able to correct what God has
done?'. 


<b>7:16. <i>I have
seen all things in the days of my vanity: there is a just man, that dies in his
righteousness, and there is a wicked man that remains alive in his
wickedness. </i></b>Similar to this is what the Saviour says in
the Gospel: "he who finds his soul will lose it, and he who loses it on
account of me, will find it"[^167]. The Maccabees are seen to die on account of
their justice by the law and justice of God, and martyrs too, who shed their
blood for Christ. On the other hand,
those who at that time ate the flesh of pigs and sacrificed to idols after the
arrival of the Lord, they are seen to live in this world and to live long lives
on account of their wickedness. But it
is the endurance of God in secret which causes suffering in those who are not
holy, so that they have wickedness in their life, and not to visit sinners for
their crimes, and it is as if he saves for the sacrifice so that he can give to
the former eternal goodness, and to the latter eternal wickedness. The Hebrews suspect the righteous, who die
for their righteousness, the sons of Aaron, since while they think they live
righteously, they worship a foreign fire. 
And they say Manasseh was impious and lived a long life on account of
his wickedness, for he then lived a long time in a long reign after having been
corrected in prison. 

<b>7:17. <i>Do
not be too righteous, do not make yourself too wise: why destroy yourself? </i></b>If you should see a man who is harsh
and wild to the extent of sinning against his brothers, so that he pardons
neither the sinner in his speaking, or he who is slow on account of natural
slowness, know that this man is more righteous than is good. For when the Saviour teaches, saying "Do
not judge, so that you are not judged"[^168],
and let none be without sin, even if it was not his life at any given day, the
judgement of God is not ignorant of the weak state of man. Therefore do not be too righteous, since
accursed conduct in the presence of God carries both a great and a minor
burden. Philosophers have placed virtues
therefore in the middle, and everything which is either too much either above
or below, is thought to be at fault.[^169] But he also says, "and do not ask too
much, lest you become confused", or "lest you be amazed". For he knows that our mind cannot understand
complete wisdom, (or that which is to be measured), and he says that we ought
to know the wisdom which must be measured in our mortality. Then even Paul asked of him that was able to
know more than man, saying, "why does he yet complain? For who has
resisted his will?"[^170] He replies, "O man, who are you that
reply to God?"[^171],
and so on. If he had heard the causes of
the complaint from the apostle, he who is introduced while he is questioning,
by chance he would have been stupefied by numbness and would have felt useful
gratitude. Since it is a gift according to
that same apostle, which is of no use to him that receives it. The command "do not be too
righteous"[^172]
is interpreted by the Hebrew as being about Saul, who felt pity for Agag, whom
the Lord had commanded to be killed. But
even that servant from the Gospel whom the Lord had pardoned[^173],
the Lord himself didn't want to pardon the servant, yet he can be used in this
verse because he was too righteous. 


<b>7:18. <i>Do not
be too wicked, and do not be foolish: why should you die before your time? </i></b>When God says, "I do not want the death of the
dying, only let him return and live"[^174],
it suffices to have sinned only once. We
ought to raise ourselves up after a catastrophe. For just like those who argue about worldly
matters, the swallow knows how to protect its young from poppy seeds, and
wounded roes seek wild marjoram to cure themselves. Then why are we ignorant that the cure of
repentance is proposed for sinners? But
he says, "do not delay in an world that is not yours". We know that Chore, Dathan, and Habiron, on
account of their uprising against Moses and Aaron, were suddenly eaten up by a
gap in the earth, and in emendation of others, many were judged before the day
of judgement even in their lifetime.[^175] Therefore he says, "do not add sins to
sins, lest you cause God to punish you"


<b>7:19. <i>It is good
that you should take hold of this, and do not withdraw your hand; for he that
fears God shall come forth of them all. </i></b>It is good to do good to righteous men, but
also being kind to sinners is not wicked. 
It is good to keep slaves faithful to you, but it is advised to do this
only with those who seek your employment. 
Even he who fears God and copies his maker, who causes rain to fall over
both the righteous and the wicked, enjoys doing good to all without distinction. Another meaning of this is, because this life
changes daily with many wretched occurrences, as fortunate as unfortunate, the
spirit should be prepared for righteousness and should ask for the pity of God,
so that whatever happens, he suffers with a free conscience. For he who fears God is neither raised to
fortune, nor crushed by misfortune.   


<b>7:20-21. <i>Wisdom
strengthens the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city. For there is not a just man on the earth,
that does good and does not sin. </i></b>Therefore wisdom strengthens the righteous,
and not even the aid of all the citizens of the city can help him, for although
someone may be righteous, yet while he is alive he is subject to vices and
sins, and he therefore needs greater protection. Another reading of this is: the ten who hold
power and are in the city are angels, who have arrived at the complete number
of 'denarii' and are here to help mankind. 
But if anyone should consider different types of help, the aid of wisdom
is better, because that is the aid of our Lord Jesus Christ. For after the angels said, "we would
have protected Babylon yet it is not now protected, so let us leave it, and let
each one of us go out unto his own land"[^176]. Then the teacher of doctors himself came down
and healed us with a touch of His finger, we who were spattered with blood, and
wet with the blood of sinners, we who weigh out all our possessions against
healing. But He healed in that city
which is in that world, and 'strengthened in wisdom' or as the Septuagint says
'helped'. For it is given and added to
everyone who possesses it. But the man
who sins greatly is stuck in deep and needs more help: therefore Wisdom herself
came to his aid. Another meaning of this
verse is: above he had said that one should be kind to both the good and the
wicked: therefore someone was able to reply: though I want to be kind to all
men, I have not the power with which to do this. And a righteous man does not have such
riches, which normally come more abundantly to sinners. Therefore he now says, those whom you can't
help with money, help with advice and comfort them with solace. For one is more able to excel in these ways
than any of the greatest of potentates. 
And you would be wise to do this, for the scale of justice is great, and
must decide for whom, how much, how long, and of what sort, help is given,
either with monetary support or with advice.  



<b>7:22-23. <i>And do
not heed all words that are spoken, lest you hear your servant curse you. For often your own heart knows that you
likewise have cursed others. </i></b>Make sure to do only those things which have
been taught, and strengthened by the help of wisdom, prepare yourself for
either good or bad outcomes, and don't worry about what your enemies might say
about you, or what kind of reputation you have. 
For just as a cautious man should not hear his servant complain about
him, so he should not want to hear what is said about him in his absence, (for
if he did this he would always be troubled and incensed to anger by the
muttering of the servant). Therefore it
is befitting for a wise man to walk with wisdom following him, and not to dwell
upon unfounded rumours. But he teaches
by another example that the righteous man ought not to worry what men say,
saying, 'just as your conscience knows what you have said about others, and
that you have often maligned others, so you ought to pardon others when they
think badly of you.' At the same time he
teaches that it is difficult to judge for one who has a rod in his eye, not to
speak about the rod of another.


<b>7:24-25. <i>I have
proved all this by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</i> <i>That
which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? </i></b>Just as is attested in the Book of Kings[^177]
he says that he sought wisdom more than other men, and tried to reach the
pinnacle, but the more he sought, the less he found, and in the midst of his
confusion, he was surrounded by the darkness if ignorance. But at another time, regarding him who was
learned in the Scriptures- the more he wanted to know, the more a greater
obscurity arose each day for him. 
Another meaning of this is: he seems to mean that contemplation of
wisdom in this life is like looking in a mirror or at a picture; therefore if I
look at my face in the mirror in the future I'll think back to the way it used
to be, and then in the liquid pool I'll recognise that I differ greatly from
the way I used to be. 


<b>7:26-27. <i>I
applied my heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason
of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and
madness. And I find that woman is more
bitter than death, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands are as bands:
whoever pleases God shall escape her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. </i></b>The Septuagint here has: "I even applied my heart
that I should know". Symmachus has
interpreted this saying, 'I have looked into all things with my reasoning to
know, to distinguish and to find out.' 
Since therefore Ecclesiastes had said above that he had tried to know
all wisdom and the more he sought it the more it eluded him, now he says even
that he sought out another thing in his wisdom, for wickedness precedes all
things in human affairs, and that affair is first and foremost in impiety,
stupidity, madness, and insanity. He
also says that he found woman to be the cause of all evil, since through her,
death came into the world and took the most prized spirits of men. And even for all adulterers, it is like there
is a coat of mail on their heart, the heart that makes the souls of adolescents
soar upwards. And when this happens to
the mind of a wretched lover, it pushes him into first position, and he is not
allowed to look back at his feet, but like a snare or noose it ensnares the
heart of a youth. 'For he has chains
around his wrists', which Aquila interpreted as being, 'for his hands are in
chains'. For he can convince, but he
doesn't have the strength and can't pull himself to those who are
unwilling. Those things destroy him, who
was righteous and good before God; but the sinner who has been captured will be
led down to his death. Let us not think
that Solomon held this opinion about women thoughtlessly, he speaks only those
things that he has experienced. For this
reason he fears God, since women have captured him. And these interpretations are very
literal. But according to the spiritual
understanding of this passage, either we should take every sin made in general,
and call it 'woman' and 'wickedness', for example, she who sits behind the façade
of woman in Zechariah above the talent of lead.[^178] Or we can take woman to be the devil
metaphorically on account of effeminate men; or indeed idolatry, and so that we
might proceed more closely, the church or heretics, which calls the fool to
itself by reasoning, so that he receives stolen bread, and stolen water, the
false sacrament, and is led to be baptised in polluted water.   


<b>7:28-30. <i>Behold,
I have found this, says the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the
account. Which still my soul seeks, but
I have not found it. I have found one
man among a thousand, but one woman among all those I have not found. Only this
have I found: that God has made man righteous, but he has sought out many
inventions. </i></b>He says, "I found this", teaching
all things diligently, that by sinning little by little, and adding one crime
on top of another, we amass a great number of sins for ourselves. '<i>esebon</i>'
even, which all translate as <i>logismon</i>
in Greek, according to the ambiguity of the Hebrew language can be said by us
to be 'number', 'sum', 'account', and 'consideration'. But, he says, my spirit sought even this
question of whether woman is rightly found to be guilty. And although I found scarcely any men to be
good, thus so that only one from a thousand can be found, I couldn't even find
one woman to be completely good. For all
of them have led me not to virtue but to self-indulgence. And because man's heart is predisposed
towards wickedness from boyhood, and almost all of us offend God in some way,
in this failing of mankind, women are more prone to this fate. The famous poet says about this:
"inconstant and always changeable is woman"[^179]. And the apostle says, "always learning
yet never arriving at the knowledge of the truth"[^180]. But he does not condemn this nature as being
common to all mankind, or say that God the creator does evil things, because he
is the creator of these things, but he warns subtly those who are not able to
avoid evil, and says that we are created good by God; but he also says that
because we are left with our own free-will to deteriorate into a worse and
worse state through our own vices, while we seek greater things and contemplate
many things beyond our strength. Differently:
while I consider the reason behind each and every one of these verses, I have
found no thought, which is not perturbed from outside by wicked thoughts. But in a thousand men I have found one man,
who is made in the image of his creator; and not in a thousand of any kind, but
of one thousand <i>men</i>. There is not a like number of women
corresponding to men. In the thousand,
those who have not been close to a woman have therefore remained the most pure. But all this must be taken as a
metaphor. In many though, who enthuse
and every day sweat in their thinking, scarcely can there be found one pure
thought, that is worthy of the name of man. 
We can take thoughts for men though, and women for work, and say that
the thoughts of man can only be seen as pure with great difficulty. But since the body does work, it is always
mixed up with some fault. But instead of
that which we said above interpreting the Hebrew phrase, "one upon
another, so that a great accumulation is made" we could either say 'account',
or 'thought'; Symmachus interprets this more clearly, saying, "one upon
another makes an amount". And we
are accustomed to call this complete and neutral, which I sought and had wanted
to find. The Hebrews name this in the
case of females, just as in the phrase "I sought one from God, this I
ask"[^181],
in place of that which is one.[^182]

<h2>CHAPTER 8</h2>


<b>8:1. <i>Who is like the wise man? And who knows what things mean? A man's wisdom lights up his face, and the
boldness of his face is transformed. </b></i>He had taught above that it is hard to find
a good man, and he had answered the question to the contrary, saying that men
are made good by God, but that they fall into sin because of their own free
will. Now he lists what qualities God
has given to a good man, to show his glory: wisdom obviously, and reason and
providence, and he knows that the secrets that are hidden by God enter his
heart. But he is also talking about
himself here indirectly, because no one was as wise as Solomon was, and none
answered the problems he set. And
because his wisdom was praised by all, wisdom which he not only carried on the
inside, but also wore on the surface of his skin, and which shone from his
face, he moreover imbued all men with the wisdom which shone forth from his
visage. Where we have, 'who is like the
wise man?' the Septuagint reads: "who knows wise men?" and where we
read, 'the boldness of his face is transformed', the Septuagint has, "and
the unwise is disliked by his face". 
And although in fact there are many, who engage themselves in the
pursuit of wisdom, it is found with great difficulty, but he is able to tell a
wise man though from those, who only seem to be wise. Though too there are even many more, who say
that they are able to let themselves tell the secrets of the Scriptures, it is
not common however, that one will actually find the true answer. But what follows- "the wisdom of a man
will light up his face and the wicked is hated by his face" - can be
explained in the way that Paul explains it: "but we all see the glory of
God with our face uncovered"[^183]. The writer of the Psalms also says, "the
light of your face shines down upon us, O Lord"[^184]. But he says that the wisdom of man is not
different from the wisdom of God. 
Although it is the wisdom of God, it then begins to be also a part of
the human faculty, but only when it is in him who merits wisdom. Every heretic, who defends his false
doctrines, shows his foolishness on his face. 
Then Marcion and Valentinus say that they are of a better nature than
the Creator himself! This can be seen in
another way, if they contend to hope for this wisdom, but do not already
possess it. 


<b>8:2-4. <i>I
counsel you: Obey the king's command, and that in the manner of an oath of
God. Do not hasten to leave his
presence, do not persist in an evil thing; for he can do whatever he
pleases. Since a king's word is law, who
dare say to him, 'what are you doing?' </i></b>Here he seems to teach the same as the
apostle - that we should obey kings and rulers, which is set out in the
Septuagint as a command: "guard the command of the king"; but
personally I think he is now talking about that king about whom David says,
"Lord, the king will be happy in your virtue"[^185]. And in another passage, where it means the
one reign of the Father and of the Son, the text reads, "God, give your
judgement to the king, and your righteousness to the son of the king".[^186] For the Father does not judge each one, but
gives each judgement to the Son. 
Moreover, that king who is the Son of God, is the son of the Father who
is the King. Therefore His precepts
should be kept, His will done. And this
is exactly what is written in the book of Tobit: "it is good to hide the
secret of the king"[^187]. He warns in particular why we should not ask
why God has taught every single thing, but see that teaching as a commandment,
and this is what an impious man hastens to fulfil. Then let his will be the same as that of
God's law. But because the Septuagint translates
this differently, saying, "do not hasten to run away from God's presence",
nor his judgement or his word, you must know that God's judgement is written in
the divine will. Therefore we ought not
to recount to anyone or make public this judgement, which is taken to be sacred
and secret from the word of God, nor should we form rash opinions from it. We should not, too, hasten like Moses, to see
the face of God, but rather wait a while until He Himself passes by and then we
will only see Him passing. Nor too
should we do what follows: do not persist in an evil thing, and so on,
especially as we understand, like one who has already come into the madness of
heresy, or as he, who although having faith in the Church, is still overcome by
sins, so that he is unfaithful. Do not
persevere in what is wrong, or in swearing, indulgence, greed, or lust. For if you do the king of vices and devil of
sins will fashion in you your end, and he will be able to do whatever he wants
with you.


<b>8:5. <i>He who
obeys the commandment will know no evil; and a wise man will know time and
justice. </i></b>Notice here in particular that 'he will know
no evil' has been written instead of 'he will not suffer' or even 'evil will
not be in him'. Likewise it has also
been written about the Saviour, "for he has made him to be sin for us, who
knew no sin."[^188] Instead of 'evil' too Symmachus interprets
this phrase as saying, "he who keeps the commandment will experience no
wickedness". But he teaches that we
should keep the command of a king, and know why and when he orders.   


<b>8:6-7. <i>For
everything has its time and justice, for man's evil overwhelms him. Indeed he does not know what will happen, for
when it happens , who will tell him? </i></b>Many good and bad things can befall a man,
but even a righteous man is not able to know what will befall him, or know the
causes and reasons for each thing, (for no one can know what will happen), but
he does know that all things are done by God to the advantage of man, and
nothing is done without His will. For
this is a great sufferance for mankind, since as the poet says: "the mind
of man knows not his lot and coming fate"[^189]. If he hopes for one thing, then another
happens; he expects the enemy to come from one direction and is wounded by a
spear from the opposite direction. But
here Theodotion and the Septuagint have said, "since the knowledge of man
overwhelms him", the Hebrew has 'wickedness' not 'knowledge'. But because the Hebrew letters 'Resh' and
'Daleth' are similar without the serif, instead of <i>raath </i>they have read <i>daat, </i>that
is instead of 'wickedness', 'knowledge'. 
This is easier to understand if you have knowledge of the language. Note too, that which is written at the end of
the verse: 'since he doesn't know what has been, and what will be after him,
who will tell him?' I have translated
word for word here from the Hebrew text, so that we can see that there is a
different meaning, since we are clearly not able to know those things which
have already passed away, or those that will be, as they have yet to be done.


<b>8:8. <i>Man is
powerless over the spirit-to restrain the spirit; nor is there authority over
the day of death; nor discharge in war; and wickedness cannot save the
wrong-doer. </i></b>Our mind does not have the power to prevent
the spirit from being taken from us, and when the spirit leaves to the realm of
God, it helps nothing to shut out mouth and hold in our fleeting life. And when we are dead, the enemy of our life
will come and we are not able to take any rest. 
Note too the kings in one age, which destroying all our things
irreligiously led us by the hands to our death, but we were taken into the
ashes and the earth. Therefore we must
not mourn if we cannot know the future and we are often oppressed by more
powerful and wicked men, for all things end in death: for the proud and the
powerful the same end; he who has devastated all things does not deserve to
keep his life when it is taken away. 
Another meaning could be that the spirit that is the source of life
cannot be prevented from leaving any man, this is the rule of mortality. Above too he also spoke of this: "turning,
turning goes the wind"[^190]. We have no power in the day of our death, but
when we are alive our enemy is easily avoided. 
Similarly he who is in time of war and does not have the peace of God,
which overpowers all feeling, he will not have any discharge therefrom, about
which it is said to a bride, "your discharge is paradise with the fruit of
apples"[^191]. And because piety will not save him who has
it, piety will save the opposite, and impiety can be called the Devil and piety
our Lord Jesus Christ. 


<b>8:9-11. <i>All
this have I seen; and I applied my mind to see every deed that is done under
the sun: there is a time when one man rules over another to his detriment. And then I saw the wicked buried and newly
come while those who had done right were gone from the Holy place and were
forgotten in the city. This too is
vanity! Because the sentence for
wrong-doing is not executed quickly- that is why men are encouraged to do evil. </i></b>I have dedicated my heart, he says, that I should see
all that is done under the sun, and this too, that man takes up arms against
man, so that he afflicts and condemns those whom he wants. And so when I began to look upon those things
I saw that the impious were dead by such belief and buried, and were deemed
holy in the earth, but those who were living were thought to be worthy of the
Church, and the temple of God, the bombastic walking above were praised for
their wickedness. "For the sinner is praised for the laxity of his soul,
and he who is wicked is blessed"[^192]. But this happens moreover because no one
dares to confront sinners and God does not immediately give punishment for
crimes, but rather postpones, so that we must await our repentance. But since those who sin are not immediately
arrested and accused, they think with little regard that their judgement will
be in the future, and continue in their crime. 
We can see how this evidence pertains to certain bishops, who come to
power in the Church, and speak ill of those, which had taught and had urged
them to follow better pursuits. These
men are very often praised after death in the Church, and blessed for those
things, which they in all likelihood did not even do, or openly are warned by
their successors or the congregation. 
And even this is vanity, since while they live they do not heed advice
and are not immediately visited for their sins, (since none dares accuse his
superior), besides they act as if holy and blessed, and as if they are walking
in the precepts of the Lord, and they increase their sins one on top of
another. Such an accusation of a bishop
is difficult. For you see, if he has
sinned, it is not believed, and if he is accused, he is not punished.


<b>8:12. <i>Because
a sinner does what is wrong an hundred times and He is patient with him, yet
nevertheless I am aware that it will be well with those who fear God that they
may fear Him. </i></b>Because a sinner has done many wicked deeds,
this is what is meant by, 'an hundred times': God gives a time for repentance,
and does not punish him immediately for his crime, but he waits so that he is
converted by his wickedness. I
understand how good-willing and forgiving God will be to those who fear Him and
tremble at His word. Symmachus
translated this passage as, "For a sinner dies wicked, long-life is
granted him". More precisely I know
that it will be well for those who fear God, who fear His face, but it will not
be well for the wicked, and he will not live long, for he does not fear
God. And because what Symmachus
translated is clear, we can say that the Hebrew word <i>maath </i>is what the Septuagint has translated as 'from then on',
which we have here as 'an hundred times'. 
Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion have interpreted 'he has died' as
"he has sinned and done evil, and is dead", because for that which he
sinned, he immediately dies. But
according to the interpretation of the Septuagint, instead of 'he is dead' we
read 'from then on', and according to that interpretation, the meaning is, 'a
sinner does not sin at first when he seems to sin, but already even before he
has sinned': "Sinners are estranged from the womb, they have erred since
they were in the stomach"[^193]. And they ask this that follows- "they
have spoken falsity", just as he explains for a simple understanding,
there seems to be no reason that child sinners speak lies as soon as they come
out of the womb.


<b>8:13. <i>And it
will not be well with the wicked, and he will not live long-like a
shadow-because he does not fear God. </i></b>He invokes wickedness upon those who do not
fear God, and desires that they do not wait long for their punishment, but
rather are crucified and immediately put to death, this punishment is for those
who merit such a death. This is similar
to what the apostle says: "I would that those who annoy us were put to death."[^194] And in another place "Alexander the coppersmith
did me much evil, may the Lord reward him according to his works."[^195] We must ask though how these things are said
so mildly. This is very true to the
Hebrew meaning of this verse. But we can
follow the Septuagint's interpretation, which seems to take another meaning,
and says, "and I know, since those who fear God will be well, that they
fear his face, and the wicked will not be well, and his day will not be long in
shadows, who does not fear God." He
could have said this: 'let there also be those things which I considered a
little earlier', but I know clearly that those fearing God will be well;
"for the face of God is above those who do wickedness"[^196]. And the wicked will not be well, for he does
not fear God and his days will not be longer in shadows. This is the day of his life, which is like a
shadow for the living. Not by this do
those who live for a long time lengthen their days, but they make them great
with the number of their good deeds. As
if confessing himself to be a sinner, Jacob says about this: "few and
wicked are these days of mine"[^197]. And confessing in the Psalm he says, "my
days are inclined like shadows, and I am like the hay of the field"[^198]. Not because he has sought a long life in the
present world, in which all that we live is brief and looks lie shadow:
"for man walks in His likeness"[^199],
but because he fears the future, lest the length of his life, if it is indeed
life, should be short.


<b>8:14. <i>There
is a futility that takes place on earth: sometimes there are righteous men who
are treated as if they had done according to the deeds of the wicked; and there
are wicked men who are treated as if they had done the deeds of the
righteous. I declared, this, too, is
vanity. </i></b>Amongst other vanities, which are borne in the world by
good and bad events, even this I have found to be vain, since those things
often happen to the righteous which ought to happen to the wicked, and the
wicked live happily in the world that you would think that they were the more
righteous! He gives the example in the
Gospel of the rich courtier and poor Lazarus.[^200] The seventy-second Psalm also talks about the
matter of why bad things happen to good men and vice-versa. But where we read, 'there is a futility that
takes place on earth', Symmachus translates this fully, saying, "it is
difficult to understand what is done on earth". The Hebrews interpret the righteous who
suffer wickedness as the sons of Aaron, and Manasseh, because the former died
while sacrificing, and the latter was restored to power after much wickedness
and captivity.


<b>8:15. <i>So I
praised enjoyment, for man has no other aim under the sun but to eat, drink,
and be joyful; and this will accompany him in his toil during the days of his
life which God has given him beneath the sun. 
</i></b>I have interpreted
this more fully above, and now I shall just speak cursorily. He is allowed to prefer to eat and drink,
which is the enjoyment (and must be short and end quickly) in the dire-straits
of his life, and in light of those things, which are seen to happen unfairly in
the world, (since man seems to have only this in return for his toil), he
enjoys only modest recompense. But if
the interpretation is read in the way it has been written, it reproves the
wretched, the fasting and the hungry, the thirsty and the mourners, whom the
Lord calls blessed in the Gospel[^201]. And we regard food and drink spiritually and
above this happiness, which we are scarcely able to find in the toil of our
life. But because these things are
expressed in this way, as I have said, the following verse shows this too,
which says, "I dedicated my heart to seeing wisdom and work", since
clearly men work on earth, and consider deeply the Scriptures day and night in
this way so that sleep flees from their eyes, in return for their study.


<b>8:16-17. <i>When I
applied my heart to see wisdom and work which takes place on earth- for even
day or night its eyes see no sleep. And
I perceived all the work of God. Indeed
man cannot fathom the events that occur under the sun, inasmuch as man tries
strenuously to search, but cannot fathom it. 
And even though a wise man should presume to know, he cannot know
it. </i></b>He searches for the causes and understanding of the
world, why this or that is done, and for what reason the world is steered by
good or bad turns of events; why one is born blind and frail, another born
healthy and with sight; why one is poor, another rich; why one is of high
birth, another inglorious. Nothing else
is of use, unless he is tortured in his search, and has an argument instead of
anguish, but he does not find what he is looking for. And when he says that he knows, then he has
the beginning of ignorance in him, and starts to sink into deeper madness. But he shows later that justice is the cause
of all things, why things happen the way they do, but that those causes hide in
secret and are not able to be understood by men.

 
<h2>CHAPTER 9</h2>




<b>9:1. <i>For all
this I noted and I sought to ascertain all this: that the righteous and the
wise together with their actions are in the Hand of God; whether love or hate
man does not know; all preceded them. </i></b>Symmachus also interprets this more clearly,
saying: I kept all these things in my heart so that I could expound all things,
since the righteous and the wise, along with their works are in the hand of
God. And besides neither friendship, nor
hatred is known to man; yet all things are not certainin their presence<b>, </b>because
they happen similar to all, both to the righteous and to the wicked alike. More precisely the meaning is this: I
dedicated my heart even to this and wanted to know whom it is that God loves,
and whom He hates. And I found too that
even the work of the righteous is in the hand of God, but though, whether they
are loved by God or not, now they know it cannot be and they remain undecided
as to whether they should keep on doing what they are doing until it is
approved, or pray. In the future
therefore they will know and all will be on their faces, that is 'will precede
them' when they leave this life. 
Knowledge of that matter then will come to them, since then is the
judgement, but now the struggle. And
whosoever remains confused as to whether they should keep on through the love
of God, as Job, or through hate, as several sinners, will not be able to know
for certain. 


<b>9:2. <i>All
things come alike to all; the same fate awaits the righteous and the wicked,
the good and the clean and the unclean, the one who brings a sacrifice and the
one who does not. As is the good man so
is the sinner, as is the one who swears, so is the one who fears an oath. </i></b>These things which in themselves are neither good nor
bad but are called 'in-between' by the wise, (since equally things happen to
both the righteous and the wicked), they perturb each single man, especially as
to why they should happen thus, and therefore do not think they are being
judged, while there will be a distinction between all things in the future when
they have been done, yet now all things are confused. But he says: "there is one outcome for
the just and the unjust", he means either the outcome of hardships or of
death, and therefore they do not know the kingdom of God nor His hate. Those who bring sacrifice and those who do
not, and others in contrast who are not listed here must be seen in a spiritual
understanding, according to that verse which says, "sacrifice to God with
a troubled spirit"[^202]. 


<b>9:3-4. <i>This is
an evil about all things that are done under the sun: that the same fate awaits
all Therefore the heart of man is full of evil; and madness is in their heart
while they live; and after that, they go to the dead. </i></b>Symmachus interprets this in his usual
clearer way, saying, "but even the heart of mankind is filled with
wickedness and impudence like their heart in life". But all of them succumb to death, for who is
able to continually live forever? The
Scripture has the same meaning regarding this. 
I said a little earlier, that when both good and bad things happen
equally to everyone, there is no difference between good and bad, for we are
taken from this life by indiscriminate death. 
Nonetheless we are filled with wrongdoings and impudence and wickedness,
and after all these trials in life we are suddenly taken by death and
afterwards we cannot consort with the living. 
Or indeed it could mean this: since the same difficulties afflict both
the just and the unjust, men are therefore provoked to commit sins. Then after he has tried all things, which are
done in vain, while he is unknowing, he descends to the world of the dead. <b><i>For
he who is attached to all living has hope, a live dog is better than a dead
lion.</i></b>


<b>9:5-6. <i>For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing at
all; there is no more reward for them, their memory is forgotten. Their love, their hate, their jealousy have
already perished- nor will they ever again have a share in whatever is done
beneath the sun. </i></b>Since he has said above that the heart of
man is filled with wickedness and impudence, and after all things, his life
comes to an end in death, then now he completes this by saying that he has
discovered that while men live, they are able to become righteous, but after
death are given no opportunity to do good work. 
For the sinner who lives can be better than the dead and righteous man,
if he wishes to convert to his virtues. 
Or indeed as for him, who threw himself into wickedness, power, and
impudence, then died: any poorest beggar is better than him. Why? Because
the living can carry out good work in the fear of death, but the dead can do
nothing to add to that which they took away from their life when they
died. And all things are forgotten, just
as it is written in the Psalm: "I have been given to forget, though dead
from my heart"[^203]. But even their enjoyment, hatred and
jealousy, and all that they were able to hold in their time, comes to an end
with their death; nor can they do anything now in their righteousness or sin,
or add to their virtues, or to their vices. 
Certain men though can argue against this explanation, asserting that we
can even grow after death, and equally decrease, and quoting that verse which
says, "and they will not share yet in all that is done under the
sun", and they understand it in this way, so that they say that they have
no communion in this world, and under this sun that we can see. But they say that they do have it in another
world<b>, </b>about which the Saviour says,
"I am not of this world"[^204],
and under the sun of justice, but I have not excluded this theory, which
contends that after we leave this earth, we are able to offend reasoning
creatures, and deserve what we get. My
Hebrew tutor thought differently of the verse, which says, "a living dog
is better than a dead lion". He explained
it in this way according to the beliefs of his people: an unlearned man is more
useful, he who still lives and can teach, than a trained teacher who is now
dead. Because of the text he understands
it to mean any one dog is better than many teachers, and the lion is Moses, or
any other prophet. But because I don't
like this explanation I prefer a better one; and Chananaea to whom it is said:
"your faith saves you"[^205],
we say he is a dog according to the Gospel. 
But a dead lion, for the people of circumcision is just the same as for
Balaam, the prophet, who says, "behold the people shall rise up as a great
lion, and shall lift up himself as a young lion"[^206]. Therefore we are a living dog amongst the
other nations; but the Jewish people which has been left by God, is a dead
lion. And that living dog is seen as
better in God's eyes than a dead lion. 
For we who are living know the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The dead though can know nothing, or await
any recompense and profit, since their memory is complete. They don't remember what they ought to know,
and God does not remember them. 
Enjoyment too, for which they often loved God, will die, and hatred as
well, about which they say boldly, "surely I hate those who hate You, O
Lord, and am I not grieved with those that rise up against You?"[^207]. And there does not exist their jealousy,
similar to the Phinees, and the knees of Matathia trembled.[^208] But it is very clear that a part of them is
not in that world, for they are not able to say, "my part is the
Lord".[^209] 


<b>9:7-8. <i>Go, eat
your bread with joy and drink your wine with a glad heart, for God has already
approved your deeds. Let your garments
always be white, and your head never lack oil. 
</i></b>Regarding the
passage until that verse where he says: 'like fish caught in a fatal net, like
birds seized in a snare, so are men caught in the moment of disaster when it
falls upon them suddenly'.[^210] Before I discuss them individually, it will
be useful to link them together, so that it can be seen how all pertain to the
same meaning. Because in a preceding
chapter he had said that after men have died they are cut off from the heart of
the living, and no one loves or hates them, as according to the poet, who says,
"there is no struggle from the dead, who lack breath"[^211]. And because they can do no more under the
sun, now he introduces the idea of human madness and habit, whereby men of this
world encourage themselves in turn to enjoy good things; and <i>prosopopoiian</i>, using this in the manner
of rhetoricians and poets, saying: "O man, since there is nothing for you
after death, and death herself hears not my complaint, and while you live this
brief life, take pleasure in enjoyment, hold feasts, suppress your worries with
wine, and understand, since they are all given by God to be used by you. Wear white clothes, and let your head smell
of ointments, and whichever woman pleases you, enjoy her embrace, thus lead
this empty and vain life in empty and vain pleasure. For you will not have anything more than
this, which you enjoy. Whatever you
like, grasp quickly, lest it disappears. 
You shouldn't fear the vain things mentioned, for the reason for each
individual work, either good or bad, will be given to you in the world of the
dead. And there is no wisdom in death,
no sense of this life after passing away. 
He also says that Epicurus, Aristippus, and the philosophers of Cyrene[^212],
and other of the philosophical flock hold this belief. But I prefer my own ideas, and I do not find,
as some people think incorrectly, that everything happens by chance, and good
and bad fate plays on human lives. I
rather believe that everything happens by the order of God. For the fast runner should not think of his
running when he runs, nor a strong man have faith in his strength, or a wise
man think amassing great riches and wealth is prudent; the learned and
well-spoken should not be able to find himself amongst a flattering crowd
because of his eloquence and learning, but by attributing all things to be done
by God. And unless he has ruled all
things in his own judgement, and built his own home, then they worked in vain,
who built it. Except if he built a city,
those, who watch over it, will stay awake in vain. For it is not as they think it is, that there
is one outcome and uncertainty in this life, since they do not think so, who
are suddenly taken away by death and taken to their judgement. And just as fish are caught by a spear or in
nets, and birds are ensnared in a noose whilst they fly through the air
unknowing, in the same way men are led away to eternal prayer on account of
their merits, when sudden death comes and judges against them, who thought all
things in life happened by uncertainty. 
This is similar to that meaning by which we wanted to understand all
things in brief. Now he speaks not as if
from another person's mouth, but for himself, each phrase must be looked at on
its own: "Go, eat your bread with joy and drink your wine with a glad
heart, for God has already approved your deeds". Since you learned that all things end with
death, and that repentance is not in the world of the dead, and that there is
no recourse to virtues, while you are in that situation, then hasten, struggle,
repent, while you still have the time. 
For God acknowledges repentance freely. 
Another meaning could be, that simply understanding is of use, according
to that verse, which says, "whether therefore you eat, or drink, or
whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."[^213]<i> </i>And
in another place: drink wine with warning"[^214]. For he who uses up more than his means does
not have true happiness and a good heart. 
But it is better to think this: the works of this man pleased God,
nonetheless he had need of bread and wine, because he has been spurned from the
vineyard of Sorek. Therefore this
teaching has been given to us, as he says, "if you desire wisdom, then
keep the commandments and the Lord shall give it to you"[^215]. Let us then keep the commandments and we will
be able to find bread and wine for the spirit. 
But he who does not keep the commandments prides himself in the
abundance of his bread and wine, and Isaiah says to him, "do not even say,
I know it, you do not know, or recognise, and your ears have not heard from the
beginning, for I knew that you would deal very treacherously"[^216]. More precisely as it is said in the
interpretation given in the Septuagint: Come, eat your bread in happiness, this
is the word of Ecclesiastes, who even speaks in the Gospel: "If any man
thirst, let him come unto me, and drink."[^217]
And in Proverbs: "Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine. Let your clothes be white forever and may
your hair be oiled[^218]. He therefore says, have a clean body and be
merciful. Or in this way: 'let there not
be a time in which you do not have white clothes, beware lest you by accident
put on clothes that are not clean'. A
known sinner was once described to have enjoyed dirty clothes. But you should put on the light, not the
malediction, which was also written about Judah: "let a curse be worn like
clothes"[^219]. Wear by your skin mercy, kindness, humility,
mildness and patience. And when you have
been stripped, as an old man, of your work, take on new work, which is renewed
each day. He also says, "and let your
hair not lack oil", you must remember that this is the nature of ointment,
that it reflects light and reduces the work of tiredness. It is spiritual ointment, the ointment of
exultation, about which is written: "therefore God, your God, has anointed
you with the oil of gladness above your friends"[^220]. This oil must gladden our face. This oil must be put on the head of a faster,
for sinners cannot have it, about whom it is said, "they have not been
closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment"[^221]. But they have a different ointment, which the
righteous man abhors, saying, "the oil of a sinner will not stain my
head"[^222]. Heretics have this oil and wish to pour it
over the heads of their beguilers.


<b>9:9. <i>Enjoy
life with the wife you love through all the fleeting days of your life that He
has granted you under the sun, all of your futile existence; for that is your
compensation in life and in your toil which you exert under the sun. </i></b>Follow wisdom and knowledge of the Scriptures, while
you are joined in matrimony to your wife, as it is said in Proverbs: "love
her and she will serve you: embrace her and she will embrace you too"[^223]. But the day of vanity, the day of this world
means nothing. The apostle mentions this
too, and he says, "live life with the woman that you love", but this
is said in ambiguity, either live or contemplate life both you yourself and
your wife with you, for you will not be able to live life alone without such a
wife, or consider each one and live life, and consider the woman in the days of
your vanity. And he words this
carefully, so that we seek the true life with our wife and wisdom in the days
of our vanity. For this is our lot and
the fruit of our toil, if we, retired, are able to find this true life.


<b>9:10. <i>Whatever
you are able to do with your strength, do it. 
For there is neither doing, nor reckoning, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in
the grave where you are going. </i></b>Do whatever you are presently able to do,
and toil at it, because when you go down to the world of the dead there will be
no place for repentance. Similar to this
is what is taught by the Saviour: "work hard, while there is still day
left; for night will come, when none is able to work"[^224],
but he says this: "to the grave where you are going", remember too
that you believe Samuel was also in the grave, and before the advent of Christ,
all men were retained by the law of the dead, however holy they were. More precisely, the holy were retained after
the resurrection of the Lord in vain in the grave, and the apostle notes this,
remarking, "it is better to die and be with Christ"[^225]. But he is with Christ, so that he might not
be held back in the grave.


<b>9:11. <i>Once
more I saw under the sun that the race is not won by the swift; nor the battle
by the strong, nor does bread come to the wise, riches to the intelligent, nor
favour to the learned; but time and death will happen to them all. </i></b>He who is bound by manacles and by heavy lead chains is
oppressed: "for wickedness sits upon a talent of lead"[^226], and in the Psalm it says, "they
weigh on me like a heavy burden"[^227]. It is not talking about that race, about
which is said, "I took up the race, and I kept my faith"[^228]. But that man is swift and his spirit is not
weighed down, nonetheless even he is not able to arrive at the goal without God
helping him. But when there has been a
war against adverse leaders, about whom it is written, "make war
sacred"[^229],
even a strong man will not be able to win with his own strength. This is also true of the sons of man and the
wise who cannot have living bread for the spirit, except through encouraging
wisdom: "Come, eat my bread"[^230]. And since there are riches, about which the
apostle says, "riches come through good deeds"[^231],
and in another place, "you have been made rich in every utterance and
knowledge"[^232];
it must be understood that a wise man cannot amass these riches, unless he
receives them from God, who possesses them. 
In another place these riches are mentioned too: "redemption of the
spirit for man is his own riches"[^233]. However learned a man is, he will not be able
to find grace too, unless accompanied by wisdom and given by God. Paul also knows this: "I worked more
than all men," he says, "yet not I but the grace of God which was
with me". Then again he says, "His grace in me was not in
vain". And right to the end man
does not know when the time will come, when the unknown fate and end of all
things will come. This reading is
according to <i>anagoge</i>. But in order to explain this more easily, I
should mention that the epistle to the Romans agrees with this
verse: "So then it is not of him that wants, nor of him that runs,
but of God that shows mercy."[^234] He also says this: "there is no bread
for the wise", this example is proved every day for many people, who
although they are very wise, still do not have the necessary sustenance for
life. And: "there is no grace for
the knowledgeable". For you may see
in the Church that the ignorant and unskilled prosper. And this is both because they have nourished
their boldness, and followed the fluency of their tongue, while they do not
think about what they say, they think that they are wise and learned, and as if
they have the greatest favour of the populous, which delights and is brought
together more by more polished words. On
the other hand a learned man lies in obscurity and suffers persecution; and not
only does he not have grace in the people's eyes, but also fades away through
poverty and hunger. But these things
happen because all things occur by uncertainty, and there is no retribution of
merit in this world, but in the future.


<b>9:12.<i> For man does not even know his
time, like fish caught in a fatal net, like birds seized in a snare, so are men
caught in the moment of disaster when it falls upon them suddenly. </i></b>I have already said above, that while men are yet
unknowing, either disaster or death befalls them. More precisely we should look at this as
allegory, that the realm of the sky is similar to a net cast into the sea; and
on the other hand heretics have nets, in which they capture fish, leading to
their death. Their net though is affable
language, flattering speeches, feigned or forced fasting, poor clothes, and an
imitation of virtues. And if they begin
to argue about the divine and raise their face to the heavens to seek the
heights of God, then they cast a noose into the heavenly abodes. So just as fish and birds are seized of a
sudden by such a net, and by such a noose, so wickedness is increased many
times and the kindness of many fails; and the signs and portents are seen in
such a way as to entice even the chosen of God if possible. See too those men of the Church, who are
called the children of men, and are of modest faith, and who can be overcome
quickly. Note too, that the term <i>sons of men</i> is used throughout the whole
book, and the Hebrew has <i>sons of man</i>,
this is 'the sons of Adam'. And almost
all scripture is filled with this idiom that sees the sons of Adam as the sons
of all men.   


<b>9:13-15. <i>This,
too, I have observed about wisdom under the sun, and it affected me profoundly:
there was a small town with only a few inhabitants; and a mighty king came upon
it and surrounded it, and built great siege works over it. Present in the city was a poor wise man who
by his wisdom saved the town. Yet no one
remembered that poor man. </i></b>While some people say that all things are
uncertain, and that the righteous have no more than the wicked, I see even the
greatest wisdom in this verse, because it happens repeatedly that there is a
small township with only a few inhabitants, and it is surrounded by an army of
a very powerful enemy, and the people inside is killed by the siege and by
hunger. And suddenly and unexpectedly a
poor man is found, who has more wisdom than all the rich men, than all those
powerful and pompous men who are in danger, and who fear the siege. And he thinks, seeks and finds an answer as
to how the town might be saved from the oppressors. But O ungrateful oblivion of men, after they
were freed from bondage and released from captivity, and the freedom was given
back to the fatherland, no one remembers that wise old man, no one gives thanks
for their salvation, but all show honour to the rich, who were able to do
nothing to help when in time of danger. 
My Hebrew tutor interpreted this passage differently: the small town, he
says, is man, who even amongst learned men is called less clean. And the few men in the town, are the members
by which the man shields and covers himself. 
But when a great king comes against it, that is the devil, and he
searches for a place by which he might break through, and in the town is found
a poor and wise man, that is the calm thought of that man on the inside, and
that is what saves the town, which is surrounded and besieged by the enemy. And the man has been saved from danger, or
persecution, or disaster, or any other kind of adverse sin. But that man on the outside, who is the enemy
of the wise and poor man on the inside, he does not remember the poor man, nor
does he remember his promises, but yet enjoys his freedom. Differently: the small town and the few
inhabitants in it is the Church in comparison to the whole world. And the great king the devil often comes against
it, not because he is great, but because he thought to be great, and he surrounds
the Church with a siege or persecution, or with another kind of disaster. He finds in it a poor man who is wise, that
is our Lord Jesus Christ, who was made poor for us and is wisdom itself. And that poor man frees the town with his
wisdom. How many times do we see a
reclining lion in a trap with rich men, this is with the politicians and
leaders of our time, who come against the Church, but fail at the wisdom of
that poor man? And when this poor man
has won and the town is restored to peace, scarcely anyone remembers him,
scarcely any of his requests are heard, but giving in to all indulgence and
pleasure, the inhabitants seek riches that are not necessary.


<b>9:16. <i>So I
said: wisdom is better than might, although a poor man's wisdom is despised and
his words go unheeded. </i></b>Although no one remembers a poor wise man,
and everyone is happy, and admires power and riches; I however admire this
despised wisdom according to all of the interpretations given above, and the
words which none thinks worthy to be heard.


<b>9:17. <i>The
gentle words of the wise are heard above the shouts of a king over fools. </i></b>Whosoever you see in the Church declaiming and arousing
applause by whatever refinery or charm, he who shakes off his laughter and
incites the crowd to feigned happiness, know that this is a sign of
foolishness, equally of him who speaks, and of those who listen to him. For the words of the wise are heard in peace
and respectful silence. He who is
foolish and is powerful speaks to fools and cannot hear himself because of
either the noise of his own voice or that of the applauding crowd.


<b>9:18. <i>And
wisdom is better than weapons, but a single rogue can ruin a great deal of
good. </i></b>Now he also takes wisdom
in preference to strength and says that it is worth more in battle than
weapons. But if there is one fool,
however small and worthless, he will repeatedly destroy riches and great wealth
by his stupidity. But because the Hebrew
can also be read as: 'and he who sins once, will lose much goodness', much
righteousness will be lost in return and virtues will follow in turn, and he
who has one, has all[^235];
and he who sins at one time, leaves himself open to all vices[^236].

<h2>CHAPTER 10</h2>


<b>10:1. <i>Dead
flies putrefy the perfumer's oil; a little folly outweighs wisdom and
honour. </i></b>Here he gives an example to illustrate the idea
expressed above, in which he says that many good things can be outweighed by
one fool, since one evil mixed with good in this way will pollute the greater
part of it, just as flies if they die in oil, make it lose its colour and
smell. And since wisdom is often mixed
with cleverness and prudence has wickedness, he teaches that we must search out
wisdom alone, or that it be mixed with the innocence of doves. Let us then be prudent to the good, and
simple in the face of the wicked. And
this is the meaning: let the righteous man have little simplicity on account of
his having too much suffering, and while he keeps his retribution for God, he
seems foolish, and does wickedness at once in vindication under the guise of
prudence. Another meaning could be those
flies that according to Isaiah inhabit a part of the river of Egypt, and
destroy the sweetness of oil and according to one source leave the smell of
their uncleanness[^237]. The chief of these flies is called Beelzebub
of the demons, and is interpreted as either 'the idol of flies' or 'the man of
the flies', or 'he who has flies'[^238].


<b>10:2-3. <i>A wise
man's mind tends to his right; while a fool's mind tends to his left. Even on the road as the fool walks, he lacks
sense, and proclaims to all that he is a fool. 
</i></b>And in the
Gospel it is taught that a wise man's left does not know what his right is
doing. And when we are hit on the right
side of the face, we do not show the left cheek to he who hit us, but the other
one. For a wise man does not have a left
side in him, but is in fact completely the right side. And when the Saviour comes to judge us, the
lambs will stand on the right, and the goats on the left. It is written in the prophets that "the
Lord knows the ways to the right, which are wrong, and actually lead to the
left."[^239]. Therefore he who is wise always thinks about
the future, because it leads him to the right. 
But he who is foolish always thinks of the present, because it is set in
the left. What follows has also been
said by the philosopher poet, who says, "the right leads to the walls of
the lower world, this is our path to Elysium, but the left is for the
wicked. That gives out punishments and
sends people down to the nether regions"[^240]. Firmianus of our time in the famous work of
his Institute recalls the passage about left and right, and argues that this is
about virtues and about vices.[^241] And we shouldn't think that this is contrary
to that passage, which says, "do not go to the right, nor to the
left"[^242]. In the first passage the right is taken to
mean good; but in the second it is not just right but also the decline to the
right. We should not know more than we
need to know, since virtues are in the middle and all excess in a vice. In the following verse though he says,
"but on the path that the fool walks, his heart is in need", and he
says: "all is foolishness" or "all are fools". This is the meaning: A fool hopes that all
others sin as he himself sins, and judges all others by his own standards. Then Symmachus has interpreted it in this
way: but when the fool walks along the road, he supposes that all are stupid as
he is. But the Septuagint has another
meaning, which says, 'all things which he thinks are foolish, are the most
vain'. 


<b>10:4. <i>If the
anger of a ruler flares up against you, do not leave your place, for defence
appeases great offences. </i></b>Now the Scripture mentions the chief of that
world, the creator of the darkness and he who toils for the sons of despair,
whom the apostle also recalls.[^243] For if he rises in our heart and the spirit
of bad thoughts is wounded, we ought not to give way, but fight against the
worst thoughts and free ourselves from the greatest sins, so that we do not
fill our work with that thought, since it is one thing in thought, another in
the deed of sinning. Reference to this
great sin can also be found in the Psalm: "if they had not conquered me, I
would be clean and purified from the greatest crime"[^244]. Symmachus translates the Hebrew word <i>marphe </i>as all the others do: <i>iama</i>, that is, 'cleanliness' or
'neatness'. He has interpreted the
meaning too, and he says, "if the spirit of a ruler defeats you, do not
move from your place; since virtue wins over the greatest sin". That is, if the devil entices your mind and
incites you to lust, do not follow the thought of sin and flattering desire,
but stand firm and fast and extinguish the flame of desire with the cold of
chastity. My Hebrew tutor suspected
certain things about this passage for a reason I do not know. If you take any high-up position in the
world, or are appointed a post higher than the other people, do not let go of
your former works and start to forget your former virtues, or cease from your
previous work, because the cure for sins is born out of doing good things, and
not from pompous and overflowing rank. 


<b>10:5-7. <i>There
is an evil that I have observed in the world as if it were an error proceeding
from the ruler: folly is placed on lofty heights, while rich men sit in low
places. I have seen slaves on horses and
nobles walking on foot like slaves. </i></b>Where we read "as if it were an error
proceeding from the ruler" Aquila, Theodotion and the Septuagint have
interpreted this as "as if not of their own will", that is <i>hos akousian</i>, from the face of the
ruler. Symmachus agrees with this,
saying, "the fool is placed in great elevation, but humble riches remain
fixed." And he remembers that he has
seen this wickedness in this time, because the judgement of God seems to be
unjust. And it happens either through
not knowing, or without his will, that either in the rulers of the world, or in
the leadership of the Church, often these men, who are rich in words and
wisdom, rich too in good deeds, remain ignoble and foolish holding a position
in the Church. But this happens in front
of his face, he who has power in that time, while he oppresses the powerful and
learned men, and he does not let them come out in public, but those whom he
knows to be foolish in the Church he makes greater, so that the blind are led
by the blind into pitfalls. The
following verse also has this meaning: "I have seen slaves on horses and
nobles walking on foot like slaves". 
Because these men are slaves of vices and sins, or are so humble, that
they are thought to be slaves by other men, they are suddenly inflated by the
devil's pompousness, and they wear out the public roads with their ponies[^245]. And each noble or wise man that is oppressed
by poverty takes the road and occupation of slaves. The Hebrew seems to say that ignorance seems
to leave the face of the powerful and rulers. 
He explains this as God, because men think that in this inequality of
matter He is not acting justly, and judging as is correct. More precisely, some men believe as their
predecessors do that there must be judgement so that He himself is powerful, a
topic that is mentioned before these verses: if a ruler comes up against you,
do not give way. Should we not be sad
therefore if we seem to be humble in this world, and know from the face of the
devil, that the foolish are raised and the rich thrown down? If we know that
slaves have the ranks of their masters and rulers do the work of their
slaves. Remember though that this horse
is seen in a good context, just as in the verse, which says, "and riding
will be your salvation".[^246] 


<b>10:8. <i>He who
digs a pit will fall into it, and he who breaks down a wall will be bitten by a
snake. </i></b>This is partly unambiguous and partly to be understood in
a more complicated way. Since elsewhere
Solomon also says, "he that sets a trap will be caught in it"[^247]. And in the seventh Psalm: "he laid out a
pond and dug it out, and then he fell into the hole he had made"[^248]. But the wall and the fence as well are the
doctrines of the Church, and the institution set up by the apostles and
prophets. And whoever knocks them down
or wants them to come to an end is bitten by a snake where he is not looking. Amos writes about this snake: "if he
goes down into the underworld, I will order a snake to kill him"[^249].


<b>10:9. <i>He who
moves about stones will be hurt by them; he who splits logs will be endangered
by them. </i></b>In Zechariah sacred stones are moved about
the earth.[^250] For they do not stay firm in their place, but
revolve, and always inclining to other places, they hasten to move away. The Saviour also teaches about these living
stones in the city of the Apocalypse[^251],
and the apostle doesn't forget to mention the building of the Church. Therefore if anyone doing wrong by their
heresy, should take away those stones from the building of the Church, then he
will suffer torture afterwards. Aquila
and Symmachus write about this man, and where we have 'he who moves about stones,
will suffer from them', both write, "he who moves stones, will be wounded
by them". But because the Scripture
says very clearly, "he who moves about stones", or 'moves stones', he
does not add 'good' or 'bad'. Moreover
and to the contrary it must be understood, that the man of the Church seemingly
a bishop and elder, (if we are taking this according to the mandate of
Leviticus), took a stone away from the house of lepers, and was obliterated in
dust and ashes.[^252] And he will suffer for this himself, because
he was forced to take away a stone from the Church of Christ and saying,
(according to the apostle), "to weep with the weeping, to mourn with the
mourners"[^253],
and "who is weak, and I burn not?"[^254]. Also cutting wood, he will be endangered by
it. Heretics are non-fruit-bearing wood,
and copse that do not bear fruit. 
Pertaining to this too is that we must not plant a glade in the house of
God, and leafy openings, that is arbours of such sounding words are scorned. However learned and wise a man may be
therefore who chops this wood with the sword of speech, he will be endangered
by it, unless he diligently pays attention. 
This is similar to what follows, this will happen, "if iron is
shaped" and its appearance is changed. 
This means that if his argument is found to be weaker, or if he does not
have a point, in which each argument is well balanced, then the argument of his
heart is blunt. Then the strength of
wickedness will come upon him and fortify him. 
For this is what the Septuagint interprets this passage to mean: it
says, "and he is fortified by strength, and he will begin to have more
wisdom than strength; his wisdom will become strong, and superfluous, but it
will not help him who possesses it.


<b>10:10. <i>If a
blade is blunt and one has not sharpened the edge, nevertheless it strengthens
the warriors. Wisdom is a more powerful
skill. </i></b>If someone, he says, has seen himself lose knowledge of
the Scriptures through negligence, and the shrewdness of his intelligence has
been blunted, nonetheless he remains disturbed, and he would be just as he had
been when he started. But it happens,
meanwhile, that he that has a little knowledge is led into pride and stops
learning and reading, and little by little takes away from that which now adds
nothing to him. Thus the heart of the
pupil remains empty, and a blade that has been sharpened is made blunt. For rest and laziness are like a kind of rust
of wisdom. So then if anyone has
suffered this, let him not despair the remedy for his health, but let him go to
his teacher and be instructed again by him, and then after much toil and hard
work, and a great deal of much sweat, he will be able to regain that wisdom
that he had lost. And this is what is
said in the Hebrew more to the point: he will be strengthened by might, that
is, by toil, by sweat, by hard work, and daily reading, then wisdom will follow
suit, and his toil will come to an end, so that he might be able to receive
wisdom once more.


<b>10:11. <i>If the
snake bites because it has not been charmed, then there is no advantage to the
charmer's art. </i></b>The meaning of this is very apparent: the
serpent and the disparager are of the same ilk. 
For just as the hidden snake bites and injects its poison, so too the
other disparages in private, and he pours out the poison of his heart against
his brother, and there will be nothing between him and the serpent. For although the tongue of man was created
for benediction and encouragement of others, the disparager makes it equal to
that of the serpent, while he uses his virtues to bad purposes. Another meaning of this is, that if the
serpent devil should bite anyone secretly, and he doesn't know it, he infects
him with the poison of sin; and if he who has been struck keeps silent, and
does not repent, and does not want to confess his wound to his teacher and
brother, they who want to encourage him and see to it that he gets better, are
not able to be of any use to him. For if
an ill man is ashamed to confess his wound to a doctor, the doctor will not be
able to cure what he does not know exists. 



<b>10:12. <i>The
words of a wise man win favour, but a fool's lips devour him. </i></b>Foolishness, if it is happy in its rusticity, will know
less evil. But now he wages war against
wisdom, and whatever prudence he sees in a learned man, he does not take to be
incited by enthusiasm. For a wise man
speaks words of knowledge, words of thanks, which are of use to those that hear
them, but the lips of a fool do not receive what is said, as it is said; on the
contrary they try to trip up a wise man and make him similar to a fool. And in fact a wise man is taught when a
foolish man speaks in his ear, and you could almost say that his words are lost
in the deep swell. Therefore he is
blessed, who speaks in the ear of a wise man. 



<b>10:13-14. <i>His
talk begins as foolishness and ends as evil madness. The fool prates on and on, but man does not
know what will be; and who can tell him what will be after him? </i></b>So far the discussion has been about the fool, whose
lips teach the wise man, or according to another interpretation, his lips make
himself corrupt. The beginning and the
end of his speech are foolishness and evil madness; or as Symmachus has
translated it, confusion, or some kind of inconsistency of words. For while he doesn't keep to the one opinion,
he thinks he can escape sin in the many arguments he speaks at the same
time. But he does not remember all those
who have gone before him, and does not know what will happen after him, and so
is confused in ignorance and the darkness, promising himself false knowledge;
by this he thinks that he is wise, and that he is learned, if he uses lots of
words. This can be taken to refer to the
heretics, who do not heed the words of wise men, but continue to argue
different sides so they intertwine the beginning and end of their speech in
vanity, confusion, and madness; and though they know nothing, they speak more
than they know. 


<b>10:15. <i>The
toil of fools exhausts them, as one who does not know the way to town.  </i></b>Join these lines with the verse above; either to those
verses that speak in general about fools, who know not God, or in particular to
that one which argues about heretics. 
Read in Plato for example: unravel the tricks of Aristotle, read Zeno
and Carneas more diligently, and you will prove to be true what is written
here: the toil of fools exhausts them. 
For they seek the truth in fact with all their enthusiasm, but since
they have no leader or anyone to lead the way on their journey, they are led by
their human instincts to think that they can understand wisdom, and thus they
do not arrive at the town; the Psalm speaks of this too: "Lord, you will
scatter their image in your town"[^255]. For the Lord will scatter in the town all
shadows and strange appearances or characters, in which they clothe themselves
in their many doctrines. In another
place the Psalm says of this: "the force of a river causes the city of God
to rejoice"[^256]. And in the Gospel: "a town built on a
mountain cannot be hidden"[^257]. And in Isaiah: "I am a strong city, a
city which is attacked"[^258]. And all the wise men and heretics of this
world are trying to attack this city of truth and wisdom, although it is strong
and fortified. And that which I have
said about philosophers can also be said of heretics, that they toil in vain,
and are exhausted in their enthusiasm for the Scriptures, when they wander in
the desert and are not able to find the town. 
The Psalmist also mentions their madness too, saying, "they
wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell
in."[^259] 


<b>10:16-17. <i>Woe to
you, O land, whose king acts as an adolescent, and whose ministers dine in the
morning. Happy are you, O land, whose
king is a man of dignity, and whose ministers dine at the proper time- in
strength and not in drunkenness. </i></b>He seems in fact here to reprove the young
king and to condemn indulgent judges, which in another place has been called
wisdom that is weakened by age, and even in other places mature age which is
made frail by pleasure.  On the other
hand he seems to approve the king with good morals, who is appointed
easily. He also seems to praise those
judges who nonetheless prefer pleasure to the business of the town, but after
much toil and the running of the township, are forced to eat as if by
necessity. But I find more holy what
seems to lie hidden in the text, because those who depart from old laws and
despise the precepts of their ageing fathers, are called young men in the
scripture; they who do not heed the commandments of God, and desire to change
the laws of mankind. The Lord of Israel
threatens in Isaiah[^260],
because the people did not want the waters of Shiloah that flows in silence,
and averted the ancient stream, choosing for themselves the rivers of Samaria,
and the surges of Damascus. "And I
will give", he says, "children to be their princes, and babes shall
rule over them"[^261]. Read also Daniel and you will find the old
God of Days.[^262] Or read the Apocalypse of John where the head
of the Saviour is said to be white and snowy, and you will find it to be like
white wool. Look at Jeremiah too because
he was wise and his hair was purported to be white because of his wisdom, and
he is forbidden to call himself a young man[^263]. Woe to the land therefore whose king is the
devil, who always desirous of new things, and even rebels against its parent in
the case of Abessalon, who regards as judges and leaders those, who love the
pleasures of the world, and who say before the day of death comes, "let us
eat and drink, for tomorrow we die"[^264]. For the other part is the blessed land of the
Church whose king, Christ, is the son of all peoples. He is descended from Abraham and Isaac, and
Jacob, also from the stock of all the prophets and saints, for whom sin was not
conquered. On account of this they were
indeed children. Born of these was the
virgin, more freely Saint Mary, who had no offspring, no seed from her flank,
but all of her fruit burst out in flower, speaking in the Song of Songs:
"I am the flower of the field and the lily of the valley"[^265]. His leaders too are apostles and all are
saintly, who see their king as the son of all men, the son of a free woman; not
of the slave woman Agar, but born of Sara in freedom. And they do not eat in the morning, or
quickly. For they do not seek enjoyment
in their time, but eat in their time, and when the time for retribution will
come, they will eat in strength, and not in disorder. Every good thing of this world is a disorder,
but an everlasting strength in the future. 
Just this is said in Isaiah: "look at those who serve me, they will
eat; but you will go hungry."[^266] And again, "look at those who serve me,
they will be happy; but you will shamed."[^267]


<b>10:18. <i>Through
slothfulness the ceiling sags, and through idleness of the hands the house leaks.</i></b> Our
house, which is held up by the condition of mankind, even that abode that we
have in heaven, sags if we are lazy and slow to do good work. And every ceiling, which is supposed to hold
the roof up high, falls to the ground and crushes its inhabitants. And when the help of hands and virtues has
eventually gone numb a great storm of all tempests and rain clouds will fall
down upon us from above. More precisely,
although we have interpreted this with regard to one man, it can be better
understood with bearing to the Church, because its stature is brought down by
the neglect of its principate. There in
the Church we find the attractions of sins, where the roof is said to be
virtue.


<b>10:19. <i>A feast
is made for laughter, and wine gladdens life, but money answers
everything. </i></b>I think that what follows relates to the
preceding verses. For with regard to the
sloth and the indolence of teachers the Church is lowered, and its roof is made
to fall, and its timbers leak, as we have shown above. Therefore here he is speaking of the
self-same teachers. And he has been seen
to accuse them, asking why they remain silent and do not make use of their duty
as teacher, (that is both for bishops and elders in the Church), saying that
they neither work on their speaking nor doctrine, the same that even Titus
admonishes[^268],
and is taught by Timothy[^269],
so that one does not forget the grace of God, which is bestowed upon a great
man. But in this respect they see
themselves as elders and bishops, so that they receive an allowance, and many
teachers ask for a two-fold glory, which is owed in fact to those who work on
their speaking and doctrines. But now he
takes the other side and accuses those who even speak in the Church and teach
the congregation, but they teach the people that which they like to hear,
because he flatters the sinner in his crime and incites the listeners to
applaud. For surely when such a teacher
is giving a lascivious speech in the Church, does he not promise the blessing
and realm of heaven to the crowd, as it will seem to you that his laughter
makes bread, and he mixes wine with the happiness of those who drink? Or as those who teach and seek riches, food,
and wealth through the promised delights. 
Or the bread of the Church, which is the bread of mourners, and not of
those who laugh, because those who weep are blessed, for they will laugh, and
will have joy in their happiness. He
also goes on to say: money or silver answers everything, and this must be taken
as two-fold: either that those learned men become rich after their praise, and
take their place at the head of the people, or indeed, since money is always
taken in return for a speech: for "the words of the LORD are pure words:
as silver extracted in a furnace of earth, purified seven times."[^270] He asserts this because the ignoble crowd is
always moved easily by eloquence and speeches, which are composed of a great
foliage of words. Differently: those
who have free-will and are forbidden to mourn and fast, make bread in their
laughter. Isaac gets his name from this
bread as well, and in the happiness of drinking they prepare wine. And so every holy man, who is teacher of the
Church, as Christ commanded, makes bread in his laughter and happiness, and hands
out cups of wine in his joy. Money also,
which answers everything, is given out as five, and two and one talent for the
head of the family in the Gospel[^271]. And ten coins which are thought to be for
slaves in business.


<b>10:20. <i>Even in
your thoughts do not curse a king, and in your bed-chamber do not curse the
rich, for a bird of the skies may carry the sound, and some winged creature may
betray the matter. </i></b>This simple example teaches the listeners
that we should not be overpowered by anger and fury, and curse and blame kings
and leaders, since it seems to happen against one's wish, that what we curse is
made known. And we run into danger by
the inability to hold our tongue. He
also says, "a bird of the skies may carry the sound, and some winged
creature may betray the matter", this is to be understood as a
exaggeration, just as we are accustomed to saying, 'walls have ears to hear
those things, which we think are said in private'. But it is better to hear a teaching in this
way, so that we know that we have a commandment to follow, not only that
nothing should be spoken rashly against Christ, but also in the secret places
of our heart, however we are troubled by our many problems, nothing should be
blasphemed, nothing thought which is impious. 
And since we owe love, that we have for Christ, the next part says,
"love the Lord your God," and even " your nearest" and
"yourself".[^272] He even orders this, so that afterwards we do
not easily take the king away from the holy, and so that we do not slander by
the wickedness of our tongue those who are rich in knowledge, wisdom and
virtues, for they are the angels who fly around the earth and are
administrators of the spirit. They say
in Zechariah, "we have traversed the earth and look all the world is inhabited
and quiet"[^273]. And just like birds, our words and thoughts
are carried to heaven. And whatever we
think in secret, is not hidden from God's knowledge.

<h2>CHAPTER 11</h2>


<b>11:1. <i>Send
your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it.</i></b> He
encourages to mercy since it must be given to all that seek wisdom, and work
well. For just as he sows over the
well-watered fields and awaits the produce of his seed, so too he who is
generous to the needy does not sow the grain of his seed, but bread itself. And he waits for it to grow into his future
profit; and when the day of judgement comes much more will be found to have
grown than was at first sown. 
Differently: in each and every man you can see this water, about which
is said, "rivers flow from his stomach, the waters of life"[^274],
lest it should trouble you to display the bread of life, the bread of
reasoning, and of speech. For if you do
this many times you will find that you have not sown the seeds of doctrine in
vain. I think that this is what is
written in Isaiah too: "blessed is he who sows across the water, where the
ox and ass trample"[^275]. This is also because that teacher (about whom
we have already spoken), is held to be worthy of blessing, because he sows
across the well-watered hearts of his listeners, the hearts of the Jews, as
those of the gentiles in the gathered congregation. 


<b>11:2.  <i>Give a portion to seven, and also to eight;
for you do not know what evil shall be upon the earth. </i></b>And in Ezekiel there are found seven or eight steps
leading up to the temple.[^276] And after the 'ethical' Psalm, that is one
hundred and eighteen, all the psalms are of fifteen steps by which we are first
taught the law, and when the seventh is finished, we then climb to the Gospel
through the 'eight steps'[^277]. Therefore it is taught that we should believe
with equal respect in each, the same for the old as for the new. The Jews dedicated their seventh part,
believing in the Sabbath, but did not dedicate that eighth, denying the
resurrection on the day of the Lord. On
the other hand, heretics, Marcion and Manichaeus and all who rip up the ancient
law with their savage mouths, dedicate their eighth part, taking up the
Gospel. But they do not save as holy the
seventh, spurning the old law. For we
are not able to understand the worthy crucifixions, the worthy punishments
already in mind, which are reserved for those who are moved to wickedness on
earth, that is for the Jews and the heretics, and for those denying the other
of the two. The Hebrews understand this
passage in this way: keep both the Sabbath and the rite of circumcision, for if
you do not adhere to these wickedness will come over you unexpectedly. <b><i> </i></b>


<b>11:3.  <i>If the clouds are full of rain, they empty
themselves upon the earth: and if the tree falls toward the south, or toward
the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it shall be. </i></b>Keep the commandments that have been taught to you
above so that the clouds above you will break open in rain. For wherever you have made your home and seat
for the future, whether to the east or facing the north, when you die you will
remain there. Differently: as I have
said above 'send your bread over the water and divide it to all who ask'. Since when the clouds are full they pour
their riches down on mortals, and you are as a tree: however aged you may be,
you will not live forever, but one day suddenly struck by the storm of death
like a storm of winds, there where you fall you will lie forever. The time of your end will come whether you
may be stiff and savage, or mild and merciful. 
Differently: God is addressed in the Psalms: "you are truth up to
the clouds"[^278],
and in Isaiah God warns the sinner of the vineyard, "I will command the
clouds not to rain down"[^279]. Therefore the clouds are as prophets or holy
men, who have amassed many talents in their mind, so that he can rain his
teachings of doctrine down on others and say, "their speech should be
awaited just as rain, and they will pour out rain across the earth"[^280],
to which is replied, "let the earth hear the words of my mouth"[^281]. But this follows: "and if a tree falls
to the east, or to the north, in the place where it falls, there it will
remain." We can take the example of
the book of Hebrews, in which is written, "God will come to Teyma"[^282],
which some interpreters have taken to mean that God will come from the south,
and when I come to think about it the south is always used in a good
context. This can be seen in Song of
Songs: "arise oh north" that is 'return' and 'go away'; "and
come O south wind"[^283]. Therefore a tree, if in this life it falls
and is cut in its state of mortality, either must sin before while it stands
and is then placed in the north afterwards, or if the south winds takes away
all its worthy fruit, it will lie wounded in the south. The text does not mean any tree, but only if
it lies to the north or south. This
means the same as that which is written: "I will say to the north wind,
come, and to the south wind, do not hold back"[^284]. Nowhere teaches about the south wind and the
east wind together, saying that they blow, since it is fitting for them to be
among those regions, because they are blown afterwards to the south and
east. Therefore it blows from the north
to the south and the south wind blows its inhabitants to the east. And they are not able to blow out if they
remain in their ancient palaces.   


<b>11:4.  <i>He that observes the wind shall not sow; and
he that regards the clouds shall not reap. 
</i></b>He who considers
what is good for him and does not give out to all who ask him, often destroys
what he ought to receive.[^285] Differently: he who proclaims the word of God
at the time when the people listen freely and a second wind of rumour comes, he
is a negligent and lazy farmer. But
favourably or not in his career he must proclaim the word of God[^286];
and he must not think of the storm of adverse clouds in his time of faith. This is written in Proverbs: "just as
the rains are heavy and unyielding, so are they who leave wisdom and praise
impiety"[^287]. Therefore you must sow your seeds in the
middle of a storm without thinking of the clouds and without fearing the
winds. And you must not say, 'that time
was convenient, this of no use', when we do not know which way and which will
is the one spirit of giving.   


<b>11:5.  <i>As you do not know what is the way of the
spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even
so you know not the works of God who makes all. 
</i></b>Just as you do
not know the way of the spirit and of the soul entering a child, and are
unknowing of the types of bone and veins in the stomach of a pregnant
woman. It is hard to know how the human
body is formed from the simplest elements into the many varied forms and limbs,
and from the very same seed, one makes soft our hair, another makes our bones
hard; one connects the veins, another links the nerves together. Thus you cannot know the work of God, who has
made all things. From this he teaches
that the variety of things in the world must not be feared, and you must not
fear the winds and the clouds, which as we have mentioned above must be
judged. But although the sower ought to
reap in the course of his career, he ought to save the outcome for the
judgement of the Lord. <b><i> </i></b>


<b>11:6-8.  <i>In the morning sow your seed, and in the
evening withhold not your hand: for you know not whether shall prosper, either
this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant
thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun: 
But if a man lives many years, and rejoices in them all; yet let him
remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that which comes is
vanity. </i></b>Do not choose which good deeds you do, but once you
have started doing good, never stop. The
evening will reveal the justice of the morning, and the sunrise will collect
the mercy of the evening. For it is
uncertain which work pleases God more, and by what means you will obtain the
fruit of righteousness. But it can
happen that not one but each one will please God. Another meaning could be that both in
childhood and in old-age you will have equal work. Do not say therefore, "I worked while I
was able, I ought to rest in old-age", for you do not know whether you
please God more in youth or in age. And
the thrift of youth too is of no use if old-age is taken up by indulgence. For the righteous has erred, not even his
former virtues can free him from death. 
And if you always do well according to each interpretation and work
equal amounts in each age, you will see God the Father, the sweetest light; you
will see Christ, the sun of righteousness. 
More precisely if you live for many years and always have good things or
do good deeds, you will still know that you are going to die, and the coming of
darkness will continually surround you: you will despise the present things as
if they were transient, frail and failing. 
Symmachus has interpreted the end of this idea in this way: if a man
lives for many years and if he has been happy in all this he ought to remember
the days of darkness, since they will be many, in which all will cease. Differently: in another place in the
Scripture God promises, saying, "I will give you timely rain and rain that
is late"[^288]. I will irrigate you with rain: the Old and
the New Testament. He warns about this
here so that we may read about the ancient law, lest we hate the Gospel, and in
this way ask about the spiritual understanding in the old text; lest we think
that what we read in the Gospels and apostles is only to be taken at face
value. For we do not know when more
knowledge and grace is divested to us by God, and he who is happy, who joined
both together to make it like one. For
he who has followed this will see the light, will see Christ, the light of justice. And if he lives for several years and with
knowledge of the Scriptures he will know the greatest happiness and enjoyment,
and he is forced more to this toil by the memory of his future judgement. Since the time of eternal darkness will come,
and perpetual punishments will be in stone for those who have not sown in the
morning and in the evening, and joined both in vain; they have not seen the
light or the sun, whence the light itself comes.      


<b>11:9-10.  <i>Rejoice, O young man, in your youth; and let
your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your
heart, and in the sight of your eyes: but know, that for all these things God
will bring you into judgement. Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put
away evil from your flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity. </i></b>

<h2>CHAPTER 12</h2>


<b>12:1.  <i>Remember now your Creator in the days of
your youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when you
shall say, I have no pleasure in them; </i></b>In this chapter there were many explanations
of all things and almost as many opinions as men themselves. It would take too long however to recount all
the opinions of everyone and their arguments in which they want to prove their
opinions, the matter would require a volume to itself. But it is enough for wise men to have shown
what they feel, and like in a small picture, to have depicted the thirst of the
earth, the waste of the whole earth, and the belt of the ocean, and to have
shown them in such a small collection. 
The Hebrews believe the imperative here refers to Israel, to whom it is
taught that she should enjoy her riches, and before the time of bondage comes
should change youth to old-age. She should enjoy whatever is pleasant or fun,
just as it seems to the heart so it seems to the eyes; at that time while she
still has them to hand. She knows
however that she will be judged in all things that she has done. And just as from bad thoughts she flees from
desires, knowing that foolishness is joined to youth, and will remember always
her Creator, and before the days of Babylonian and Roman captivity come, in
which she will no longer be free. And
all of this passage from the point which says, "before the sun, moon, and
stars become dark"[^289],
until the place where the Scripture reminds us, "and dust will be swirled
on earth just as it used to be and the soul returned to God who gave it"[^290],
they explain their condition. And since
as I have said above these things are tiresome and favourable, they should be
touched by us but briefly and superficially. 
Therefore enjoy your youth O Israel, and do this or that, that has
already been mentioned before your time of bondage comes; and your glory will
leave you and pride, and judges, and your holy men who want to be interpreted
as the sun, moon, and stars, and are taken away. Before Nebuchadnezzar comes, or Titus,
Vespasian's son, before the call of the prophets and their prophecies are
fulfilled. In that day when the angels
that protect the temple leave, and the strongest men in your army are thrown in
confusion, and the speeches of the judges will be slow to come, and the
prophets, who are accustomed to receiving the light of their visions from
heaven, they all will become dark. When
the doors of the temple are closed Jerusalem will be made humble and the
Chaldeans will come as if by the song of a bird, called thus in the words of
Jeremiah, and the singing girls with the lute in the temple choir will become
silent[^291]. At that time, when they will come to
Jerusalem, the enemies too will fear the greatness of God, and in the way of
doubt, they will fear the death of Sennacherib. 
For they also believe the saying, "and from up high they will fear
and tremble in the road"[^292]. In those days "the almond tree will
flourish", that stick and staff which Jeremiah saw in his prophecy in the
beginning, "and the grasshopper will be a burden"[^293]. Nebuchadnezzar with his army, "and
desire shall fail ", the friendship between Israel and God. But what desire wants for itself, although we
have begun to speak about them individually will be explained more fully. But all this will happen to Israel, because
man will go out into the house of his eternity, and having returned from the
protection of God to the heavens, going to his tabernacle, the weeping and
crying will wander in the street and will be hemmed in by the enemy's
siege. Be happy therefore Israel in your
youth, before the silver cord is broken, (this is until your glory is with
you), before the golden ribbon breaks off, (that is before the arc of the
tabernacle is taken away); before the pitcher is worn away to the fountain, and
the wheel is turned around over the pool. 
That is until you read the most sacred teachings, for the spirit of a
holy man is grace, and before you return to Babylon, from whence you left the
loins of Abraham, and you will begin to be worn away in Mesopotamia, which once
breathed life into you, and all is returned to He who gave it. The Jews have always taught these things and
have understood this chapter to pertain to themselves. But I prefer to return to the previous argument,
and try to explain each thing individually: "rejoice O youth, in your
adolescence, and let your heart be good in the days of your youth, and walk in
the way of your heart and in the sight of your eyes; and know above all these
things, since God will lead you into judgement". He has said that the light of this world is
the sweetest and that man ought to rejoice in the days of his life, and grasp
desire with all enthusiasm. For the
eternal night of death will fall when it's not permitted to enjoy ones amassed
wealth and like a shadow, all things that we possess, will die. Now therefore he encourages man and says,
"O youth, before old-age and death fall upon you, enjoy your youth, and
whatever you feel is good, and seems joyful to see, take it and enjoy as it
please you the things of this world." 
Again so that he does not think these things say to provoke men to
indulgence, and thus fall into the doctrines of Epicurus, he takes this
suspicion, saying, "and know, since above all these God will lead you to
judgement". Thus, he says, take
advantage of the things of the world, so that you know you will be judged in
the end. "And force anger from your
heart and take wickedness from your flesh, since youth and foolishness are
vanity". In anger he sees all the
problems of the spirit. In the
wickedness of the flesh he sees every desire of the body. In this way therefore, he says, enjoy the
goodness of this world, lest you leave pleasure or flesh. Leave off your former vices, which you did in
your youth of vanity and foolishness, since youth is joined to
foolishness. "And remember in the
day of your youth Him, who created you, before the days of wickedness come and
the years approach, in which you will say, 'I have no will'". Always remember your Creator and walk the
route of your youth, so that you remember your end is death, before your time
comes, in which sad things will happen.


<b>12:2.  <i>While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or
the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain. </i></b>If we take this from the creation of the world, this
chapter agrees with the words of the Lord, in which He says, "there will
be trouble and difficulty as there has not been since the beginning of
creation, but this will not happen. For
the sun will grow dark and the moon will not shed light, and the stars will
fall from the sky, and the virtues of heaven will be moved"[^294]. Those things are the guardians of the house,
as we understand the 'house' to be this world, and the strong men, deceived by
wickedness and varied strengths must be dispersed. But if a particular consummation of any one
person is kept to the end of his life, then the sun, the moon, and stars,
clouds and rain will cease to be for him, who has died. Differently: enjoy youth, O Christian people,
and enjoy the goodness which has been given to you by God, and know that God
will judge you for all these. Do not
think that, since the earlier branches have been broken, you will be placed in
the root of a good olive tree, and therefore you will be without worry. But remove anger from your heart and desires
from your body, and when you have left all other vices remember your Creator
before the day of wickedness comes, the day of madness, in which punishments
have been made for sinners. This is so
that when you sin the sun of righteousness will set for you at midday, and the
light of knowledge will die, and the brightness of the moon, (that is of the
Church) will be taken away, and the stars will die, about which is written,
"in which you shine like the lights in the world having reason of
life"[^295]. And elsewhere: "star differs from star
in glory. Before the clouds return after
the rain"[^296],
lest the prophets, who have watered the hearts of believers by the rain of
their speech, after they have seen you to be unworthy of their rain, return to
their seat, clearly to Him from whom they were sent.


<b>12:3.<i>  In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the
strong men shall bow themselves; </i></b>The keepers of the house can be interpreted as either
the sun and the moon, and the remaining choir of stars, or the angels who keep
watch over this world. The men of great
strength though, or the brave, as Symmachus has interpreted it, are those who
die, or as Aquila has translated it, those who err, and are felt to be demons,
for they are called those chosen by the powerful devil. The Lord overpowered him, and joining him,
according to the parable of the Gospel[^297],
destroys his house. Differently: the
keepers of the house, who relate all things, which are written to the body of
man, think that it means ribs, because the intestines are hemmed in by them,
and all of the fleshy parts of the stomach are protected in this way. They think that the strong men are to be
interpreted as legs; the sun and moon and stars therefore pertain to the eyes,
nose and ears, and receive all the sensations of the head. But they do not interpret this to such an
extent, because they are forced deeper by necessity, not by demons, or the sun,
moon, or stars, but to understand what follows according to the limbs of man. <b><i>And
the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows
be darkened. </i></b>In the beginning of
the world when the charity of most was cold and the spirits of teachers were
few, who were able to offer the food of heaven to believers, and they were
carried to the heaves; then those who in part see the light of knowledge in
this world began to be darkened. For it
is said to Moses: "sit yourself in this hole in the rock, and you will see
me pass"[^298]. Oh how much more one spirit saw the truth
through that opening and those dark caves! 
Differently: there are two grinders, from whom one is taken, the other
is left, the Gospel is not silent in this matter[^299]. And when they are few, and have ceased, it is
necessary that every light of knowledge is removed from our eyes. Differently: they think the grinders have
ceased because they are few, and that it is talking about teeth. And when at last old-age comes even teeth are
worn away, or they fall out, which usually grind down food to be sent to the
stomach. But seeing it grow dark in the
caves, they think it means eyes because sight darkens with old-age, and sight
is made difficult.   


<b>12:4.  <i>And the doors shall be shut in the streets,
when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the
bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low. </i></b>When the voice of the grinder is weak and the teaching
of a tutor has stopped, then in turn all things will stop. Even the doors are closed in the streets, as
according to the unwieldy virgins of the Gospel[^300],
and each one regards her doors as closed to her in the street, so that she can
not buy oil. Or even, while the virgins
are wandering in the streets, husbands close each room when they have entered
into it. For if the road is thin and
narrow, which leads to life and that which leads to death is wide and open,
justly, the charity of most being cold, the door of teachings is closed in the
streets.[^301] But let us use the following verse, in which
he says, "and he rises to the sound of a bird", (or of a sparrow), if
we seem to be a sinner to the voice of the bishop or elder so to show that we
are in repentance. But this could also
be different again, if we do not follow the context of this chapter, it can be
taken to mean the real resurrection, when the death will rise up to the voice
of the arch-angel. And it is not
surprising, if we compare the trumpet of an angel to a sparrow, when all night
is compared to Christ, if it is clement. 
And also this is not too surprising, if my memory serves me right, when
I have never read of a sparrow in a bad light. 
In the tenth Psalm a righteous man says, "I trust in God, just as
you say to my spirit: fly to the mountain like a sparrow."[^302] And in another place: "I woke and I was
made as a sparrow alone on a roof"[^303]. Nor is it seen in a bad light in another
place: "and even the sparrow found a home for himself"[^304]. Differently: they want to see this as the
closed doors in the street, as the weak steps of an old man, because he always
sits and cannot walk. The weakness of
the voice of the grinder is interpreted as in his jaws, because he cannot chew
food, and scarcely reduced in spirit, his voice is heard only quietly. More precisely he shows him to rise to the
sound of a bird, because now with cold blood and dry organs by which sleep is
nourished, he wakes to a soft sound, and in the middle of the night, when the
cock crows, he rises quickly; but he is not able to move his limbs from his
bed. And he becomes silent too, or as it
is better put in the Hebrew, the daughters of song become deaf, (meaning ears),
because it is harder for old-men to hear noises and there is less distinction
between voices, or enjoy songs. Also
compare what Berzellai says to David, when he does not want to go to Jordan.[^305]<b><i> </i></b>


<b>12:5. <i>Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall
be in the way. </i></b>That is, they will not be able to enter on
difficult tasks and with tired knees and frightened footsteps, will not be able
to go out in the open, and will fear the offence of steps.<b><i> 
And the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a
burden, and desire shall fail: because man goes to his long home, and the
mourners go about the streets. </i></b>The
speech now explains the limbs of a man of the Church through a metaphor. And when old-age comes his hair will grow
white, his feet will swell, his lust will grow cold and he will be destroyed by
death. Then he will be returned to the
earth, and then in the house of his eternity you will remember his tomb and his
ashes with reverence, and a crowd will walk before the mourners at his
funeral. But the flower of the almond-tree,
which we have in place of grey hairs, some interpret as the sacred thorn,
because, while the flesh of the buttocks decreases, the thorn grows and
flowers. More precisely, in that verse
which says, "the grasshopper will be a burden", you must note that
where we have in our manuscripts 'grasshopper', the Hebrew has <i>aagab</i>, which is rather ambiguous for
us. For it can be translated as 'heel'
or as 'grasshopper'. Just as for example
in the beginning of Jeremiah, the word <i>soced</i>
if the accent is changed can mean 'a nut' or 'wakefulness'. And this is said to him: "what do you
see, Jeremiah?" and he replies, "a nut".[^306] And the Lord says to him, "you have seen
well, for I will wake over my work so that I might complete it."[^307] Or that explanation: it also has the
etymology of the word 'nut', because God is about to keep awake. And what the people has deserved it will be
given, is what the text seems to say. 
Thus now he shows the ambiguity of the word through its etymology,
showing that the legs of old men swell up and that gout weighs upon the organs. This does not happen to all men, but to most,
and this is <i>synecdoche</i> where a part
is called by the name of the whole. 
Indeed where we read 'desire' the Hebrew has <i>abiona. </i>This in itself has
many meanings, and is interpreted as 'love', 'lust', 'longing', or
'desire'. And it has the meaning, as I
have said above, that the lust of an old man grows cold, and the organs of
intercourse sag. But this is said
because these words are ambiguous, for although they mean 'almond-tree', and
'grasshopper', and 'desire' in his language, they also mean other derived words
in our language, and are derived from the forms which pertain to old-age. You must note too, that where the Septuagint
has the word 'almond-tree' the word itself is <i>soced</i>, which is found in the beginning of Jeremiah. But there it is meant 'nut' but here it means
'almond-tree'. Symmachus has
interpreted this passage in a greatly different way, (though I am unsure of what
he means): for he says, 'and they will see even above these things from on
high, and they will wander, and waking he will fall asleep, and the strength of
his spirit will be dispersed.' For man
will go to the house of his eternity, and the weeping will wander in the
street. Laodicenus[^308]
followed the interpretation of Symmachus, which the Hebrews do not like, nor
the Christians; for while he is far from the Hebrews' view, he rejects too the
interpretations of the Septuagint. 


<b>12:6-8.  <i>Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the
golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel
broken at the cistern. Then shall the
dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who
gave it. Vanity of vanities says Ecclesiastes;
all is vanity. </i></b>He returns to former matter and after a
rather large exaggeration, -which he interposes in this place, in which he
says, "and remember your Creator, in the day of your youth; before the
days of wickedness come, and before the sun, moon grow dark" and so on,
"in the day in which the keepers of the house are renewed". - now he
finishes the point he had begun in a similar way, saying, "before the
silver cord is broken", and this or that happens. But he shows the silver cord to be this white
band, and the space that divides us from heaven. It also means the gold band, which returns to
the place whence it came down. more
precisely the two that follow, the wearing of the jug on the fountain, and the
breaking of the wheel by the pond, are metaphorical images of death. For death is just like the jug, which is worn
down, stops to fill, and the wheel by which water is carried from a well or
pond, if it has been broken. Thus the
interpretation of the Septuagint has it that the usage of water is twisted in
this rope; thus when the silver cord is broken, and the river of the spirit
flows back to the fountain, the man will die. 
He goes on more clearly: "the dust will return to the earth, whence
it was taken, and the spirit is returned to God, who gave it". From which there is enough to smile at in
those who think that spirits are produced with bodies, not from God, but are
made from the parent's body. For when
the flesh is returned to the earth, and the spirit goes back to God, who gave
it; it is obvious that God is the parent of all spirits, not man. Then after the description of man's death, he
goes back to the beginning of his book, saying, "vanity of vanities, says
Ecclesiastes, all is vanity"[^309]. For all toil of mortal men, which is argued
all through the books, is pertinent here, so that dust returns to the earth,
and the spirit returns to the place, whence it was taken, it is a great vanity
in this world to toil and obtain nothing for the future from it.     


<b>12:9-10.  <i>And moreover, because the preacher was wise,
he still taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out,
and set in order many proverbs. The
preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that which was written was
upright, even words of truth. </i></b>The wisdom in which Solomon judges all kinds
of men he now professes at the end, because he was not happy with the use of
the old law, but therefore immersed himself in trying to solve difficult
problems of his own accord, and in teaching people; he composed parables and
proverbs, which say one thing superficially and yet have a deeper meaning. For proverbs often have different meaning to
that which is written, and this is the method used in teaching in the Gospels,
since the Lord spoke to the people in parables and in proverbs[^310],
but He explained them to the apostles in secret. From this we clearly get the Book of
Proverbs, and we shouldn't think that they are but simple stories with
teachings, but rather as gold still in the earth, as a seed within a nut, or as
a fruit is found inside the hairy covering of its peel. Thus we must search for another meaning in
them which pertains to God. Before this
though he mentions that he desired to know the workings of the world and the
wisdom and mind of God. He wanted to
know why one thing or another should happen, as David after the death of the
body and spirit hoped he would see the path to heaven, saying, "I will see
the heavens, the work of your fingers"[^311]. But now Solomon strives to find this wisdom,
so that he may know and understand with his human mind, though confined by the
walls of the body, the truth only known by God. 

<b>12:11.  <i>The words of the wise are as goads, and as
nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one
shepherd. </i></b>The teacher should not be seen to break from
the law of God and afterwards to justify teaching by himself, more hastily than
Moses not so much of his own will, as first by the anger of God, took teachings
therefrom with enthusiasm. He says that
his words are the words of the wise, which like a goad correct the wicked and
they move the slow steps of mortals with a sharp sting, thus they are hard like
nails which hold things up securely and high; and they are not offered with one
man's authority, but with the advice and agreement of all teachers. Let not mankind's wisdom be despised, for he
says it is given from one shepherd. That
is, many are allowed to teach, but there is only one originator of the
teachings, who is God. He turns the
passage against those who think there is one God of the Old Law, and one God of
the Gospels, since one shepherd taught the advice of the wise. But the wise are just as much prophets as the
apostles themselves. At the same time it
should be remembered that the words of the wise are said to sting, not to
flatter or encourage debauchery by a lack of discipline. But as I have said above it is to give the
wound and slow pain of repentance to those who have come into wickedness. For if his speech does not sting but it like
pleasure for the listeners then that is not the speech of a wise man. For the words of the wise are like the goad,
since after all they cause the conversion of the wicked, are firm, given on the
advice of saints, given by the one shepherd, and are founded on a strong
root. I think I have heard it said in
Paul that Saul was thrown into the way of wickedness by this goad: "it is
hard for you to kick against the pricks."[^312]


<b>12:12.  <i>And further, by these, my son, be
admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much study is a weariness
of the flesh. </i></b>If you remove the words which are given by
the one shepherd, related by the advice and agreement of the wise, do nothing
and nothing will be reproved you; follow in the footsteps of the multitude and
do not diverge from their command. Then
too for him who seeks to know many things there is a great number of books that
will lead him to wickedness and make the reader toil in vain. But he also teaches that you must have
enthusiasm and follow meanings more than the words themselves, the opposite
that philosophers and teachers of this world teach, who try to assert the
falsities of their doctrines with flamboyant and unnecessary language. On the other hand divine scripture is
restricted by the small quantity of what is written, and however much it is
enlarged by people's opinions it is restricted by the text itself. This is because the Lord has made speech
concise and brief all over the world, and His word is the same when it is
spoken in our mouth and our heart.[^313] Differently: read often, then consider what
you have read daily, there is usually more toil of the mind that that of the
body. For just as whatever you do with
your hand and body is filled with the toil of the hand and the body, so that
which pertains to reading is more the toil of the mind. It seems to me from this that the above points
from the several books must be considered differently to the way in which many
believe them to be. It is the custom of
the Scriptures that, no matter how many books there are, if they all follow the
same matter are have few differences, then we can say that they are one
book. In this way the Gospel and the
"immaculate law of the Lord, converting spirits"[^314]
are called one, although there are several books in the Gospel and there are
many laws. In this way too there is one
volume of Isaiah, and all of the divine Scripture has one title; Ezekiel[^315]
and John[^316]
are also many books in one book. The Saviour too prophesied in the holy words,
saying, "in the title of the Book is written about me"[^317]. According to this meaning therefore I think
it is a teaching that there should not be too many books. For whatever you say, if it is told to him
who was with God in the beginning, the word then is God[^318],
as one volume, and the many books are the one law, which is called the
Gospel. But if you argue that they are
varied and differ too much to be in the same volume, and look at them with too
much curiosity, even within each book you will see that there are many
books. They say about this: "you
may not escape the sin of saying too much"[^319]. Therefore there is no end to such books, for
all is good and the ending locks in truth, but wickedness and lying have no
end. And the more they are sought, the
more they come about. Study and
consideration of this is toil of the body. 
I say of the body here and not of the spirit. But the spirit even has toil according to
what the apostle says: "the more I worked for all these, not I, but the
grace of God which was with me"[^320],
and the Saviour says, "I worked shouting"[^321].   


<b>12:13-14.  <i>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole
matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of
man. For God shall bring every work into
judgement, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be
evil. </i></b>The Hebrews say that although it used to be among other
writings of Solomon in the past, they have not persisted in memory; and this
book seems as if it ought to have been omitted, because it asserts that all
God's creations are vain and that he thinks everything is done for nothing, and
he prefers food and drink and transient pleasures to all things; thus he takes
his authority from this one title, so it is now included in the number of
divine books, because he argues well and lists many things like <i>anakephaiosei, </i>and he said that his
speeches are the easiest to hear, and to understand; let us therefore fear God
and carry out his commandments. For man
is born for this purpose and, understanding his Creator, he reveres Him in fear
and respect, and in the work of his commandments. And when the time of judgement comes whatever
we have done will stand before the judge and for a long time we will await our
judgement which could go one way or the other, and we will receive our just
rewards, whether they be good or bad. 
But where we read, "with every secret thing", Symmachus and the
Septuagint have interpreted, "from all contempt", or even "from
all unknown", which even brought by reluctant words, not by will, but by
ignorance, we will be returned to reason in the day of our judgement. Differently: since fear is more appropriate
to slaves, and perfect love involves no fear, and fear in the divine Scripture
is used to denote those embarking on and those completing education[^322]. Now I think he talks about the fear inherent
in virtues, according to the passage, which says, "nothing is lacking from
those who fear Him"[^323]. Or even, since until now he is a man and has
not yet taken the name of God, he has this reason of his wealth, so that he
fears God while he is still alive. Since
every single deed is judged, that is, God leads all men into judgement about
all things, either good or bad, which are done and said differently than by
Him. For indeed, "woe to those who
say wicked is good, and good is wicked"[^324].
