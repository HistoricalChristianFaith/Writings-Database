<h2 id='tocuniq2'>Prologue</h2>

We want to interpret the last of the twelve prophets, Malachi ((or Malachim)), whose name was translated by the Seventy as 'His Messenger'. They said, 'The assumption of the word of the Lord is upon Israel in the hand of His Messenger', which is read in Hebrew as 'Malachi' (His Messenger), which rightly and explicitly means 'His Messenger', that is, My Messenger. And it should not be thought, according to the opinion of some (Origenists), that an angel came down from heaven and assumed a human body in order to speak to Israel the things that are commanded by the Lord. If names are to be interpreted, and from names there is not spiritual understanding, but the order of history is to be woven: therefore both Hosea, who is called savior, and Joel who is interpreted as Lord God, or the beginning, and the other prophets will not be men; but either angels, or the Lord and Savior, because their names resonate with this. Finally, except for the Seventy, other interpreters translated the name Malachi as it is read in Hebrew. However, the Hebrews consider Malachi to be Ezra the priest, because he mentions all the things that are contained in his book, and even here the prophet says: The lips of the priest shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at his mouth, for he is the angel of the Lord of hosts (Mal. II, 7). The time also matches: 941-942, and the title matches as well, as we have said in the Psalms, which do not fabricate titles, they should be believed, those whose first psalms are designated by names. Therefore, it is to be believed that Malachi, that is, Ezra, after Haggai and Zechariah, who prophesied under Darius, existed. And for this reason, he does not have a title, because his book serves as his title: in which we learn that in the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, and the others, ascended from Babylon and the king, according to the hand of his Lord God, granted all his request. And they ascended with him from the sons of Israel and the sons of the priests, and the sons of the Levites, and the singers, and the gatekeepers, and the Nethinim in Jerusalem, in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes, and they came to Jerusalem in the fifth month. This is the seventh year of the king, because on the first day of the first month he began to ascend from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem. These things, my Minerva (or Minerva), and Alexander, not so much united by blood as by religion, so that I might not let go of the undertaking I have begun, and so that I might not toil in vain for your benefit, I have briefly spoken in the Prologue: in order that, relying on the help of your prayers, I might explain what follows, setting forth the words of Malachi first according to the Hebrew truth, then according to the Septuagint interpreters. Origen wrote three volumes on this book; but he did not touch the history at all, and in his usual fashion he was entirely engaged in allegorical interpretation, making no mention of Ezra at all; but he thought that it was an angel who wrote, according to what we read about John: Behold, I send my angel before your face (Matt. 11:10). We absolutely do not accept that we are compelled to take on the collapse of souls from heaven. I don't know of any other commentaries that I have read on this prophet, except for a short book by Apollinaris, of which the points of interpretation rather than the interpretation itself should be mentioned.

<h2 id='tocuniq4'>(Chap. I.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 1, Verse 1) The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by the hand of Malachi. LXX: The assumption of the word of the Lord upon Israel, by the hand of his angel. What the word 'onus' means, that is, a burden, which in Hebrew is called 'Massa' (), and by Aquila is called 'ἅρμα', or what 'λῆμμα' means, that is, assumption, which the Septuagint and other interpreters have also translated, we have mentioned in other prophets. For even Nahum writes: The burden of Nineveh: The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite  (Nahum 2). And Habakkuk: The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw (Hab. I). And Zechariah: The burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Adrach, and Damascus shall be his rest (Zech. IX and XII). And again in the following: The burden of the word of the Lord upon Israel. Let us be content with this explanation: and now let us say only this, that the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel, or as the LXX say, upon Israel, is indeed heavy because it is called a burden, but it has something of consolation in it, for it is taken not against Israel, but to Israel. For it is one thing when, for example, we write to him or them, and another thing when we write against him and him: because in the former, there is a part of friendship, whereas in the latter, there is an open confession of enmity. And it must be known that when Israel was taken captive, that is, the ten tribes, they were indiscriminately called by the former name, while the two tribes, Judah and Benjamin, were called Israel. And when it is said, 'In the hand of his angel,' or Malachi, take 'hand' to mean 'works.' And it came to pass in the hand of Haggai, and in the hand of Jeremiah, and in the hand of Moses, the word of God was made. For in their hands is iniquity, and their right hand is filled with gifts, and their hands are full of blood, in them the word of God does not happen; but those who wash their hands among the innocent (Psalm 25). And whoever Pilate attempted to wash his hands, so that he would not consent to the blasphemies of the Jews (Matthew 27), of whom the Psalmist rejoices, saying: He led me out over the waters of refreshment (Psalm 22, 2). Concerning this water, the Lord promises through the prophet: I will sprinkle you with the cleanest water (Ezekiel 36). But whoever is a sinner, is intoxicated by the Babylonian cup, and it is said about him: Thorns are born in the hand of the drunkard (Proverbs 26, 9).

LXX: Put on your hearts. This is not found in Hebrew, but I believe it was added from Haggai, in which we read: And now put on your hearts from this day and onward (Haggai II, 16). Therefore, after the title of the prophet or the preface, it must be understood in two ways: Put on your hearts, that is, pay attention and consider, as mentioned above: The assumption of the word of the Lord on Israel in the hand of His Angel. Or carefully pay attention to what will be said afterwards, so that you may not know them with the ears of the body, but with the understanding of the mind and heart, and make for yourselves treasures in which you may receive the riches of the words of God; and let wisdom act confidently, when your hearts have been enlarged, and when the heart has been filled with the words of God, cast out evil thoughts that come from the heart, such as murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts (Matt. XV), and the rest, and fulfill what the Savior said: He who has ears to hear, let him hear (Luke VIII, 8).

I have loved you, says the Lord. Yet you say, 'In what have you loved us?' Was not Esau Jacob's brother? says the Lord. Yet I have loved Jacob but Esau I have hated. I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert. If Edom says, 'We are shattered but we will rebuild the ruins,' the Lord of hosts says, 'They may build, but I will tear down, and they will be called the wicked country, and the people with whom the Lord is angry forever.' And your eyes will see, and you will say: Let the Lord be magnified beyond the border of Israel. LXX: I have loved you, says the Lord: and you said, in what have you loved us? Was not Esau brother to Jacob, says the Lord: yet I loved Jacob, but Esau I hated: and I have made his borders a desolation, and his inheritance a dwelling of the desert. For Idumea will say, it is destroyed: let us return and rebuild the desolate places. Thus says the Lord almighty: They themselves will build, and I will destroy: and they will be called the borders of iniquity, and the people over whom the Lord has prepared until eternity. And your eyes shall see, and you shall say: The Lord is magnified upon the borders of Israel. Israel, that is, Judah, to whom the word of God was accustomed to be made and the vision of the Lord, is compelled to bear his burden and the weight of the heaviest punishments, in order to cast off more grievous sins and to feel through torments what he did not feel through benefits. And lest the punishment may seem unjust upon his own, the Lord subjoins: I have loved you: For whom the Lord loveth, he chastiseth; but every son whom he receiveth, he correcteth. (Hebrews 12:6). And in saying, I have loved, the present denies, while it confesses the past. They respond there with the rashness with which they sin, forgetting His benefits: 'In whom have you loved us?' To which the Lord says: 'In order that I should be silent about other things, I will discuss your origins, the beginnings from which you came, before you were born, indeed before Rebecca conceived Esau and Jacob in her womb (Gen. 25): I loved you in Jacob, I hated the Edomites in Esau.' The apostle Paul, expounding this passage in a mystical argument, writes to the Romans, connecting two testimonies together, one from Genesis and one from Malachi: 'But even Rebecca also, having conceived of one, even our father Isaac.' For when they were not yet born, nor had done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand: not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger. As it is written: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated (Rom. 9:10, et seqq.). For this saying: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated, is referred to the Book of Genesis, and to the prophet Malachi. And not only she: For when they were not yet born, nor had done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand: not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger. As it is written: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated (Rom. 9:10, et seqq.). For this saying: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated, is referred to the Book of Genesis, and to the prophet Malachi. And not only she: Before the twins were born or had done anything good or evil, in order that God's purpose in election might stand: not by works but by him who calls she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” (Romans 9:10, et seqq.). For when they were not yet born, nor had done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand: not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger. As it is written: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated (Rom. 9:10, et seqq.). For this saying: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated, is referred to the Book of Genesis, and to the prophet Malachi. And not only she: Before the twins were born or had done anything good or evil, in order that God's purpose in election might stand: not by works but by him who calls she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” (Romans 9:10, et seqq.). For when they were not yet born, nor had done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand: not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to her: The elder shall serve the younger. As it is written: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated (Rom. 9:10, et seqq.). For this saying: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated, is referred to the Book of Genesis, and to the prophet Malachi. And not only she: Before the twins were born or had done anything good or evil, in order that God's purpose in election might stand: not by works but by him who calls she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” (Romans 9:10, et seqq.). But if Edom, that is, Esau, shall say: We are destroyed indeed, but we will return and build up the ruinous places; thus saith the Lord of hosts: They shall build up, and I will throw down: and they shall be called the borders of wickedness, and the people with whom the Lord is angry for ever. And your eyes shall see, and you shall say: The Lord be magnified upon the border of Israel. If a son be a father, where is my honour? And if a master be a lord, where is my fear? saith the Lord of hosts. The Jews falsely flatter themselves that the Edomites, Romans, and Israelites prophesy about the end of the world: that when the Roman empire, that is, the Idumean empire, is destroyed, the kingdom of the world will come to the Jews. We have spoken these things, laying the foundations of history: now let us come to the spiritual understanding. Israel, a man, or rather, a person perceiving God, or as I think better, most upright before God, is loved by the Lord, and wants to know the reason for his love in himself. And the Lord answered, that Esau and Jacob, being born from the same stock, that is, vices and virtues proceed from one source of the heart: while from the freedom of our will, we lean in whichever direction we desire; but the former vices are born through infancy, childhood, and youth, which afterwards stronger age refines and supplants. The elder brother is rough and bloody (Gen. XXV): he delights in hunting, forests, and beasts. He lives a small and simple life, dwelling innocently in his home. God turns the borders of Edom, that is, the earthly and bloody ones, into solitude, and does not allow anything to grow or last on the land. But if impudent wickedness tries to rebuild what has been destroyed by the word of God, the Lord declares himself an adversary to their efforts to restore vice. And once all the boundaries of the enemies have been overthrown, then we can see with our own eyes the Israelites and all the saints saying: Let the Lord be glorified in their borders, all those who have their minds fixed on God (Wisdom 11). Moreover, love and hatred of God arise either from His foreknowledge of future events or from His works. Otherwise, we know that God loves all things and hates nothing that He has created; but He properly avenges those who are enemies and rebels against His own charity. And on the contrary, He hates those who desire to rebuild what has been destroyed by God. However, God is said to hate anthropopathetically: to weep, to grieve, to be angry; so that when we hear of His hatred towards the wicked, we may avoid what we understand God to hate.


<h2 id='tocuniq5'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) The son honors the father, and the servant his master: if therefore I am a father, where is my honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? says the Lord of hosts. LXX: The son glorifies the father, and the servant his master will fear. And if I am a father, where is my glory? And if I am a master, where is my fear? says the Almighty Lord. Although before you were born, I began to love you like sons: yet choose how you will call me, either father or master. If you are a father, give your father the respect that is due, and show the appropriate devotion to your parent. If you are a master, why do you despise me? Why do you not fear the master? However, he is speaking to those who have returned from the Babylonian captivity under Zerubbabel and the son of Josedech, and the priest Ezra, and Nehemiah, and have constructed an altar, but have not yet built the temple, nor have they rebuilt the walls of the city, and nevertheless they remained in their former sins, not venerating God with love or fear. But what we have called glory, or honor, is one word both among the Greeks, δόξα, and among the Hebrews  947  כָּבוֹד (Chabod), but for the sake of the Latin language we have used the word honor. For even in the Gospel where the Lord speaks and says: Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you (John 17:1), it is read as δόξασον among the Greeks, that is, glorify. But many Latin translators have rendered this passage as honorifica. At the same time, let us consider that a son and a servant in the Holy Scriptures are chosen by will, not by necessity of nature. For whoever receives the spirit of adoption becomes a son of God; but whoever receives the spirit of servitude becomes a servant of God in fear (Rom. VIII). Therefore, God desires first that we be His sons and that we do good willingly. If we wish to attain this, let us at least be His servants and depart from evil through fear of punishment. We read in a negative light the sons: We were children of wrath, and sons of Gehenna (Ephesians 2:3), whom the Pharisees, going around the sea and land, worthy progenitors of torments (Matthew 23). And Judas the traitor is called the son of perdition (John 17); and in the eighty-eighth psalm it is written about the Lord: The son of iniquity will not be able to harm him (Psalm 88:23). Also in Hosea, the sons of fornication are called, who are generated from a prostitute mother, of whom it is written: Your mother has fornicated (Hosea 2:5). And in the Gospel, the sons of the devil are criticized: You are born from the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father (John 8:44). We read the sons in a positive sense, as sons of God: Whoever received him, he gave them power to become sons of God (John 1:12). And sons of wisdom, proclaimed by the Gospel: Wisdom is justified by her children (Matthew 11:19). And sons of Abraham: Amen, amen, I say to you, God can raise up sons of Abraham from these stones (Matthew 3:9). And the apostle's children: My little children, for whom I am in labor again until Christ is formed in you (Galatians IV, 19), and many similar passages. Therefore, the Son honors, or glorifies, the Father, according to what is written: Let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven (Matthew V, 16). The servant also honors his master, but not with the same love as the son; rather, it is implied from the common rule that the son honors his father and the servant his master; yet Almighty God, knowing the difference between a son and a servant, seeks glory from the son and fear from the servant: For the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (Ecclesiastes I, 16), so that we may pass from the fear of servants to the glory of sons.


<h2 id='tocuniq6'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) To you, O priests, who despise my name, and you say: 'How have we despised your name?' You offer on my altar defiled bread, and you say: 'How have we defiled you?' By saying that the table of the Lord is despised. LXX: You, O priests, who despise my name, and you say: 'How have we despised your name?' You offer on my altar polluted bread, and you say: 'How have we polluted it?' By saying that the table of the Lord is despised ÷ and what remains, you have despised ÷ But what follows: And what remains you have despised, we have marked with an obelus, because it is not found in the Hebrew, and it has been added from the following verses. To you, therefore, O priests, who despise my name, this discourse is directed: you who have returned from Babylon, fearful of past servitude, should have turned to the Lord with a full heart. And not only do you not do this, but imitating Cain, you respond with arrogant words against God, and you ask Him whom hidden things do not deceive, and it is said: Wherein have we despised thy name? (Gen. IV) so that with the impudence of dissimulation, you may cover the wound of conscience. Do you want to know in what way you despise my name? You offer on my altar polluted bread: that is, the bread of offering, which according to Hebrew traditions, you yourselves should sow, you yourselves should reap, you yourselves should grind, you yourselves should cook. And now you take whatever you please from the midst, and with a reckless voice you respond, and you say, in what way do we pollute them, or you? For while the sacraments are violated, he himself, of whom they are sacraments, is violated. But we can interpret this in the following way: In what you say, the Lord's table has been despised, referring to the fact that, when they returned from Babylon and the temple had not yet been rebuilt, they dwelled in huts and in the ruins of the ancient city. They only built an altar, but it did not have the same glory as the previous one, and they believed that the sanctity of the religious practice was lacking because there was no ambition for construction. We have drawn thin lines to highlight the spiritual explanation that must be imprinted. He reproaches the divine word to bishops, as well as to neglectful priests and deacons, whether because we are of the priestly and royal lineage, or because all those who are baptized in Christ are considered (or should be considered) in the name of Christ. Why do they despise the name of God? And when asked in what way they have despised His name, He reveals the reasons for their offense: 'You offer on my altar polluted bread,' He says. We pollute the bread, that is, the body of Christ, when we unworthy approach the altar, and when we, dirty, drink the world's blood, and say, 'The table of the Lord has been despised.' Not that anyone would dare to say this, and not that anyone would think of uttering such an impious thought with a wicked voice, but the deeds of sinners despise the table of God. We can also say this: The Doctor of the Church who makes the spiritual bread and distributes it to the people, if he speaks to the people and flatters the rich either for human glory or for worldly gains that follow glory, and honors sinners, and according to James, welcomes those who come to him with gold rings (James 2), and rejects the holy poor, despises the name of God, defiles the bread of teachings, and hurls insults at God himself, thinking that the table of his writings is a common table of idols and secular teachings.


<h2 id='tocuniq7'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) If you offer the blind animal for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if you offer the lame and sick animal, is it not evil? Offer it to your governor; see if he is pleased with it or accepts your face, says the Lord of hosts. LXX: For if you offer the blind animal for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if you offer the lame and sick animal, is it not evil? Offer it to your governor; see if he receives you, if he accepts your face, says the Almighty Lord. We learn more fully about the diversity of victims and what should or should not be offered in Leviticus (Lev. 21 and 22). Therefore, the priests and Levites, gatekeepers and singers, and the servants of Solomon who returned from Babylon, including those whose names were listed by Ezra, offered illicit victims to God, namely blind and lame animals, and those weakened by various infirmities (1 Esd. 2); for this is what is meant by 'languid,' encompassing everything in one word. If you were to offer gifts to your leader, would he not reject them? Would he not consider it an injustice done to him? And yet, you dare to offer this to God, when you do not dare to give it to humans? It would take too long to explain the mysteries of all the sacrifices; I will only speak about those that are contained in this present chapter. The victim of the soul is blind, as it is not enlightened by the light of Christ, nor does it have an eye that gazes upon the Gospel (Matthew 6). The prayer of the petitioner is lame, as it approaches prayer with a divided mind and listens to the people of the Jews: How long will you limp with both feet? (1 Kings 18:21) And weak, and covered with all infirmity, which does not have the power of Christ God, and the wisdom of God. Prayers of this kind, which are without the light of truth, and do not have firm traces of wisdom, decay with various weaknesses, if they are offered to the leader of the Church, or to any educated and wise teacher, will they not be rejected, and fall into contempt for him who dared to offer such things?

<h2 id='tocuniq8'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(V. 9) And now beseech the face of God that he may have mercy on you: for by your hand has this been done, if in any way he may accept your faces, says the Lord of hosts. Who is among you that shut the doors, and kindle my altar to no purpose? LXX: And now beseech the face of your God, and pray to him: these things have been done by your hands, if I may accept your faces, says the Lord Almighty: because even among you the doors shall be closed, and my altar shall not be kindled for nothing. In this place, the Seventy interpreters differ greatly from the Hebrew truth: and where the interpretation is different, it is necessary that the meaning also be different. Because you have offered blind, lame, and weak victims, for you have done all these things that I have said: repent, if in any way God will have mercy on you, for there is no one among you to the very end, not even a high priest, not a priest, not even a Levite, not a singer, and not even a doorkeeper, and the one who sets fire on the altar for burning sacrifices, who should not receive payment for his work from me. However, when he says this, he means tithes of all the crops that are offered by the people. By this, it is shown that servitude to the Lord is more acceptable, which does not demand a reward in the present. Hence the Apostle preaches the Gospel for free (1 Thess. 2); and he works with his hands night and day, so as not to be a burden to anyone, and he testifies that this glory of his free preaching to the Gentiles should by no means be diminished (2 Thess. 3). Furthermore, LXX others suggest a much different meaning: O priests, who offer weak sacrifices, turn to repentance, and seek the face of the Lord and pray for the works of your hands. But what it brings forth: If I 951 take your faces, I do not know if it agrees with the exhortation of repentance. For no one says, pray to me, and I will not spare you. It follows: In you the doors will be closed, namely, those of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Where the Savior says: I am the door (John 10:9). Or in other words: The doors of the Scriptures will not be opened to you, nor will you be able to understand the holy of holies or know the sacraments of the Lord; nor will you be able to offer incense on his altar, because your prayers will not reach him. And what is said to be given freely, we interpret as meaning without reward: those who follow this understanding that we now explain turn it into a favor, so that they do not have the grace to serve at the Lord's altar.


<h2 id='tocuniq9'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 seqq.) I have no pleasure in you, says the Lord of hosts, and I will not accept an offering from your hand. For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name will be great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering. For my name will be great among the nations, says the Lord of hosts. But you profane it when you say: 'The table of the Lord is polluted, and its fruit, its food, is despised.' And you have said: 'Behold, we have labored and blown it away', says the Lord of hosts. And you have brought in the lame, and the sick, and you have brought in an offering: will I accept it from your hand? says the Lord. LXX: It is not my will in you, says the Lord Almighty, and I will not accept a sacrifice from your hands, for from the rising of the sun to its setting my glorious name is among the nations, and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure sacrifice, for great is my name among the nations, says the Lord Almighty. But you have defiled it by saying, 'The table of the Lord is polluted, and its fruit, its food, is despised.' You also say, 'These things are from affliction,' and you scoff at them,' says the Lord Almighty. You bring stolen goods, lame or sick animals, and offer them as sacrifices. Should I accept them from your hands?' says the Lord Almighty. The rule of Scriptures is this: When a clear prophecy about the future is given, do not diminish what is written by uncertain allegories. So now, specifically, the Lord's message is addressed to the priests of the Jews, who offer the blind and the lame and the sick for sacrifice, so that they may know that spiritual victims will succeed the carnal victims. And not the blood of bulls and goats, but incense, that is, the prayers of the saints, are to be offered to the Lord, not in one province of the world, Judea, nor in one city of Judea, Jerusalem, but in every place, an offering is to be made, not unclean, like the people of Israel, but clean, like in the ceremonies of the Christians. For from the rising of the sun even to its setting, the name of the Lord is great among the Gentiles, as the Savior says: Father, I have manifested your name to men (John 17:6). And when, he says, my name shall become great among the Gentiles, oh you princes of the Jews, you have defiled it and continue to defile it. Thus, the prophecy covers both the future and the present time. But therefore, oh priests and princes of the Jews, in every place a clean offering is presented to me, and my name is great among the Gentiles, because you say the Lord's table is defiled, and what is placed on it is contemptible with the fire that devours it. The people, upon returning from Babylon, built an altar made only of random and unpolished stones, according to the book of Ezra (Ezra 1:6), without a temple, without city buildings, without the construction of walls, and they believed that the worship of the religion was of lesser value because it lacked the adornments of the temple. To them, the Lord says: Do you think that the altar and the burnt offerings and the sacrifices placed on it are polluted? Do you also think that the fire, which consumes the sacrifices, is polluted? You do not understand that the almighty God does not seek gold, gems, or a multitude of sacrifices, but rather the will of those who offer. 953. But those who think that the altar should be understood as the table on which the loaves were placed, how can they interpret what follows, when I do not see at all the fire that devours it: for the fire does not devour the loaves of the offering, which were always exchanged for new ones instead of the old ones, and taken away to be used by the priests (Leviticus 2:4). Or certainly it should be understood in this way: You have defiled my name by saying: What good is it if we offer the best? Whatever is offered must be consumed by fire. But the fruit of the altar is fire, and the food of fire is the offerings of the host or the holocaust. And it is not enough that you spoke blasphemy in the previous discourse, but you also said this: 'Behold, we have labored and blown away what we had, says the Lord of hosts.' The meaning of this statement is as follows: You said, 'We have returned from captivity, we have been plundered by our enemies, we have labored greatly on a long journey, we are poor, whatever we could have, has been consumed by the hardships of the road. Whatever we have, we offer.' And by saying this, you have blown away your own sacrifices, that is, you have made them unworthy by my exhalation. Or as it can be read in Hebrew: 'And you have blown me away by saying this.' You have done injury not to the sacrifice, but to me, to whom you were sacrificing. Therefore, I will by no means accept that from your hand, says the almighty Lord. Some think that this is specifically said to the Jews because their offerings are unclean and polluted, and sacrifice is transferred to the Gentiles. It should be understood as pertaining to the priests of the Church who offer sacrifices to the Lord negligently. But if we accept this, then the offerings must be transferred again from the Church to another religion. And just as I read the Gospel, so again what is not yet future will happen in accordance with the Gospel. They also refer to the contaminated table of the Lord in holy Scriptures, if they are understood differently than they are written.

<h2 id='tocuniq10'>(Chap. II.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 2, verses 1, 2.) Woe to the deceitful one who has a male in his flock and makes a vow, sacrificing something weak to the Lord. For I am a great king, says the Lord of hosts, and my name is feared among the nations. + And now, to you, O priests, I give this command: If you will not listen and if you will not set it on your heart to give glory to my name, says the Lord of hosts, I will send poverty upon you and curse your blessings, yes, I have cursed them, because you have not set it on your heart. LXX: And cursed is the one who is powerful and has a male in his flock, and his vow is upon him, and he sacrifices a weakling to the Lord. For I am a great King, says the Lord Almighty, and my name is renowned among the nations. And now I have this command for you, O priests. If you do not listen and if you do not set your heart to give glory to my name, says the Lord Almighty, I will send a curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you have not set your heart to honor me. This which is written, and I will scatter your blessing, is added in the Septuagint, and is not found in Hebrew. Whatever the human mind can find to excuse its sin and defend itself with false satisfaction, this divine word, foreseeing it, rebukes and condemns. And the meaning is, because you offer the blind and the lame and the sick, and this is not from your own, but from robberies and spoils and the tears of the miserable, and moreover you say, we offer what we have from labor and poverty: therefore I say generally, that your own conscience may accuse you. Certainly you hide poverty and the injustice of captivity, and the weakness of your family affairs: listen to what I say: Cursed is the deceitful one who has a male in his flock, and making a vow he sacrifices an inferior one to the Lord. If you do not have a male, the curse does not harm you. By saying this, he shows that they have what is best and offer what is worst. Therefore, priests, this commandment is for you, you have done what is wicked in contempt of me. But because I prefer the repentance of a sinner to death, I say even now: If you refuse to listen and understand, so as to give glory to my name, which is terrible among the nations, I will send a true plague to you, so that you will not lie; but, compelled by the lack of all things, you will say that you do not possess the best things to offer. And I will curse, he says, your blessings, that is, those things which you now possess through my blessings; whatever is blessed by you will be cursed by me. And I will curse them, implied by your blessings; for you did not want to understand what is being said; for it is said: you have not set it upon your heart. We can receive the curse and deception of the Jewish people, who, although they had in their flock the male Lord Savior, and the spotless Lamb who takes away the sins of the world (John 1), and being warned by the prophecy of all the prophets, to sacrifice and accept the ram, which was caught by its horns in the thicket of Sabec (Genesis 22), they did not want to do this; but instead, they sacrifice the weak to the Lord, crucifying the Savior, and choosing Barabbas, the author of robbery and sedition (John 18), who is interpreted according to mystical understanding as referring to the devil: and for those despising and preferring the devil to the Savior, the name of Christ is horrible among the nations, who have received the passion of the Lord and fearfully honor Him. It can also be said about us: If we, created by God, wise and possessing a nature suitable for sacred disciplines, neglect our own skill and give ourselves to vices and excesses, and having power, we sacrifice the weak to the Lord. However, our prayer is weak and tainted, when it is corrupted by anger, envy, enmities, and other disturbances of the soul: if we offer a gift at the altar and remember that our brother has something against us, we do not proceed and make amends to him (Matthew 5:23). And so the Apostle commands: 'I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands without anger and dispute' (I Tim. II, 8). And the shepherd is the one who knows our thoughts and the senses of our virtues, as it is said in the one hundred and second Psalm (Verse 1): 'Bless the Lord, O my soul, and let all that is within me bless his holy name'. If he governs his flock well, he fulfills that blessing: 'Blessed shall be the offspring of your cattle and the produce of your ground' (Deut. XXVIII, 4). But if he who naturally possesses masculinity, that is, strength, rigidity, and robustness, sacrifices lightness or excessive femininity and lasciviousness, or if he is weakened and corrupted by various disturbances of the soul, he will feel within himself that which is written: The powerful endure torments powerfully (Wisdom 6:7). And: To whom much is given, much will be demanded from him (Luke 8). Therefore, it is specifically said to priests that if they refuse to listen and hold it in their hearts, so as to give glory to the name of the Lord through good conduct (Romans 2); but on the contrary, his name is cursed among the nations because of them, he will send upon them poverty of all good things, and will turn their blessings into a curse. Those who abuse their health for pleasure, and turn their wealth into luxury, and tarnish their good reputation with impure conduct, they change the blessings of God into curses. Indeed, it is specifically the priests who are commanded, and their blessings are turned into curses when they do not bless the saints with true heartfelt affection, like Isaac with Jacob, and Jacob with the patriarchs, and Moses with the twelve tribes (Genesis 27 and 49, and Deuteronomy 23), but they deceive the hearts of the innocent with sweet words and blessings (Romans 16), and those who act wickedly are blessed by them, and they flatter sinners as long as they are rich and indulge in their vices, of whom it is said: My people, those who call you blessed are leading you astray and causing you to stumble in your paths (Isaiah 3:11).


<h2 id='tocuniq11'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(Vers. 3, 4.) Behold, I will cast the branch to you, and I will scatter the refuse of your solemnities upon your faces, and it shall take you away with it. And you shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant might be with Levi, says the Lord of hosts. LXX: Behold, I will separate for you the shoulder, and I will scatter the belly upon your faces, the belly of your solemnities, and I will take you together: and you shall know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my testament may be with the Levites, says the Lord Almighty. Because he speaks to the priests, he says: I will cast in your faces those things which you consider holier in the Law, and which have been forgiven to you by God as a gift of virtues from sacrifices: The arm, which the Seventy translated as shoulder, that is, the right arm of the animal. And I will scatter, he says, the dung, that is, the abdomen; or according to the Hebrews, excrement, that is, Phares, metaphorically using the term to refer to what contains, calling that which is contained, for the priests received both the arm and the chest, as well as the tongue and the abdomen, and those things which are described in Leviticus (Lev. VII and IX) from sacrifices. He testifies that all these things are cast away for their sins, and that they are sent upon the faces of the priests (Num. 18; Deut. 18), so that those who offer may be such as those things that are offered. And He says that He will take you with Him, that is, the dung of your solemnities, so that the filthy faces may be defiled by the mixture of foul dung, and from that which I cast away from you, you may understand that I am He who once chose your father Levi, and through Levi Aaron, and granted you the glory of the priesthood, so that it might be My covenant or testament with Levi, and he might minister to Me in an eternal priesthood. Note that 'Brit' in Hebrew is translated as 'pact' or 'covenant' by Aquila, 'testament' by the LXX, and in many places in Scripture, 'testament' does not mean the will of the deceased, but a covenant of the living. God desired that all people, especially priests, not have any blemish and adorn their shoulder or arm with good works. A good conscience is signified by the heart, holy confession by the tongue, so that what we believe in our hearts for righteousness, we confess with our mouths for salvation (Romans 10). In the stomach, there is nothing deadly; but rather that which sustains and nourishes our life: for if food is not digested in the stomach and its juice irrigates the body, it becomes weak and leads to death. However, we turn everything the opposite way, so that the Lord may reject us or separate our works from the works of the saints, and it is prescribed for us to anoint our heads (Matt. VI) and to wash our faces from the filth of sins while fasting, and to contemplate the glory of the Lord with unveiled face (III Cor. III). Now we say: Confusion covers my face (Ps. XLIII, 16) and like Cain, our face falls (Gen. IV), and we cannot fulfill what is commanded: Lift up your eyes and see (Jer. XIII, 20); but we have faces covered with the filth of vices and we say: My wounds have putrefied and have become corrupt, because of my foolishness (Ps. XXXVII, 6). Wherefore all these things are turned into dung, as the Scripture saith: And he shall take you with him as dung, even the faces of our sacrifices which ought to have come full and clean to the solemnities of God, and to eat the flesh of the lamb shod with shoes (Exod. XII), or after seven weeks, to offer the fruits of our works to God (Lev. XXIII), or to live passing through in the tabernacles of this world, and to say: I am a stranger and a pilgrim, as were all my fathers (Ps. XXXVIII). And because for this reason we translate: He will take you with himself to the dung, the Septuagint translated it as: I will take you together, intelligence is added, that after the priests have been covered with disgrace and ignominy, and have recognized their sin and repented, then they shall be taken by the Lord, and it is fitting for this meaning what follows: And you shall know that I have sent this commandment to you. But the interpretation that seems true to me is superior, lest between the words of threat, he may have inserted words of flattery, especially since even the things that follow sound like God's indignation.


<h2 id='tocuniq12'>(Vers. 5 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 5 onwards) My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave him fear, and he feared me, and trembled at the presence of my name. The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and equity, and turned many away from iniquity. For the lips of the priest preserve knowledge, and people seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts. LXX: My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave him fear to fear me, and he was in awe of the presence of my name. The law of truth (also called truth itself) was on his lips, and iniquity was not found on his tongue. He walked with me in peace and turned many away from wickedness. For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, because he is the messenger of the Almighty. It is described from the perspective of God, the perfect duty of a priest, what he should be like, and how God wanted him to be, whom he commanded to be. For He had said above, 'On account of the pact between Me and Levi,' says the Lord of Hosts, 'and it was through Levi the Patriarch that the pact reached his descendants, Aaron, Eleazar, Phinehas, and others who were generated from his lineage. But now in the end, He says, 'You have made void the pact with Levi,' says the Lord of Hosts. From this, it is clear that everything that is said about Levi pertains to the priests and specifically to the high priest. We read in Numbers about Phinehas, who killed Zimri and the Midianite woman with a sword. Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, caused My fury to rest upon the Israelites because he was zealous for My honor and did not let Me destroy the Israelites in My anger. Therefore, I said, 'Behold, I will give him the covenant of peace, and it shall be for him and his descendants after him a covenant of eternal priesthood.' This is because he was zealous for his God and made atonement for the Israelites.' (Numbers 25:11) But let us not consider the testament or pact of life to be that which is common to us with animals and all living creatures, but that which says: I am the life (John 14:7). For indeed our life is hidden with Christ in God (Colossians 3:3): of whom we can say that he himself is our peace, as the Apostle affirms: For he himself is our peace (Ephesians 2:14). Therefore, the Lord gave to Levi and through him to his descendants, that they might fear him; for the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (Psalm 111:10), and they should fear and withdraw themselves from his presence, showing the fear of the mind by the horror of the body, according to what is written: On whom shall I rest, except on the humble and quiet and trembling one who keeps my words? (Isaiah 66:2) The law of truth was on his lips, that is, the teaching of the peoples, which in the priest should not be defiled by any falsehood; but should proceed entirely from the fountain of truth. And injustice was not found on his lips, so that he might imitate his Lord, of whom it is said: 'He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth' (1 Peter 2:22). He walked with me in peace and equity, so that he himself may have peace within him and may bring peace to others, and may show no partiality in judgment, and therefore he walks with God as Enoch walked, who was taken up by God and was found no more (Genesis 5); and he turned many away from iniquity. Whoever is a priest and does not correct wrongdoers, passes over the duty of the priest. The lips of the priest shall keep knowledge: they shall not say, pronounce, but shall keep, so that they may speak at the proper time, and give food to the servants in due season, and seek the law from his mouth. The same is written in Haggai: 'Ask the priests about the law of the Lord' (Haggai 2:12). It is the duty of the priest to respond to the disciplined inquiry about the law. If someone is diligent in ignorance of other things, but negligent in the Holy Scriptures, they boast in vain of a dignity whose works they do not exhibit. This is what the apostle Paul writes to Titus: That he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict (Titus 1:9). And to Timothy: Since from childhood you have known the sacred writings, which are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus, so that the one who sins in the presence of all may be rebuked (2 Timothy 3:13). It follows: Because the angel of the Lord of hosts is. He explains his name as Ezra, the priest of God, that is, Malachi, which is interpreted as the angel of the Lord; however, an angel, that is, a messenger, is truly called a priest of God, because he is the mediator between God and men, and he announces God's will to the people: and therefore in the priest's breastplate it is the rational (Exodus 29), and in rational learning and truth is placed, so that we may learn that a priest must be learned and a proclaim of the Lord's truth. Some falsely think that what is said about Levi and through Levi to the priests should be understood about Christ, not considering the things that follow, which are contrary to the person of Christ.

<h2 id='tocuniq13'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Vers. 8, 9.) But you have departed from the way, and have caused many to stumble in the law: you have made void the covenant of Levi, says the Lord of hosts. Therefore I also have made you contemptible and base before all the people, because you have not kept my ways, and have had respect of persons in the law. LXX: But you have turned aside from my way, and have made many weak in the law, you have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the Almighty Lord. And I gave you contemptible and dissolute ones to all nations, because you did not keep my ways, but showed partiality in the law. This does not pertain to the person of Christ, nor to those who are dedicated to his worship, even if I remain silent, the wise reader understands. And the meaning is: I wanted to make you do what is contained in the previous chapter, and what I spoke through Moses in Deuteronomy: Give his teaching and truth to the righteous man (Deut. XXXIII, 8, sec. LXX), and the rest: but you have departed from the straight path, or deviated, as I said: Do not turn to the right or to the left (Deut. V, 32); and you have made many weak in the law, or caused them to stumble, as Aquila and Symmachus translated. To turn to the right is to abstain from the foods that God created for use; to condemn marriage and to fall into that which is written in another place: Do not be overly righteous (Eccl. 7:17). To turn to the left is to give oneself over to luxury and lust, and to cause scandal to many in the law. It is better for such a person to have a millstone tied around their neck and be thrown into the sea, than to cause one of the least of these to stumble. But many make the weak, who, having received the strength of faith in Christ, make them weak by their negligent behavior, of whom rightly it is said: You have made void the covenant of Levi, the covenant of life and peace, and other things which we have said pertain to the priest's duty. For this reason, I too have made you contemptible and lowly to all the people, so that they would despise you and trample upon your honor and glory: Because you have not kept my ways and have shown partiality in the law. Among all the sins of Levi, or those who are from Levi, the priests of God, that one is placed last and greatest, why they receive faces in the law, so that they consider not causes, but persons, despising the just poor, receiving and honoring unjust rich. To whom it is said in the eighty-first psalm: How long will you judge unjustly and accept the faces of sinners (Psalm 81:2)? And Paul says to the Galatians: God, he says, does not accept the person of man (Galatians 2:6). The apostle James more fully argues this sin and condemns it (James 2). However, whatever is said to the previous people, let us consider it also said to us, so that we may be more cautious in avoiding vices and not adopt a face against the law, nor prefer falsehood to the truth as worshippers of God.

<h2 id='tocuniq14'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 and following) Is not the Father one of us all? Is not God one who created us? Why then does each one of us despise his brother, violating the covenant of our fathers? Judah has transgressed, and abomination has been made in Israel and in Jerusalem: because Judah has defiled the sanctification of the Lord, which he loved, and has taken the daughter of a foreign god. The Lord will destroy the man who does this, the master and the disciple from the tents of Jacob, and the one who offers an offering to the Lord of hosts. LXX: Is not the Father of you all one? Did not one God create you? Why have you each forsaken his brother, making the abominable testament of your fathers? Judas has been abandoned, and abomination has been made in Israel and in Jerusalem, because Judas defiled the holy things of the Lord, in which he loved, and he discovered foreign gods. May the Lord destroy the man who does these things, until he is driven out from the tents of Jacob, and from those who offer sacrifice to the Almighty Lord. Before we discuss the current chapter, the tradition of the Hebrews must be presented, indeed the truth of the Scriptures must be explained. We read in a volume titled Ezra, spoken in the person of Ezra himself: The leaders approached me, saying: The people of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands and from their abominations, namely the Canaanites, Ethiopians, Persians, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites. For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: and the holy seed is mixed with the people of those lands. Moreover the hand of the princes and magistrates hath been first in this transgression. And when I had heard this thing, I rent my mantle and my coat, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down mourning (1 Esdras 9:1). And again in the following: And there were found of the sons of the priests that had taken strange wives: of the sons of Jesus, the son of Josedec, and his brethren, Maasia, and Eleazar, and Jarib, and Godolia: and they gave their hands to put away their wives, and to offer for their offence a ram of the flock (1 Esdras 10:18-19). At the end of the chapter, after listing those who had taken foreign wives ((or had taken)), the Scripture states: All of these took foreign wives, and there were women among them who gave birth to sons. Therefore, upon their return from the Babylonian captivity, both the leaders, priests, and Levites, as well as the rest of the people, rejected their wives of Israelite descent, who, due to poverty and the injustice of a long journey, as well as the frailty of their gender, could not bear the labor and had become worn out, and had contracted physical weakness and deformity. And they had entered into matrimony with foreigners, who were either in the prime of life or possessed more attractive physical appearances, or were the daughters of the powerful and wealthy. So Ezra the prophet rebukes them and challenges them to reject their new wives and take back the wives they had divorced. He says, 'Is not Abraham our father? Didn't Isaiah write about him: Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah, who bore you; for he was one, and I called him.' Isn't it one God who created us, who chose our lineage from Abraham? Why then do we despise our old wives and cast aside the daughters of our brothers, in order to abandon the covenant of our fathers and not take wives according to the Law? Juda transgressed (for this tribe alone returned from Babylon with the priests and Levites, and abomination was committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. Not from the ten tribes which were held by the Assyrians did this happen, but from those who returned under the authority of King Cyrus, Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah from Babylon. Because Judah defiled the sanctification of the Lord, which he loved, and took a daughter of a foreign god, mixing Israel's seed with foreigners and the daughters of the nations, that is, with non-Israelite women who served idols, by marrying them. Therefore, the word of the prophets is directed towards them, and they are drawn away from sin by curses. May the Lord destroy the man who does this. How beautifully he does not pardon the error, nor does he say, 'May the Lord curse the one who did this,' but the one who does it, stretching the curse towards the future, in order to provoke sinners to repentance. The teacher, he says, the disciple from the tents of Jacob, whether he be a priest or a layperson, they shall be struck with the same curse, and there shall be no difference in punishment for those in whom the sins are equal. And the one offering a gift to the Lord of hosts: it is understood that the Lord will destroy him as well, who wishes to offer a gift at the altar for men of this kind, whose only remedy is not to do what they have done. Some, not understanding this passage, nor knowing the truth of history, understand what he says: 'Is not the father of us all one?' concerning Abraham, so as to also mention Abraham as the father of the Gentiles, according to what is written: 'God is able from these stones to raise up children of Abraham' (Matt. 3:9). Certainly they affirm one God the Father according to what we read in Deuteronomy: Is not this the same Father who possessed you, and made you, and created you (Deut. XXXII, 6)? And again: You have deserted the God who created you (Ibid., 18). And elsewhere: I have begotten sons and exalted them, but they have forsaken me (Isaiah I, 2). And in the Book of Psalms: The sons of strangers have lied to me: the sons of strangers have grown old and stumbled from their paths (Ps. XVII, 46). 964 From this one father, who sinned, departing, they made many fathers of their vices: For everyone who commits sin is born of the devil. And this is what follows: Therefore each one of us despises his brother, violating the covenant of our fathers, they interpreted it in such a way as to say: We who are all generated from one father ought to be one, and to have one confession of faith; but afterwards by pride and the building of the tower against God, they were divided into many languages and opinions (Gen. XI). They also refer to acts of charity, saying: Let us despise our brothers when we do not share with them what we have received from God for sustaining life. And they further allege that our brother is called Lord according to the Scriptures, who commanded Mary Magdalene to announce to his brothers that the Lord has risen (John 20), and he speaks in the Psalm: I will declare your name to my brothers, in the midst of the Church I will sing praise to you (Psalm 22:23). So the Jews deserted their brother and contaminated the covenant of their fathers, which God had made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that in their descendants, who is interpreted as Christ, all the nations would be blessed. They suspect these things in various ways because they do not find a certain way. Finally, even this which follows according to the Septuagint: Judas has been forsaken, and abomination has been made in Israel and in Jerusalem, they explain thus: The Jews have been deserted because they have blasphemed the Lord Savior and have endured what is written: According to the multitude of their wickedness, drive them out, for they have provoked you, O Lord (Ps. 5:11), so that they would be scattered as wanderers and fugitives into all the provinces. For they have polluted the holy things of the Lord, being devoted to the Son of God, and approaching foreign gods: For whoever does not accept the Son, does not accept the Father who sent him (Luke IX, 43). And because they have done this, they will continue to be destroyed until they are humbled, either by the injustice of captivity, or by the guilt of their conscience: and they will be cast out from the tents of Jacob, so that with the temple and altar destroyed, no sacrifices may be offered among them (or by them). Not content with this explanation (because Judas is interpreted as the confession of the Lord), they transfer understanding to the penitent, who, after confessing the Lord, if he sins, commits an abomination in Israel, and in Jerusalem, in the sense of seeing God, and in the vision of peace. For he pollutes the mysteries of Christ, unworthily receiving his body and blood (I Cor. XI), because he loves vices and finds for himself foreign gods, having the number of gods according to the number of sins. According to the Apostle Paul: God is a voracious belly (Phil. III), and according to Peter (also James). Whoever is conquered by him, is subjected to him (II Petr. II, 19). And whoever does this, will be exterminated from the Church, and from the tents of Jacob, who supplants vices and sins, until he is humbled for his own good, and a victim is offered for him to the Almighty Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq15'>(Vers. 13 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 13 ff.) And you have done this again, covering the altar of the Lord with tears, weeping and groaning, so that I will no longer look upon your sacrifices or accept anything pleasing from your hands. Yet you ask, 'Why?' Because the Lord has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, whom you have despised, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant. Did not one God create us all? Did not one God give us life and breath? And what does one seek, except the seed of God? Therefore, guard your spirit and do not despise the wife of your youth. When you have hatred, let it go, says the Lord God of Israel; but iniquity will cover its clothing, says the Lord of hosts: guard your spirit and do not despise. LXX: And you have done these things that I hated: you covered the altar of the Lord with tears, weeping and groaning, looking for a sacrifice still worthy of labor, or to receive something acceptable from your hands. And you said, why? Because the Lord has testified between you and the wife of your youth, whom you have abandoned, and she is your companion, and the wife of your covenant, and no other person has done this, and the remainder of your spirit. And you said, what else does God seek besides offspring? And guard in your spirit, and do not abandon the wife of your youth. But if you hate her and divorce her, says the Lord God of Israel, he will cover your thoughts of wickedness, says the Almighty Lord. And guard in your spirit, and do not abandon. Let us interpret the story, and connecting short sentences to each verse, let us discuss what has been handed down to us from the Hebrews. The abandoned wives of the Israelites, contemplating the women of foreign nations in the beds of their husbands, sought refuge only in God's help, prostrating themselves before the altar of the Lord for 966 days and nights with tears, groans, and wails, causing envy towards His providence; because He did not regard human affairs and did not alleviate their miseries. Where God says that he cannot accept sacrifice and offering from the hands of priests who have committed these things, being hindered by the weeping and lamentations of their wives, and moreover, he asks why he does not accept sacrifice from their hands, and immediately he declares: Because the Lord has testified between you and the wife of your youth, whom you have despised, saying: Because of this, a man will leave his father and mother and cling to his wife, and the two will become one flesh (Gen. II, 24): and therefore she is called a partner and wife of union and covenant, who was made from the rib of man by God. And the remainder of his spirit, whether of God, as some suppose, or of the husband, as others suspect, because on this account it seems that, in a certain manner, one soul exists in two (persons), with the spirit and mind united. Therefore, when one (person) has made both the man and the woman, on this account the conjunction of both was made by God, so that children would be born. For there is only one God, what does he seek except the seed of God, that is, children generated from the Israelite stock? So when you have fruitful wives and rejoice in children, why do you seek the beauty of women, which is suitable for prostitutes, not for wives? Therefore, God commands through the prophet and says: Guard your spirit; do not be led astray by desire, so that you are not overcome by the love of strangers. And do not despise the wife of your youth, who was first joined to you in virgin marriage, let her remain with you until old age. But it could happen that the rulers, priests, Levites, and people would respond: God commanded through Moses that when we hate our wives, we should divorce them. And it is written: You say to me that it is written: When you hate your wife, divorce her, says the Lord God of Israel (Deut. XXIV). And immediately he replied: Indeed, this is a commandment in the Law, but because of the hardness of your hearts. Which the Lord further expounds in the Gospel: But whoever, except for the cause of fornication, unjustly divorces his wife (Mat. V, 52), his garment of iniquity will cover him, that is, the body in which the soul is clothed, says the Lord of hosts: so that he may be punished in the same way he sinned. Therefore, in this dissolved question, it inculcates and repeats what it said above: Guard your spirit, and do not despise, either the guardianship of your spirit, or certainly a wife, if she is poor or ugly. What we specifically explained according to the book of Ezra concerning abandoned wives, some people believe this statement is generally against those who plunder the possessions of others and unjustly amass wealth, daring to offer gifts to God, which it says it cannot accept, forbidden by the tears of those who have been devastated, and by weeping and groaning. And it is fitting to apply this testimony to that place: Honor God from your just labors (Prov, III, 9). But they also mix in this feeling, those who on account of the loss of family property, the death of their children, shipwreck, and other things that pertain to the loss of worldly possessions, are turned to weeping, and give themselves wholly to mourning and lamentation: not with the strength of mind and hope in God, and disregard everything for the rewards of the future; even if they direct their prayers to God, they are not received by him, because they are defiled by unseemly and incongruous lamentations for a man. But as for what follows: Because the Lord has testified between you and the wife of your youth, whom you have despised; and she is your partner, and the wife of your covenant or testament; and no other has done so; and the remnants of your spirit are interpreted in such a way that they say the natural understanding of the wife of your youth, and the law written in the heart, which is inherent in all human beings. Therefore, even the nations without the law of God do the things that are of the law. And about this wife, it is preached in Proverbs: A wife is joined to a man by God (Prov. XIX, 24); and we are commanded to drink from our own wells and fountains, and let no one share in drinking, and to take delight in the wife of our youth. This wife even impels us to say to the gullible: God will judge, and God will see (Judges VII, 13); and I leave all things to be judged between me and you, about which even Ecclesiastes speaks: And live your life with the woman whom you have loved all the days of your vanity, which have been given to you under the sun (Eccl. IX, 9). This wife is the remaining spirit of ours, because she is always joined to our perception: and if she departs from us, we immediately offend God, and our impiety covers us. Hence it is again suggested: Keep your spirit (Galatians 6), not the flesh in which those who are cannot please God, not the soul: For the animalistic man does not receive those things which are of the spirit (1 Corinthians 2:14); but the spirit: for the Spirit intercedes for us with unspeakable groanings (Romans 8:16).

(Verse 17.) You have wearied the Lord with your words, and you say: in what way have we wearied Him? In that you say: everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and such please Him; or certainly where is the God of justice? LXX: You have provoked the Lord with your words, and you say: in what way have we provoked you? In that you say: everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and in these things he delights; and where is the God of righteousness? This place is more fully described by the seventy-second psalm, the beginning of which is: How good is God to those who are upright in heart! But my feet were almost moved: my steps were almost poured out: for I was jealous of the wicked, seeing the prosperity of sinners: For there is no regard for their death, nor is there a firm foundation in their affliction. They are not troubled by the toil of men, and they will not be scourged with men (Ps. 72, 1 seqq). And then I said, therefore I have justified my heart without cause: and have washed my hands among the innocent. So when the people returned from Babylon and saw all the nations around them, and saw them serving the idols of Babylon, and abounding in wealth, and flourishing in their bodies, and possessing all the things that are considered good in this world; but as for me who have knowledge of God, I am covered in squalor, hunger, and servitude, and I am scandalized and say: There is no providence in human affairs, everything is carried by uncertain chance, and is not governed by God's judgment, but rather evil pleases Him, and good displeases Him. Or surely if God judges all things, where is His fair and just judgment? This kind of question, unbelievably, is continually raised to God regarding the future, and when He sees the wicked powerful, He sees the humble saints abounding in all things, even not having those things necessary for sustenance; and sometimes with deaf ears and blind eyes, and with sores in every part of their bodies, and burdened by weakness, like Lazarus in the Gospel (Luke 16) who, covered in purple, desired to be nourished by the crumbs that were thrown from the remnants of tables; but the rich person, in such great cruelty and brutality, does not have compassion on a fellow human, whom even the tongue of dogs has compassion on, not understanding the time of judgement, nor that those things which are eternal are the true goods, saying: Evil things please him, and where is the judgement of God?


<h2 id='tocuniq17'>(Chap. III.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

Chapter 3, Verse 1: Behold, I send (or will send) my angel, and he will prepare the way before me: and immediately he will come to his temple, the Lord whom you seek, and the angel of the covenant whom you desire. LXX: Behold, I will send my angel, and he will prepare the way before me: and suddenly the Lord whom you seek will come to his temple, and the angel of righteousness whom you desire. This the Lord interpreted in the Gospel according to John the Baptist, saying: This is he of whom it is written; Behold, I send my angel before your face, and he will prepare your way before me (Matthew 11:10); and he did not use the same words that the translators of the LXX rendered. Marcus the evangelist also, combining two testimonies of Malachi and Isaiah in the discourse of one prophet, began as follows: The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is written in the prophet Isaiah: Behold, I send my angel before your face, who will prepare your way (Mark 1:2). This we also read in other words in Malachi. And what follows: The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths (Isaiah 40:3), is said by the prophet Isaiah. And immediately explaining both testimonies, he says: There was, he said, John in the wilderness, baptizing and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins (Mark 1:4). But even the evangelists have interpreted the prophecy of the prophets concerning John, and while they agree in meaning, they differ in wording. For what the LXX translated as 'Make straight the paths of our God,' Mark and Luke said, 'Make straight his paths.' But John said, 'Prepare the way of the Lord.' From this it is clear that the apostles, the evangelists, and the Lord Himself, do not follow the authority of the LXX translators, whom having knowledge of the Hebrew language, they do not need; but they transfer from the Hebrew what they have read, not caring about the syllables and punctuation of the words, as long as the truth of the meaning is transferred. Indeed, we have taught that they did this in many places, especially in the book which is titled by us, on the best method of interpretation, it is confirmed by many testimonies together. Therefore, what is said: Behold, I send my angel and he will prepare the way before my face, it is said in the person of Christ, that he sent John into the desert of Judea to preach the baptism of repentance, for the remission of sins. But what follows: And immediately he will come to his temple, the Lord whom you seek, and the angel of the testament whom you desire, he speaks of himself as if of another, according to the custom of the Scriptures. There is no doubt that this Lord is the Savior, who is the Creator of all, and is called the Angel of the Covenant, and the Angel of Great Counsel. However, others think that what is said, 'Behold, I send my angel and he will prepare the way before me,' is spoken from the person of the Father. And what follows, 'The Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple, the Dominator and the Angel of the Covenant whom you desire,' they understand as being said by the Lord Savior himself. But John prepares the way and makes straight paths for the hearts of the faithful of our God, in which, because of wickedness and unbelief, God could not walk first. However, the temple or the Church is interpreted, or each of the faithful in the Church: Build spiritual houses, a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices, and acceptable to God through Christ Jesus (I Peter 2:5). But to those who believe: Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you (I Corinthians 3:16)? The Jews understand this which is said: 'Behold, I send my angel', to refer to Elijah the prophet, and what follows: 'He will immediately come to his temple, the ruler whom you seek' they attribute to the anointed one, that is, their Christ, whom they say will come at the end of time. But I wonder how the course of events does not teach them the truth. For if the ruler will find his temple, which is destroyed down to its foundations, or if it is to be rebuilt by another before Christ comes, what more will their Christ do, since all things have already been restored by another? Our Lord, in the Gospel, interpreting Elijah the prophet, speaks of John the Baptist, saying: If you want to know, he is Elijah who is to come (Matthew 11:14), of whom also the same prophet whom we have been discussing writes at the end: Behold, I am sending to you Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes (Malachi 4:5). But how John is Elijah, he has given us the way of understanding, by mentioning that he came in the power and spirit of Elijah.


<h2 id='tocuniq18'>(Vers. 2. seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 2 and following) Look, says the Lord of Hosts, who can think of the day of his coming? And who will stand to see him? For he will come like a refining fire and like the fullers' soap. He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will offer sacrifices to the Lord in righteousness. And the sacrifice of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord, as in the days of old and as in former years. And I will come to you in judgment, and I will be a swift witness against sorcerers and adulterers, and perjurers, and those who oppress the hired worker, the widow, and the fatherless, and those who thrust aside the sojourner: they have not feared me, says the Lord of hosts. For I the Lord do not change. Behold, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts, and who will endure the day of his coming? And who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap. He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring offerings in righteousness to the Lord. And the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord as in the days of old and as in former years. And I will come to you in judgment, and I will be a swift witness against evildoers, and against adulterers, and against those who swear falsely by my name. And those who cheat hired workers of their wages, and oppress widows, and orphaned children, and pervert the justice due to foreigners, and those who do not fear me, says the Lord Almighty. For I am the Lord your God, and I do not change. Above, we have read the question raised to the Lord by those who say: 'Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and he delights in them.' Or surely, if He is displeased, where is the God of judgment? This is where is the truth of justice? To which the Lord's response was: I will send my angel, who will prepare my way, and he will come to his temple, the ruler whom you seek, who is the judge of truth, of whom it is said in the Psalm: O God, grant your judgment to the king, and your justice to the son of the king (Psalm 71:1). For the Father does not judge anyone; but he has given all judgment to the Son (John 5:22). And that Son is the angel of the covenant whom you seek, who does not delight in evil, who does not show partiality in judgment (Colossians 3:25), who is not changed by either mercy or severity: for the cup in the Lord's hand is full of mixed wine, and he pours from one side to the other (Psalm 75:8-9), meaning that mercy tempers justice, and justice tempers mercy. So he will come immediately and swiftly to his temple, that is, the Church. And who will be able to conceive the day of his coming? If no one can conceive the day of his coming because of the power of his majesty, who will be able to endure it? And who will stand to see him, that is, who will be able to behold him in his glory with dimmed and blinded eyes, he who is the sun of righteousness, and in whose wings is healing? He will come like a consuming fire, and like the fuller's herb. For fire will burn before him, and around him will be a mighty tempest. Then He will call the heavens from above, and the earth, that He may judge His people. The rivers of fire will go before Him, and will engulf the sinners. The Lord is said to be a consuming fire (Deut. IV), that will burn up our wood, hay, and stubble. And not only fire; but also the herb of fullers, which in Hebrew is called Borith, and in the Septuagint πόαν, that is, the herb of fullers, they translate. For those who commit grave sins, it is a fire that melts and consumes; but for those who commit lesser sins, it is the herb of fullers that restores cleanliness, according to what is written in Isaiah: The Lord will wash away the filth of the sons and daughters of Zion, and will cleanse their blood from their midst, with the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning (Isai. IV). Those who have filth need the spirit of judgment in order to be cleansed; those who are full of blood need the spirit of burning in order for the blood that is externally attached to them to be removed. And the one who sits and melts and purifies like silver, according to Ezekiel (Chapter 22), whatever is mixed in our gold and silver, that is, in our understanding and speech, in bronze, tin, iron, and lead, let it be cooked in the furnace of the Lord, so that pure gold and silver may remain. And the Lord also says in the Gospel: I came to cast fire upon the earth, and what will I but that it be kindled (Luke 12:49); and he shall purify the sons of Levi. For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God (1 Peter 4:17). And elsewhere it is written: Begin at my sanctuary (Ezekiel 9:6). But in the sons of Levi: understand all priestly dignity. If, however, the priests are to be purified and worshiped, so that pure gold and silver may remain, what is to be said of the others? When they have been cleansed and purified, then they will offer righteous sacrifices to the Lord, and their sacrifice will be pleasing, which they offer for Judah and Jerusalem, that is, for those who confess the Lord and contemplate His peace with their minds, as in the days of old and the years of ancient times, so that just as they pleased God in the beginning, they may begin to please Him again after sin and repentance, having been cleansed from all the filth of sins. And I will approach, he says, to you in judgment, and I will be a swift witness. How great is the fear of judgment, when he himself is witness and judge. He is a witness against all wrongdoers and adulterers, for these crimes are committed in secret and therefore are brought to light, so that they may not remain hidden for long. After the wrongdoers come the adulterers: after the adulterers come the perjurers: after the perjurers come those who falsely accuse for the payment of a hireling, and they refuse to repay for the labor of their work that they owe. Widows and orphans are also understood to be falsely accused, and they oppress the stranger and foreigner, or at least the catechumen, who has not yet become a citizen of the city of Christ. And if they have not done all these things, it is enough for them to be punished, because they did not fear the Lord. Therefore, we should not consider perjury, not giving wages to the laborer, slandering the widow and the orphan, and oppressing the foreigner and the stranger as light sins: which are compared to wickedness, sorceries, and adultery. We understand this both according to history and according to metaphor, so that what was said at that time to the rulers of the Jews may now be said to the rulers of the Churches. And that which follows: I am the Lord and I do not change, he states this because he had said earlier: he is like a consuming fire, and like the soap of fullers, so that we do not think that he changes his divine nature, since he is called an angel, or fire, or Borith for us.


<h2 id='tocuniq19'>(Vers, 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6) And you, sons of Jacob, were not consumed. For from the days of your fathers, you have strayed from my commandments and have not kept them. LXX: And you, sons of Jacob, have not strayed from the sins of your fathers, you have turned away from my commandments, and have not kept them. As I said before: I will be a swift witness against sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers, those who exploit hired workers, widows and orphans, and those who oppress the foreigners, for they have not feared me, says the Lord of hosts. Calling Himself a just judge, He brought in the statement: 'I am the Lord and I do not change.' And the meaning is this: You are daily changed by wickedness, adultery, perjury, slander, and violence, but I, in judgment, am not swayed by the diversity of persons. And though I admit to being a severe and just judge, O sons of Jacob, you are not consumed by the variety of torments, according to what is written in Jeremiah: 'Without cause I struck your sons, you did not receive discipline' (Jer. 2:30): and you have not done this only recently, nor once, to merit forgiveness for your error, but you will have inherited impiety, departing from my statutes from the days of your fathers, and not keeping what I commanded. But the sons of Jacob according to the supplanter's reckoning, and the brothers of the original snatcher, who do not depart from the sins of their fathers, and deviate from what is lawful, and do not keep the commandments, let us understand those who in the Church constitution depart from vices, and falsely assume for themselves the name of Christian religion.

<h2 id='tocuniq20'>(Vers. 7 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 7 and following) Return to me, and I will return to you, says the Lord of hosts. But you say, 'How shall we return?' Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. But you say, 'How have we robbed you?' In your tithes and contributions. You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you. Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby put me to the test, says the Lord of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts. And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return? Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? And you say: in what way have we deceived you? Because the tithes and first fruits are with you, and you look upon them, and you defraud me ((or: deceive me)): the year is complete, and you have brought in the fruits into the storehouse, and there will be plunder in your houses. Therefore, return to this, says the Lord Almighty: unless I open for you the floodgates of heaven, and pour out my blessing upon you until it is sufficient, and I will divide food for you, and your land will not be destroyed, and your vineyard will not wither in the field, says the Lord Almighty: and all the nations will call you blessed, because you will be a land of delight, says the Lord Almighty. And in the beginning we said that Malachi should be understood as the prophet Ezra; and all the things that are written about him in history, are contained in this book as well: and now we say that during his time and that of Nehemiah (whom it is clear lived together) there was a very severe famine, and because of the famine there was a revolt, and the poor, compelled by the necessity of things, sold their sons and daughters, and all their possessions, and their entire substance. Finally they say: Our sons and daughters are too many, let us take their price in wheat, and eat and live. And there were those who said: Let us sell our fields and vineyards, and our houses, and let us take wheat in hunger. And I was angry, says Ezra, when I heard their outcry according to these words: and my heart thought within me, and I reproached the nobles and magistrates, and the rest. Therefore, during a time of famine, food was so scarce that they were forced to sell their own children, and even those who had little and had stored many crops in barns refused to give tithes out of necessity or due to the magnitude of the price to the Levites, who did not have a share in the inheritance of Judah; but the firstfruits and tithes were their inheritance. Lest it be thought to be ours, let us consider the testimony of Ezra: 'And I realized,' he said, 'that the portions of the Levites had not been given, and each one had fled to his own region from the Levites, from the singers, and from those who served. And I brought a complaint against the officials, and I said, 'Why have we abandoned the house of God?' And I gathered them together and made them stand in their stations. And all of Judah brought the tithes of grain, wine, and oil into the storehouses, and we appointed Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe (Nehemiah 13:10-11),' and so on. We have heard the story of Ezra, now let us repeat the words of the prophets, carefully considering whether the prophecy and the history agree. When it is said, 'Return to me, and I will return to you,' says the Lord Almighty, it is clear that those whom he exhorts to return have departed from the Lord. And behold the mercy of the Lord, he promises an equal return, so that the measure with which they have measured will be measured back to them (Matt. 7:1). And as it is written in Leviticus: 'If you walk contrary to me, then I will also walk contrary to you in fury' (Lev. 26:27-28). So now he encourages the people to return, so that he himself may also return to them. Those who do not understand that they have fallen away from the Lord impudently ask: Where are we returning to? And they say: When did we fall away, that we should be compelled to return? The Lord answered: If a man opposes God, because you are opposing me? The Hebrew word, which is written 'Hajecba', the LXX translated as 'if he supplants': for which Aquila, and Symmachus, and Theodotio substituted 'if he defrauds', so that the meaning is: If a man defrauds God, because you defraud me? And truly, according to the order of history, because the people did not give the tithes and firstfruits to the Levites, 977 the Lord says that he himself suffered fraud, whose ministers were forced by hunger and shortage to abandon the temple. For if he is visited by others in prison, if he is received as a sick person, and if he receives food and drink when hungry and thirsty, why should he not himself receive tithes from his own ministers, and if they are not given, be deprived of his own portion? What we have said, Hajecba interprets in the language of the Syrians and Chaldeans, if it is affixed: from where also we translated it many years ago, more towards the mystery of the Lord's passion, in which men crucified God, than towards tithes and firstfruits (by which one is visited in prison, and received by the sick, and receives food while hungry and thirsty, and is given to drink), referring to written things. Let the prudent reader inquire how our interpretation agrees with the following: In tithes and firstfruits, and see if we can say this: 'For you to crucify me: for you to lay wicked hands on your God', you have done by meditating upon many things, by withholding tithes and firstfruits, I do not say from my priests and Levites, but from me, who commanded them to be given through Moses (Exodus 23). This has been said to us about one word, leaving the judgment of understanding to the reader; now let us follow the order of prophecy. Because you have not given me tithes and firstfruits, therefore you are cursed with hunger and poverty, and you deceive me, or defraud and deprive me, the whole nation for the nation, which is written in Hebrew as Aggoi, the year Seventy was interpreted as a nation. And this is the meaning. Behold, the year has come to an end, and you have gathered nothing into my treasure, but into your barns: And for tithes and firstfruits, which were small, if given to me, you have lost the abundance of your possessions and all the abundance of crops. But in order for you to know, I, being angry with you, because you have cheated me of what is mine, urge and remind you to bring the tithes into the barns, that is, into the treasury of the temple, and let the priests and Levites, who minister to me, have food: and test me, if I will not pour out such great rains, that the floodgates of the heavens seem to be opened. And I will pour out blessing upon you until abundance. The word 'effusion' shows the name 'generosity'. But it is possible for fertility to exist in the fields that are irrigated by rain, yet locusts or weevils, or rust or caterpillars may destroy them, and the labors of humans perish. Therefore, He joins and says: And I will rebuke for you the devourer, namely the locust, and the rest that we have mentioned; and it shall not corrupt the fruit of your land. And vineyards will fill vine-presses also, and all nations around will marvel at the fertility of your land, to such an extent that everyone will desire to live in it, and the abundance of all things will be an example to all peoples. Understand also concerning tithes and first fruits, which were once given by the people to the priests and Levites, in the same way for the people of the Church, to whom it is commanded not only to give tithes and first fruits, but also to sell all that they have and give to the poor, and to follow the Lord Savior (Matthew 19 and Mark 10). But if we do not want to do this, let us at least imitate the beginnings of the Jews, so that we give a portion to the poor from the whole, and defer the due honor to the priests and Levites. Hence the Apostle says: Honor widows who are truly widows (I Tim. V, 3): and let the presbyter be honored with double honor, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine of God. Whoever does not do this is proved to defraud and supplant God, and is cursed in the lack of all things: as he who sows sparingly, shall also reap sparingly; and he who sows in blessings, shall gather abundant fruits in blessings (II Cor. IX, 6). If at any time hunger and poverty, and the lack of all things oppress the world: let us know that this comes from the anger of God, who speaks of being defrauded and deprived of their portion if the poor do not receive alms. We can interpret tithes and firstfruits in this way: if someone is learned and educated in the Law of God, they can teach others, but they should not attribute their knowledge and abilities to their own wisdom and talent, but rather give thanks first to God, who bestows everything, and then to his priests and teachers, from whom they have learned. For if one does not give thanks, but claims knowledge for oneself, they will be cursed in poverty. But if one, understanding God as the giver, and giving thanks to those through whom they have been taught by God, humbles oneself and brings the food into the storehouse of God, that is, ministers the nourishment of Holy Scripture to the people in the Church, then the floodgates of heaven will immediately open upon them, and a spiritual rain will pour forth, and God will command his clouds to rain upon them, and they will enjoy the abundance of all things, and God will even rebuke the devourer for their sake, bringing forth opposing strengths, and their efforts will bear fruit, and they will attain what is written: Blessed is the one who speaks into the ears of those who listen. He will also lift up his eyes and see the regions, for they are already white for harvesting (John 4); and he will gather fruits for eternal life. The vineyard in his field will not be sterile, as he who says in the Gospel: I am the vine (John 15, 1). And he who speaks through the prophet: I have planted a fruitful vineyard, the whole truth (Jeremiah 2, 21); and through humble confession, gratitude to God, and his teachers in the Church, he will attain such blessedness that all nations will call him blessed, and desire to dwell in his land and teachings, those who have heard him speaking in the Church.


<h2 id='tocuniq21'>(Vers. 13, seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 13 and following) Your words have become burdensome to me, says the Lord, and you have said: What have we spoken against you? You have said, 'It is vain to serve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his precepts, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts?' Therefore now we call the arrogant blessed, for they who practice wickedness are built up and they have tested God, and they have escaped.' LXX: You have wearied me with your words, says the Lord. And you said, 'In what way have we spoken against you?' And you said, 'It is vain to serve God; and what good is it that we have kept his ordinances, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts? And now we call the arrogant blessed. Yes, they who work wickedness are built up; yes, they tempted God and escaped.' In that, when you were saying 980: Whoever does evil is good in the sight of the Lord, and such people please Him; or certainly where is the God of judgment? Now, he repeats the same more fully: For the people who appeared to have knowledge of God and to observe the law, and to understand their sin, and to offer victims for their sins, to give tithes, to observe the Sabbath, and all the other things that are commanded by the Law of God, seeing that all the nations around them are abundant in all things, he was scandalized by his own poverty, hunger, and misery, and he said: What advantage is it to me that I worship the one true God, reject idols, and in sorrow I go before God with a guilty conscience? The 72nd Psalm, which we mentioned previously, continues more fully and extensively in the same place. Therefore, the prophet, who is a spiritual physician, heals all wounds and declares that blasphemous words against the Creator are cut off. And he speaks in the person of God, saying: 'Your words have prevailed against me, or they have become burdensome.' Indeed, according to Zachariah, wickedness sits upon a talent of lead (Zach. V): and what is said against God is crushed under the heavy weight of blasphemy. Those who do not understand the most serious words and their blasphemy ask, What have we spoken against you? To whom the Lord replied: You have said, It is in vain to serve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his precepts? In this present world they demand reward for serving God, therefore they do not receive it. And because we have walked sorrowful before the Lord, according to what is written in the Psalms: All the day long I walked in sadness (Psalm 37:7). Therefore, we call those arrogant individuals blessed, who boast against God and hurl impious blasphemies. Indeed, they have been successful and enjoy prosperity even after their crimes and blasphemies. They have tested God, whether they resist Him or not, and have been saved. They consider worldly health and happiness to be salvation, and therefore they are deceived by errors. We can understand this about the heretics Marcion and Valentinus, and others who do not accept the Old Testament and speak against the Creator of the world, that they make progress in their impiety and have many partners in crime. Those who are scandalized by them, but persevere in the Church, and are ignorant of the reasons for God's judgment, weave together the words of the prophets.

(Verse 16) Then those who feared God spoke to one another. LXX: These are the ones who spoke, those who fear the Lord, each one to his neighbor. According to the Hebrews, it is to be understood in this way: those who blaspheme against God's judgment, those who fear God have spoken to one another, that the retribution of good or evil is not in the present and brief age, but in the future and eternal; and that man cannot know God's judgments and argue about his fairness and justice; and other things that a just person should speak with a just person. And he did not say what they had spoken; but from what he brought forth: Then they spoke, fearing God, each with their neighbor, we must understand that those who feared God spoke what is contained in the words of all the Scriptures. But according to the LXX it should be read as exceptional, and with a strong voice, so that we may say: These are the ones who spoke, fearing the Lord, each to their neighbor: that is, those who boast in vain and say, 'What is the benefit, because we have kept his commandments and walked sorrowfully before the Lord?' For if they feared the Lord, they would not say such things.

(Ver. 17, 18.) And the Lord waited, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and meditate on His name. 'They shall be Mine,' says the Lord of hosts, 'on the day that I make them My special possession. And I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him. Then you shall again discern between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him.' LXX: And the Lord waited, and heard, and wrote a book of remembrance in His sight for those who fear the Lord and revere His name. And they shall be mine, says the Almighty Lord, on the day that I make, as a possession, and I will choose them as a man chooses his own son who serves him. And you shall return and see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him. These are the words of the righteous and those who fear God, speaking to each other and not wanting to hear or speak blasphemy. The Lord listens and hears, and a book of remembrance is written before him for those who fear and think of his name, so that when the day of judgment comes, he may give punishment to the blasphemers and rewards to those who fear him. However, a book was written, about which we read in Daniel: Thrones were set up, and books were opened (Dan. VII, 10). And they will be a possession of the Lord of hosts, in the day when the time of judgment comes. In Hebrew, possession is called Sgolla (), which Aquila interpreted as περιούσιον, and the others as περιποίησιν. Therefore, those who fear the Lord, those who have spoken with their neighbor and have answered words of blasphemy, will be a possession on the day of judgment, and He will spare them, because every man is under sin. Whether you choose them, just as a man chooses his son to be his servant. In this there is a twofold affection, both of a father towards his son, and of servitude towards a servant. And then those of you who now blaspheme and say: What benefit is it, because we have kept his commandments, and have walked sadly before the Lord? From their choice and happiness, you will know their misery, and turned to repentance, you will see what difference there is between the just and the wicked, and between one who serves God and one who does not serve Him.

(Chapter 4, verse 1 onward) Behold, for the day is coming, burning like a furnace, when all the proud and all the evildoers will be stubble; and the coming day will set them ablaze, says the Lord of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch. But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall. And you shall trample the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day when I act, says the Lord of hosts. LXX: For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven, when it will burn them up, and all the aliens and all the evildoers will be stubble; the day that is coming shall set them ablaze, says the Lord of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch. But for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall rise, with healing in its wings. You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall. And you shall tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet, on the day when I act, says the Lord of hosts. For the wicked have made me labor in their speeches, and have said: Every one that doth evil, is good in the sight of the Lord, and such please him: and if it be not so, who will confront him? and since he is good to those who serve him not, they have said: Where is the God of justice? And behold I speak these things to justify myself, for I am full of complaints against the ungodly; but if I had a cause, I would just speak, and would not fear him as he is. And when He shall have inflamed and burnt them, He will leave in them no root nor germ of wickedness. This is what the impious will suffer on the day of judgment. On the contrary, it is said what will happen to those who fear the name of God: And the sun of justice shall rise upon you, who ((elsewhere: because)) will judge all things truly: and neither good nor evil, neither virtues nor vices, shall be able to remain hidden. And health shall be in His wings, to carry the repentant on His shoulders, according to what is written in Deuteronomy: Spreading His wings, He has received them, and has carried them on His shoulders. (Deut. XXII, 11). Then those who are now included in the world as if in prison will go out, and they will leap like calves from the herd, or like calves freed from chains. Hence the Apostle says: I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ (Philippians 1:23), so that he may go out and leap like a calf freed from chains, and like a victim of the Lord. And he is not content with the end of this joy; but he will trample on the wicked when they become ashes. Hence, there is also an imprecation for the righteous: But the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet swiftly (Romans 16:20). Abraham spoke to the Lord, feeling himself to be like the ashes of divine majesty: 'I am dust and ashes' (Gen. XVIII, 27); and therefore he will see the sun of justice, and will rest among its chosen ones, and carried by him, he will be raised up to the heavens. But he, through pride, said: 'I will set my throne above the stars, I will be like the Most High' (Isai. XIV, 13); he will be cast down to the earth, and will be like ashes under the feet of the holy ones, when the day of the Lord of judgment comes.

(Verse 4.) Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments. Likewise in the Septuagint. The just retribution in the future will be righteous, when the flame will devour and burn the root and offspring of the proud, and the sun of righteousness will rise for those who fear the Lord, with healing in its wings. Therefore remember the law of Moses my servant, which I gave him on Mount Horeb, which is Sinai, for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments. But the Apostle says: We know that the law is spiritual (Rom. VII, 14); and blessed David: Open my eyes, and I will consider the wonders of your law (Ps. CXVIII, 18); and because all ate the heavenly manna in a spiritual manner, and the whole people of Israel drank from the same spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ. (I Cor. X, 3, 4); those who believe in Christ must spiritually observe the precepts of the law, which were given in Horeb (which means dryness), through which the moisture of all vices is dried up, and to the rays of the sun of justice, the rheum of lust is dried. But the Lord spoke to all of Israel, who understands with their heart God, and of whom it is said in the Gospel: Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God (Matt. 5:8).

<h2 id='tocuniq26'>(Vers. 5, 6.)</h2>

(Ver. 5, 6.) Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet, before the great and dreadful day of the Lord comes: and he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with a curse. LXX: Behold, I will send you Elijah the Tishbite, before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes: he will turn the heart of the father to the son, and the heart of man to his neighbor; lest I come and strike the earth completely. After Moses (whose commands we have taught are to be observed spiritually), Jesus says that Elijah must be sent: in Moses, the Law, in Elijah, signifying prophecy, as Abraham said to a certain wealthy man dressed in purple: They have Moses and the prophets, let them listen to them (Luke 16:29). And the Lord and Savior, transfigured on the mountain, was speaking with Moses and Elijah in radiant clothing, who were also telling him what he would suffer in Jerusalem (Mark 9): for the Law and the chorus of all the prophets proclaim the passion of Christ. Therefore, before the day of judgment comes, and the Lord strikes the earth with a curse, either utterly or suddenly, as the LXX translated it (for this signifies ἀρδὴν), the Lord will send Elijah (who is interpreted as 'my God' and is from the city of Thesbi, which means 'conversion' and 'repentance') to convert the hearts of the fathers to the children, namely, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and all the patriarchs, so that their descendants may believe in the Lord and Savior, in whom they also believed. For Abraham saw the day of the Lord and rejoiced (John 8:56), that is, the heart of the father to the son, that is, the heart of God to every one who has received the spirit of adoption. And the heart of the children to their fathers, like the Jews and Christians, who now disagree among themselves, may they agree equally in the religion of Christ. Hence it is said to the apostles, who spread the seed of the Gospel throughout the whole world: For your fathers have begotten sons for you (Ps. 44:17). For if Elijah does not convert the heart of the fathers to the children beforehand, and the heart of the children to their fathers, when the great and terrible day comes (great for the saints, terrible for sinners), the true and just judge will strike, not the heavens, nor those who dwell in heaven, but the earth with a curse, those who perform earthly works. The Jews and the Judaizing heretics believe that Elijah will come before their own Messiah and will restore all things. Hence, in the Gospel, a question is posed to Christ: Why do the Pharisees say that Elijah will come? To which He responded: Elijah will indeed come, and if you believe, he has already come, referring to John the Baptist as Elijah.
