<h2 id='tocuniq2'>Prologue</h2>

There were many who wrote the Gospels, and Luke the evangelist testifies, saying: Indeed, many have attempted to arrange the narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning and became servants of the word. And their perseverance until the present time declares the monuments, which were published by various authors and were the beginnings of diverse heresies, such as that according to the Egyptians, and Thomas, and Matthew, and Bartholomew, and also the twelve apostles, and Basilides and Apelles, and others, whom it is a very long task to enumerate. However, it is necessary to say only this for the present, that there have been some who have attempted to arrange the narrative more as an order of events than to weave the truth of history with the spirit and grace of God. To whom can that prophetic utterance be applied: Woe to those who prophesy from their own heart, who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing. (Ezekiel 13:3) Of whom the Savior also speaks in the Gospel of John: All who came before me are thieves and robbers. (John 10:8) They came, but were not sent. For he himself says: They were coming, and I was not sending them. (Jeremiah 14:14; and 23:21) To those who come, there is a presumption of rashness; to those who are sent, there is an obligation of servitude. But the Church, which is founded on the rock of the Lord's word, which the king introduced into his chamber  (Song of Songs I and II) , and to which he reached out his hand through the hidden opening  (Song of Songs V) , is like a young doe and a little deer  (Song of Songs II, 9) , gushing forth four rivers like the paradise  (Genesis II) , having four corners and rings, through which it is carried like the ark of the Testament and the guardian of the Law of the Lord, by immovable wood  (Exodus XXV, 10 et seq.) .



Matthew is the first of all, a tax collector by the name of Levi, who published the Gospel in Judea in the Hebrew language, mainly for the sake of those who believed in Jesus from among the Jews, and did not observe the shadow of the Law once the truth of the Gospel had come. Mark is the second, the interpreter of the apostle Peter, and the first bishop of the church in Alexandria. Although he himself did not see the Lord Savior, he narrated the deeds according to the faith of what he had heard the Master preach, rather than in chronological order. Lucas, the third physician, from Syria Antioch (whose praise is in the Gospel), who himself was a disciple of the apostle Paul, composed a volume in the regions of Achaia and Boeotia (2 Corinthians 8), delving into certain things deeper and, as he himself confesses in the preface, describing what he heard more than what he saw. John, the last apostle and evangelist, whom Jesus loved greatly, who reclined on the chest of the Lord (John 13 and 21), drank from the purest streams of doctrine, and alone deserved to hear from the cross: Behold, your mother (John 19:27). When he was in Asia, and the seeds of heretics Cerinthus, Ebion, and others who deny that Christ came in the flesh were already sprouting (whom he himself in his epistle calls antichrists (I John 2:18), and the apostle Paul frequently rebukes (Romans 3; 2 Corinthians 5)), he was compelled by almost all the bishops of Asia at that time, and by the embassies of many Churches, to write more deeply about the divinity of the Savior, and to break forth to Him (so to speak), the Word of God, not so much with audacity as with fortunate boldness. And the Ecclesiastical History recounts that, when he was compelled by the brothers to write, he responded that he would do so if they all prayed to God together with a declared fast. And when this was fulfilled, being filled with revelation, coming to a preface, he exclaimed from heaven: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. This was in the beginning with God (John 1). Therefore, these four Gospels were predicted long before, and it also proves the volume of Ezekiel, in which the first vision is woven as follows: And in the midst there was a likeness of four living creatures: and the appearance of their faces was like the face of a man, and the face of a lion, and the face of a calf, and the face of an eagle (Ezekiel 1:5 and 10). The first face of a man signifies Matthew, who begins to write as if from man: The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham (Matt. 1). The second [face] signifies Mark, in whom the voice of a roaring lion is heard in the wilderness: The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths (Mark 1:3). The third signifies a calf, which signifies that the evangelist Luke took his beginning from the priest Zacharias. On the fourth, John the Evangelist, who had assumed eagle's wings and was hastening to higher things, discusses the Word of God. The rest of what follows advances in the same sense. Their legs were straight, and they had feathered feet, and wherever the spirit went, they went, and they did not turn back: and their backs were full of eyes, and sparks and torches running in between, and a wheel within a wheel, and on each of the four sides there were faces. Therefore, the Apocalypse of John, after the exposition of the twenty-four elders who were holding harps and bowls, adored the Lamb of God, introduces lightning, and thunder, and seven spirits running, and a sea of glass, and four animals full of eyes (Apoc. IV and V), saying: The first animal was like a lion, and the second was like a calf, and the third was like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle. And a little later: They were full, he says, in their eyes, and they did not have rest day and night, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come (Rev. 4:7-8). By all these things it is clearly shown that only the four Gospels should be accepted, and all the foolishness of the apocrypha should be sung to the dead heretics rather than the living Church. And I am quite surprised, beloved Eusebius, why, suddenly setting sail for Rome, you wanted this present of mine to be given to you as a kind of provision, so that, briefly explaining Matthew, I might compress it in words and expand it in meaning. If you remember my response, you would never ask for years in a few days. First of all, it is difficult to read all those who have written on the Gospels 7-8. Then, it is much more difficult, with judgment applied, to receive the best ones. I admit that I read, many years ago, twenty-five volumes of Origen on Matthew, as well as his Homilies and his commatic interpretation. And also the Commentaries of Theophilus, bishop of the city of Antioch, of the martyr Hippolytus and of Theodore, bishop of Heraclea. And those of Apollinaris of Laodicea and Didymus of Alexandria. And of the Latin authors, Hilary, Victorinus, Fortunatianus' little works, from which, even if I were to omit some small parts, something worthy would still be written in memory. But you, within two weeks, with Easter approaching and the winds blowing, force me to dictate: when the notaries should be present, when the documents should be written, when they should be corrected, and how much time should be allowed for clarification. Especially since you know that I have been ill for three months, barely able to begin walking now; and I cannot make up for the magnitude of the work with the brevity of time. Therefore, setting aside the authority of the Ancients, whom I have neither the ability to read nor follow, I have briefly arranged the historical interpretation that you particularly demanded; and at times I have mixed in the flowers of spiritual insight, reserving the complete work for the future. But if my life should be longer, or if you fulfill your promises on your return, then I will strive to complete what remains, rather I will lay the foundations and partially construct the walls, and I will place a most beautiful pinnacle, so that you may know the difference between sudden boldness in dictation and thorough diligence in writing. Surely you know, and I would be ashamed to call you as a witness to my lies, that I have dictated this small work with such speed that you might think I am more inclined to read the works of others than to compose my own. And do not think that this is said out of arrogance and confidence in my abilities, but rather because I want to show you how much influence you have with me, as I would rather endanger myself for the sake of the learned than deny you anything you diligently ask for. Therefore, I beg you, if my speech is unpolished and my words are not flowing as smoothly as usual, attribute it to my haste, not my incompetence, and when you come to Rome, bring copies with you for the Virgin Christ the Prince, who has asked me to write on the Song of Songs. Due to a prolonged illness, I have postponed my hopes for completing this work in the future. I am imposing this condition on you, that if you are to keep the writings I send to you, she must also seal them in a small chest and write her own replies afterwards.



<h2 id='tocuniq3'>Book One</h2>

Book One

<h2 id='tocuniq4'>9 (Caput I.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

9 (Chapter I - Verse 1) The book of the generation of Jesus Christ. In Isaiah we read: Who shall declare his generation (Isaiah 53: 8)? Therefore, we cannot say that the Evangelist is contradicting the prophet, as what the prophet said was impossible to express, the Evangelist begins to narrate here: because there the generation of divinity is spoken of, while here the incarnation is spoken of. But he begins with the physical, so that we may begin to say that God is man through a human.

Sons of David, sons of Abraham. Abraham begot Isaac. Isaac, however, begot Jacob. Jacob, however, begot Judah and his brothers. A reverse order, but necessarily rearranged. For if Abraham had been placed first, and then David: Abraham would have had to be repeated, so that the series of generations would be covered. Therefore, among others being omitted, he called them sons; because the promise regarding Christ was made to them alone, to Abraham: In your seed, all nations will be blessed (Gen. XXII, 18), which is Christ. To David: I will set the fruit of your womb upon your throne. (Psalm 132:11)

<h2 id='tocuniq5'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) But Judas begot Phares and Zaram of Thamar. Phares begot Esron. Esron begot Aram. Aram begot Aminadab. Aminadab begot Naasson. It should be noted in the genealogy of the Savior that no holy women are included; only those whom Scripture reproaches, since He came for sinners, being born of sinners, in order to erase the sins of all. Therefore, even in the following generations, Ruth the Moabitess and Bathsheba the wife of Uriah are mentioned.



<h2 id='tocuniq6'>(Vers. 4 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 4 seqq.) Naasson, however, fathered Salmon. Salmon, however, fathered Boaz by Rahab. Boaz, however, fathered Obed by Ruth. Obed, however, fathered Jesse. Jesse, however, fathered King David. David, however, king, fathered Solomon by her who had been Uriah's. Solomon, however, fathered Rehoboam. Rehoboam, however, fathered Abijah. Abijah, however, fathered Asa. Asa, however, fathered Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat, however, fathered Joram. This is Naasson, the prince of the tribe of Judah, as we read in Numbers (Num. I and II).



Joram, however, begot Oziam. Ozias, however, begot Joathan. Joathan, however, begot Achaz. Achaz, however, begot Ezechiam. Ezechias, however, begot Manassen. Manasses, however, begot Amon. Amon, however, begot Josiam. Josias, however, begot Jechoniam and his brothers in the Babylonian exile. In the fourth book of Kings (Ch. III, VIII and following), we read that Joram was begotten by Ochoziam, and after his death, Josabeth, daughter of King Joram and sister of Ochozia, took Joas, the son of her brother, and rescued him from the slaughter that was being carried out by Athalia (or Atholia). His son Amasias succeeded him to the kingdom, and after him his son Azarias, who is also called Ozias (or Ochozias). His son Joathan succeeded him. Therefore, you can see that according to the history, there were three kings in the middle whom the Evangelist omitted: for Joram did not beget Ozias, but Ochozias, and the others we mentioned. However, because it was the intent of the Evangelist to list three sets of fourteen generations in different periods of time, and Joram had married the most wicked Jezabel, his memory is removed up to the third generation, so as not to be included in the order of the holy birth.



<h2 id='tocuniq7'>(Vers. 12 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 12 and following) And after the Babylonian exile, Jechonias fathered Salathiel. Salathiel fathered Zorobabel. Zorobabel fathered Abiud. Abiud fathered Eliacim. Eliacim fathered Azor. Azor fathered Sadoc. Sadoc fathered Achim. Achim fathered Eliud. Eliud fathered Eleazar. Eleazar fathered Matthan. Matthan fathered Jacob. If we were to place Jechonias at the end of the first fourteen generations, in the next there would not be fourteen but thirteen. Therefore, let us know that Jeconiah is the same person as Joachim, the former being the father and the latter being the son; the former is written with 'c' and 'm', while the latter is written with 'ch' and 'n'. This confusion arose due to errors of the scribes and the passage of time among both the Greeks and the Latins.

<h2 id='tocuniq8'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Ver. 16) But Jacob begot Joseph. Here Julianus Augustus has presented to us the disagreement of the Evangelists, why the evangelist Matthew called Joseph the son of Jacob, and Luke called him the son of Heli; not understanding the custom of the Scriptures, that one is according to nature, the other according to the Law his father. For we know this by the command of God given through Moses, that if a brother or relative without children dies, another should take his wife to raise up offspring for his brother or relative (Deut. II). Both Africanus, a historian of the time, and Eusebius of Caesarea extensively debated in their books the discrepancies in the Gospels.

<h2 id='tocuniq9'>(Vers 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) The man of Mary, from whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ. When you hear the word 'man', do not entertain the suspicion of marriage; but remember the custom of the Scriptures, that the husband is called the spouse of the bride.

<h2 id='tocuniq10'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) And from the deportation to Babylon to Christ, fourteen generations. Count from Jechoniah to Joseph, and you will find thirteen generations. Therefore, the fourteenth generation will be reckoned to be in Christ himself.

But the generation of Christ was as follows. Let the diligent reader inquire and say: Since Joseph is not the father of the Lord Savior, why does the order of the generation lead to Joseph? To this we will first respond that it is not the usual practice of the Scriptures to trace the order of women in generations. Furthermore, Joseph and Mary were from the same tribe, so according to the Law, Joseph had to take her as a relative, and they were both counted in Bethlehem, being from the same lineage.



When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, why is she conceived not from a simple virgin, but from a betrothed one? First, so that through the generation, the origin of Mary could be shown by Joseph. Second, so that she would not be stoned by the Jews as an adulteress. Third, so that fleeing to Egypt, she would have the comfort of her husband. Ignatius the Martyr also added a fourth cause as to why she was conceived from the betrothed one: in order to hide the birth from the devil, while he thought it was not from a virgin, but from a wife.



Before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit. And Joseph her husband, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.' All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: 'Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel' (which means, God with us). When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.

<h2 id='tocuniq11'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Ver. 19.) But Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing publicly to expose her, was minded privately to put her away. But while he thought on these things, behold the angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying: If any man take her as wife that has been defiled, her defilement is upon him (1 Cor. VI, 16). And it is commanded in the Law, not only guilty persons, but also those who have knowledge of the crime, to be subject to punishment (Lev. V): how then does Joseph, who conceals the crime of his wife, deserve to be called just? But this is a testimony to Mary, that Joseph knowing her chastity, and wondering at what had happened, kept silent about it, not understanding its mystery.



<h2 id='tocuniq12'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20.) Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son. And as we said before, the term 'spouses' is used for wives, as the book against Helvidius explains more fully. And an angel speaks to Joseph in a dream with gentle affection, to confirm the righteousness of his silence. It is also noteworthy that Joseph is said to be the son of David, in order to show that Mary is also from the line of David.



<h2 id='tocuniq13'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21.) And you shall call his name Jesus. For he will save his people from their sins. Jesus means 'Savior' in Hebrew. The evangelist noted the etymology of his name, saying: 'You shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people.'

<h2 id='tocuniq14'>(Vers. 22 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 22 onwards) Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him. And all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: Behold, a virgin shall conceive in her womb. But the prophet, because he predicts the future, signifies what is going to happen, and he writes, he will receive: but the evangelist, because he narrates a story not about the future but about the past, changed he will receive to he has received. For he who has, will by no means receive. We read something similar in the Psalms: You have ascended on high, you have led captivity captive: you have received gifts among men (Ps. 67:19). The apostle, in citing this testimony, did not say he received, but he gave: because there it signified about the future that he would receive; here it narrates about the one who had already given what he had received.



<h2 id='tocuniq15'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) And he took his wife, and did not know her until she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name Jesus. From this passage, some very perverse people suspect and say that Mary had other children, arguing that the term firstborn is only used when someone has siblings. However, this is contrary to the custom in the divine scriptures, where the term firstborn is not applied to someone who has siblings, but to the one who is born first. Read the aforementioned book against Helvidius.



<h2 id='tocuniq16'>(Chap. II.—Vers. 2 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 2, Verses 2 and following) For we have seen his star in the East, and have come to worship him. When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. To confound the Jews and make them understand the birth of Christ from the Gentiles, a star rises in the East, which the successors of Balaam, through prophecy, had known. Read the book of Numbers (Chapter XXIV). The magi, however, were guided by a star to Judea, so that when questioned by the priests, they would be able to give an account of the coming of Christ.

<h2 id='tocuniq17'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5) But they said to him: in Bethlehem of Judea. For thus it is written by the prophet: And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the leaders of Judah. For from you shall come forth a ruler, who will shepherd my people Israel. This is an error of the scribes. We think that it was first written by the evangelist, as we read in the Hebrew itself, 'of Judah,' not 'of Judea.' For what other Bethlehem of the nations is there, that it should be distinguished here as 'of Judea'? But it is called Judaea for this reason, because there is another Bethleem in Galilee. Read the book of Joshua the son of Nun (Joshua 19). Finally, even in the testimony itself, which is taken from the prophecy of Micah, it is written thus: And you, O Bethlehem, land of Judah (Micah 5:2).

<h2 id='tocuniq18'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) And opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh. The presbyter Juvencus beautifully captures the significance of the gifts in one verse.

Thus, they bring gifts of gold, myrrh, and incense to the king, the people, and the God.

And having received an answer in a dream, they returned to their own country by another way, so as not to go back to Herod. Those who had presented gifts to the Lord subsequently received a response. However, the response (which is called χρηματισθέντες in Greek) was not made through an angel, but through the Lord Himself, in order to demonstrate the privilege of Joseph's merits. They returned by another way because they were not to mix with the unfaithfulness and treachery of the Jews.



<h2 id='tocuniq19'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Vers. 13, 14.) Behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying: Rise and take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For it will come to pass that Herod will seek the child to destroy him. So Joseph rose and took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt; and he stayed there until the death of Herod. When he takes the child and his mother to go to Egypt, he takes them by night and in darkness; but when he returns to Judea, neither night nor darkness are mentioned in the Gospel.



<h2 id='tocuniq20'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Verse 15, 16.) So that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: Out of Egypt I called my son. Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men. Let those who deny the truth of the Hebrew scriptures answer where this is read in the Septuagint translators. But since they did not find it, we will tell them it is written in the prophet Hosea (Chapter 11), as they can also confirm with the copies we recently published. However, we can reconcile (or console) this passage differently for the contentious, whose behavior the Apostle Paul denies having. And we present the testimony from Numbers, with Balaam saying: God has called him out of Egypt; His glory is like a unicorn (Numbers 23:22).



<h2 id='tocuniq21'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 17 seqq.) Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying: A voice was heard in Ramah, sobbing and loud lamentation; Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be consoled, since they are no more (Jerem. XXXI, 15). But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying: Rise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel. From Rachel was born Benjamin, in whose tribe Bethlehem is not (Genes. XXXV). Therefore, it is asked how Rachel mourns the sons of Judah, that is, Bethlehem, as if they were her own. We will answer briefly, because she is buried near Bethlehem in Ephrath, and from the maternal womb, she received the name of the mother's lodging. Whether because Judah and Benjamin were two joined tribes, and Herod had ordered not only the killing of children in Bethlehem, but also in all its borders. By the slaughter of Bethlehem, we understand that many from Benjamin were also killed. But she wept for her children, and she did not receive consolation, according to a twofold interpretation. Either because she considered them dead for eternity, or because she did not want to console herself about those whom she knew would survive. But what is said in Rama, let us not think that this is the name of a place, near Gabaa, but 'rama' is interpreted as 'an elevated place', so the meaning is: A voice was heard in an elevated place, that is, far and wide dispersed.

<h2 id='tocuniq22'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) For those who sought the child's life are dead. From this we understand that not only Herod, but also the priests and scribes at the same time had planned the death of the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq23'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21.) He rose and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. He did not say, 'I took my son and my wife,' but the child and his mother, as if a foster father, not a husband.

<h2 id='tocuniq24'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22) But hearing that Archelaus was reigning in Judea, in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee. Many fall into error due to ignorance of history, thinking that he is the same Herod who mocked the Lord in his passion, and who is reported to be dead now. Therefore, this Herod, who later became friends with Pilate, is the son of that Herod, the brother of Archelaus; and Tiberius Caesar himself, the city of Lugdunum, which is in Gaul, banished him, and made his brother Herod successor to the kingdom. Read the story of Joseph.

<h2 id='tocuniq25'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) And coming, he lived in a city called Nazareth, so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene. If he had set a fixed example from the Scriptures, he would never have said, what was spoken by the prophets; but simply, what was spoken by the prophet: but now, calling them prophets in the plural, he shows that he did not take words from the Scriptures, but the meaning. Nazarene, interprets as holy. But all Scripture testifies that the Lord would be holy. We can also say in another way, that even in the same words, according to the Hebrew truth, it is written in Isaiah: There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Nazarene shall rise out of his roots (Isa. 11:1).

<h2 id='tocuniq26'>(Chap. III.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter III - Verse 1) Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near. John the Baptist proclaims the kingdom of heaven, honoring the Lord as its precursor with this privilege.

<h2 id='tocuniq27'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) For this is he who is spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: 'The voice of one crying out in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.' He was preparing the souls of the believers, in whom the Lord was going to walk, to walk in the purest ways, saying: 'I will dwell in them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people' (Leviticus 26:12). Porphyry compares this passage to the beginning of the Gospel of Mark, where it is written: 'The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as it is written in the prophet Isaiah: Behold, I send my angel before your face, who will prepare your way.' The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths. (Isa. XL, 3). For even though the testimony is from Malachi (Chap. III) and connected to Isaiah, it is asked how we can consider it as an example taken from one Isaiah. This question was answered fully by learned scholars. However, we think that the name of Isaiah was added by mistake of the scribes, which we can also prove in other places, or certainly from the fact that different testimonies of the Scriptures have become one body. Read the thirteenth Psalm, and you will find the same.

<h2 id='tocuniq28'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) Now John himself had a garment made of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. He said, 'It is made of hair, not wool.' The type of clothing indicates austerity, not luxury. The leather belt that he wore, just like Elijah, is a symbol of mortification (IV Kings 1). Furthermore, what follows is...

But his food was locusts and wild honey. It is fitting for a dweller of solitude to fulfill not the delights of food, but the necessity of human flesh.

<h2 id='tocuniq29'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse. 9.) God is able to raise up children of Abraham from these stones. He calls them ethnic stones because of the hardness of the heart. Read Ezekiel: I will take away the heart of stone from you and give you a heart of flesh (Ezek. XXXVI, 26). In the stone, hardness is shown, in the flesh, softness is shown. Or it simply indicates the power of God, that he who created everything out of nothing can also create a people from the hardest stones.



<h2 id='tocuniq30'>(Vers. 10, 11.)</h2>

(Verse 10, 11.) For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. I indeed baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I. The preaching of the Gospel word, which is sharp on both sides, is called an axe, according to the prophet Jeremiah, who compares the word of the Lord to an axe cutting through a rock (Jeremiah 46).



Whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. In another Gospel: Whose, he said, I am not worthy to untie the strap of his shoe: here humility is shown, there mystery is demonstrated, that Christ is the bridegroom, and John does not deserve to untie the bridegroom's shoe, lest his house be called according to the law of Moses, and the example of Ruth, the house of the barefoot (Deut. XXV, and Ruth. IV).

<h2 id='tocuniq31'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor, and gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. This is because the Holy Spirit is like a fire, as the Acts of the Apostles teach, which, when it descended, sat upon each of them like tongues of fire (Acts 2); and the word of the Lord was fulfilled when He said, 'I came to send fire upon the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled' (Luke 12:49). Whether it be because in the present we are baptized by the Spirit, and in the future by fire. The Apostle also concurs with this meaning: The work of each one shall be made manifest: for the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire. (1 Corinthians 3:13).

<h2 id='tocuniq32'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verse 13, 14.) Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John to be baptized by him. But John tried to prevent him, saying: I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me? But Jesus answered and said to him: The Savior accepted baptism from John for three reasons. First, to fulfill all righteousness and humility of the Law, because he was born as a human. Second, to confirm the baptism of John with his own baptism. Third, as Jordan sanctified the waters, by the descent of the dove, the Holy Spirit would show forth the coming in the baptism of believers.

<h2 id='tocuniq33'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) Without measure. He spoke beautifully, without measure, to show Christ in water, John to be baptized by Christ in spirit. Or differently, without measure: so that I, who assumed the form of a servant, may fulfill his humility. Otherwise, know that you shall be baptized by me in the day of my judgment. Without measure, says the Lord Jesus, I have another baptism by which I must be baptized. You baptize me in water, so that I may baptize you for me in your blood.



<h2 id='tocuniq34'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16) For thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he let him go. And Jesus, having been baptized, immediately came up from the water. He did not add the righteousness of the Law or of nature, so that we may understand both: if God accepted baptism from a man, let no one refuse to accept it from a servant.

<h2 id='tocuniq35'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) And behold, the heavens were opened for him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon him. And behold, a voice from heaven, saying: 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.' The mystery of the Trinity is demonstrated in the baptism: the Lord is baptized, the Spirit descends in the form of a dove, and the voice of the Father, testifying to the Son, is heard. The heavens are opened not by the opening of the elements, but by spiritual eyes; as Ezekiel also mentions in the beginning of his book that they were opened. And the dove also sat upon the head of Jesus, so that no one would think that the voice of the Father was made to John, not to the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq36'>(Chap. IV.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 4 - Verse 1) Then Jesus was led into the desert by the spirit. There is no doubt that it was the Holy Spirit. It follows:

In order to be tempted by the devil. However, he is led not unwillingly or captivated, but by his own will to fight.

<h2 id='tocuniq37'>20 (Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Ver. 2.) And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry. And the tempter coming, said to him: If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. In this number of forty, the sacrament is shown to us, in which Moses also fasted on Mount Sinai (Exodus XXIV), and Elias near Mount Horeb (3 Kings XIX). But it is allowed to be hungry in the body, so that an opportunity for tempting by the devil may be given.

<h2 id='tocuniq38'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) Say that these stones become bread. It is fittingly said to the hungry: say that these stones become bread. You are tempting him with two opposing arguments, O devil. If these stones can become bread at his command, then you are foolishly tempting someone of such great power. But if he cannot do it, then you are foolishly suspecting the Son of God. If you are the Son of God, say that these stones become bread.

<h2 id='tocuniq39'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) He answered and said: It is written: Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God. The testimony is taken from Deuteronomy (Deut. VIII, 3). The Lord responded in this way because His intention was to overcome the devil through humility, not power. It should also be noted that if the Lord had not begun to fast, the devil would not have had an opportunity to tempt Him, according to this: My son, when you come to serve God, prepare yourself for trials, and put your soul in order (Eccli. II, 1). But the very response of the Savior indicates that he was a man who was tempted. Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Therefore, if anyone does not feed on the word of God, he does not live.

<h2 id='tocuniq40'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) Then the devil took him to the holy city. This assumption, which is called, does not come from the weakness of the Lord, but from the pride of the enemy, who thinks that the will of the Savior is a necessity. From this passage, however, it is understood what is meant by what is written in another place: They went into the holy city and appeared to many (Matthew 27:53).

<h2 id='tocuniq41'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) And he set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'

If you are the Son of God. In all temptations, the devil does this in order to see if you are the Son of God; but the Lord responds in such a way as to leave him in doubt.

Send yourself downward. For it is written: The voice of the devil, who always desires everyone to fall downward, says, Send yourself downward, it can persuade, it cannot force.

He has commanded his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. We read this in the ninety-first psalm, but there it is not about Christ, but about a holy man, a prophet. Therefore, the devil misinterprets the Scriptures. Surely if he truly knew that it was written about the Savior, he should have also said what follows in the same psalm against himself: You will tread on the lion and the serpent; you will trample the young lion and the serpent. He speaks of the assistance of angels as if speaking to a weak person: he is silent about his own trampling as if a turncoat.

<h2 id='tocuniq42'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) Jesus said to him again: It is written: You shall not tempt the Lord your God. He breaks the false arrows of the devil's scriptures with the true shields of the scriptures. And it should be noted that he presented only the necessary testimonies from Deuteronomy, to show the sacraments of the second law.

<h2 id='tocuniq43'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) Again, the devil took him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, and said to him, 'All these things I will give you if you fall down and worship me.' The glory of the world, which is passing away with the world, is shown on the mountain and on the pinnacle. But the Lord descends to humble and lowly places in order to overcome the devil through humility. Furthermore, the devil hastens to lead him to the mountains, so that through the same mountains by which he himself fell, others may fall as well, according to the saying of the Apostle: 'Lest he be lifted up with pride and fall into the judgment of the devil' (1 Timothy 3:6).



<h2 id='tocuniq44'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) I will give you all these things if you fall down and worship me. Even in this boasting, the arrogant and proud one speaks: not because he has power over the whole world or can give all the kingdoms, since we know that many holy men have been made kings by God. If you fall down, he says, and worship me. Therefore, whoever is going to worship the devil, falls before him.

<h2 id='tocuniq45'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) Then Jesus said to him: Go, Satan: for it is written. Not as many think, Satan and the apostle Peter are condemned with the same sentence. For to Peter it is said: Get behind me, Satan (Matt. XVI, 23), that is, follow me, who are contrary to my will: but here he hears, go, Satan: and it is not said to him, behind me, so that it may be understood, go into the eternal fire, which is prepared for you, and your angels.



You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only Him. The devil said to the Savior: if you fall down and worship me, on the contrary, He hears that He should rather worship the Lord, His God.

<h2 id='tocuniq46'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) Then the devil left him: and behold, angels came and ministered to him. Temptation precedes victory. Angels minister, to demonstrate the dignity of the victor.

<h2 id='tocuniq47'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Verse 15, 16.) The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles: the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light, Those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them a light has shined. These were the first to hear the Lord preaching, that where the first captivity had occurred by the Assyrians, there the proclamation of the Redeemer would be born.

<h2 id='tocuniq48'>(Vers. 17, 18.)</h2>

(Verse 17, 18.) Then Jesus began to preach and say, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.' And as Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. And he said to them. When John was handed over, he begins to preach rightly: as the Law ends, the Gospel arises accordingly. But if the Savior preaches the same things that John the Baptist had foretold before, he shows himself to be the Son of the same God, whose prophet John was.



<h2 id='tocuniq49'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Ver. 19, 20.) Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men. And immediately they left their nets and followed him. These first ones were called to follow the Lord: fishermen and unlettered men are sent to preach, lest the faith of believers be thought to come about not by the power of God, but by eloquence and teaching.

<h2 id='tocuniq50'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) And he healed the lunatics and the paralytics. And many crowds followed him from Galilee and Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond the Jordan. Not truly lunatics, but those who were thought to be lunatics due to the deceit of demons, who, by observing the phases of the moon, desired to defame creation so as to overflow with blasphemies against the Creator.

<h2 id='tocuniq51'>(Chap. V.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 5, Verses 1, 2.) But Jesus, seeing the crowds, went up the mountain, and when he had sat down, his disciples came to him. And opening his mouth, he taught them, saying, 'The Lord goes up to the mountains, so that he may draw the multitudes to higher things with him. But the crowds are not able to ascend. And the disciples follow, to whom he speaks not standing, but sitting and huddled. For they were not able to understand him shining in his majesty.' According to the letter, some of the simpler brothers think that he taught the Beatitudes and the rest that follow on the Mount of Olives, which is not at all the case: for from what precedes and follows, the place is shown to be in Galilee, which we thought was either Mount Tabor or any other lofty mountain. Finally, after he finished his speeches, it immediately follows: But when he entered Capernaum.

<h2 id='tocuniq52'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. This is what we read elsewhere: And the humble in spirit will be saved (Psalm 34:16): But lest anyone should think that poverty, which is sometimes borne out of necessity, is being preached by the Lord, he added 'in spirit,' so that you would understand it as humility, not as lack. Blessed are the poor in spirit, who are poor by choice for the sake of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, concerning such poor, the Savior also speaks through Isaiah: The Lord has annointed me; therefore, he has sent me to preach to the poor (Isaiah 61:1).



<h2 id='tocuniq53'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Ver. 4.) Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Not the land of Judah ((Al. Judea)), nor the land of this world; not the cursed land, bringing forth thorns and thistles (Gen. V), which the most cruel and warlike possess; but the land that the Psalmist desires, saying: I believe to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living (Ps. XXVI, 13). Such a possessor, and after victory a triumphator, is also described in the forty-fourth psalm: Attend, proceed and reign prosperously (Al. and prosperously): for truth, meekness, and justice. No one possesses this land by meekness, but by pride.

<h2 id='tocuniq54'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. This mourning is not a common law of nature for the dead, but for the sins and vices of the dead. Thus Samuel wept for Saul, because he regretted that God had anointed him king over Israel (1 Samuel 15). And so the Apostle Paul says that he weeps and mourns for those who have not repented after committing fornication and impurity (2 Corinthians 12).

<h2 id='tocuniq55'>24 (Vers. 6.)</h2>

24 (Verse 6.) Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. It is not enough for us to desire justice unless we also endure the hunger for justice: so that under this example, we may never consider ourselves sufficiently just, but always understand the works of justice to be lacking.

<h2 id='tocuniq56'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Mercy is not only understood in acts of charity, but also in bearing each other's burdens in every sin, if we carry the burdens of one another (Galatians 6).

<h2 id='tocuniq57'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Those who have no consciousness of sin are not accused. The world is seen by the pure in heart: the temple of God cannot be defiled.

<h2 id='tocuniq58'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. Those who first make peace in their own hearts, and then among quarreling brothers. For what good is it to reconcile others through you, when there are wars of vices in your own soul?

<h2 id='tocuniq59'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Notice that it explicitly adds (or, says), for righteousness' sake. For many endure persecution for their own sins and are not righteous. Also, consider that the blessedness of true circumcision is ultimately achieved through martyrdom.

<h2 id='tocuniq60'>(Vers 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. That curse should be despised which brings about blessedness, which is uttered falsely by the mouth of the reviler. Hence, it specially defined what blessed cursing is: every curse uttered against you falsely on my account. Therefore, where Christ is the cause, there also the desired cursing is.



<h2 id='tocuniq61'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. I do not know who can fulfill this for us, so that our reputation may be torn apart by insults, and we may rejoice in the Lord. Whoever pursues vain glory cannot fulfill it. Therefore, we must rejoice and be glad, so that a reward may be prepared for us in heavenly places. We read elegantly written in a certain volume: 'Do not seek glory, and you will not grieve when you are without it.' »

<h2 id='tocuniq62'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) You are the salt of the earth. The apostles are called salt because through them the entire human race is season

25 Quod si sal evannerit, in quo salietur? Si doctor erraverit, a quo alio doctore emendabitur?

It is worthless beyond nothingness, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. An example is taken from agriculture. For salt, indeed, as a condiment for foods, and for drying meats, it is necessary, but it has no other use. Certainly, we read in the Scriptures that certain cities, sown with the salt of the victors' anger, so that no sprout would arise in them (Judith IX). Therefore, let the doctors and bishops beware and see: the powerful endure torments powerfully (Wisdom VI, 7); and there is no remedy, but to lead the ruins of the ancestors to Tartarus.



<h2 id='tocuniq63'>(Vers. 14 seqq.)</h2>

(Verset 14 et suiv.) You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. It teaches the confidence in preaching, so that the apostles are not hidden out of fear, and are not like a lamp under a basket, but rather they freely reveal themselves, so that what they have heard in the inner rooms, they may proclaim on the housetops (Matthew 10:27).



<h2 id='tocuniq64'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill. Whether it is that he has fulfilled the prophecies about himself through others, or because by his preaching he has fulfilled those things which before were crude and imperfect on account of the weakness of those who heard them, taking away wrath and excluding retaliation, and suppressing hidden desire in the mind.

<h2 id='tocuniq65'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) Until heaven and earth pass away. The new heavens and the new earth are promised to us, which the Lord God will create. Therefore, if new things are to be created, the old things will necessarily pass away. And what follows is:

One iota, or one iota, will not pass from the Law until all is done. It is shown from the figure of the letter, that even what are thought to be the least in the Law, are full of spiritual sacraments, and all are recapitulated in the Gospel. Whose, then, is the erudition and whose teaching, to demonstrate that even diverse sacrifices and those which appear superstitious are fulfilled in daily victims?

<h2 id='tocuniq66'>(Vers. 19 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 19 and following) Therefore, whoever shall break one of the least of these commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but he who shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I say to you, that unless your justice exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. You have heard that it was said to those of old: You shall not kill; and whoever kills shall be liable to judgment. But I tell you. This chapter, sticking with the previous testimony, in which he said: Not one iota, or one apex, will pass from the Law, until all things are fulfilled. Therefore, he seals the Pharisees, who, despising the commandments of God, establish their own traditions, which do not benefit them in teaching the people if they destroy even a small thing that is commanded in the Law. However, we can also understand that the education of teachers, even if subject to a small sin, leads them down from the highest rank, and it does not benefit them to teach righteousness, which the smallest fault destroys. And let perfect happiness be to fulfill with action what you have taught in words.

<h2 id='tocuniq67'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22) Because whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. In some manuscripts it is added, without cause: but in the true definitive sentence, anger is completely eliminated, as the Scripture says: Whoever is angry with his brother. For if we are commanded to offer the other cheek to the one who strikes us, and to love our enemies, and to pray for those who persecute us (Luke 6), all occasion for anger is removed. Therefore, without cause must be removed, because the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God (James 1).



But whoever says to his brother, 'Raca,' shall be liable to the council. This word 'Raca' is properly of the Hebrews: for Raca signifies 'empty,' that is, foolish or senseless: which we can call a common insult, without a brain. If we are to give an account for idle words, how much more for an insult (Matthew 5:22)! But it is also distinctly added: Whoever says to his brother, 'Raca.' For our brother is no one else, unless he has the same Father as us. When someone believes in God in the same way and knows Christ as the wisdom of God (1 Cor. 1): by what means can it be indicated by the praise of foolishness?

But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire. Ἀπὸ κοινοῦ ex superioribus subauditur: Whoever says to his brother, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire. For whoever says to a believer, 'You fool!' is impious in religion.

<h2 id='tocuniq68'>(Vers. 23, 24.)</h2>

(Vers. 23, 24.) Therefore, if you offer your gift at the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and go first to be reconciled to your brother: and then coming, offer your gift. He did not say, if you have something against your brother, but if your brother has something against you, so that a harsher necessity of reconciliation may be imposed on you. As long as we cannot appease him, I do not know whether we should consequently offer our gifts to God.



<h2 id='tocuniq69'>(Vers. 25 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 25 onwards) Be reconciled quickly with your adversary while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. Truly I say to you, you will not get out of there until you have paid the last penny. You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones: 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I tell you that everyone. Because what we have in Latin codices is 'consentiens,' it is written in Greek as 'Εὐνοῶν,' which means benevolent or kind. From the preceding and subsequent passages, it is clear that our Lord and Savior, while we run on the path of this world, encourages us to peace and harmony, according to the Apostle, who says: If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with all men (Rom. XII, 18). For in the preceding chapter, he also said: If you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you: and when this is finished, he immediately adds: Be reconciled to your adversary, etc. And in the following he commands: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute and slander you. When this is clear and the consequent understanding, many think it is said about the flesh and the soul, or about the soul and the spirit, which is not entirely correct. For how can the flesh be sent to prison if the soul does not agree, since both the soul and the flesh must be imprisoned together? And the flesh can do nothing except what the mind commands, or the Holy Spirit dwelling in us can deliver judgment to the flesh or the soul that resists, since he himself is the judge. Others, according to the Letter of Peter saying: Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goes about seeking whom he may devour (I Peter 5:8), and the rest, interpret the adversary as the devil, and they want to command from the Savior that, as long as it is in our power, we may be benevolent towards the devil, who is an enemy and avenger, and not make him suffer punishment on our behalf. For since he himself supplies the incentives of vices, and even to us who sin willingly, if we agree with him who suggests vices, he must also be tormented on our behalf. And they say it is a kind act for each saint to sustain his adversary, if he does not make him endure torments for himself. Some say more forcefully that in Baptism each person enters into a pact with the devil and says: I renounce you, devil, and your pomp, and your vices, and your world, which is in the evil one (1 John 5:19). Therefore, if we keep the pact, we are kind and consenting to our adversary, and by no means are we to be shut up in prison. But if we have in fact transgressed anything of what we promised to the devil, we will be handed over to the judge and the officer, and we will be thrown into prison, and we will not be released from it until we repay the last quarter. A quarter is a type of coin that has two minutes. Hence, in another Gospel, that poor and widowed woman is said to have sent a quarter into the treasury (Mark 12), and in another, two minutes (Luke 21). Not that the Gospels are in disagreement, but that one quarter has two minute coins. This is therefore what he is saying: You will not leave the prison until you have paid even the smallest sins.

<h2 id='tocuniq70'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28.) Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. Between passion and pre-passion, that is, between feeling and intense feeling, there is a difference: passion is considered a vice, while pre-passion, although it carries the fault of initiation, is not held accountable in the crime. Therefore, whoever looks at a woman and his soul is tickled, he is struck by pre-passion. But if he agrees and allows himself to be affected by the thought, as it is written in David: They passed into the feeling of their hearts (Ps. 73:7), he moves from pre-passion to passion, and it is not a lack of will to sin, but an opportunity. Therefore, whoever sees a woman with lustful intent, that is, if he looks at her in order to lust after her, he is rightly said to commit adultery in his heart.

<h2 id='tocuniq71'>(Vers. 29, 30.)</h2>

(Verse 29, 30.) And if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell. For he had spoken earlier about a woman's desire, and now correctly referred to the wandering of thought and sense as an eye. On the right hand, as well as other parts of the body, the beginnings of the will and emotions are demonstrated: such as what we conceive in our minds, we accomplish in our actions. Therefore, we must be careful that what is best in us does not quickly turn into vice. For if the right eye and right hand cause stumbling, how much more those things that are on the left in us! For if the soul falters, how much more the body, which is inclined towards sin! Otherwise, in the right eye and in the right hand, the affections of brothers, wives, children, relatives, and close ones are shown, which if we see as an impediment to contemplate the true light, we must cut off such portions, so that while we desire to make others gain, we ourselves do not perish forever. Where is it said, concerning the high priest, whose soul is dedicated to the worship of God: 'He shall not defile himself for the dead among his people, except for his close relatives.' (Lev. 21:11), that is, he shall not experience any emotions except for those related to his dedication.

<h2 id='tocuniq72'>(Vers. 31 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 31 seqq.) However, it is said: Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce. But I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for the cause of fornication, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not swear falsely, but you shall perform your oaths to the Lord. In the later part, the Savior explains this place more fully, that Moses commanded the certificate of divorce to be given because of the hardness of the hearts of the husbands, not granting a separation, but removing homicide. For it is far better, even if a sorrowful discord were to arise, for blood to be shed through hatred.

<h2 id='tocuniq73'>(Vers. 34 seqq.)</h2>

(Versed 34 onwards) But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Nor should you swear by your head, because you cannot make a single hair white or black. Let your word be 'Yes, yes' or 'No, no'; anything more than this comes from evil. The Jews have always had this wicked habit of swearing by the elements, as the prophetic word often accuses them (Isaiah 65). Whoever swears, worships, or loves the one by whom they swear. In the law it is commanded that we do not swear, except by the Lord our God (Deut. VI and VII). The Jews, by swearing by angels, and by the city of Jerusalem, and by the temple, and by the elements, honored and worshipped creatures and earthly things with the honor and worship due to God. Finally, consider that here the Savior did not prohibit swearing by God, but by heaven, and earth, and Jerusalem, and by your own head. And this was granted in the law as if to little children, so that just as they would sacrifice animals to God and not to idols, they would be allowed to swear by God: not that they would do this rightly, but because it was better to offer this to God than to demons. However, evangelical truth does not require an oath, since every faithful statement is considered as if made under oath.

<h2 id='tocuniq74'>(Vers. 38.)</h2>

(Verse 38.) You have heard that it was said: An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But I say to you, do not resist evil. Whoever says an eye for an eye does not want to take away the other, but to preserve both. Our Lord, by taking away vengeance, cuts off the beginnings of sins. And in the Law there is retribution, in the Gospel there is grace. There, fault is corrected, here the beginnings of sins are taken away.

<h2 id='tocuniq75'>(Vers. 39.)</h2>

(Verse 39.) But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. The man described in Ecclesiasticus is an imitator of him who says: Learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart (Matthew 11:29). And he confirms his promise by saying: If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong; but if well, why do you strike me? (John 18:23). David says in the Psalm: 'If I have repaid those who did evil to me' (Ps. VII, 5). And Jeremiah in the Lamentations: 'It is good for a man to bear the yoke from his youth' (or sit by it, etc.). He will give his cheek to the one who strikes him; he will be filled with insults (Thren. III, 27,30). This is directed against those who think there is one God of the Law and another of the Gospel, which is taught both there and here. According to mystical understanding: our right hand, when struck, we are not commanded to offer the left, but the other, that is, the other right. For justice does not have a left hand. If a heretic strikes us in a dispute and wants to wound the right doctrine, let another testimony from the Scriptures be set against him, and let us continually offer him our right hands while he is weary with anger.

<h2 id='tocuniq76'>(Vers. 42, 43.)</h2>

(Verse 42, 43.) Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you. You have heard that it was said: Love your neighbor and hate your enemy. If we understand this saying to mean only about almsgiving, it cannot apply to most of the poor. But even if the rich give constantly, they cannot give constantly. Therefore, after the good of almsgiving, instructions are given to the apostles, that is, to the teachers, so that those who have received for free may give for free (Matthew 10). Money of this kind never runs out; but the more it is given, the more it is doubled. And when it waters the fields under its control, the spring's waters never dry up.

<h2 id='tocuniq77'>(Vers. 44.)</h2>

(Verse 44.) But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute and slander you. Many, considering the weakness of their own abilities and not the power of the saints, think that the commandments of God are impossible and say that it is enough to have virtues and not to hate enemies. However, they command to love more than human nature can endure. Therefore, it should be understood that Christ does not command the impossible, but the perfect: what David did to Saul and Absalom (1 Samuel 24 and 26, and 2 Samuel 18). Stephanus also, the martyr, prayed for those who were stoning him as enemies (Acts 7). And Paul desires to be accursed for his persecutors (Romans 9). Moreover, Jesus both taught and did these things, saying: Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing (Luke 23:34).

<h2 id='tocuniq78'>(Vers. 45.)</h2>

(Verse 45) So that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. If someone keeps the commandments of God, they become a child of God. Therefore, being a child is not by nature, but by his own choice.

<h2 id='tocuniq79'>(Chap. VI.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 6, Verse 1) Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. Otherwise, you have no reward from your Father in heaven. When you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. From all these things it is gathered that they are hypocrites who do anything in order to be glorified by men. It seems to me also that he who says to his brother: 'Let me remove the speck from your eye' (Matthew 7:4), does this for the sake of glory, in order to appear righteous himself. Therefore it is said to him by the Lord: 'Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your own eye.' Thus, not virtue but the motive for virtue has reward with God. If you veer slightly off the right path, it doesn't matter whether you go to the right or to the left, because you have lost the true way.

<h2 id='tocuniq80'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(Vers. 3, 4.) But when you give alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be done in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.



Amen I say to you, they have received their reward. Not God's reward, but their own. For they have been praised by men, for whom they have exercised virtues.

<h2 id='tocuniq81'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6) But when you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. This is simply understood, it teaches the listener to flee from vain glory in prayer. But it seems to me that this is more of a command, that we should pray to the Lord with our thoughts confined within our hearts and our lips closed, which we also read Anna did in the Book of Kings; Her lips, it says, were moving (1 Samuel 1:13).



<h2 id='tocuniq82'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) But when praying, do not speak much, as the Gentiles do. For they think that they will be heard because of their many words. Therefore, do not be like them. If a Gentile speaks much in prayer, then a Christian should speak little. For God is not the listener of words, but of the heart. (Wisdom 1:6).

<h2 id='tocuniq83'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(V. 8.) For your Father knows what you need before you ask him. So you will pray like this. In this place, a certain heresy arises, as well as a perverse doctrine of philosophers, who say: If God knows what we pray for, and before we ask, he knows what we need, then we speak in vain to the one who knows. To these it must be briefly answered, we are not storytellers, but askers. For it is one thing to tell the ignorant, another to ask the one who knows. In that, there is evidence; here, there is obedience. There, we faithfully indicate; here, we miserably beseech.

<h2 id='tocuniq84'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) Our Father, who art in heaven. By calling Him Father, let them confess themselves to be His sons.

Hallowed be thy name. Not in you, but in us. For if because of sinners the name of God is blasphemed among the nations (Rom. VIII), on the contrary, because of the righteous it is sanctified.

<h2 id='tocuniq85'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10) Your kingdom come. This can mean either a general prayer for the kingdom of the whole world, that the devil may stop reigning in the world, or that God may reign in each individual, and sin may not reign in the mortal body of humankind (Rom. VI). At the same time, we must consider that it requires great courage and a pure conscience to ask for the kingdom of God and not fear judgment.

Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Just as the angels serve thee blamelessly in heaven, so may men serve thee on earth. Let those be ashamed of this opinion who daily lie about there being disturbances in heaven. For what benefit is the likeness of heaven to us, if there is also sin in heaven?

<h2 id='tocuniq86'>(Vers. 11-13.)</h2>

(Vers. 11-13.) Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. The word 'supersubstantial,' which we have expressed, is rendered in Greek as 'ἐπιούσιον,' a term that the Septuagint translators frequently translate as 'περιούσιον.' Therefore, we examined the Hebrew, and wherever they translated 'περιούσιον,' we found 'Sgolla,' which Symmachus translated as 'ἐξαίρετον,' meaning exceptional or outstanding, although he did interpret it differently in one particular instance. Therefore, when we ask that God give us extraordinary or exceptional bread, we ask for Him who says: 'I am the living bread that came down from heaven' (John 6:51). In the Gospel called according to the Hebrews, instead of 'supersubstantial bread,' I found the word 'mahar,' which means 'for tomorrow'; so the meaning is: 'Give us our bread for tomorrow,' that is, for the future, today. We can also understand the 'supersubstantial bread' in another way, referring to the bread that is above all substances and exceeds all creatures. Others simply think, according to the words of the Apostle (I Tim. VI, 8): Having food and clothing, with these we are content, that we should only be concerned with providing for the holy present food. Hence, in the following it is commanded: Do not worry about tomorrow.

Amen. The sign of the Lord's Prayer is: which the Eagle interprets faithfully: we, truly, can say.

<h2 id='tocuniq87'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you your offenses. This is what is written: 'I said, you are gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High; nevertheless, you shall die like men, and fall like one of the rulers.' (Psalm 82:6-7) This is said to those who have deserved to be called gods because of their offenses. Therefore, rightly are they called men to whom offenses are forgiven.



<h2 id='tocuniq88'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(V. 16) For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to fast. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward. The word exterminate, which is frequently used in the books of Ecclesiastic writers, has a much different meaning than is commonly understood. For it means that those who are exiled are exterminated, as they are sent beyond the borders. Therefore, we should always understand this word in this sense: which is said in Greek as ἀφανίζουσι. However, the hypocrite demolishes his face to simulate sadness; and with a strong mind rejoicing, he bears grief on his countenance.

<h2 id='tocuniq89'>(Vers. 17 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 17 and following) But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you may not appear to be fasting to men, but to your Father who is in secret: and your Father who sees in secret will repay you. Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where rust and moth destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. He is speaking according to the custom of the province of Palestine, where they usually anoint their heads on festive days. Therefore, he commanded us to show ourselves joyful and festive when we fast. Those reading it from the Psalmist: The oil of the sinner shall not anoint my head (Ps. 140:5), on the contrary they want the good oil, about which it is said elsewhere: God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows (Ps. 44:8). And He commands that we, who practice virtues, should anoint the principal (ἡγεμονικὸν) oil of our hearts with spiritual oil.

<h2 id='tocuniq90'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. This applies not only to money, but also to all passions and possessions. The stomach is the god of gluttons: there it has its heart, where its treasure is. The treasure of the luxurious is feasts. For the lascivious, it is playfulness; for the lover, it is desire. Everyone serves the one by whom he is conquered (2 Peter 2:19).

<h2 id='tocuniq91'>(Vers. 22, 23.)</h2>

(Verse 22, 23.) If your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness! Those with failing eyesight often see many lights: a sound and pure eye perceives only one light. This can be transferred to the realm of perception. For just as the whole body is in darkness if the eye is not sound, so the soul, if it has lost its primary light, will abide in darkness in all its senses. If therefore the light which is within you is darkness, how great is that darkness! If the sense which is light is obscured by the fault of the soul, do you think in what darkness it will be enveloped!

<h2 id='tocuniq92'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) You cannot serve God and wealth. Wealth is called mammon in the Syriac language. You cannot serve God and wealth. Let the greedy person hear this, let the person who is thought to be unable to serve both wealth and Christ hear this. And yet it did not say, the one who has wealth, but the one who serves wealth. For the servant of wealth guards the riches, like a servant; but the one who has shaken off the yoke of servitude distributes them, like a master.



<h2 id='tocuniq93'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) Therefore I say to you: Do not be anxious about your souls, what you will eat, nor about your bodies, what you will wear. In some manuscripts it is added: nor what you will drink. Therefore, we are completely freed from the care of what nature gives to all, and is common to animals and humans. But it is commanded to us not to be anxious about what we will eat: because in the sweat of our face we prepare bread for ourselves. Labor must be exercised, worry must be removed. What is said here: Do not be anxious about what you will eat, or about what you will wear (Gen. III), let us take it as referring to physical food and clothing. However, we should always be concerned about spiritual food and clothing.

<h2 id='tocuniq94'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26) Is not the soul more than food, and the body more than clothing? He says this in such a way: He who has provided greater things, surely will provide lesser things.

Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? The Apostle instructs (Rom. XI), not to think of ourselves more highly than we ought to think. This testimony should be kept in mind in the present chapter. For there are some who, while they want to exceed the boundaries of the fathers and fly high, are immersed in the depths: saying that the birds of the air are angels and other strengths in the ministry of God, which are nourished by the providence of God without worry for themselves. If this is how it is, as they want it to be understood, how does the statement follow for human beings: Are you not worth more to them? It must be taken simply: if the birds, without care and toil, are nourished by God's providence, which exist today and will not exist tomorrow: how much more are human beings, to whom eternity is promised, ruled by God's will!

<h2 id='tocuniq95'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) But which of you by thinking is able to add one cubit to his stature? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

<h2 id='tocuniq96'>(Vers. 28-30.)</h2>

(Vers. 28-30.) Consider how the lilies of the field grow: they do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these. If God so clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? And why are you anxious about clothing?

<h2 id='tocuniq97'>(Vers. 31 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 31 and following) Do not be anxious, saying: What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or with what shall we be clothed? For all these things the Gentiles seek. For your Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. Therefore, it has granted that those who forbid thinking about the future should be anxious about the present. And so the Apostle says: 'Working night and day with our hands, so as not to burden any of you' (1 Thess. 2:9). Tomorrow is understood as a future time in the Scriptures, as Jacob says: 'And my righteousness shall answer for me tomorrow' (Gen. 30:33). And in Samuel's vision, the witch speaks to Saul: 'Tomorrow you will be with me' (1 Sam. 28:19).

<h2 id='tocuniq98'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) The malice of the day is enough for itself. Here, malice is not set against virtue, but rather labor, affliction, and the hardships of the world: just as Sara afflicted her servant Agar (Gen. 16), which is significantly expressed in Greek as ἐκάκωσεν αὐτὴν. Therefore, let us be content with the thoughts of the present time; let us leave the care of the future, which is uncertain.

<h2 id='tocuniq99'>(Chap. VII.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter VII - Verses 1, 2) Do not judge, so that you may not be judged. For with the judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. If judging is prohibited, what is the consequence of Paul judging the fornicator in Corinth (1 Cor. 5), and Peter rebuking Ananias and Sapphira for lying (Acts 5)? But he shows what he prohibits from the consequences, saying: just as you judge, you will be judged. Therefore, he did not prohibit judgment, but taught it.

<h2 id='tocuniq100'>(Vers. 3-5.)</h2>

(Vers. 3-5.) But why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, and not see the beam in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me remove the speck from your eye,' while the beam is in your own eye? Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye. He speaks of those who, while being subject to mortal sin themselves, do not overlook minor sins of their brothers: straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel (Matthew 23). Therefore, those who hypocritically pretend to be just, as we said above, are called hypocrites, who, while they have a beam in their own eye, look at the speck in their brother's eye.

<h2 id='tocuniq101'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6) Do not give what is holy to the dogs. Holy, it is the bread of the children. Therefore, we should not take the bread of the children and give it to the dogs.

Do not cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. The pig does not appreciate ornamentation, as it wallows in the mire. And according to the Proverbs of Solomon: If he has a golden circle, he is found to be more vile. (Prov. XI, 22). Some interpret them as dogs who return to the vomit of their sins after believing in Christ: but they interpret pigs as those who have not yet believed in the Gospel, and who wallow in the mire of unbelief and vice. Therefore, it is not fitting for men of this kind to quickly believe the Gospel pearl, lest they trample on it and, once converted, begin to scatter us.

<h2 id='tocuniq102'>(Vers. 7 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 7 and following) Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Or what man is there among you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? He shows what we should seek, who had forbidden earthly things to be asked for. If it is given to the one who asks, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it is opened, then it is clear that the one who has not been given, and the one who has not found, and the one to whom it has not been opened, has not asked, sought, and knocked properly. Let us therefore knock at the door of Christ, of which it is said: This is the gate of the Lord, the just shall enter into it (Ps. CXVII, 20); so that when we have entered, the hidden and dark treasures may be revealed to us in Christ Jesus, in whom is all knowledge (Coloss. II).

<h2 id='tocuniq103'>(Vers. 11, 12.)</h2>

(Ver. 11, 12.) So if you, being evil, know how to give good things to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him! Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. It should be noted that when he referred to the apostles as evil, unless perhaps under the guise of the apostles the entire race of men is condemned, whose hearts are inclined to evil from infancy in comparison to divine mercy. Read Genesis (Genesis 8). It is not surprising if people of this age are called evil, since even the apostle Paul recalls: Redeeming the time, for the days are evil (Ephesians 5:16).

<h2 id='tocuniq104'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verse 13, 14) Enter through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and spacious is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it. How narrow is the gate and confined is the way that leads to life! And few are those who find it. The wide path is the pleasure of the world, which people desire. The narrow path, which is opened through struggles and fasting, which even the Apostle entered (II Cor. VI, XI): and Timothy is encouraged to enter through it (I Tim. V). At the same time, consider how clearly he has spoken about each path. Many walk the broad path, but few find the narrow one. The broad path is not sought after, nor is there a need for discovery: it offers itself willingly, and is the path of those who wander. But the narrow path, not everyone finds it, and those who do find it, do not immediately enter it. Indeed, many, once they have found the path of truth, are captivated by the pleasures of the world and turn back from the middle of the journey.

<h2 id='tocuniq105'>(Vers. 15 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 and following) Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. And by their fruits you will know them. It is possible to understand all things, as those who promise one thing in appearance and speech but show another thing in action. But especially, this should be understood about heretics, who seem to clothe themselves in the appearance of piety through continence, chastity, and fasting, but inwardly they have a poisoned heart and deceive the minds of the simple brothers. Therefore, from the fruits of the soul, which drag innocence to ruin, they are compared to ravenous wolves.

<h2 id='tocuniq106'>(Vers. 18 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 18 and following) A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore, by their fruits you will know them. Let us ask the heretics who claim that there are two contradictory natures, if according to their understanding, a good tree can never bear bad fruit, then how did Moses, a good tree, sin by striking the rock (Deut. 32)? And how did David, after killing Uriah, sleep with Bathsheba (2 Sam. 11)? And how did Peter, during the Passion of the Lord, deny Him, saying: 'I do not know the man' (Matt. 26:72)? Or what connection is there between Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, a bad tree who did not believe in the God of Israel, giving good advice to Moses (Exod. 18)? And how did Achior, in speaking to Holofernes, say something useful (Judith 5)? And as the comedian said (which the Apostle confirmed): 'Evil company corrupts good morals' (1 Cor. 5). And when they do not find what to answer, let us infer that Judas (John 13) , once a good tree, bore bad fruits after betraying (or handing over) the Savior; and that Saul (Philippians 3) , a bad tree at the time he persecuted the Church of Christ, bore good fruits afterwards, when he was transformed from a persecutor into a vessel of election (Acts 9) . Therefore, a good tree does not bear bad fruits as long as it perseveres in the pursuit of goodness; and a bad tree remains in the fruits of sin as long as it does not convert to repentance. For no one remains in what he was, he begins to be what he has not yet begun.

<h2 id='tocuniq107'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21.) Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. As he said before, those who have a garment of good life should not be received on account of the wickedness of their teachings: so now he asserts the opposite, that even faith should not be given to those who, although they possess the integrity of faith, live wickedly and destroy the integrity of doctrine with evil deeds. For both the work is necessary for the servants of God, so that both the work is confirmed by speech, and speech is confirmed by works. This statement may seem contrary to that: No one can say, 'Jesus is Lord,' except in the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3). But it is customary for the sayings of the Scriptures to be taken for actions, as it is immediately approved in the following passages, refuting those who boast of having knowledge of the Lord without works, and they hear from the Savior: Depart from me, you workers of iniquity, I do not know you (Luke 13). And the Apostle speaks in this sense: They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him (Titus 1:16).

<h2 id='tocuniq108'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) Many say to me on that day: Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons, and in your name perform many miracles? It is not always the merit of the one who does the prophesying, performing miracles, and casting out demons, but either the invocation of the name of Christ accomplishes this, or it is for the condemnation of those who invoke it and for the benefit of those who see and hear. So, even though people may despise those who perform miracles, they still honor God, for it is by invoking His name that such great wonders are accomplished. For both Saul (1 Samuel 10) and Balaam (Numbers 23) and Caiaphas (John 11) prophesied, not knowing what they were saying; and Pharaoh (Genesis 41) and Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 2) knew the future through dreams. And in the Acts of the Apostles, the sons of Sceva were seen casting out demons (Acts 19). But it is also narrated that the apostle Judas, with the intention of a traitor, performed many signs among the other Apostles.

<h2 id='tocuniq109'>42 (Vers. 23.)</h2>

42 (Verse 23.) And then I will confess to them, because I never knew you. He said explicitly, I will confess, because he had pretended to speak a long time ago: I do not know you. The Lord does not know those who perish. However, observe why he added, I never knew you, if, according to some, they have always lived among rational creatures.

<h2 id='tocuniq110'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) Depart from me, you who practice iniquity. Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. He did not say, 'you who have practiced iniquity,' so as not to seem to take away repentance, but rather 'you who practice,' that is, those who, up until the present hour, when the time of judgment comes, though they do not have the power to sin, still have the inclination.



<h2 id='tocuniq111'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they rushed upon that house, and it did not fall. This rain which seeks to overthrow the house is the devil. The rivers, all the Antichrists, who are against Christ. The spiritual winds of wickedness in heavenly places (Ephesians 6).

<h2 id='tocuniq112'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26.) For it was founded upon a rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man. Upon this rock the Lord built his Church (Matthew 15): from this rock the apostle Peter obtained his name. Upon a rock of this kind, serpent's tracks are not found (Proverbs 30). Concerning this, the prophet speaks confidently: He set my feet upon a rock (Psalm 40:3). And in another place: The rock is a refuge for rabbits, or porcupines (Psalm 104:8). For a timid animal takes refuge in the caves of the rocks: and with its rough skin and completely armed with javelins, it protects itself with such defense. Therefore, it is said to Moses at that time when he had fled from Egypt, and the rabbit was the Lord's: Stand in the opening of the rock, and you will see my back parts. (Exodus 33:21).

<h2 id='tocuniq113'>(Vers. 27, 28.)</h2>

(Verse 27, 28) Whoever built his house on sand: and the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell: and great was the fall thereof. And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, that the multitudes were astonished at his doctrine. The foundation which the Apostle, the architect, laid (I Cor. 3), is one, our Lord Jesus Christ. Upon this stable and firm foundation, and by itself a strong structure founded on massive support, is built the Church of Christ. Truly, every heretic's discourse is built for the purpose of collapsing upon a super unstable arena which cannot be securely cemented together nor reduced into one bond.

<h2 id='tocuniq114'>(Vers. 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29.) For he was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes and Pharisees. For they taught the people, what was written in Moses and the Prophets. But Jesus, being like God and the Lord of Moses himself, for the freedom of his will, either added to the law what seemed less, or changing it, preached to the people, as we also read above: It was said to the ancients: But I say to you.

<h2 id='tocuniq115'>(Chap. VIII.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 8, Verse 1) When Jesus had come down from the mountain, many crowds followed him, and behold, a leper came and knelt before him, saying, 'Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.' When the Lord came down from the mountain, crowds gathered, for they were unable to ascend to higher places. And the leper was the first to meet him. For he had not yet been able to hear the Savior's message about the leprosy while on the mountain. And it should be noted that he was the first to be cured, specifically: second, the centurion's servant; third, Peter's mother-in-law, who had a fever; and in the fourth place, those who were brought to him possessed by demons, whose spirits he cast out with a word, when he healed all who were ill. And behold, a leper came and knelt before him, saying, 'Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.'

<h2 id='tocuniq116'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Verse 2.) Lord, if you will, you can cleanse me. He who asks for the will, does not doubt about the power.

<h2 id='tocuniq117'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3) And Jesus, extending His hand, touched him, saying: I will, be clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. By extending His hand, the Lord caused the leprosy to flee. Consider also how humble and devoid of boasting His response is. The man had said, if you will: the Lord answered, I will. The man had said, you can cleanse me: The Lord unites and says, be cleansed. Therefore, it is not, as many Latin speakers believe, to be joined and read as, I will-be-cleanse, but separately, so that first, He says, I will: then, giving the command, He says, be clean (or be cleansed).



<h2 id='tocuniq118'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) And Jesus said to him: See that you tell no one. And in truth, why was it necessary that he boast in speech, which he excelled in bodily?

44 But go, show yourself to the priests and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them. He sends him to the priests for various reasons. First, out of humility, so that he may seem to defer honor to the priests. For it was commanded by the law that those who had been cleansed from leprosy should offer gifts to the priests. Second, so that seeing the cleansed leper, they might either believe in the Savior or not believe. If they believed, they would be saved; if they did not believe, they would be without excuse. And at the same time, in order to avoid being accused of frequently violating the law.

<h2 id='tocuniq119'>(Vers. 5 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 5 onward) Then a centurion came to him, pleading with him and saying, 'Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented.' And Jesus said to him, 'I will come and heal him.' The centurion answered and said, 'Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.' We must not accuse the Lord of boasting, because he immediately promises to go and heal, seeing the faith, humility, and prudence of the centurion. He had faith that a paralytic could be healed by the Savior from among the gentiles. He had humility in that he considered himself unworthy for the Lord to enter his house. He had prudence in that he recognized the hidden divinity within the flesh, knowing that what was visible to unbelievers would not benefit him, but rather what was hidden inwardly. Concerning this prudence, he also said:

<h2 id='tocuniq120'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) For I am also a man under authority, having soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it. He wanted to show that the Lord can fulfill his will not only through the coming of his body, but also through the ministry of angels.

<h2 id='tocuniq121'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) But when Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, 'Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith. I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'

Amen I say to you, I have not found such great faith in Israel. He speaks about the present, not about all the past patriarchs and prophets: unless perhaps the faith of the Gentiles is preferred over that of Israel.

<h2 id='tocuniq122'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) But I say to you, that many will come from the East and the West, and will recline with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. Because God, the creator of the heavens, is the Father of Christ, therefore Abraham is also in the kingdom of heaven, along with whom the nations that believe in Christ, the Son of the Creator, will recline. And that same understanding is fulfilled, as we mentioned above, in the faith of the Gentile centurion: as the peoples who will believe from the East and the West are mentioned.



<h2 id='tocuniq123'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(V. 12) But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness. The sons of the kingdom signify the Jews, over whom God reigned before. They shall be cast out into outer darkness. Darkness is always within, not without. But because he who is expelled from the Lord leaves behind the light, therefore outer darkness is so named.

There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. If there is weeping of the eyes, and gnashing of teeth demonstrates the bones: therefore, the resurrection of the bodies and their members that had fallen is true.

<h2 id='tocuniq124'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) And when Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying down and feverish (or trembling): and he touched her hand, and the fever left her. The hand of the woman is touched, and with her healed works, the weakness of sins departs. It is the nature of human beings that after a fever, their bodies become more tired, and as health begins, they feel the afflictions of sickness. But the health that is granted by the Lord restores everything at once, and it is not enough to be healed; but to indicate an increase in strength, it is added:

<h2 id='tocuniq125'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15) And he rose up and served them. That hand which had been touched was also healed.

<h2 id='tocuniq126'>(Vers. 16-18.)</h2>

(Vers. 16-18.) But when evening came, they brought to him many who were demon-possessed; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick. This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: “He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases.” And seeing great crowds around him, Jesus gave orders to go to the other side. Everyone is healed not in the morning, not in the afternoon, but in the evening, when the sun is setting: when a grain of wheat dies in the ground in order to bring forth many fruits (John 12).



<h2 id='tocuniq127'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Verse 19, 20) And one scribe, approaching, said to him: Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go. And Jesus says to him: Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head. This scribe of the law, who knew only the letter that kills, if he had said: Lord, I will follow you wherever you go, he would not have been rejected by the Lord; but because he esteemed one teacher out of many, and was a learner of letters, which is more significantly said in Greek, γραμματεὺς, and not a spiritual hearer: therefore, he has no place where Jesus can lay his head. Now, it is shown to us, and because of this the scribe is rejected, that he, seeing the greatness of the signs, wanted to follow the Savior in order to seek profit from the miracles of his works, desiring the same thing that Simon Magus wanted to buy from Peter (Acts 8). Therefore, such a faith is rightfully condemned by the Lord's judgment and it is said to him: Why do you desire to follow me because of riches and the profits of the world, when I am of such great poverty that I don't even have a small shelter and I don't use my own roof?



<h2 id='tocuniq128'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21.) And another of his disciples said to him: Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father. What is the similarity between a scribe and a disciple? The former calls him master, the latter confesses him Lord. The former desires to go and bury his father due to an opportunity for piety; the latter promises to follow him wherever, not seeking a master, but seeking profit from the master.

<h2 id='tocuniq129'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Ver. 22) But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead. He is dead, whoever does not believe. But if a dead person buries the dead, we should not be concerned about the dead, but the living: lest while we are concerned about the dead, we ourselves may also be called dead.

<h2 id='tocuniq130'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves. He performed the fifth sign when he got into a boat from Capernaum and commanded the winds and the sea. The sixth sign, when he gave power to the demons to enter into the pigs in the region of the Gerasenes. The seventh, when he entered his own city and healed a paralytic lying on a bed. Firstly, the paralytic is the son of a centurion.

<h2 id='tocuniq131'>(Vers. 24, 25.)</h2>

(Verse 24, 25.) But He was sleeping. And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, 'Lord, save us, we are perishing!' And Jesus said to them, 'Why are you afraid, you of little faith?' We read the foreshadowing of this sign in Jonah (Jonah 1), when, as the others were in danger, he was secure, and slept, and was awakened; and by the power and mystery of his passion, he saved those who woke him.

<h2 id='tocuniq132'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26.) Then rising up, he commanded the winds and the sea: and there was a great calm. And from this place we understand that all creatures feel their Creator. For those whom he rebukes, and those whom he commands, feel the one who commands: not by the error of heretics, who think that all things are animate; but by the majesty of the creator, which to us is imperceptible, but to them is perceptible.

<h2 id='tocuniq133'>(Vers. 27-29.)</h2>

(Verse 27-29) And men marveled, saying: What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him? And when Jesus had come across the sea into the region of the Gerasenes, two men with demons met him as they came out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass by that way. And behold, they cried out, saying: Not the disciples, but the sailors and others who were in the boat, marveled. But if anyone wants to argue that those who marveled were disciples, we will answer that they were rightly called men who had not yet known the power of the Savior.



<h2 id='tocuniq134'>(Vers. 30, 31.)</h2>

(Verse 30, 31.) What have we to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here before the time to torment us? Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding not far off from them. And the demons begged him, saying, 'This confession is not of free will, which is followed by the reward of the confessor, but of forced necessity, which compels unwillingly, as if fugitive slaves see their master after a long time: they only beg to be spared from the beatings.' So, demons, seeing the Lord suddenly present on earth, believed that they had come to judge. The presence of the Savior is torment for demons. And some people foolishly think that demons know the Son of God, but are ignorant of the devil, because these demons are of lesser evil than the one whose servants they are. Since all knowledge of the disciples must be referred to the teacher, demons as well as the devil are more suspect of understanding the Son of God than knowing Him. No one knows the Father, except the Son, and whoever the Son chooses to reveal him to. (Matthew 11:27)

<h2 id='tocuniq135'>(Vers. 32, 33.)</h2>

(Verse 32, 33.) If you cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs. And He said to them: Go. And they, going out, went into the pigs. And behold, the whole herd rushed headlong into the sea, and they died in the water. But the shepherds fled; and coming into the city, they announced all these things, and about those who had demons. Not that the Savior granted the demons what they were asking, He said, go: but so that through the destruction of the pigs, an opportunity for salvation would be given to the people. For when the shepherds see these things, they immediately report them to the city. Let Manichaeus be ashamed, if the souls of men and beasts are of the same substance and from the same author, how is it that for the salvation of one man, two thousand pigs are choked?

<h2 id='tocuniq136'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34) And behold, the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and when they saw Him, they begged Him to pass through their borders. They ask Him to pass through their borders, not out of pride as some think, but out of humility by which they judged themselves unworthy of the Lord's presence, just as Peter, falling to the knees of the Savior in the catch of fish, said: Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man (Luke 5:8).

<h2 id='tocuniq137'>(Chap. IX.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 9, Verses 1-2) And Jesus got into a boat and crossed over, and came to his own city. And behold, they brought to him a paralytic lying on a bed. And Jesus seeing their faith, said to the paralytic: Take heart, my son, your sins are forgiven. By his city, we understand none other than Nazareth, from where he is also called the Nazarene. And they brought him, as we said before, a paralytic lying on a bed, because he himself was not able to enter. But Jesus, seeing not the faith of the one who was being offered, but of those who were offering, said to the paralyzed man: Have confidence, my son, your sins are forgiven you. Oh, wonderful humility! He calls despised and weak, dissolved in the joints of all his limbs, his son, whom the priests did not consider worthy of touching. Or certainly he calls him son because his sins are forgiven him. According to the allegory, sometimes the soul, lying in its body, with all the powers of its limbs dissolved, is offered to the Lord to be healed by the perfect teacher, and if it is healed by his mercy, it receives such great strength that it immediately carries its bed.



<h2 id='tocuniq138'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(Verses 3, 4.) And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves: He blasphemes. And when Jesus saw their thoughts, he said: Why do you think evil in your hearts? We read in the Prophet, saying God: I am the one who blots out your iniquities (Isaiah 43:25). Therefore, the scribes, because they thought he was a man and did not understand the words of God, accuse him of blasphemy. But the Lord, seeing their thoughts, shows himself to be God, who can know the hidden things of the heart, and speaks in a silent manner: With the same majesty and power with which I behold your thoughts, I can also forgive sins to men. Understand what the paralytic suffers from among you.

<h2 id='tocuniq139'>(Vers. 5, 6.)</h2>

(Verse 5, 6.) Which is easier to say: your sins are forgiven you; or to say: rise up and walk? But so that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins, then He says to the paralytic. There is a great difference between saying and doing. Whether the paralytic's sins were forgiven, only the one who forgave them knew. But both the one who rose up and those who saw him rise up could verify it by his walking. Therefore, a bodily sign is given in order to prove something spiritual, although it has the same power to forgive the faults of both body and soul. And intelligence is given to us, because many bodily weaknesses occur due to sins. And perhaps your sins are forgiven first, so that with the causes of weakness removed, health is restored.

<h2 id='tocuniq140'>(Vers. 7, 8.)</h2>

(Verse 7, 8.) Rise, take up your bed, and go to your house. And he rose and went to his house. And when the crowds saw it, they were afraid and glorified God, who had given such authority to men. And if the paralyzed man rises, if he recovers his former strength, he carries his bed on which he lay before, and carries it into his house of virtues.

<h2 id='tocuniq141'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) And as Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man sitting at the tax booth, named Matthew. And he said to him, 'Follow me.' And he rose and followed him. The other evangelists, out of respect and honor for Matthew, did not want to use his name openly, but they said, 'Levi,' for he had two names. But Matthew himself, according to what is commanded by Solomon (or rather, it is said), 'The righteous is an accuser of himself at the beginning of his speech' (Proverbs 18:17). And in another place: Confess your sins, that you may be justified (Isaiah 43:26). Matthew calls himself and the tax collector, in order to show to the readers that no one should despair of salvation if they have turned to better things; since he himself was suddenly changed from a tax collector to an apostle. Porphyry and Julian the Emperor argue in this place, either the incompetence of the lying historian, or the foolishness of those who immediately followed the Savior, as if they irrationally followed anyone who called them, when there were so many virtues and signs that the Apostles had seen before they believed. Certainly, that very brilliance and majesty of hidden divinity, which also shone forth in a human face, was able to draw those who saw it for the first time to itself by its appearance. For if this power is said to exist in a magnet and amber, so that they attract rings, straws, and stalks to themselves, how much more could the Lord of all creatures draw to himself those whom he wished?

<h2 id='tocuniq142'>(Vers. 10 seq.)</h2>

(V. 10 seq.) And it came to pass, as he sat at table in his house, behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, 'Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?' But when Jesus heard it, he said, 'Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means: "I desire mercy, and not sacrifice." For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.''

<h2 id='tocuniq143'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) I desire mercy, and not sacrifice. For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners. And the Lord was going to the feasts of sinners, so that He may have an opportunity to teach and provide spiritual food to His invited guests. Ultimately, as He was frequently described as going to feasts, it is only important what He did there, what He taught, in order to demonstrate both the humility of the Lord in going to sinners and the power of His teaching in the conversion of repentant sinners. But as for what follows: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice' (Hosea 6:6). And: 'I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners,' testifying of the prophet, he rebukes the scribes and Pharisees who consider themselves righteous, but reject the company of sinners and tax collectors.

<h2 id='tocuniq144'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) Then the disciples of John came to him, saying: Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast? Proud question, and full of the arrogance of the Pharisees. Certainly, to say nothing else, the boasting of fasting should be reprehended. And the disciples of John could not be blameless, who were slandering him, whom they knew had been proclaimed by their master's words, and were joining themselves to the Pharisees, whom they knew had been condemned by John, saying: O generation of vipers, who has shown you to flee from the coming wrath?



<h2 id='tocuniq145'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) And Jesus said to them: Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast. Christ is the bridegroom: the Church is the bride. From this holy and spiritual union, the Apostles are born, who cannot mourn as long as they see the bride in the bridal chamber and know that the bridegroom is with the bride. But when the wedding is over and the time of his passion and resurrection has come, then the sons of the bridegroom will fast. Some believe that after forty days of the Passion, fasting should be observed: although the immediate arrival of Pentecost and the Holy Spirit indicate the celebration to us. And on this occasion, Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla also observe Lent after Pentecost: because, with the bridegroom taken away, the children of the bridegroom should fast. However, the custom of the Church comes from the passion of the Lord and the resurrection through the humility of the flesh, so that we may be prepared for the spiritual nourishment of the body through the fasting of the flesh. According to the tropology, it must be known that as long as the bridegroom is with us and we are in joy, we cannot fast or mourn. But when he departs from us because of our sins, then fasting must be announced, then mourning must be undertaken.

<h2 id='tocuniq146'>(Vers. 16, 17.)</h2>

(V. 16, 17) However, no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. For the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the wineskins burst, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved. These words were spoken by him to them. What he means is this: Until someone is born again and the old self is removed through my suffering, and he puts on a new self, he cannot bear the stricter commands of fasting and continence, lest through excessive severity he lose even the faith that he seems to possess now. But he set forth two examples, both of the old and the new, and of clothing. By the old wineskins we must understand the scribes and Pharisees. The new patch of clothing and the new wine represent the teachings of the Gospel, which the Jews cannot bear, lest a greater tear be made. The Galatians also desired to do something similar, mixing the precepts of the Gospel with the precepts of the Law, and putting the new wine into old wineskins; but the Apostle speaks to them, saying: O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you into not obeying the truth? (Gal. III, 1) Therefore, the word of the Gospel should be infused into the apostles rather than the Scribes and Pharisees, who were corrupted by the traditions of the elders and could not keep the sincerity of Christ's teachings. For there is a difference between the purity of a virginal soul, untouched by the contamination of previous vices, and the filth of one that has succumbed to the desires of many.

<h2 id='tocuniq147'>(Vers. 18, 19.)</h2>

(Verse 18, 19.) Behold, a certain ruler came forward and worshipped him, saying: My daughter has just died; but come, lay your hand upon her, and she will live. And Jesus arose and followed him, and so did his disciples. The eighth sign is in which the ruler asks for his daughter to be raised, not wanting to be excluded from the mystery of true circumcision; but a woman who had been flowing with blood enters, and is healed in the eighth place, so that the ruler's daughter comes as the ninth, according to what is said in the Psalms: Ethiopia will stretch out her hands to God (Psalm 67:32). And so, all Israel will be saved; as it is written: 'The Deliverer will come out of Zion, and He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob; for this is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins.' (Romans 11:25-26).

<h2 id='tocuniq148'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Ver. 20) And behold, a woman who had been suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His cloak. In the Gospel according to Luke, it is written that the daughter of a ruler had reached the age of twelve (Luke 8). Note, therefore, that during that time this woman, that is, the people of the Gentiles, began to be sick, while the people of the Jews believed. For unless a comparison of virtues is made, vice is not revealed. But this woman, flowing with blood, does not approach the Lord in the house, nor in the city, for according to the Law she was excluded from the cities (Leviticus 15, Numbers 5); but on the way, as the Lord walks, so that while He goes to another, another may be healed. Hence the apostles say: 'It was necessary that the word of God should be preached to you, but since you judged yourselves unworthy of salvation, we turn to the Gentiles' (Acts 13:46).

<h2 id='tocuniq149'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) For she said within herself, If I shall touch but his garment, I shall be whole. But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, According to the Law, he who touches a woman who is menstruating or has a discharge of blood is unclean (Lev. 20:25). She touches the Lord for this reason, that she may be healed of the defect of blood.

<h2 id='tocuniq150'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22) Have faith, daughter, your faith has saved you: and the woman was saved from that hour. Therefore, daughter, because your faith has saved you. He did not say, your faith will save you, but has saved you. For in what you have believed, you have already been saved.

<h2 id='tocuniq151'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise, He said, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose. And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.

<h2 id='tocuniq152'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Vers. 24.) Step back, for the girl is not dead, but sleeping. And they laughed at him. For in God, all things live.

<h2 id='tocuniq153'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) And when the crowd had been thrown out, he entered. For they were not worthy to see the mystery of the one rising again, who they derided with unworthy insults.

<h2 id='tocuniq154'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26) And he took her by the hand. And the girl arose: And this report went forth into all that land. Unless the hands of the Jews, which are full of blood, are first cleansed, their synagogue will not rise again.

<h2 id='tocuniq155'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27) And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, 'Have mercy on us, Son of David.' As Jesus passed through the house of the ruler and was going to his own house, as we read above: Getting into a boat, he crossed over and came to his own city. The two blind men cried out, saying, 'Have mercy on us, Son of David.' And yet they were not healed on the way, as they thought; but after he came to his own house, they approached him and entered: and their faith is first tested, so that they may receive the light of true faith. Earlier we presented a sign regarding the prince's daughter and the hemorrhaging (or sick) woman, now this is added: that as there was death and weakness there, here blindness is shown. Both peoples were blind when the Lord passed through this world, and desired to return to their homes. But unless they confess and say, 'Have mercy on us, Son of David,' and when Jesus asks, 'Do you believe that I am able to do this?' He responds: Indeed, Lord, he does not receive his former sight. In another Gospel, one blind man is written about, with torn clothes, sitting in Jericho, who is forbidden by the apostles to cry out; but through impudence, he receives healing (Mark 10). This passage properly pertains to the people of the Gentiles and should be explained in its own volume.

<h2 id='tocuniq156'>(Vers. 28, 29.)</h2>

(Verse 28, 29.) Have mercy on us, Son of David. And when he came into the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them: Do you believe that I can do this for you? They said to him: Yes, Lord. Then he touched their eyes, saying: Let it be done to you according to your faith. And their eyes were opened. Let Marcion and Manichaeus, and other heretics, who tear apart the Old Testament, hear this and learn that the Savior is called the Son of David. For if he was not born in the flesh, how is he called the son of David?



<h2 id='tocuniq157'>(Vers. 30, 31.)</h2>

(Verse 30, 31.) And Jesus warned them, saying, "See that no one knows." But when they went out, they spread the news about him throughout that whole land. And the Lord, fleeing the glory of boastfulness because of his humility, had commanded this. And they, because of the remembrance of his grace, cannot remain silent about the kindness. Note, therefore, that something contrary to what was commanded must have happened. These blind men are healed in the tenth place.

<h2 id='tocuniq158'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32) And when they had departed, behold, they brought to Him a man who was mute and demon-possessed. And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. And the multitudes marveled, saying, “It was never seen like this in Israel!” But the Pharisees said, “He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.”



<h2 id='tocuniq159'>(Vers. 33, 34.)</h2>

(Verse 33, 34.) And the crowds marveled, saying: Never has it appeared like this in Israel. But the Pharisees said: By the prince of demons he casts out demons. The crowd confesses the works of God, and says: Never has it appeared like this in Israel. In the crowd, there is a confession of the nations. But because the Pharisees could not deny the power of God, they slandered his works and said: By the prince of demons he casts out demons, thus demonstrating the unbelief of the Jews through their slander even today.



<h2 id='tocuniq160'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Verse 35.) And Jesus went about all the cities and towns, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Gospel of the kingdom, and healing all illness and every infirmity. You see that He preached the Gospel equally to both villages and cities, that is, to both large and small, so that He would not consider the power of the nobles, but the salvation of the believers. He went through the cities, having this work that the Father had commanded: and this hunger, to save the unbelievers with His teaching. But He was teaching the Gospel of the kingdom in the synagogues and villages, and after preaching and teaching, He cured every illness and every infirmity, so that those whom his words did not persuade, his deeds would persuade. He is properly called the Lord, who cares for every illness and every infirmity, for nothing is impossible for Him.

<h2 id='tocuniq161'>(Vers. 36.)</h2>

(Verse 36.) But seeing the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples. The persecution of the flock and sheep and the disturbance of the crowds is the fault of the shepherds and the vice of the leaders. Hence it follows.

<h2 id='tocuniq162'>(Vers. 37, 38.)</h2>

(Verse 37, 38.) Indeed, the harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. The abundant harvest signifies the multitude of people, while the few laborers represent a shortage of workers. And it is commanded to pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. These are the laborers whom the Psalmist speaks of, saying: Those who sow in tears will reap with joy. Going forth, they went and wept, carrying their seeds. But when they come, they will come with joy, carrying their sheaves (Psalm 126:7-8). And to speak more plainly, the abundant harvest is the entire crowd of believers. However, the workers are few, like the apostles and those who imitate them and are sent to the harvest.

<h2 id='tocuniq163'>(Chap. X.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 10, Verse 1) And having called his twelve disciples together, he gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. The kind and merciful Lord and Master does not withhold His powers from His servants and disciples. And just as he had healed all manner of sickness and all manner of disease, he also granted the apostles the power to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. But there is a great difference between having and giving, donating and receiving. Whatever he does, he does it by the power of the Lord: they, if they do anything, confess their weakness and the power of the Lord, saying: In the name of Jesus, rise up and walk (Acts 3:6). It should be noted that in the twelfth place, the power of signs is granted to the apostles.

<h2 id='tocuniq164'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(V. 2.) The names of the twelve apostles are as follows. The catalog of apostles is provided in order to exclude those who will be false apostles.

<h2 id='tocuniq165'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) The first is Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus. The order and merit of each apostle was determined by the one who searches the secrets of the heart. The first is written Simon, with the surname Peter, to distinguish him from the other Simon who is called the Cananaean, from the village of Cana in Galilee, where the Lord turned water into wine (John 2). He also calls James the son of Zebedee, because another James follows, James the son of Alphaeus. And he pairs the apostles together. He joins Peter and Andrew as brothers, not so much in flesh as in spirit. He also joins James and John, who, leaving behind the bread of the body, followed the true Father. He pairs Philip and Bartholomew, and also Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. The other evangelists, in the order of names, first mention Matthew; and afterwards Thomas, they do not mention the name of the tax collector, so as not to appear to criticize the evangelist while recalling the early way of life. But indeed, (as we said above), he places himself after Thomas and calls himself a publican, so that where sin abounded, grace may abound even more (Rom. V, 20).

<h2 id='tocuniq166'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) Simon the Cananaean. He is the one who is referred to in another Gospel (Luke VI) as Zealot. For Chana means zeal. Thaddaeus the apostle is said in the Ecclesiastical History to have been sent to King Abgar of Edessa, who is called by the evangelist Luke Judas, the son of James; and elsewhere he is called Lebbaeus (Acts I), which means little heart. And it is believed that he had a triple name: just as Simon was also called Peter (Mark III); and the sons of Zebedee were called Boanerges (or Banerges), because of the firmness and greatness of their faith.



And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. He took his name either from the village or city where he was born, or from the tribe of Issachar, so that it was born by some prophecy into the condemnation of itself. For Issachar is interpreted as wages, to signify the price of the traitor.

<h2 id='tocuniq167'>(Vers. 5, 6.)</h2>

(Verses 5, 6.) Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into the cities of the Samaritans: but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. This place is not contrary to the commandment which is afterwards said: Going, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost  (Matt. 28:19) . Because this is before the resurrection, and that after the resurrection is the commandment. And it was necessary to announce the first coming of Christ to the Jews, so that they would not have a just excuse for rejecting Him; because He sent the apostles to the Gentiles and to the Samaritans. But according to the tropology, those of us who are called by the name of Christ are commanded not to walk in the error of the way of the gentiles and heretics, so that as their religion is separated, let their way of life be separated as well.

<h2 id='tocuniq168'>(Vers. 7, 8.)</h2>

(Verse 7, 8.) And as you go, preach, saying: 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give. And let no one among the rural and uneducated people doubt, for those who promise the kingdom of heaven are given the power to heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons, in order to prove the greatness of the promises by the greatness of the signs. And because spiritual gifts (if the reward is of medium value) always become less valuable, condemnation of greed is added.

Freely you have received, freely give. I, as the master and Lord, have bestowed this upon you without cost, and you give without cost, so that the grace of the Gospel is not corrupted.

<h2 id='tocuniq169'>(Vers. 9, 10.)</h2>

(Vers. 9, 10.) Do not possess gold, silver, or money in your belts. Take no bag for the journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staff. For the worker deserves his food. Therefore, he gives these precepts to the evangelizers of truth, to whom he had said before: Freely you have received, freely give. For if they preach in such a way that they do not accept payment, the possession of gold, silver, and money is superfluous. For if they had gold and silver, they seemed to preach not for the sake of the salvation of souls, but for the sake of profit. Nor is there money in their purses. He who cuts off wealth, almost cuts off the necessities of life, as the apostolic teachers of true religion, who taught that all things are governed by the providence of God, showed themselves to think nothing of tomorrow. Not a bag on the way. By this precept he condemns the philosophers, who are commonly called Bactroperitae, because they despise the world and consider everything as worthless, and carried the storeroom with them. Nor two tunics. In two tunics it seems to me to show a double garment. Not that in the regions of Scythia and freezing snow, one should be satisfied with one tunic: but rather that we understand clothing in the tunic: so that, dressed in one thing, we do not preserve another thing out of fear of future events. Nor footwear. And Plato taught that the two summits of the body should not be covered, nor should we become accustomed to the softness of the head and feet. For when these things have strength, the rest are stronger. Not the rod: Why do we seek the help of the Lord, the protection of the staff? And because he had sent apostles somewhat dumb and unprepared to preach, and the condition of masters seemed hard, he tempered the severity of the command with the following sentiment, saying: The worker is worthy of his food. Only, he said, take what is necessary for you in food and clothing. And the Apostle also repeats: Having food and clothing, let us be content with these (I Tim. VI, 8). And in another place: Let him who is being catechized communicate the word to him who is catechizing him in all good things (Galat. VI, 6): so that those who reap spiritual things may make them companions of their carnal things: not in greed, but in necessity. We have said these things historically. However, according to the anagoge, it is not permitted for teachers to possess gold and silver, and money that is in belts. We often read about gold in terms of its value; silver, in terms of its use in conversation; copper, in terms of its sound. These things we are not allowed to receive from others, but to possess them as gifts from the Lord. Nor are we to embrace the teachings of heretics, philosophers, or false doctrines that are weighed down by the world, nor should we have two minds or allow our feet to be bound by deadly chains. Instead, as we enter the holy land, we are to be naked; we are not to have a staff that turns into a snake or rely on any support from the flesh. For this kind of staff and stick is made of reeds, and if you press on it even a little, it will break and pierce the hand of the one leaning on it.



<h2 id='tocuniq170'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11) Whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you leave. Concerning the appointment of bishops and deacons, Paul speaks; They must also have a good testimony from those who are outside. (1 Timothy 3:7). When the apostles entered a new city, they could not know what kind of person he was. Therefore, a host should be chosen by the reputation of the people and the judgment of the neighbors, so that the dignity of the preacher is not tarnished by the infamy of the recipient. When everyone should preach, one guest is chosen, not giving a favor to the one who is going to stay, but receiving it, for it is said, who is worthy in her, so that he may know himself more to receive grace than to give it.

<h2 id='tocuniq171'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>

(Verses 12, 13.) But when you enter the house, greet it. And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. The hidden greeting is expressed in Hebrew and Syriac speech. For what is said in Greek, χαῖρε, and in Latin, ave, is called in the Hebrew Syriac language Salom Lach () or Salom Emmach (), which means peace be with you. And the instruction is as follows: When you enter a house, bless the guest with peace, and as much as you can, calm the strife and quarrels. But if a contradiction arises, you will receive a reward for the offered peace: they, who wish to have war, will possess it.

<h2 id='tocuniq172'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. The dust is shaken off the feet as a testimony of their labor, that they have entered the city and the apostolic preaching has reached them. Whether the dust is shaken off so that they receive nothing from them, not even necessary food, those who have rejected the Gospel.



<h2 id='tocuniq173'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(v. 15) Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city. If it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah ((or Gomorheis)) than for that city which did not receive the Gospel, and therefore more tolerable, because to Sodom and Gomorrah the preaching was not given, but to this city it was given, and yet it did not receive the Gospel: therefore among sinners there are different punishments.



<h2 id='tocuniq174'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16) Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. He calls them wolves, scribes, and Pharisees, who are the Jewish clerics.

<h2 id='tocuniq175'>(Vers. 17, 18.)</h2>

(Verse 17, 18.) Be therefore wise as serpents, and innocent as doves. But beware of men: for they will deliver you up in councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues. And you shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. So that by prudence they may avoid snares, and by simplicity they may not do evil. The cleverness of the serpent is set as an example: because it hides its head with its whole body, and it protects the part where life is. And so, let us also, at the risk of our whole body, guard our head, who is Christ. The simplicity of doves is demonstrated by the appearance of the Holy Spirit. Hence, the Apostle also says: Be little children in malice (1 Corinthians 14:20).

<h2 id='tocuniq176'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Verse 19, 20.) But when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you should say. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should say. For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you. Above, he said: For they will hand you over to councils and flog you in their synagogues, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake. Therefore, when we are brought before judges because of Christ, we should only offer our own will for Christ. Moreover, Christ himself, who dwells within us, will speak for himself, and the grace of the Holy Spirit will be ministered in answering.

<h2 id='tocuniq177'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) But brother will betray brother to death, and father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death. And you will be hated by all because of my name. We frequently see this happening in persecutions: there is no loyal affection among them, for they have different beliefs.

<h2 id='tocuniq178'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) But whoever perseveres until the end, he will be saved. For it is not to begin, but to complete virtue.

<h2 id='tocuniq179'>(Vers. 23, 24.)</h2>

(Verse 23, 24.) But when they persecute you in this city, flee to another. Amen I say to you, you will not have finished going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes. A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. This refers to that time when the apostles were sent for preaching, to whom it is specifically said: Do not go into the way of the gentiles, and do not enter the cities of the Samaritans (Above, same.), they should not fear persecution, but should avoid it. Indeed, we see (or rather, we saw) that in the beginning, believers did this: when the persecution of Jerusalem arose, they were scattered throughout all Judea, so that the occasion of tribulation would become the seedbed of the Gospel. However, we can say spiritually: when they persecuted us in one city, that is, in one book of Scripture or testimony, we fled to other cities, that is, to other volumes. Although the persecutor may be contentious, the Savior's protection will come before victory is granted to our adversaries.



<h2 id='tocuniq180'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25) If they called the head of the household Beelzebub, how much more his household members! Therefore, do not fear them. Beelzebub is an idol of Accaron, which is called the idol of flies in the book of Kings (2 Kings 1). Beel is the same as Baal: Zebub means fly. Thus, they called the prince of demons by the filthy name of the most impure idol, which means fly, because of the filth that destroys the sweetness of oil (Ecclesiastes 10).



<h2 id='tocuniq181'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26) For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not be known. And how in the present age the vices of many are not known? But about the future time it is written, when God will judge the secrets of men, and will illuminate the hiding places of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of hearts. And the meaning is: Do not fear the cruelty of persecutors, and the rage of blasphemers, for the day of judgment will come, in which both your virtue and their wickedness will be demonstrated.



<h2 id='tocuniq182'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. What you have heard in secret, declare openly; what you have learned in private, speak publicly: what I have taught you in the small place of Judea, proclaim boldly in all cities and throughout the world.

<h2 id='tocuniq183'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28) And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Truly, the soul is invisible and incorporeal, according to the denser substance of our body. And it will certainly be punished and feel torments when it receives its original body, so that it may be punished with the one with whom it sinned.

But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. The name Gehenna is not found in the old books, but is first mentioned by the Savior. Let us therefore inquire what is the occasion of this statement. We have read more than once that there was an idol of Baal near Jerusalem, at the roots of Mount Moriah, where the Siloam flows. This valley and plain of small fields was irrigated and wooded, full of delights, and a grove consecrated to the idol. But the people of Israel had fallen into such great madness, that they sacrificed in the desolate vicinity of the temple, surpassing the strictness of religion with their delights, and they burned or initiated their sons into demons. And that place was called Gehenna, that is, the Valley of the Sons of Hinnom. This is written in the Book of Kings (2 Kings 23), Chronicles (2 Chronicles 28), and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 7, 19, and 32) in great detail. And God threatens that He will fill the place itself with the bodies of the dead, so that it may never be called Topheth and Baal, but may be called Polyandrium, that is, a burial mound of the dead. Therefore, the future punishments and eternal torments by which sinners are tormented are denoted by the name of this place. Moreover, we read in the book of Job (Job 24) that there are two hells, one of excessive heat and one of cold.

<h2 id='tocuniq184'>(Vers. 29 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 29 onwards) Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? Yet not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father's will. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows. Therefore, whoever confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven. But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven. The Lord's discourse is attached to itself, and the following depend on the preceding. Wise reader, always beware of a superstitious understanding; so that you do not conform the Scriptures to your own senses, but join your senses to the Scriptures, and understand what follows. Above he had said: 'Do not fear those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul'; now he speaks consequently, 'Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father.' And the meaning is this: If small and worthless animals do not perish without God as their author, and if there is providence in all things, and those things which are destined to perish do not perish without the will of God, then you who are eternal should not fear living without the providence of God. This meaning I have stated above: Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they? And afterwards: Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow, and so on. But if the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, God clothes it, how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith! Some forcefully interpret the two sparrows as representing the soul and the body. Even five sparrows, according to Luke (Luke XII), which are sold for two pennies, are referred to the senses. But how that understanding is adapted to the whole body of the Gospel message is not of little difficulty. But even the hairs of your head are all counted. Therefore, do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows. The deeper meaning of our previous explanation is expressed: that those who can kill the body should not be afraid, for they cannot kill the soul, and if even small animals do not fall without God's knowledge, how much more so for humans, who are supported by apostolic dignity! Moreover, when it is said that even the hairs of your head are all counted, it shows the immense providence of God towards humans and signifies His ineffable affection, that nothing about us escapes God, and even the smallest and most insignificant things do not elude His knowledge. They mock the ecclesiastical intelligence in this place, who deny the resurrection of the flesh, as if we were all saying that even the hairs that have been counted and cut by the barber will rise again, when the Savior did not say, 'But all the hairs on your head will be saved,' but 'They are counted.' Where there is number, the knowledge of number is demonstrated, not the preservation of the same number.

<h2 id='tocuniq185'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34) Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth: I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. Above, he had said: What I tell you in the dark, say in the light; and what you hear in your ear, preach on the housetops. Now he explains what follows after preaching. By the faith of Christ, the whole world is divided against itself: every household had both unbelievers and believers, and therefore a good war was sent, so that a bad peace would be broken. It is written that in Genesis God did a certain thing against the rebellious men who had been moved from the East and were hastening to build a tower (Gen. XI) through which they might penetrate the heights of heaven, in order to divide their languages. Therefore, in the psalm, David prays: Disperse, O Lord, the nations who desire war (Ps. LXVII, 32).

<h2 id='tocuniq186'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Verse 35) For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man's enemies will be those of his own household. This passage is written in almost the same words in the prophet Micah (Micah 7). And it should be noted whenever a testimony from the Old Testament is presented, whether the meaning alone or also the wording agrees.

<h2 id='tocuniq187'>(Vers. 37.)</h2>

(Verse 37.) Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. He who had previously stated: I did not come to bring peace, but a sword; and to divide people against father and mother, and mother-in-law, so that no one would put piety before religion, he added, saying, Whoever loves father or mother more than me. And in the Song of Songs we read: Set me as a seal upon your heart (Song 2:4). This order is necessary in every affection. Love after God the Father, love the mother, love the children. But if necessity comes, that the love of parents and children be compared to the love of God, and both cannot be preserved, let there be hatred towards one's own, and devotion towards God. Therefore, he did not forbid loving the father or mother, but specifically added: Whoever loves the father or mother more than me.

<h2 id='tocuniq188'>(Vers. 38, 39.)</h2>

(Verse 38, 39.) And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it. In another Gospel it is written: Whoever does not take up their cross daily. Let us not think that the ardor of faith can be enough once and for all, the cross must always be carried, so that we may always teach ourselves to love Christ.

<h2 id='tocuniq189'>(Vers. 40.)</h2>

(Verse 40.) Whoever receives you, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives the one who sent me. A most beautiful order. It sends for preaching, teaches not to fear dangers, and subjects one's feelings to religion. He had carried gold above, and had shaken off bronze from his belt. The condition of the evangelists is difficult. So, where does the income come from, where does the necessary sustenance come from? Hope moderates the severity of the commandments with the promises. Whoever receives you, he says, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives the one who sent me, so that in receiving the apostles, each of the believers may consider that they have received Christ.



<h2 id='tocuniq190'>(Vers. 41.)</h2>

(Verse 41.) Whoever receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward. And whoever receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward. Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet and understands him speaking of future things, he will receive a prophet's reward. Therefore, the Jews, understanding the prophets in a carnal way, will not receive the reward of the prophets. On another note: In every profession, there is a mixture of weeds with wheat. He had said earlier: Whoever receives you, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives the one who sent me. He had invited the disciples to the reception of the masters. The response of the believers could be hidden; therefore, we must receive both false prophets and the traitor Judas, and provide them with sustenance. The Lord, anticipating this, says that it is not the persons that should be received, but the names, and those who receive them should not lose their reward, even if the person received was unworthy.

<h2 id='tocuniq191'>(Vers. 42.)</h2>

(Verse 42.) And whoever gives a drink to one of these little ones, only a cup of cold water, in the name of a disciple, amen I say to you, he will not lose his reward. We read in the prophet David: To make excuses for sins (Ps CXL, 4): that many present their sins as if they were justifying circumstances, so that they may appear to sin out of necessity rather than by choice: The Lord, the searcher of hearts and reins, contemplates future thoughts in each one. He had said: Whoever receives you, receives me. But this commandment could be hindered by many false prophets and false teachers; he also addressed this scandal, saying: Whoever receives the righteous in the name of the righteous, will receive the reward of the righteous. Again, another could argue and say: I am prevented by poverty, thinness holds me back, so that I cannot be hospitable. And he dilutes this excuse with a very light commandment, so that we may offer a cup of cold water with all our heart. He said, cold waters are not hot, nor is there any lack of firewood in hot waters, lest it be an occasion for poverty and want. The Apostle also commanded such a thing to the Galatians, as we have said before: 'Let him who is catechized communicate his word to him who catechizes him in all good things' (Galatians 6:6), and he urges his disciples to provide refreshment to their teachers. Because anyone could feign poverty and evade the command, before he presents it, he solves the imminent question, saying: 'Do not be deceived, God is not mocked.' For whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. And this is the meaning: you argue in vain about poverty, when your conscience tells you otherwise: you can deceive me who encourages you; but know that as much as you sow, so shall you reap.

Book Two

<h2 id='tocuniq193'>(Chap. XI.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

Chapter 11, Verses 1-2. And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished instructing His twelve disciples, that He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities. It is not as if He was unaware and asking; for He had already shown the others who were unaware, saying: Behold, the Lamb of God, behold Him who takes away the sins of the world (John 1:29), and He had heard the voice of the Father, thundering: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased (Matthew 3:17). But the Savior asks where Lazarus has been laid, so that those who were indicating the place of the tomb would at least be prepared to see the dead man rising again, and the disciples would be sent to Christ to witness the signs and miracles, so that through this opportunity they would believe in Him and learn from their Master. But the disciples of John, through their pride against the Lord, and their envy and malicious opposition, also revealed their thoughts in a superior manner, as the Evangelist reports: Then the disciples of John approached him, saying: Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast (Ibid., IX, 14)? And in another place: Master, to whom you gave testimony at the Jordan, look, his disciples are baptizing and everyone is coming to him (John III, 26), as if to say: We are being abandoned, there is a scarcity here, while a crowd gathers around him.



<h2 id='tocuniq194'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect another? He does not say, 'You are the one who has come,' but rather, 'You are the one who is to come.' And the meaning is this: Send to me, because I am about to descend into the underworld, whether I should announce you to the dead, who I have announced to the living? Does it not befit the Son of God to taste death, and to send another to these sacraments?

<h2 id='tocuniq195'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

(Ver. 4, 5.) And Jesus answered and said to them, 'Go and tell John what you hear and see: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up.' John had asked through his disciples: 'Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?' Jesus shows the signs, not responding to what had been asked, but to the stumbling block of the messengers: 'Go and tell John the things which you hear and see: The blind see and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up.' And what is no less important about these things,

The poor are evangelized. Either the poor in spirit, or certainly the poor in wealth (or works), so that there is no distinction in preaching between the noble and the lowly, the rich and the needy. These things confirm the strictness of the teacher, the truth of the instructor, that all are equal before him who can be saved. And what he says:

<h2 id='tocuniq196'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Ver. 6.) And blessed is he who is not scandalized in me. He strikes down the messengers, as will be shown in the following.

<h2 id='tocuniq197'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) But as they were departing, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Look, those who wear soft clothing are in the palaces of kings. If a harsh judgment had been pronounced against John, as many believe, then why is he now being praised so highly? But because the surrounding crowd did not know the mystery of the question, and thought that John doubted about Christ, whom he had pointed out with his finger, so that they would understand that John was not asking for himself, but for his disciples: Why, he said, do you go out into the desert? Is it perhaps to see a man resembling a reed that is carried by every wind, and to have doubts about the one he had previously proclaimed? Or is it possible that he is compelled by the stings of envy against me, and his preaching seeks empty glory, so that he may seek profits from it? Why does he desire riches, so that he may abound in feasts? He feeds on locusts and wild honey. Does he dress in soft clothing? The covering of his body is made of camel hair. Such food and clothing are received in the prison's lodging, and the preaching of truth has such a dwelling. But those who are flatterers and pursue gains, seeking wealth, and abound in pleasures, and dress in soft clothing, they are in the houses of kings. From which it is shown that a strict and austere life and preaching should avoid the courts of kings, and decline the palaces of soft people.



<h2 id='tocuniq198'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) But what did you go out to see, a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. In him, John is greater than the other prophets, because while they had predicted someone who was to come, he pointed to the one who has already come, saying: Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world. And because to the privilege of being a prophet, John added the reward of baptizing his Lord, it follows that he increased in merits, fulfilling the testimony of Malachi, in which even an angel is prophesied (Mal. II). However, here the term 'angel' cannot be understood as referring to John by nature, but rather by the dignity of his office, that is, as a messenger who announced the coming of the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq199'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11) Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people have been raiding it. For it does not immediately follow that if others are not greater than him, he is greater than others; but that he has equality with the other saints.

But whoever is lesser in the kingdom of heaven is greater than him. Many want to understand this about the Savior, that whoever is lesser in time is greater in dignity. But let us understand simply: that every saint, who is already with God, is greater than him who still stands in battle. For it is one thing to possess the crown of victory, another to still fight in the battle. Some want to receive the last angel in heaven ministering to the Lord as better than any first man who dwells on earth.



<h2 id='tocuniq200'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(V.12) But from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!



<h2 id='tocuniq201'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John. Not that they exclude the prophets after John. For we read in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 11:21) that Agabus and the four virgin daughters of Philip prophesied. But what the Law and the prophets, whose writings we read, prophesied, they prophesied about the Lord. Therefore, when it is said, 'All the prophets and the Law prophesied until John,' it indicates the time of Christ, so that John, who they said would come, would show that he has come.



<h2 id='tocuniq202'>(Vers. 14, 15.)</h2>

(Verse 14, 15.) And if you want to receive it, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. This which was said, if you want to receive it, he is Elijah, signifies a mystical understanding and requires intelligence, as the following words of the Lord demonstrate, saying: He who has ears to hear, let him hear. For if the meaning were clear and the sentiment evident, why would it be necessary for us to be prepared for its understanding? Therefore, John is called Elijah, not according to foolish philosophers and certain heretics, who introduce reincarnation, but because, as another testimony of the Gospel states, he came in the spirit and power of Elijah, he had the same grace or measure of the Holy Spirit. But the austerity of life and the firmness of mind of Elijah and John are equal. For Elijah lived in the desert, and so did John: Elijah wore a leather belt, and so did John. Elijah, because he accused King Ahab and Jezebel of impiety, was forced to flee (3 Kings 19); John, because he accused Herod and Herodias of unlawful marriage, was beheaded. There are those who think that John is called Elijah because just as Elijah is said to precede the second coming of the Savior according to Malachi, and announce the coming Judge, so did John in the first coming; and both are messengers of either the first coming of the Lord, or the second.



<h2 id='tocuniq203'>(Vers. 16 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 16 onwards) But to whom shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to their playmates, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.' For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' And wisdom is justified by her children. To the boys sitting in the marketplace and shouting and saying to their companions: We sang to you, and you did not dance; we mourned, and you did not weep. The generation of the Jews is compared, the Scripture saying: To what shall I compare this generation? It is like the boys sitting in the marketplace, and so on. Therefore, not to us is attributed free intelligence, and the passive interpretation of allegories: but whatever we are going to say about the boys, it must be referred to the likeness of the generation. You are the children who sit in the forum, of whom Isaiah speaks: Behold, I and the children whom God has given me (Isa. VIII, 18). And in the 18th psalm (Verse 8): The testimony of the Lord is faithful, providing wisdom to the little ones. And elsewhere: Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise (Ps. VIII, 3). Therefore, these children sat in the forum, or ἐν ἀγορᾷ as it is more significantly expressed in Greek, where many things are for sale. And because the people of the Jews did not want to listen, they not only spoke to them, but shouted with full mouths: We have sung to you, and you did not dance; we have provoked you to do good works to our song, and to dance to our pipe, just as David danced before the ark of the Lord (2 Samuel 6), and you did not want to. We have lamented, and we have provoked you to repentance, and you did not want to do this either, rejecting both preaching, both exhortation to virtues and penance after sins. It is not surprising if you have despised the double way of salvation, both the fasting of God and also abundance. If fasting pleases you, why was John displeasing? If feasting, why was the Son of Man displeased? One of them you call possessed by a demon, the other a glutton and a drunkard. But because you did not want to accept both disciplines, wisdom has been justified by her children: that is, by the dispensation and teaching of God. And I, who am the power and wisdom of God (1 Corinthians 1), have been proved right by my apostles and sons, to whom the Father has revealed what he had hidden from the wise and prudent among themselves (John 17). In certain Gospels it is read: Wisdom is justified by her works (Luke 7:35). For wisdom does not seek testimony from words, but from actions.

<h2 id='tocuniq204'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20.) Then he began to reproach the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. The reproach of the cities of Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum is explained by the heading of this chapter. He reproached them because after performing many miracles and signs, they did not repent.

<h2 id='tocuniq205'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verse 21, 22.) Woe to you, Chorazin; woe to you, Bethsaida: for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you. Chorazin and Bethsaida, cities of Galilee, are mourned by the Savior because despite the many signs and miracles, they did not repent, and are surpassed by Tyre and Sidon, idolatrous cities given to vice. They are preferred, however, because Tyre and Sidon have only violated natural law, whereas these, after transgressing natural law, have also disregarded the signs that were performed among them. We are inquiring where it is written that the Lord performed signs in Chorazin and Bethsaida. Above, we read: 'And he went through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction' (Matthew 9:35). Therefore, among the other cities and villages, it is to be presumed that the Lord also performed signs in Chorazin and Bethsaida.



<h2 id='tocuniq206'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to the realm of the dead. In another version, we find: And you, Capernaum, which was exalted to heaven, will descend to the depths. And there are two different understandings. Perhaps you will descend to the depths because you have proudly resisted my preaching. Or perhaps because you, exalted to heaven in my presence and witnessing my signs and miracles, having such privilege, will be punished with greater sufferings for refusing to believe in them as well.



<h2 id='tocuniq207'>(Vers. 23, 24.)</h2>

(Vers. 23, 24.) Because if in Sodom (or, as some say, in Sidon) the miracles had been done that have been done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. Let the prudent reader ask and say whether Tyre and Sidon and Sodom could have repented at the preaching of the Savior and the signs of miracles, and it is not their fault that they did not believe, but the sin of silence is in him who did not want to preach repentance to those who would have acted on it. To which the easy and clear answer is: to be ignorant of the judgments of God, and to not know the sacraments of his dispensations. The purpose was for the Lord to not exceed the boundaries of Judea, so as not to give the Pharisees and priests a just occasion for persecution. Therefore, before the passion, he commanded the apostles: Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into the cities of the Samaritans (Matthew 10:5). Therefore, Chorazin and Bethsaida are condemned because they refused to believe in the present Lord. Tyre and Sidon are justified because they believed in his apostles. Do not question the times when you witness the salvation of the believers. However, in Capernaum, which means the most beautiful town, unbelieving Jerusalem is condemned, to whom it is said through Ezekiel: Sodom was justified because of you (Ezek. XVI, 52).

<h2 id='tocuniq208'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25) At that time, Jesus answered and said: I confess to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth. Confession, not always repentance, but also signifies thanksgiving, as we often read in the psalms. Let those who calumniate the Savior for calling his Father the Lord of heaven and earth, not as one who is born, but as one who is created, hear. For if he is also a creature, and a creature can call its creator father, it would be foolish not to call both himself and the Lord of heaven and earth, or Father, in the same way.



74 Because you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to little ones. He gives thanks and rejoices in the Father, because the sacraments of his coming have been revealed to the apostles, which the scribes and Pharisees, who consider themselves wise, have ignored, and in their own sight, prudent. Wisdom has been justified by her children.

<h2 id='tocuniq209'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26.) Yes, Father, because it was pleasing to You in this way. Speaking with affection to the Father, that the work begun in the apostles may be completed.

<h2 id='tocuniq210'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) Everything has been handed over to me by my Father. And understand mystically the One who hands over the Father and the One who receives the Son. Otherwise, if we want to feel according to our weakness, when the one receiving starts to have, the one giving will start to not have. However, everything that has been handed over to Him does not mean the heavens and the earth, and the elements, and the rest that He Himself made and created: but those who, through the Son, have access to the Father, and who previously were rebellious, began to feel God afterwards.



And no one knows the Son except the Father, nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal. Let Eunomius be ashamed of claiming to have such knowledge of the Father and the Son as they have of each other. But if he persists in this and consoles himself in his madness because it follows, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal. It is one thing to know by the equality of nature what you know, and another by the dignity of the revealer.

<h2 id='tocuniq211'>(Vers. 28, 29.)</h2>

(Verse 28, 29.) Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart, and you will find rest for your souls. The weight of sin is heavy, and the prophet Zacharias testifies, saying, iniquity sits upon a talent of lead (Zacch. 5). And the Psalmist laments: My iniquities have overwhelmed me (Psalm 38:4). Certainly, it invites those who were oppressed under the heavy yoke of the Law to the grace of the Gospel.

<h2 id='tocuniq212'>(Vers. 30.)</h2>

(Verse 30.) For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. How is the Gospel lighter than the Law, when in the Law murder is condemned, but in the Gospel anger is condemned? In what way is the grace of the Gospel easier, when in the Law adultery is punished, but in the Gospel lust is punished? In the Law there are many precepts, which the Apostle teaches cannot be fully fulfilled (Acts 15). In the Law, works are required, and whoever does them shall live. In the Gospel, the will is sought, and even if it does not have the desired effect, it does not lose the reward. The Gospel commands what we are able to do: that we do not desire, namely, this is within our power. When the law does not punish the will, it punishes the effect, so that you do not commit adultery. Imagine a virgin prostitute in persecution. This virgin is accepted according to the Gospel, since she does not sin by her own will, but she is rejected in the Law as if corrupted.


<h2 id='tocuniq213'>(Chap. XII.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 12, Verse 1) At that time, Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath; and His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. In another Gospel, we also read that because of their great need, they did not even have a place to eat, and therefore they were hungry like men (Mark 2 and Luke 6). The fact that they rubbed the heads of grain with their hands and found solace in hunger is an indication of a more austere life; they sought simple food, not prepared feasts.



<h2 id='tocuniq214'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(V2.) But the Pharisees, seeing this, said to him: Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful for them to do on the Sabbath. Note that the first apostles of the Savior destroy the letter of the Sabbath against the Ebionites, who, while accepting the other apostles, reject Paul as a transgressor of the law.

<h2 id='tocuniq215'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(Ver. 3, 4.) But he said to them: Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? To refute the slander of the Pharisees, he recalls an old story, when David, fleeing from Saul, came to Nob and was received by the priest Ahimelech. He asked for food, and since he did not have any ordinary bread, Ahimelech gave him the consecrated bread, which only the priests and Levites were allowed to eat. And he merely asked if there were any boys in the world born of women; and when he responded, without hesitation, he did not hesitate to give bread, deeming it better to free people from the danger of hunger, as the prophet says: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice' (Hosea 6:6), rather than to offer sacrifice to God. For a merciful offering is pleasing to God and the salvation of humanity. Therefore, the Lord opposes and says: 'If even David, who is holy, and Ahimelech the high priest, are not condemned by you, but rather both have transgressed the command of the Law with a justifiable excuse, and hunger is the cause, why do you not approve the same hunger in the apostles, which you approve in others?' Although there is a great difference in this. Those people rubbed the ears of grain in their hands on the Sabbath, while others ate the Levitical loaves and came near the feast of the New Moon, on which day he was sought for at the banquet and fled from the royal court. Note that neither David nor his servants took the showbread before they answered that they were clean from women.

<h2 id='tocuniq216'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) Have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath and yet are without guilt? But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here. If you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.” (Matthew 12:5-8) However, the Laws of God are never contradictory to themselves. And wisely, when his disciples were able to be accused of transgression, David and Achimelech mention examples that they followed: but he attributes the violation of the Sabbath, true and without excuse, to those who had committed slander.

<h2 id='tocuniq217'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) But I tell you that here is a greater temple. Here, is not a pronoun, but an adverb of place; that the place, which holds the Lord of the temple, is greater than the temple.

<h2 id='tocuniq218'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) But if you knew what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless. What it means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' we have already explained. But what follows, 'You would not have condemned the guiltless,' refers to the apostles. And the meaning is this: If you approved of Achimelech's mercy, because he refreshed David and his men who were in danger of starvation, why do you condemn my disciples, who have done nothing similar?



<h2 id='tocuniq219'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) And when he had passed from there, he came into their synagogue. And behold, there was a man with a withered hand. This is the thirteenth one who is healed in the synagogue. And it should be noted that his hand was healed not on the road or outside, but in the council of the Jews.

<h2 id='tocuniq220'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) And they asked him, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him. Because he had previously defended himself and his disciples against the accusation of breaking the sabbath by a valid example, the Pharisees now want to falsely accuse him. They ask whether it is lawful to heal on the sabbath day, so that if he does not heal, they can accuse him of cruelty or weakness; but if he does heal, they can accuse him of transgression.

<h2 id='tocuniq221'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Vs. 10 seqq.) But he said to them: Which one of you, having a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath. In this way, he solved the proposed question, so as to condemn those who were questioning out of greed. If, he said, on the Sabbath you hurry to rescue a sheep or any other animal that falls into a pit, not because of the animal, but because of your greed, how much more should I free a man, who is much more valuable than a sheep!



<h2 id='tocuniq222'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) Then he said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" And he stretched it out, and his health was restored like the other. In the Gospel used by the Nazarenes and Ebionites (which we recently translated from Hebrew into Greek, and which some call the authentic Gospel of Matthew), this man, who has a withered hand, is said to be a mason, praying for help with these words: \"I was a mason, seeking food with my hands. I beg you, Jesus, to restore my health, so that I may not shamefully beg for food.\ Until the coming of the Savior, the hand of God was dry in the synagogue of the Jews, and His works were not performed in it: but after He came to the earth, His right hand was restored to the believing apostles, and the former work was renewed.

<h2 id='tocuniq223'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him, how they might destroy him. The reason they plot against the Lord is envy. For what had he done to provoke the Pharisees to kill him? It was because he had stretched out his hand. For who among the Pharisees does not stretch out their hand on the Sabbath, carrying food and extending a cup, and all the other things that are necessary for sustenance? Therefore, if it is not a crime to stretch out one's hand and lift up food or drink on the Sabbath, why do they accuse him of doing something they themselves are guilty of, especially when this builder did not carry such things, but only stretched out his hand in accordance with the command of the Lord?



<h2 id='tocuniq224'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 and following) But Jesus, knowing this, departed from there, and many followed him, and he healed them all. And he commanded them not to make him known, so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, saying, Knowing their plot, that they wanted to destroy their Savior, he departed from there, in order to take away from the Pharisees the opportunity for wickedness against himself.

<h2 id='tocuniq225'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not strive, nor cry out. Through the prophet Isaiah, this is spoken in the person of the Father: I will put my spirit upon him (Isaiah 42:1). The spirit is not placed upon the Word of God, nor upon the only begotten, who proceeded from the Father's bosom, but upon him of whom it is said: Behold my servant (ibidem).



<h2 id='tocuniq226'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) Neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets. For the way is broad and spacious that leads to destruction, and many enter through it (Mat. 7:13). Those who do not hear the voice of the Savior are many, because they are not on the narrow path, but on the spacious one.

<h2 id='tocuniq227'>(Vers. 20, 21.)</h2>

(Verse 20, 21.) He will not break a bruised reed, and he will not extinguish smoking flax, until he brings forth judgment to victory. And in his name the Gentiles will hope. He who does not reach out his hand to the sinner, nor carries the burden of his brother, he breaks the bruised reed. And he who despises the small spark of faith in the little ones, he extinguishes smoking flax. Christ has done neither of these; for this is why he came, to save what was lost.



<h2 id='tocuniq228'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that he could speak and see. All the crowds were amazed and said, 'Could this be the Son of David?' But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, 'This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the prince of demons.' Three signs were performed simultaneously in one man: the blind see, the mute speak, and the one possessed by a demon is set free. This was indeed done in a physical sense at that time, but it is also fulfilled daily in the conversion of believers, so that after the demon is expelled, they first see the light of faith, and then their mouths are opened in praise of God.



<h2 id='tocuniq229'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25) But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself shall be made desolate, and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand. The crowds marveled and confessed that he, who performed such great signs, was the son of David. But the Pharisees attributed the works of God to the prince of demons. To them, the Lord did not respond to their words, but to their thoughts, so that they might be compelled to believe in his power, who saw the hidden things of the heart.



<h2 id='tocuniq230'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26) And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand? A kingdom and a city divided against themselves cannot endure; but just as small things grow by harmony, so great things are destroyed by discord. Therefore, if Satan fights against himself, and a demon is an enemy of a demon, then the end of the world should have already come; so that opposing powers would not have a place in it, and their war would be the peace of mankind. But if you think, O scribes and Pharisees, that the expulsion of demons is by the power of their prince, in order to deceive ignorant men by fraudulent pretense, what can you say about the healings of bodies, which the Lord performed? It is one thing if the weakness of limbs and the signs of spiritual virtues are also assigned to demons.

<h2 id='tocuniq231'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27) And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. He indicates the sons of Judaeans, either the exorcists of that nation according to custom, or the apostles generated from their lineage. If exorcists, who were casting out demons by invoking God, are constrained by wise questioning to confess that it is the work of the Holy Spirit. He says that if the expulsion of demons is attributed to God and not to demons in your sons, why should the same work and cause not apply to me? Therefore your judges will be, not by power, but by comparison: while they assign the expulsion of demons to God; you to Beelzebub, the prince of demons. But if it is said of the apostles, which we must understand more, they will be their judges: because they will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel (Matthew 19 and Luke 22).

<h2 id='tocuniq232'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28.) But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. In Luke, we read this passage as follows: But if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you (Luke 11:20). This is the finger that the Magi confessed, who were making signs against Moses and Aaron, saying: This is the finger of God (Exodus 8:19). By this finger, the stone tablets were written on Mount Sinai (Deuteronomy 9). Therefore, if the hand and arm of God is the Son, and his finger is the Holy Spirit, then the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are of one substance: let the inequality of the members not scandalize you, for the unity of the body builds it.



Therefore, the kingdom of God has come upon you. It signifies either himself, about whom it is written in another place: The kingdom of God is within you (Luke 17:21). And: One stands among you, whom you do not know (John 26). Or certainly that kingdom which both John and the Lord himself preached: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand (Matthew 3:2). There is also a third kingdom of Holy Scripture, which is taken away from the Jews and will be given to a nation producing its fruits (Matthew 21).



<h2 id='tocuniq233'>(Vers. 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29.) Or how can anyone enter the strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house. We should not be secure: Our adversary is strong, which is confirmed by the voice of the victor. His house is the world, which is situated in evil (1 John 5), not by the dignity of the Creator, but by the greatness of the transgressor. We were once his vessels. The strong man has been bound, and bound in Tartarus, and crushed by the foot of the Lord. And with the seats of the tyrant plundered, captivity has been taken captive.



<h2 id='tocuniq234'>(Vers. 30, 31.)</h2>

(Verses 30, 31.) Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. Therefore I say to you: every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Let no one think that this is said about heretics and schismatics (although it can be understood in that way from what is said in excess), but it refers to the consequences and context of the discourse to the devil: because the works of the Savior cannot be compared to the works of Beelzebub. He desires to hold captive the souls of men; the Lord desires to set them free. He preaches idols; this one preaches the knowledge of the one God. He draws towards vices; this one calls back to virtues. How, then, can they have concord, whose actions are divided (or different)?

<h2 id='tocuniq235'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32.) And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the age to come. And how is it that some of our bishops and priests, after blaspheming against the Holy Spirit, are reinstated in their positions, when the Savior says that all sins and blasphemies will be forgiven to men, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in the present time or in the future? Unless perhaps we take that example from the evangelist Mark, who expressed the causes of such anger more clearly, saying: 'Because they were saying, He has an unclean spirit.' Therefore, whoever attributes the works of the Savior to Beelzebub, the prince of demons, and says that the Son of God has an unclean spirit, to this person blasphemy will never be forgiven. Or perhaps this passage should be understood as follows: Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, being scandalized by my flesh and considering me only human, that I am the son of a carpenter and have brothers named James, Joseph, and Judas; and that I am a glutton and a drunkard, such an opinion and blasphemy, although it is not without fault of error, nevertheless will receive forgiveness on account of the lowliness of the body. But those who clearly understand the works of God, since they cannot deny the power, driven by the same envy, they slander; and they say that Christ, the Word of God, and the works of the Holy Spirit are Beelzebub: these will not be forgiven, neither in this age, nor in the age to come.

<h2 id='tocuniq236'>(Vers. 33.)</h2>

(Verse 33.) Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad. For the tree is known by its fruit. It constrains them with an unassailable argument, which the Greeks call ἄφυκτον and we can call inevitable: it concludes from questions asked here and there, and presses with both horns. If, he says, the devil is evil, he cannot do good works. But if the works you see are good, it follows that the one who does them is not the devil. For it is not possible for good to arise from evil, or for evil to arise from good. But as follows:

<h2 id='tocuniq237'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) Brood of vipers, how can you speak good when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. It reveals that they are a bad tree, producing fruit of blasphemy, which have the seeds of the devil.

<h2 id='tocuniq238'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Verse 35) A good man brings forth good treasures. And an evil man brings forth evil treasures. Either it shows the Jews themselves blaspheming the Lord, from what wicked treasure they bring forth blasphemies, or with the previous question, the opinion clings that just as a good man cannot bring forth evil things, nor can an evil man bring forth good things, so Christ cannot do evil things, and the devil cannot do good works.

<h2 id='tocuniq239'>(Vers. 36, 37.)</h2>

(Verse 36, 37.) But I tell you that every idle word that men speak, they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment. For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned. This also aligns with what was said before. And the meaning is this: If an idle word, which does not edify the listeners, is not without danger for the one who speaks it, and each person will have to give an account for their own words on the day of judgment, how much more will you, who revile the works of the Holy Spirit and say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, have to give an account for your slander! Idle speech is that which is spoken by the speaker and heard by the listener without any usefulness: if we omit serious matters and talk about frivolous things, and tell old stories. However, whoever responds with jests and breaks out in laughter and utters something shameful, they will be held guilty not of idle speech, but of a crime.

<h2 id='tocuniq240'>(Vers. 38.)</h2>

(Verse 38) Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you." They demand a sign as if the signs they had seen were not enough. But in another Gospel it is explained more fully what they are asking for: "We want to see a sign from heaven" (Mark 8:11). They either wanted fire to come down from above like Elijah, or they wanted thunder to roar, lightning to flash, and rain to pour down in the summertime against the natural order of the place, so that they could not accuse Jesus of working these wonders in secret or attribute them to various natural phenomena. For those who calumny the things which they see with their eyes, hold with their hand, and experience through usefulness: what will you do with those things which have come from heaven? Surely you will respond that the magicians in Egypt performed many signs from heaven (Exod. VII).

<h2 id='tocuniq241'>(Vers. 39.)</h2>

(Verse 39.) And he answered and said to them: An evil and adulterous generation. Admirably said adulterous: because she had dismissed her husband, and according to Ezekiel, had joined herself to many lovers (Ezek. 16).

<h2 id='tocuniq242'>(Vers. 40.)</h2>

(Verse 40.) He seeks a sign, and a sign will not be given to him, except the sign of Jonah the prophet (John 2). For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. We have discussed this passage more fully in the Commentaries of the prophet Jonah; therefore, we leave it to the diligence of the reader to refer to that passage. Having briefly mentioned this, we are content that the whole should be understood in part through synecdoche: not that the Lord stood in hell for all three days and three nights, but that in part of the day of Preparation, the day of the Lord, and the whole day of the Sabbath, three days and three nights are understood.



<h2 id='tocuniq243'>(Vers. 41.)</h2>

(Verse 41) The men of Nineveh will rise up in judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah. Not by the power of judgment, but by the example of comparison.

And behold, here is more than Jonah. Here, 'here' is an adverb of place, not a pronoun. Jonah, according to the Septuagint Interpreters, preached for three days: I for so much time. He to the unbelieving Assyrians: I to the people of God, the Jews. He to foreigners: I to fellow citizens. He spoke in simple words, doing nothing of signs: I doing so many signs, enduring the slander of Beelzebub. Therefore, there is more of Jonah here, that is, currently among you.



<h2 id='tocuniq244'>(Vers. 42.)</h2>

(Verse 42.) The Queen of Austria will rise in judgment with this generation, and will condemn it because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, someone greater than Solomon is here. In the same way, the Queen of Austria will condemn the people of Judah, just as the men of Nineveh condemned the unbelieving Israel. This, however, is the Queen of Sheba, of whom we read in the Book of Kings and Chronicles: she, despite all the difficulties and leaving her people and empire behind, came to Judah to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and she brought him many gifts. But in Nineveh, the faith of the nations is secretly preferred to that of Israel.

<h2 id='tocuniq245'>(Vers. 43.)</h2>

(Verse 43) But whenever an unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it roams through arid places, searching for rest but does not find any. Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept clean, and put in order. Then it goes and brings along with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And the last state of that person becomes worse than the first. For heretics are in a much worse condition than the Gentiles: because in the former there is hope of faith, and in the latter there is the battle of discord. Although this understanding seems to prefer applause and the appearance of doctrine, I do not know whether it has the truth. For from the fact that a finite or parabolic, or exemplary, sequence follows: so it will be for this wicked generation: we are compelled not to refer to heretics and any other people, but to the Jewish people as a parable, so that the context of the passage does not flow passively and vaguely in different directions and is confused like the custom of fools; but let it adhere to itself, either responding to what came before or what comes after. An unclean spirit went out from the Jews, when they received the Law, and walked through dry places, seeking rest for itself. Being driven out by the Jews, it walked through the deserted places of the Gentiles; and when they later believed in the Lord, he, not finding a place among the nations, said:

<h2 id='tocuniq246'>(Vers. 44.)</h2>

(Verse 44.) I will return to my home, from which I departed. This is, I will go to the Jews, whom I had dismissed before.

<h2 id='tocuniq247'>(Vers. 45.)</h2>

(Verse 45) And coming, he finds it empty, swept clean, and put in order. Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So it will be with this wicked generation. For the temple of the Jews was empty, and it did not have Christ as a guest, who said: Rise, let us go from here (John 14:31). And in another place: Your house shall be left to you desolate (Luke 13:35). Therefore, since both God and the angels did not have protection, and they were adorned with superfluous observances of the Law and traditions of the Pharisees, the devil returns to his former seat: and adding to himself a group of demons, he inhabits his former home, and the last things of that people become worse than the previous ones. For now they are possessed by a much greater number of demons, blaspheming Christ Jesus in their synagogues, than they were possessed in Egypt before the knowledge of the Law: for it is one thing not to believe in the coming One, and another not to receive Him who has come. But the number seven, whether understood to refer to the devil because of the Sabbath, or because of the number of the Holy Spirit: just as it is narrated that the seven spirits of virtues descended upon the rod from the root of Jesse and the flower that ascended from the root (Isa. XI); so, on the contrary, the number of vices is consecrated in the devil.

<h2 id='tocuniq248'>(Vers. 46 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 46 and following) While he was still speaking to the crowds, behold his mother and brothers stood outside seeking to speak to him. But someone said to him: Look, your mother and brothers stand outside seeking you. But he answered the one who told him, saying: Who is my mother, and who are my brothers? And stretching out his hand towards his disciples, he said. The Lord was occupied with the work of speaking, teaching the people, and fulfilling the duty of preaching, while his mother and brothers came and stood outside, desiring to speak to him. Then someone announces to the Savior that his mother and brothers are standing outside, seeking him. It seems to me that this person who announces it is not doing so by chance and simply: but is setting a trap for the Savior, whether he prefers spiritual work over flesh and blood. Therefore, the Lord, not because he denied his mother and brothers, ignored their request to go out; but because he responded to the one laying a trap, extending his hand towards his disciples, he said:

<h2 id='tocuniq249'>(Vers. 49, 50.)</h2>

(Verses 49, 50.) Behold my mother and my brothers. For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother. These are my mother, who daily begets me in the souls of believers. These are my brothers, who do the works of my Father. Therefore, he did not deny his mother, as Marcion and Manichaeus believed, that he was born from a phantom; but he preferred the apostles to kinship, so that we may also prefer the spirit to the flesh in comparison of love. Behold, your mother and brothers are standing outside, seeking you. Some of the Lord's brothers suspect that Joseph had children by another wife, following the delusions of the apocryphal writings and inventing a certain Melcha or Escha as a little woman. But as it is contained in the book that we wrote against Helvidius, by the brothers of the Lord, we understand the children of Mary's sister, who is said to be the mother of James the Lesser and Joseph and Judas, whom we read are called the brothers of the Lord in another place in the Gospel. But Scripture demonstrates that brothers are called consobrinos. Let us also say differently: The Savior speaks to the crowds, teaching the nations from within. His mother and brothers, that is, the synagogue and the Jewish people, stand outside and desire to enter, but they become unworthy of his word. And when they ask, inquire, and send a message, they receive the answer that they are free to enter and believe if they wish, but they cannot enter unless they ask someone else.



<h2 id='tocuniq250'>87 (Chap. XIII.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea. And great crowds gathered around him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. The people couldn't enter Jesus' house or be where the apostles were hearing the mysteries. Therefore, the compassionate and merciful Lord goes out of his house and sits by the sea of this world, so that great crowds gather around him and hear on the beach what they do not deserve to hear inside. He got into a boat and sat down, and the whole crowd stood on the beach. Jesus is in the midst of the waves, tossed to and fro by the sea, and in his majesty he approaches his boat to draw near to the land. But the people, not enduring the danger, nor surrounded by temptations that they could not bear, stand firmly on the shore in order to hear what is said.

<h2 id='tocuniq251'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying: The crowd is not of one mind, but of various desires in each person. Therefore, he speaks to them in many parables, so that they may receive different teachings according to their various desires. And it should be noted that he did not speak all things to them in parables, but many. For if he had said everything in parables, the people would have left without benefit. He mixes the clear with the obscure, so that through what they understand, they may be provoked to understand those things which they do not understand.



<h2 id='tocuniq252'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Version 4.) Behold, he who sows went out to sow. And while he was sowing, he was inside, at home, speaking to the disciples the mysteries. Therefore, he who sows the word of God went out from his house, in order to sow in the crowds. But this sower who sows is signified to be the Son of God, and to sow the word of the Father among the people. And at the same time, observe that this is the first parable, which is placed with its interpretation. And beware that wherever the Lord explains his words and is asked by the disciples to explain inwardly, we should not want to understand anything else, or anything more, or anything less, than what was explained by him.



<h2 id='tocuniq253'>(Vers. 5 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 5 and following) Some fell by the wayside: and the birds of the air came and devoured them. Others fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil. But when the sun rose, they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. Others fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. Others fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. Valentinus uses this parable to prove his heresy, introducing three natures: spiritual, natural or animal, and earthly; while there are actually four: one by the wayside, another rocky, a third full of thorns, and a fourth of good soil. We postpone the interpretation of it for a while with the disciples, wanting to hear privately what is said.

<h2 id='tocuniq254'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) He who has ears to hear, let him hear. We are prompted to understand these sayings whenever we are moved by these words.

<h2 id='tocuniq255'>(Vers. 10, 11.)</h2>

(Verse 10, 11.) And the disciples came and said to him, 'Why do you speak to them in parables?' He answered them, 'To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.' It is necessary to inquire how the disciples approach him while Jesus is sitting in the boat, unless it is understood that they had recently boarded the boat with him and there, standing, were asking about the interpretation of the parable.



<h2 id='tocuniq256'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) For whoever has, more will be given to him, and he will have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. Those who have the ability to judge are given more, and those who do not have it, lose even what they seem to have: but what the apostles have in Christ, namely faith, is granted to them even if they have fewer virtues. But to the Jews who do not believe in the Son of God, even what good they possess by nature is taken away. For those who do not have wisdom, they cannot understand anything wisely.

<h2 id='tocuniq257'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verse 13, 14.) Therefore, I speak to them in parables, because seeing, they do not see, and hearing, they do not hear, nor do they understand; so that the prophecy of Isaiah may be fulfilled in them, which says: You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive. This applies to those who stand on the shore and are separated from Jesus, and despite the loud noise of the waves, they do not hear what is being said clearly; and the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in them: You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive (Isaiah 6:9). These things are prophesied about the crowds, which stand on the shore, and do not deserve to hear the word of God. Let us therefore approach with the disciples to Jesus, and let us ask him for the explanation of the parable, lest we seem to have ears and eyes in vain with the crowds.

<h2 id='tocuniq258'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15) For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily. They see without seeing, and hear without hearing. For the heart of this people has become fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily. And lest we think that the thickness of the heart and the heaviness of the ears are natural, not voluntary, he adds the fault of their own judgment and says:

And they closed their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I heal them. But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. For amen I say to you, many prophets and just men have desired to see the things that you see, and have not seen them, and to hear the things that you hear and have not heard them.

<h2 id='tocuniq259'>(Vers. 16)</h2>

(Verse 16) But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. Unless we had read above about auditors called to understanding, with the Savior saying: "He who has ears to hear, let him hear," we would now think that the eyes and ears that receive blessedness are understood as bodily (or physical). But to me, those blessed eyes seem to be the ones that can recognize the sacraments of Christ, and those ears that Jesus commanded to be lifted up on high so that they may behold the gleaming wheat fields (John 4:9); and those blessed ears of which Isaiah speaks: "The Lord has opened my ear" (Isaiah 50:5).



<h2 id='tocuniq260'>(Vers. 17, 18.)</h2>

(Verse 17, 18.) Truly I say to you, many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see; and to hear what you hear, and did not hear. Therefore, listen to the parable of the sower. It seems that this passage is contrary to what is said elsewhere: Abraham desired to see my day, and he saw it, and rejoiced (John 8:56). However, it is not said that all the prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, but many. Among many, it can happen that some have seen it, while others have not seen it: although even in this interpretation is dangerous, as we seem to make any discretion among the merits of the saints. Therefore Abraham saw in an enigma, he did not see in form: but you hold him in the present, and you have your Lord, and you question him at will, and you dine with him.

<h2 id='tocuniq261'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) Everyone who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it. By saying this beforehand, he exhorts us to listen more attentively to what is being said.

<h2 id='tocuniq262'>(Vers. 20, 21.)</h2>

He comes, the wicked one, and snatches away what was sown in his heart; this is the one who was sown along the path. And as for the one sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. The wicked one snatches away the good seed. And understand at the same time what was sown in the heart, and the diversity of the soil of the souls of believers.

But in fact, through tribulation and persecution, he is continuously stumbled because of the word. Pay attention to what has been said, he is continuously stumbled. Therefore, there is some distance between him who is compelled to deny Christ by many tribulations and punishments, and him who is immediately stumbled and falls at the first persecution.

<h2 id='tocuniq263'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22) But he who was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, and the anxiety of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. It seems to me that even that which is said literally to Adam, 'Among thorns and thistles you shall eat bread' (Gen. III, 18), signifies mystically that whoever devotes themselves to the pleasures and concerns of this world, shall eat heavenly bread and true food among thorns. And he elegantly added: the fallacy of wealth suffocates the word. For wealth is beguiling, promising one thing and doing another. Its possession is slippery, as it is carried here and there, and those who have it, either with an unsteady step, abandon it, or those who do not have it, seek to obtain it. Hence, the Lord declares it difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven, as wealth suffocates the word of God and softens the rigor of virtues.



<h2 id='tocuniq264'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) But he who was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit: one hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold. As for the bad soil, there were three types: along the path, rocky places, and thorny areas. Likewise, on good soil, there is a threefold diversity: a hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold fruits. And in both the bad and the good soil, the substance does not change, but the will does: both the hearts of unbelievers and believers are the ones that receive the seed. He came, he says, the evil one, and snatches away what is sown in his heart; and second and third, here is, he says, the one who hears the word. In the explanation of the good land also, this is the one who hears the word. Therefore, first we must hear, then understand, and after understanding, produce the fruits of teachings, and produce either a hundredfold, or sixtyfold, or thirtyfold, of which we have spoken more fully in the book against Jovinian, and now we briefly summarize: A hundredfold for virgins, sixtyfold for widows and the continent, thirtyfold for chaste marriage. For honorable are marriage and a pure bed (Heb. XXXI, 3, 4). Some of our people refer the hundredth fruit to the martyrs: if this is so, the holy union of marriage is excluded from the good fruit.

<h2 id='tocuniq265'>(Vers. 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Verses 24 onwards) He proposed another parable to them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the plants sprouted and produced grain, then the weeds also appeared. So the servants of the householder came and said to him: Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? And so, where does it get the weeds? And he said to them: An enemy has done this. The servants said to him: Do you want us to go and gather them up? And he said: No, lest while you gather up the weeds, you root up the wheat with them. Allow both to grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will say to the reapers: Gather up first the weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn. This is the second parable with its interpretation not immediately stated, but delivered after other parables were interjected. For here it is proposed, and afterwards the crowds having been dismissed, they come to his house, and his disciples come up to him, asking: Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field, and the rest. Therefore, we ought not to seek with hasty desire of understanding before his knowledge, what is to be explained by the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq266'>(Vers. 31.)</h2>

(Verse 31.) He proposed another parable to them, saying: The Lord was sitting in a boat, and the crowd stood on the shore: those far away, the disciples closer, could hear. He presents them with another parable, about a rich head of the household who invited guests and provided them with various foods according to the nature of their appetite. Therefore, in the previous parable, He did not say 'another' but 'another one'. For if He had said 'another', we could not expect a third; instead, He said 'another one', so that more would follow.



<h2 id='tocuniq267'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32) The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field. It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches. It should not be a burden to the reader if we present all the parables. For those things that are obscure should be explained more fully, lest they be more entangled by excessive brevity than expounded. The kingdom of heaven is the preaching of the Gospel, and the knowledge of the Scriptures which leads to life; and of which it is said to the Jews: The kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and given to a nation producing its fruits (Matthew 21:43). Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field. The man who sows in his field is understood by many as the Savior, who sows in the hearts of believers. By others, the man himself who sows in his field, that is, in himself and in his own heart. Who is this who sows, if not our understanding and our soul, who, receiving the grain of preaching, and nurturing the seed with the moisture of faith, causes it to sprout in the field of his own heart? The preaching of the Gospel is the least of all disciplines. Indeed, for the first doctrine has no faith in the truth, preaching man as God, God as dead, and the scandal of the cross. Compare such doctrine with the dogmas of philosophers and their books, the splendor of eloquence and the composition of speeches, and you will see how much smaller it is than the other seeds of the Gospel. But when it grows, it demonstrates nothing biting, nothing vivid, nothing vital, but all flabby and withered, and soft, it boils in vegetables, and in herbs, which quickly wither and fall. However, this preaching, which seemed small at first, when it is sown either in the soul of the believer or in the whole world, does not rise in vegetables, but grows into a tree: so that the birds of the sky (which we must understand as either the souls of believers or the strengths owned by God's service) come and dwell in its branches. The branches of the evangelical tree, which have grown from the mustard seed, are diverse in doctrines, on which each of the aforementioned birds rests. Let us also assume the wings of the dove (Ps. LIV), so that, flying towards higher things, we may be able to dwell in the branches of this tree, and make nests for ourselves of teachings, fleeing earthly things and hastening towards heavenly things. Many, reading the smallest seed of mustard, and what is said in the Gospel by the disciples: 'Lord, increase our faith' (Luke XVII, 6), and the Savior answers them: 'Amen I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, and you say to this mountain, move from this place, it will move,' they think the apostles are either seeking little faith or doubting the Lord about little faith; whereas the apostle Paul considers faith compared to a grain of mustard seed to be very great. For what does he say? If I have faith to move mountains, but do not have love, it profits me nothing (I Cor. XIII, 2). Therefore, what the Lord said about faith being able to move mountains, the Apostle teaches can be done with complete faith.

<h2 id='tocuniq268'>(Vers. 33.)</h2>

(Verse 33.) And he spoke another parable to them. The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened. The stomachs of different people are different: some are pleased with bitter, some with sweet, some with more harsh, and some with more gentle foods. Therefore, as we have already said, the Lord presents various parables, so that there may be different remedies according to the varieties of wounds. That woman, who took the leaven and hid it in three measures of flour until it was all leavened, seems to me to be the apostolic preaching or the Church, which is gathered from diverse nations. She takes the leaven, namely the knowledge and understanding of the Scriptures, and hides it in three measures of flour, so that the spirit, soul, and body, brought together as one, do not disagree with one another; but when two or three come together, they obtain from the Father whatever they ask for (Matthew 18). This place is being discussed, and in another way. We read in Plato, and the common teaching of philosophers is that there are three passions in the human soul: the rational, which we can interpret as reason; the spirited, which we can call full of anger or irascible; the appetitive, which we name concupiscible. And that philosopher thinks that our reason dwells in the brain, anger in the gall, and desire in the liver. And so, if we accept the fermentum of the Evangelical holy Scriptures, about which it was said above, the three human passions will be brought together into one, so that we may possess prudence in reasoning: in anger, hatred against vices; in desire, longing for virtues; and all this will be accomplished through the Gospel teaching, which our mother Church has provided for us. I will also mention a third interpretation for some, so that the curious reader may choose from among many what pleases them: They interpret this woman and the Church itself, which has mixed the faith of man with enough flour for the belief of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. And when it has been fermented into one, it leads us not to the threefold God, but to the knowledge of one divinity. Likewise, three sown grains of wheat, while there is not a different nature in each, draw substances toward unity. Indeed, pius quidem sensus, but never can the understanding of parables and the interpretation of obscure enigmas proceed to the authority of doctrines. Now, the sown grain is a measure, according to the custom of the province of Palestine, holding one and a half modius. Other things are said about this parable, but it is not the purpose of this material to speak about everything.

<h2 id='tocuniq269'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34) Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds, and he did not speak to them without a parable. He speaks to the crowds in parables, not to the disciples; and even today the crowds listen to him in parables: the disciples ask the Savior at home.

<h2 id='tocuniq270'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Verse 35) So that what was said through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world. This testimony is taken from the seventy-seventh psalm (Verse 2). It is read in some codices, and a diligent reader may perhaps find the same thing in the place where we have put it, and the Vulgate edition has: So that what was said through the prophet might be fulfilled, written there, through the prophet Isaiah, saying. Because it was not found in Isaiah, I believe it was later removed by prudent men. But it seems to me that it was originally written like this: 'What is written by the prophet Asaph, saying. The seventy-seventh psalm, from which this testimony is taken, is inscribed with the title of Asaph the prophet.' And the first scribe did not understand Asaph, and thought it was a mistake of the scribe, and corrected it to the more obvious name of Isaiah. It must be known, therefore, that in the psalms and hymns and songs of God, not only David, but also the others whose names are written, are to be called prophets: namely, Asaph and Idithun, and Heman the Ezrahite, and Ethan, and the sons of Korah, and the rest whom the Scripture mentions. And that which is said in the person of the Lord: I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world, must be carefully considered and found to describe in a more detailed manner the departure of the Israelites from Egypt, and all the signs that are contained in the story of Exodus. From this we understand that all those things that are written should be understood in a parabolic manner: not only to sound out the obvious letter, but also the hidden mysteries; for this is what the Savior promises, opening his mouth in parables, and revealing secrets from the foundation of the world.

<h2 id='tocuniq271'>(Vers. 36.)</h2>

(Verse 36) Then Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, 'Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.' Jesus sent the crowds away and returned to the house, so that his disciples could come to him and privately ask him about the things that the people were not worthy to hear or understand. 'Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.'

<h2 id='tocuniq272'>(Vers. 37 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 37 onwards) And he answered, saying: The one who sows good seed is the Son of Man. But the field is the world. And the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom. But the weeds are the sons of the evil one. And the enemy who sowed them is the devil. And the harvest is the end of the age. And the reapers are angels. Therefore, just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so it will be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and those who practice lawlessness, and will throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. He clearly explained that the field is the world: the sower, the Son of Man; the good seed, the sons of the kingdom; the tares, the sons of the evil one; the enemy who sowed them, the devil; the harvest, the end of the world; the reapers, angels. All scandals are referred to the tares; the righteous are considered sons of the kingdom. Therefore, as I have said above, we must apply our faith to what has been explained by the Lord. And those things which have been left unspoken and neglected by our understanding must be briefly touched upon. Understand that the men who are asleep are the leaders of the Churches. Do not welcome servants of the household of the father except for the angels, who daily see the Father's face (Matt. XVIII). But the devil is called the enemy of man because he stopped being God. And it is written of him in the ninth psalm: Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail (Psalm IX, 20). Therefore, let the one who is placed over the Church not sleep, lest through his negligence the enemy sows weeds, that is, the dogmas of heretics. But what is said, 'Lest while you gather up the tares, you root up also the wheat together with them,' gives place to repentance, and we are warned not to cut off our brother immediately, because it may happen that he who is corrupt in his understanding today, may tomorrow begin to be sound and to defend the truth. Also that which follows: 'Allow both to grow until the harvest,' seems to be contrary to this precept: 'Take away the evil from among you'; and there is to be no fellowship with those who are called brethren, and are adulterers and fornicators. For if eradication is prohibited, and patience must be maintained until the harvest, how are certain ones to be expelled from among us? Between wheat and weeds, which we call darnel, as long as it is grass and the stem has not yet come to the ear, there is a great similarity, and in distinguishing, either no difference or a very difficult one. Therefore, the Lord warns us not to quickly pronounce judgment when there is any ambiguity, but to reserve the judgment of God: so that when the day of judgment comes, he may expel not suspicion of crime, but a clear guilt from the assembly of the saints. But what he said, that the bundles of weeds are to be burned with fire, and the wheat is to be gathered into barns, it is clear that the heretics and hypocrites are to be burned with the fires of hell; but the saints who are called wheat are to be received into the barns, that is, the heavenly mansions.

<h2 id='tocuniq273'>(Vers. 43.)</h2>

(Verse 43.) Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let anyone with ears listen!

<h2 id='tocuniq274'>(Vers. 44.)</h2>

(Verse 44) The kingdom of heaven is like a hidden treasure in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. Hindered by frequent obscurities of parables, we surpass the literal interpretation, so that we seem to have transitioned from one kind of interpretation to another. This treasure is either all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden, or God's Word, which is seen hidden in the flesh of Christ (Colossians 2), or the holy Scriptures, in which the knowledge of the Savior is preserved: and when someone finds Him in them, they should consider all the benefits of this world as nothing in order to possess Him whom they have found. But what follows: When a man finds it, he hides it, is said not because he does this out of envy, but because out of fear of losing it, he hides it in his heart, which he preferred to his former abilities.

<h2 id='tocuniq275'>(Vers. 45, 46.)</h2>

(Verse 45, 46.) Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls. Upon finding one exceedingly precious pearl, he went and sold all that he had and bought it. In other words, the same thing as was said above. The good pearls that the merchant seeks are the Law and the Prophets. Listen, Marcion; listen, Manichaeus: the good pearls are the Law and the Prophets, and the knowledge of the Old Testament. But there is one most precious pearl, the knowledge of the Savior, and the sacrament of his passion, and the mystery of his resurrection. When a person, like the apostle Paul, discovers it, they despise all the mysteries of the law and the prophets, and the practices of their former life, in which they were blameless, as worthless filth and rubbish, in order to gain Christ (Philippians III). Not that the discovery of a new pearl condemns the old pearls, but by comparison, every other gem is worthless.



<h2 id='tocuniq276'>(Vers. 47 seqq.)</h2>

(Verses 47 and following) Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a fishing net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. When it was full, they pulled it ashore, sat down, and sorted the good fish into containers, but threw away the bad ones. This is how it will be at the end of the world: the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. This fulfills the prophecy of Jeremiah, who said, 'Behold, I will send many fishermen to you' (Jeremiah 16:16). When Peter, Andrew, James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, heard this, they followed Jesus and became fishers of men (Matthew 4:19). They wove together a net of gospel teachings from the old and new testament and cast it into the sea of this world, which even to this day stretches in the midst of waves, capturing whatever falls into it from the salty and bitter depths, both good and bad people, and the best and worst fish. But when the consummation and end of the world comes, as he explains more clearly below, then the fishing net will be drawn to the shore: then the true judgment of separating the fish will be displayed, and as if in a very calm harbor, the good will be placed in the vessels of celestial mansions: but the wicked will be received to be burned and dried up by the flame of hell.

<h2 id='tocuniq277'>(Vers. 51.)</h2>

(Verse 51.) Did you understand all these things? They said to him: Yes. He said to them: To the apostles specifically this speech is; and to them it is said: You understood all these things; He does not want to hear them only as a people, but to understand them as future teachers.

<h2 id='tocuniq278'>(Vers. 52.)</h2>

(Verse 52.) Therefore, every learned scribe in the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a household who brings forth from his treasure new and old things. The apostles were instructed, the scribes and notaries of the Savior, who recorded his words and precepts on the tablets of the fleshly heart, in the sacraments of the heavenly kingdoms, and they possessed the wealth of the household, casting forth from their treasure new and old teachings: so that whatever they preached in the Gospel, they would confirm with the voices of the law and the prophets. Wherefore the Bride also in the Canticles saith: 'I have kept for thee my brother, both New and Old.' (Cant. VII, 13)

<h2 id='tocuniq279'>(Vers. 53, 54.)</h2>

(Verse 53, 54.) And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, that he departed from there. And coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they marveled and said. After the parables that he spoke to the people, and that only the apostles understood, he went to his own country to teach more openly there.

Where does this wisdom and these virtues come from? The Nazarenes marvel at where he gets his wisdom and virtue; but the error is obvious, for they suspect that he is the son of a carpenter.

<h2 id='tocuniq280'>(Vers. 55, 56.)</h2>

(Verse 55, 56.) Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did he get all these things? And they took offense at him. The error of the Jews is our salvation, and the condemnation of the heretics. For they saw Jesus Christ merely as a man, so that the carpenters thought him to be the son: Isn't this the carpenter's son? Are you surprised if they err about his brothers, when they err about his father? This place has been explained more fully in the aforementioned book against Helvedius.

<h2 id='tocuniq281'>(Vers. 57.)</h2>

(Verse 57.) But Jesus said to them: A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house. It is almost natural for citizens to envy each other. For they do not consider a man's present deeds, but they remember his fragile infancy, as if they themselves had not also passed through the same stages of age to mature adulthood.

<h2 id='tocuniq282'>(Vers. 58.)</h2>

(Verse 58) And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief. Not because he was unable to do many miracles for them, who were unbelieving; but rather because in doing many miracles he would condemn the unbelieving citizens. It can also be understood in another way, that Jesus is despised in his own home and country, that is, among the Jewish people. And therefore, he performed only a few signs there, so that they would not become completely without excuse. But he performs greater signs daily among the nations through his apostles, not so much in the healing of bodies, but in the salvation of souls.



<h2 id='tocuniq283'>(Chap. XIV.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 14, Verses 1, 2.) At that time Herod the Tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus, and he said to his servants, 'This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.' Some of the interpreters of the Church inquire about the reasons why Herod suspected this, that he believed John had risen from the dead and that is why miraculous powers were at work in him, as if an explanation of this strange error should be given to us, or it provides an opportunity for belief in transmigration of souls based on these words, even though at the time John was beheaded, the Lord was thirty years old: but transmigration of souls, on the other hand, suggests that after many years in different bodies, souls enter into various bodies.



<h2 id='tocuniq284'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(vv. 3, 4.) For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. Because John had said to him, 'It is not lawful for you to have her.' The ancient history tells us that Philip, the son of Herod the Great (under whom the Lord fled to Egypt), the brother of this Herod under whom Christ suffered, had married Herodias, the daughter of King Aretas; but later, due to some disputes arising against his son-in-law, he took his daughter back and gave her in marriage to Herod, his enemy and the former husband of Herodias. However, who this Philip is, the evangelist Luke explains more fully: In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea; and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee; and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis (Luke 3:1). Therefore, John the Baptist, who came in the spirit and power of Elijah, with the same authority that Elijah had rebuked Ahab and Jezebel (1 Kings 21), accused Herod and Herodias of having entered into an unlawful marriage and of not being allowed to marry his brother's wife while his brother was still alive. John preferred to risk his life before the king rather than be forgetful of God's commandments because of flattery.



<h2 id='tocuniq285'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) And wanting to kill him, he feared the people: for they held him as a prophet. Indeed, he feared the sedition of the people because of John, from whom he knew that many crowds had been baptized in the Jordan; but he was overcome by the love of his wife, because of whose ardor he had even neglected the commandments of God (Genesis 40).

<h2 id='tocuniq286'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) But on Herod's birthday, Herodias' daughter danced in the midst, and it pleased Herod. We have found no other to have observed their own birthday except Herod and Pharaoh, as their impiety was on equal terms, so too was their festivity.

<h2 id='tocuniq287'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) So when he had promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask from him. But she being forewarned by her mother. I do not excuse Herod, that unwillingly and against his will he committed murder because of the oath, who perhaps swore to do this in order to prepare the machinery for a future killing. Otherwise, if he had said that he did it because of an oath, if he had asked for the death of his father or mother, would he not have done it? Therefore, since he was going to reject it in himself, he ought to have despised it and the prophet.



<h2 id='tocuniq288'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) 'Give me,' she says, 'here on a platter, the head of John the Baptist.' Herodias, fearing that Herod might someday come to his senses and become a friend to his brother Philip, and that their unlawful marriage would be dissolved, instructs her daughter to immediately request the head of John at the very banquet itself: a worthy reward for the dance, a worthy prize for the blood.

And the king was saddened. It is the custom of the Scriptures that the historian narrates the opinion of many, just as it was believed by all at that time. Just as Joseph was also called the father of Jesus by Mary herself, so now Herod is said to be saddened, because those reclining at the table thought so (Luke 2). For he was a deceiver of his own mind and a skilled murderer, showing sadness on his face when he had joy in his mind.



<h2 id='tocuniq289'>(Vers. 9, 10.)</h2>

(Verse 9, 10) However, because of the oath and because of those who were reclining at the table with him, he commanded it to be given. And he sent and beheaded John in prison. The wickedness excuses the oath, so that under the pretext of piety he might become impious. But what he added: 'And because of those who were reclining at the table with him,' he wants them all to be partakers of his wickedness, so that they might be carried away in a luxurious and impure banquet of bloody feasts.

<h2 id='tocuniq290'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. We read in Roman history that Flamininus, a Roman general, agreed to have a certain accused of a capital crime be beheaded at a banquet because he was lying next to a prostitute who claimed to have never seen a decapitated man before. He was expelled from the Senate by the censors because he mixed food with blood during the feast, and he preferred the death of a guilty man to the enjoyment of another person, so that lust and murder were mixed together. How wicked Herod and Herodias and the girl who danced demand the prophet's head as the price of blood, so that she may have power over the tongue that condemned unlawful marriages. This happened exactly as written; but we still see to this day, the Jews having lost Christ, who is the head of the prophets, in the person of John the Baptist.

And his disciples came and took his body and buried it. Josephus reports in a certain town of Arabia that John was beheaded. And what follows: His disciples came and took the body, both of him (John) and of the Savior, we can understand.

<h2 id='tocuniq291'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) And they came and told Jesus. When Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place by himself. They announced to the Savior the death of John the Baptist, and when he heard this, he withdrew to a deserted place. Not, as some think, out of fear of death, but sparing his enemies, lest they join one murder with another. Or deferring his own death to the day of his Passover, on which he was to be sacrificed as the Lamb (Exodus 12), and the doorposts of believers to be sprinkled with blood. Or perhaps He withdrew to give us an example of avoiding unnecessary danger, because not all have the same perseverance in enduring torments as they do in offering themselves to be tortured. For this reason, He also gives the command in another place: 'When they persecute you in this city, flee to another' (Mt. X, 23). The evangelist also elegantly does not say, 'He fled to a deserted place,' but 'He withdrew,' in order to avoid the persecutors rather than fearing them. Another interpretation: After the Jews and the king of the Jews cut off the head of the prophets and silenced the voice and speech of prophecy among them, Jesus moves to the desert, a place that the Church had not had before.

And when the crowds heard this, they followed him on foot from the cities. It is possible that, for another reason, upon hearing of the death of John, they withdrew to a deserted place to confirm the faith of the believer. Finally, the crowds followed him on foot, not on pack animals, not in various vehicles, but by their own physical effort, to show their fervor of the mind. If we were to explain the reasons behind each word, we would exceed the brevity of the stated task. However, it must be said in passing that after the Lord came into the desert, many crowds followed him. For before he came into the solitude of the nations, he was worshiped by only one people.

<h2 id='tocuniq292'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) And going out, he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, and he cured their sick. In the Gospel message, the spirit is always joined with the letters, and whatever seems cold at first glance, if you touch it, it becomes warm. The Lord was in a deserted place; the crowds followed him, leaving their cities, that is, their former ways of life and the varieties of teachings. But Jesus going out signifies that the crowds indeed had the will to go, but they did not have the strength to arrive: therefore, the Savior goes out from his place and goes to meet them, just as he had met the repentant son in another parable (Luke 15). And seeing the crowd, he has pity on them and cares for their illnesses, so that full faith immediately obtains the reward.

<h2 id='tocuniq293'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) And when evening had come, his disciples approached him, saying: This place is deserted, and the hour has already passed. Send away the crowds so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food. All things are full of mysteries. He departed from Judea and came to a deserted place. The crowds followed him, leaving their cities behind. Jesus went out to them, had compassion on the crowds, and cured their sick. And he did this not in the morning, not as the day was growing, not at noon, but in the evening, when the sun of justice had set.



<h2 id='tocuniq294'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) But Jesus said to them: They have no need to go. They have no need to seek different foods, and buy for themselves unknown breads, when they have heavenly bread with them.

On that day he commanded you to eat. He challenged the apostles to break the bread, so that, in them testifying that he did not have it, the greatness of the sign may become more known.

<h2 id='tocuniq295'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) They replied to him: We have here only five loaves and two fish. In another Gospel, we read: There is a certain boy here who has five loaves (John 6:9) ; which seems to me to signify Moses: But two fish, either we understand both Testaments, or because the even number is referred to the Law. Therefore, the apostles before the passion of the Savior and the radiance of the shining Gospel had only five loaves and two little fish, which were moving in salty waters and in the waves of the sea.



<h2 id='tocuniq296'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18) He said to them: Bring them to me here. Listen, Marcion, listen, Manichaee, Jesus orders five loaves and two fish to be brought to him, so that he may sanctify and multiply them.

<h2 id='tocuniq297'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) And when he had commanded the multitude to recline upon the hay. The sense is clearly evident according to the letter: let us reveal the sacraments of spiritual interpretation. They are commanded to recline upon the hay, and according to another Evangelist (Luke 9), upon the ground, by fifties or hundreds, so that after they have trampled upon their flesh and all its desires, and subjected all the pleasures of this world to themselves like dry hay, then by the number fifty they may ascend through penitence to the summit of perfection represented by the number one hundred.



Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples. He looked up to heaven, teaching that our eyes should be directed there. He took the five loaves and the two fish in his hands, and he broke them and gave them to the disciples. With the Lord breaking them, the food became a source of abundance. For if they had remained whole and not been torn into fragments, nor divided into a plentiful harvest, they would not have been able to feed such a great multitude of crowds, children, and women. Therefore, the law is broken with the prophets, and it is torn into pieces and its mysteries are brought forth in the midst, so that what was whole and permanent in its original state may be divided into parts and nourish the multitude of nations.

<h2 id='tocuniq298'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20.) However, the disciples gave to the crowds. And all ate, and were satisfied. The crowds received food from the Lord through the apostles.

And they took up the remnants of the twelve baskets full of fragments. Each of the apostles fills his own basket with the remains of the Savior, so that he may either have something to give food to the Gentiles afterwards, or teach from the remnants that the loaves were truly multiplied. And at the same time, consider how in the desert and in such a vast solitude loaves are not found, except only five and two fish, and yet twelve baskets are easily found.



<h2 id='tocuniq299'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) Now the number of those who ate was five thousand men, besides women and children. According to the number of five loaves and the multitude of five thousand men who ate, it had not yet reached the seven-fold number according to another account, of whom there are four thousand who eat, close to the number of the Gospels. But those who ate were five thousand men who had grown into full maturity, and they followed him of whom Zacharias says: Behold the man, his name is the Rising Sun. But women and children, being of the weaker sex and younger age, are considered unworthy of being counted. Therefore, in the Book of Numbers, whenever priests, Levites, armies, or fighting crowds are described, slaves, women, children, and the common people are omitted from the count.

<h2 id='tocuniq300'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) And immediately Jesus compelled his disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of him across the sea, while he dismissed the crowds. He instructed the disciples to cross over and compelled them to get into the boat, which shows by his words that they unwillingly left the Lord, as they did not want to be separated from him even for a moment.

<h2 id='tocuniq301'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) And when the crowd was dismissed, he went up the mountain alone to pray. But when evening came, he was there alone. If Peter, James, and John, who had seen the glory of his transfiguration, had been with him, perhaps they would have gone up the mountain with him. But the crowd cannot follow to the heights, unless he teaches them by the sea on the shore and feeds them in the desert. But as for him going up alone to pray, do not attribute it to the one who satisfied five thousand men with five loaves, excluding women and children; but to the one who, upon hearing of John's death, withdrew into solitude. Not that we should separate the person of the Lord, but that his works are divided between God and man.



<h2 id='tocuniq302'>107 (Vers. 24.)</h2>

107 (Verse 24): However, the little boat was being tossed by the waves in the middle of the sea; for the wind was contrary. Rightly, as if unwillingly, and the apostles, drawing back, had departed from the Lord, lest they should suffer shipwrecks in His absence. Finally, while the Lord was staying on the mountain peak, immediately a contrary wind arises, and it stirs up the sea, and the apostles are in peril, and the impending shipwreck persists as long as Jesus does not come.

<h2 id='tocuniq303'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) However, during the fourth watch of the night, he came to them, walking on the sea. Military stations and night watches are divided into three-hour intervals. Therefore, when he says that the Lord came to them during the fourth watch of the night, it indicates that they were in danger throughout the entire night, and in the last part of the night, and at the end of the world, he will provide them with help.

<h2 id='tocuniq304'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26.) And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying: It is a ghost. If, according to Marcion and Manichaeus, our Lord was not born of a Virgin, but appeared in a vision: how is it that now the apostles fear seeing a vision?

And they cried out due to fear. The confused shout and uncertain voice is a sign of great fear.

<h2 id='tocuniq305'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27) Immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying: Have confidence, I am, do not be afraid. He takes care of what was first in the matter and commands those who fear, saying: Have confidence, do not be afraid. And what follows, I am, does not add who he is, either from a voice they could recognize, who spoke through the darkness of the obscure night, or they repeated that he himself is the one who spoke to Moses: Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: He who is, has sent me to you (Exod. III, 14).



<h2 id='tocuniq306'>(Vers. 28, 29.)</h2>

(Verse 28, 29.) But Peter, responding, said: Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water. And he said: Come. In all places, Peter is found to have the most fervent faith. When the disciples were asked who they said Jesus, the Son of God, confesses. He prevents him from going to his passion, and although he may be mistaken in understanding, he is not mistaken in his feelings: not wanting him to die, whom he had confessed as the Son of God just a little while before. He is the first among the first to ascend the mountain with the Savior, and in his passion he alone follows, washing away with bitter tears the sin of denial that had descended from sudden fear. After the passion, when they were in the lake of Genesareth, fishing, and the Lord was standing on the shore, as others were slowly sailing, he did not allow any delays, but girding himself with his own girdle, he immediately threw himself into the waves. Therefore, with the same ardor of faith as always, now also, while others are silent, he believes that he can do by the will of the master what he could do by nature. Command me to come to you over the waters. You give the order, and immediately the waves will be still, and the body which is naturally heavy will become light.

And when Peter descended from the boat, he walked on the water to come to Jesus. Those who think that the body of the Lord was not true, because he walked on soft waters, let them explain how Peter walked, whom they certainly will not deny to be a real human being.

<h2 id='tocuniq307'>(Vers. 30.)</h2>

(Verse 30) But when he saw the strong wind, he was afraid. And when he began to sink, he cried out, saying: Lord, save me. The faith of his soul burned, but human frailty dragged him into the deep: therefore a little is left to temptation, so that faith may increase, and he may understand that he is not saved by the ease of his request, but by the power of the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq308'>(Vers. 31, 32.)</h2>

(Verse 31, 32.) And immediately Jesus, stretching out His hand, took hold of him and said to him, 'You of little faith, why did you doubt?' And when they got into the boat, the wind stopped. If it is said to the Apostle Peter, of whose faith and ardor of mind we have spoken above, who confidently asked the Savior, saying, 'Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water,' because he was a little afraid, 'You of little faith, why did you doubt?' What must we say, who have even the smallest portion of this little faith?



<h2 id='tocuniq309'>(Vers. 33.)</h2>

(Verse 33.) But those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, "Truly You are the Son of God." At the one sign of calm being restored to the sea, which sometimes happens after great storms by chance, sailors and passengers truly confess the Son of God, and Arius preaches a created being in the Church.

<h2 id='tocuniq310'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) And when he had crossed over, they came to the land of Genesaret. If we knew what Genesaret would resonate in our language, we would understand how Jesus, through the symbol of the apostles and the boat, leads the Church freed from the shipwreck of persecution to the shore, and makes it rest in a very peaceful harbor.

<h2 id='tocuniq311'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Ver. 35.) And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent throughout all that region. They recognized him by his reputation, not by his appearance, or certainly by the greatness of the signs he was performing among the people; even his face was well-known to many. And see how great is the faith of the people of the land of Genesareth, that they are not content with the salvation of those present, but send to other cities in the vicinity, so that all may come running to the physician.

<h2 id='tocuniq312'>(Vers. 36.)</h2>

(Verse 36.) And all who were sick approached him, and they begged him to touch the fringe of his garment. And whoever touched it, they were healed. But those who were sick should not touch the body of Jesus or the entire garment, but only the edge of the fringe, and whoever touched it, they would be healed. Understand the fringe of his garment, or at least understand this commandment: whoever breaks it will be considered the least in the kingdom of heaven (Above, III). And through the assumption of the body, by which we come to the Word of God, and afterwards enjoy His majesty.

<h2 id='tocuniq313'>(Chap. XV.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 15, Verse 1) Then came to him from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying: Why do your disciples transgress the traditions of the elders? The stupidity of the Pharisees and scribes is evident as they accuse the Son of God of not keeping the traditions and precepts of men.

<h2 id='tocuniq314'>(Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Vers. 1, 2.) For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread. Hands, that is, works, are to be washed, not of the body for sure, but of the soul, so that the word of God may be made in them.

<h2 id='tocuniq315'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(V. 3.) But he, answering, said to them: Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? He refutes false slander with a true response. For, he says, you disregard the precepts of the Lord for the sake of human tradition, why do you think that my disciples should be accused, because they disregard the commands of the elders, in order to maintain the knowledge of God?

<h2 id='tocuniq316'>(Vers. 4 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 4 onwards) For God said, 'Honor your father and mother, and whoever curses his father or mother, let him be put to death.' But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, Whatever help you would have received from me is given to God,' and does not honor his father or mother, you have made void the commandment of God because of your tradition. Hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, 'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me' (Exodus 20, Leviticus 20). But they worship me without cause, teaching doctrines and commandments of men. And, calling the multitude to him, he said to them: Hear and understand. Honor in the Scriptures is not only felt in greetings and deference to offices, but also in acts of charity and the offering of gifts (Exodus 20:12, 21 and Leviticus 20). The Apostle says, 'Honor widows who are truly widows' (1 Timothy 5:3); here honor is understood as a gift. And in another place: Elders are to be honored with double honor, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine of God (ibid., 17). And by this command we are commanded not to close the mouth of the ox that is treading out the corn (Deut. XXV) . And may the worker be worthy of his wage (Luke X) . The Lord had commanded, considering the weaknesses, ages, and hardships of parents, that children should honor their parents even in providing for their basic needs. The scribes and Pharisees, desiring to undermine this most provident Law of God and to introduce impiety under the name of piety, taught the worst sons that if anyone wished to vow to God (who is the true Father) those things which are to be offered to parents, the offering of the Lord should take precedence over the gifts of the parents; or certainly, the parents themselves, fearing that they would incur the crime of sacrilege by rejecting what had been consecrated to God, were consumed by poverty. And so it happened that the offering of children, under the pretext of the temple of God, went to the profits of the priests. This wicked tradition of the Pharisees came from another occasion. Many, having debts to pay and unwilling to repay what was owed, entrusted it to the priests, so that the money collected would be used for the services of the temple and their own needs. And this can also be understood briefly. He says, 'You compel the children to say to their parents: whatever gift I was going to offer to God, I consume it as food for you, Father, and it benefits you, Mother, so that they, fearing to receive what seems to be dedicated to God, would rather live in poverty than eat from the consecrated offerings.'



<h2 id='tocuniq317'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) It is not what enters into the mouth that defiles a person; but what proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles a person. The word, properly speaking, is communicated through Scripture and is not worn out in everyday conversation. The Jewish people, boasting to be a part of God, call common foods, which all humans use, 'unclean.' For example, pork, oysters, rabbits, and other animals that do not have split hooves, do not chew the cud, and are not scale-covered in fish. And it is also written in the Acts of the Apostles: 'What God has cleansed, you must not call common' (Acts 10:15). Therefore, that which is commonly available to other people, and is as if it is not from God's side, is called impure. It is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person. Let a wise reader oppose and say: If what enters the mouth does not defile a person, then why do we not eat idol-offerings? And the Apostle writes: You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons (1 Corinthians 10:20). Therefore, it must be understood that while food itself, being a creature of God, is clean, it becomes unclean through the invocation of idols and demons.

<h2 id='tocuniq318'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) Then his disciples approached him and said to him, 'Do you know that the Pharisees were scandalized when they heard this word? From one speech, all the superstitious observance of the Jews had been eliminated; those who considered their religion to be based on the eating and abstaining from certain foods.' And because the term 'scandal' is frequently used in Ecclesiastical Scriptures, let us briefly explain what it means. Σκῶλον and scandalum can be translated as 'stumbling block,' 'fall,' or 'the stumbling and falling of the foot.' Therefore, when we read this: 'Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.'

<h2 id='tocuniq319'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up. Even those things which seem plain in the Scriptures, are full of questions. Every plant, he says, which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up. Therefore, that plantation also shall be rooted up, of which the Apostle says, I have planted, Apollos watered (1 Cor. III, 6). But the question is resolved by what follows: But God gave the increase (Ibid., 9). He himself also says: You are God's field, God's building (1 Corinthians 3:9). And in another place: We are God's co-workers. Now if we are co-workers, then God is the one who plants and waters, while Paul and Apollos are only servants who work with God (1 Corinthians 3:6-7). Some people misuse this passage, introducing various interpretations, and say: If the planting that the Father did not plant will be uprooted, then the planting that he did plant cannot be uprooted. But listen to what Jeremiah says: 'I planted a true vineyard, how have you turned into the bitterness of a foreign vine?' (Jeremiah II, 21). Indeed, God planted it, and no one can uproot His plantation. But because this planting is in the will of one's own free choice, no one else can uproot it unless it itself gives consent.

<h2 id='tocuniq320'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) Let them alone, they are blind, leaders of the blind. But if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit. This is what the Apostle commanded: Avoid a heretical man after the first and second admonition, knowing that he is perverted and condemned by himself (Titus 3, 10). In this sense, the Savior also commanded that the worst teachers should be left to their own discretion, knowing that they are difficult to be drawn to the truth, and that they are blind and lead the blind people into error.



<h2 id='tocuniq321'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Ver. 15, 16.) But Peter, responding, said to him: Explain this parable to us. And he said: Are you still without understanding? What had been clearly stated and was clear to the hearing, the apostle Peter thinks was said in a parable and seeks a mystical understanding in a matter that is manifest. And he is reprimanded by the Lord for thinking that what was clearly spoken was said in a parable. From this, we observe that the listener is faulty, who wants to understand either clearly stated but obscure things, or things clearly stated in an obscure manner.



<h2 id='tocuniq322'>(Vers. 17, 18.)</h2>

(Ver. 17, 18.) Do you not understand that everything that enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is expelled into the sewer? But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and those defile a person. All the passages of the Gospels among heretics and evil-doers are full of scandals. And some people falsely accuse this statement, saying that the Lord, ignorant of physical processes, thinks that all foods go into the stomach and are digested there: whereas immediately after being ingested, the nourishment is distributed through the limbs and veins, as well as the marrow and nerves. And so, many people who suffer from a constant stomach disorder, immediately vomit what they have eaten after meals and snacks, and yet they are still corpulent: because at the first touch, more liquid food and drink are poured through the limbs. But while these people want to criticize the ignorance of others, they show their own. For although a thin and liquid food, when it has been cooked and digested in the veins and limbs, passes through the hidden passages of the body, which the Greeks call πόροι, and goes to the lower regions and into the intestines.



<h2 id='tocuniq323'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Verse 19, 20.) For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies: these are the things that defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a person. 'For out of the heart,' he says, 'come evil thoughts.' Therefore, according to Christ and not according to Plato, the soul's principal place is in the heart, not in the brain. Those who believe that evil thoughts are instilled by the devil and not born out of one's own will can be argued against based on this statement. The devil can be a helper and instigator of evil thoughts, but he cannot be the author. However, if he is always lying in wait, he may ignite the slightest spark of our thoughts with his fuel, but we should not assume that he can explore the secrets of our hearts. Rather, we should judge what we have within us by our physical appearance and actions. For example, if he sees us frequently admiring a beautiful woman, he understands that our hearts have been wounded by Cupid's arrow.



<h2 id='tocuniq324'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verse 21, 22) And Jesus went out from there and withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon. And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those territories and cried out to him, saying. He leaves behind the scribes and the Pharisees who accuse him, and he goes into the parts of Tyre and Sidon, in order to care for the Tyrians and Sidonians. But the Canaanite woman goes out from her former territories, in order to fervently plead for her daughter's healing. Note that in the fifteenth place, the daughter of the Canaanite woman is healed.



Have mercy on me, Lord, son of David. For He knew how to call upon the son of David, because she had already gone out of her borders, and had abandoned the error of the Tyrians and Sidonians by changing their place and faith.

My daughter is being tormented by an evil spirit. I think the Canaanite people believed that those who were tormented by evil spirits were ignorant of the Creator and worshipped stones.

<h2 id='tocuniq325'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23.) He did not answer him a word. Not out of Pharisaic pride, nor out of the scorn of the Scribes; but so that he would not seem to be contrary to his own command, by which he had instructed: Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into the cities of the Samaritans (Luke 10:5). For he did not wish to give occasion to the accusers and reserved the perfect salvation of the Gentiles for the time of his passion and resurrection.

And his disciples approached him, saying: Send her away because she cries out after us. At that time, the disciples still ignorant of the mysteries of the Lord, either moved by mercy, or desiring to be free from her persistence, were asking for the Canaanite woman, whom another Evangelist calls the Syrophoenician woman (Mark 7), or wanting to avoid her importunity; because she shouted more frequently not for the purpose of calling a compassionate person, but to call for a harsh physician.

<h2 id='tocuniq326'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24.) But he answered and said: I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Not that he was not sent also to the Gentiles, but that he was first sent to Israel, so that when they did not receive the Gospel, the migration to the Gentiles might be justified. And he significantly said, to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, so that from this passage we may also understand one wayward sheep from another parable.

<h2 id='tocuniq327'>(Vers. 25, 26.)</h2>

(Verse 25, 26.) But she came and worshiped him, saying: Lord, help me. He answered and said: It is not good to take the bread of the children and throw it to the dogs. The faith, patience, and humility of the Canaanite woman are preached in this remarkable passage. Faith, by which she believed that her daughter could be healed. Patience, by which she persevered in prayer even when rejected. Humility, by which she compared herself not to dogs, but to puppies. However, the ethnic dogs are called such because of their idolatry, being given to the consumption of blood and carried away by the corpses of the dead into madness. Note that this Canaanite woman persistently called first David her son, then the Lord, and finally worshipped Him as God.

<h2 id='tocuniq328'>(Vers. 27, 28.)</h2>

(Verse 27, 28.) But she said: Even so, Lord. For even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table. Then Jesus, answering, said to her: O woman, great is your faith: be it done to you as you wish. And her daughter was healed from that hour. I know, she said, that I am not deserving of the bread of the children, nor am I able to receive the whole food; nor to sit at the table with the father; but I am content with the crumbs of the puppies; so through the humility of the crumbs, I may obtain the greatness of the whole bread. Oh, the wonderful change of things! Israel, once a son, now dogs. Because of the diversity of faith, the order of names is changed. Concerning them, it is later said: Many dogs have surrounded me (Ps. 21:17). And: See the dogs, see the evil workers, see the mutilation (Phil. 3). We have heard with the Syrophoenician woman and the woman who had a flow of blood: Your faith is great, let it be done to you as you wish. And: Daughter, your faith has made you well.



<h2 id='tocuniq329'>(Vers. 29, 30.)</h2>

(Verse 29, 30.) And when Jesus had passed on from there, he came near the Sea of Galilee; and going up on the mountain, he sat there. And great crowds came to him, bringing with them the mute, the blind, the lame, the weak, and many others. And they threw them down at his feet. In the place where the Latin interpreter translated, 'weak' is written in Greek as 'κυλλοὺς', which is not a general term for weakness, but the name for a specific infirmity: just as someone is called lame when they limp with one foot, so 'κυλλὸς' is used to describe someone who has a weak hand. We do not have the property of this word. Therefore, the evangelist explained the healings of the others in the following passages, but he was silent about these. For what follows?

<h2 id='tocuniq330'>(Vers. 31.)</h2>

(Verse 31.) And he healed them, so that the crowds marveled, seeing the mute speaking, the lame walking, the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel. Concerning the mute, he remained silent, for he had nothing to say in opposition. This is accomplished with one word. Now let us consider the fact that the healed daughter of the Canaanite woman returned to Judea, and to the Sea of Galilee, and went up to the mountain; and like a bird calling its young to fly, she beckoned them, and there she sat, and the crowds gathered around her, bringing with them various afflictions; and after he healed them, he gave them food; and when this work was completed, he got into a boat, and came to the region of Magadan. And ascending the mountain, he sat there: and the crowds approached him. Notice that the mute, the lame, and the blind are led to the mountain, so that they may be healed by the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq331'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32) But Jesus, calling together his disciples, said: I have compassion for the crowd, because they have persevered with me for three days already and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way. He wants to feed those whom he has healed; first, he removes their weakness so that later he can offer food to the healthy. He also calls his disciples and speaks to them about what he is going to do, either to provide an example to the teachers, that they should share their plans with their subordinates and disciples, or so that they understand the magnitude of the miracle from their conversation, responding that they do not have loaves of bread in the desert. He said, 'I have compassion for the crowd, because they have been staying with me now for three days and have nothing to eat. If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from a great distance.' Therefore, he who hurries to reach the desired dwelling without heavenly bread is in danger. Thus the angel speaks to Elijah: Arise and eat, for you will walk a long way.

<h2 id='tocuniq332'>(Vers. 33 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 33 and following) And His disciples said to Him, “Where would we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd?” And Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” And they said, “Seven, and a few small fish.” And He directed the people to sit down on the ground. Taking the seven loaves and the fish, He gave thanks and broke them, and He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. And they all ate and were satisfied. And what was left over from the fragments, they took up seven baskets full. Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. And after dismissing the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan (Μαγδαλά). We have already discussed this sign above, and it is pointless to repeat the same things: let us only dwell on those things that differ. Above we read: When it was evening, the disciples came to him, saying: This is a deserted place (above, XIV, 15), and the rest. Having summoned the disciples, the Lord himself speaks: I have compassion on the crowd, because they have persevered with me for three days already. There, there were five loaves and two fish; here, there are seven loaves and a few fish. There, they recline on the hay; here, on the ground. There, those who eat are five thousand, according to the number of loaves they eat; here, four thousand. There, twelve baskets are filled with the leftover fragments; here, seven baskets. Therefore, in the previous sign, those who were close and near to the five senses, the Lord himself does not remember them, but the disciples remember them in the evening of the neighboring night, and with the sun declining. But the Lord himself remembers and says that he has compassion, and he explains the reason for his compassion: because they have been persevering with me for three days now, and he does not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way. Those who are fed with the sacred seven loaves, that is, with the perfect and complete number, are not five thousand, but four thousand, a number that is always praised, and the square stone does not waver and is not unstable; and for this reason, the Gospels are also consecrated in that number.



<h2 id='tocuniq333'>(Chap. XVI.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter XVI—Verse 1 and following) And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to him and tested him, asking him to show them a sign from heaven. But he answered and said to them: When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red'; and in the morning, 'It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.' You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times. An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. This is not found in most codices: it is clear that from the arrangement and stability of the elements, both fair and rainy days can be predicted. However, the scribes and Pharisees, who seemed to be experts in the law, could not understand the advent of the Savior from the prophecy of the prophets.

<h2 id='tocuniq334'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) And leaving them, he went away, and when his disciples had come across the sea, they forgot to take bread. He said to them: Leaving behind the scribes and Pharisees, to whom he had said, An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and a sign will not be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet, he went over the sea correctly, and he followed the peoples of the Gentiles. But what the sign of Jonah means, has already been said above.

<h2 id='tocuniq335'>(Vers. 6, 7.)</h2>

(Verses 6, 7.) Watch out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. But they were discussing among themselves, saying, 'We did not bring any bread.' He who avoids the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees does not observe the precepts of the Law and the teachings of men, neglecting the traditions in order to fulfill God's commandment.

<h2 id='tocuniq336'>(Vers. 8 seqq.)</h2>

(Verses 8 and following.) But Jesus, being aware of this, said to them: Why are you discussing among yourselves, O you of little faith, that you have no bread? Do you still not understand or remember the five loaves for the five thousand men, and how many baskets you took up? Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand men, and how many baskets you took up? How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. By occasion of the precept, which the Savior had commanded, saying: Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, He teaches them what the five loaves and the seven signify: the five thousand men, and the four thousand, who were fed in the wilderness. Although the greatness of the miracles is clear, yet something else is shown in spiritual understanding. For if the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees signifies not bodily bread, but perverse traditions and heretical doctrines, why do the foods, with which the people of God are nourished, not signify the true and complete teaching? Let someone ask and say: How is it that they did not have bread, who, when seven baskets were filled immediately, they got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan; and there the sailors hear that they should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees? But the Scripture testifies that they forgot to take bread with them. This is the leaven that the Apostle speaks of; A little leaven leavens the whole lump (I Cor. V, 6). Marcion and Valentinus and all heretics had this kind of leaven, which is to be avoided in every way. This fermentation has the power that if it is mixed with flour, which seemed small, it grows into something greater, and attracts the entire mixture to its flavor ((or conversion)) : and so also heretical doctrine, if it has thrown even a small spark into your heart, in a short time it grows into a great flame, and draws the entire possession of the person to itself. Finally, it follows: Then they understood that he did not say to beware of leavened bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

Book Three

<h2 id='tocuniq338'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) And Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi. This Philip is the brother of Herod, about whom we spoke before, the tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis regions, who built Caesarea, which is now called Paneas, in honor of Tiberius Caesar, and in honor of Caesar, and also named it after himself, Caesarea Philippi, and it is in the province of Phoenicia. He imitated his father Herod, who named Caesarea in honor of August Caesar, which was formerly called the Tower of Straton. And he built, in the name of his daughter Julia, across the Jordan. This place (which is also called Ille) is Caesarea Philippi, where the Jordan River originates at the foot of Mount Lebanon, and it has two springs, one called Jor and the other Dan, which, when mixed together, become the Jordan River.

And he asked his disciples, saying: Whom do men say that the Son of man is? He did not say, whom do men say that I am, but the Son of man: lest he should seem to seek glory from men. And note that wherever it is written in the Old Testament, son of man, in Hebrew it is written as son of Adam. Just as it is in that (also), which we read in the psalm: Sons of men, how long will you be heavy of heart? (Psal. IV, 3), which in Hebrew is said as sons of Adam. But beautifully he asks: Whom do people say the Son of Man is? For those who speak of the Son of Man are humans; but those who understand his divinity are not humans, but gods are called.

<h2 id='tocuniq339'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) But they said: Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and others Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. Jesus says to them, I wonder that some interpreters seek the reasons for each individual's errors, and weave a lengthy argument about why some thought that our Lord Jesus Christ was John, others Elijah, others Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. If they could be mistaken about Elijah and Jeremiah, how did Herod mistake John, saying: I myself beheaded John, he has risen from the dead, and powers are at work in him (Mark 6:16).



<h2 id='tocuniq340'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Verse 15, 16.) But who do you say that I am? Simon Peter answered and said: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. Wise reader, take note that from the following text and the discourse, the apostles are not called men, but gods. For when he had said: Who do men say that the Son of man is, he added: But who do you say that I am? To them, who are men, forming their opinions based on human things; but to you, who are gods, what do you think of me being? Peter, speaking on behalf of all the apostles, declares: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. He calls Him the living God, in distinction from those gods who are thought to be gods but are dead: Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, Minerva (or Ceres), Bacchus, Hercules, and other monstrous idols.

<h2 id='tocuniq341'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) But Jesus answered and said to him: Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. The Apostles answer on behalf of Jesus. Peter had said: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God; a true confession has received a reward: Blessed are you, Simon Barjona. Why? because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but the Father revealed it. What flesh and blood could not reveal, has been revealed by the grace of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, from confession, it obtains the name which has revelation from the Holy Spirit, whose son is also to be called. For indeed, Barjona in our language means son of a dove. Others simply understand that Simon, that is, Peter, is the son of John, according to the question in another place: Simon, son of John, do you love me? (John 21:15) He answered: Lord, you know. And by the fault of the writers, it is corrupted so that instead of Bar Joanna, that is, son of John, it is written Barjona, with one syllable removed. Joanna, however, means 'by the grace of the Lord.' Both names can be understood mystically, as both the dove represents the Holy Spirit and grace represents the spiritual gift of God. Also, what is said, 'For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you,' is compared to the apostolic narrative where it says, 'I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood' (Galatians 1:16), signifying the Jews as flesh and blood, so that here also it may be demonstrated in a different sense that Christ, the Son of God, was revealed to him not through the teaching of the Pharisees, but through the grace of God.



<h2 id='tocuniq342'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) And I also say to you. What is it that he says: And I also say to you? Because you have said to me: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God; and I say to you, not with empty words, and having no need, but I say to you: what I have said, I have done.

Because you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church. Just as he gave the title of 'light' to the apostles, so too did he bestow upon Simon, who believed in Christ the rock, the name of Peter. But according to the metaphor of the rock, it is rightly said to him: I will build my church upon you.

And the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it. I consider the gates of Hell to be vices and sins: or certainly the doctrines of heretics, through which deceived men are led to Tartarus. Therefore, let no one suppose that it is said concerning death, that the apostles were not subject to the condition of death, whose martyrdoms he sees flashing.

<h2 id='tocuniq343'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) And I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. And whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. The bishops and priests who do not understand this passage, arrogantly assume to themselves something of the Pharisees, either to condemn the innocent or to release the guilty; whereas with God, it is not the judgment of priests, but the life of the accused that is sought. In Leviticus (Chapter 14), we read about leprosy, where they are commanded to show themselves to the priests, and if they have leprosy, then they become unclean by the priest: not that priests make lepers and unclean; but so that they have knowledge of who is leprous and who is not, and they can discern who is clean and who is unclean. So just as the priest there makes the leper clean or unclean, so here the bishop and priest bind or loose, not those who are innocent or guilty; but according to their office, when they hear the varieties of sins, they know who should be bound and who should be loosed.



<h2 id='tocuniq344'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) Then he commanded his disciples not to tell anyone that he was Jesus Christ. Before sending the disciples to preach, he had ordered them to announce his coming: here he instructed them not to say that he was Jesus Christ. It seems to me that preaching Christ is one thing, and preaching Jesus Christ is another. Christ is a common name of dignity: Jesus is the proper name of the Savior. However, it may be that before his passion and resurrection, he did not want to be preached; but after the completion of the sacrament of his blood, he would more fittingly say to the apostles: Go, teach all nations (Matthew last chapter, verse 19), etc. So that no one thinks that our intelligence alone, and not the Gospel teachings that follow, explain the reasons for the prohibition of preaching at that time.

<h2 id='tocuniq345'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) Then Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. And the meaning is: Proclaim me then, when I have suffered these things, because it is not profitable to publicly proclaim Christ and make known his majesty to the people, who after a little while will see him whipped and crucified, and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes. And now Jesus suffers many things from those who crucify the Son of God again (Heb. VI): and when the elders are thought to be in the Church, and the high priests, following the simple letter, kill the Son of God, who is wholly felt in spirit.

<h2 id='tocuniq346'>(Vers. 22, 23.)</h2>

(Verse 22, 23.) And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying: Lord, be it far from you, this shall not happen to you. But he turned and said to Peter: Get behind me, Satan, you are a hindrance to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man. We have often said that Peter had great zeal and love for the Lord Savior. Therefore, after his confession, when he said: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God, and heard the Savior's response: Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father who is in heaven, he suddenly hears from the Lord that he must go to Jerusalem, suffer many things from the elders and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day rise again. He does not want his confession to be destroyed; he does not think it is possible for the Son of God to be killed. And he takes him into his affection, or leads him separately, so that he does not appear to accuse the teacher in front of the other disciples, and he begins to rebuke him out of love and desire, saying: Lord, be it far from you; or as it is better in Greek, ἵλεώς σοι, Κύριε, οὐ μὴ ἔσται σοι τοῦτο, which means, be propitious to yourself, Lord, this shall not happen to you; it cannot happen, and my ears do not accept that the Son of God should be killed. To whom the Lord, turning, said: Go behind me, Satan, you are a stumbling block to me. Satan is interpreted as adversary or opposer. Because you speak contrary to my will, you must be called adversary. Many believe that it was not Peter who was rebuked, but the opposing spirit who suggested these words to the Apostle. But to me, this Apostolic error, coming from a feeling of piety, will never seem like an incentive of the devil: Go behind me, Satan. The devil says: Go away. Peter hears: Go away from me, that is, follow my opinion: for you do not understand the things that are of God, but those that are of men. It is my will, and the Father's (whose will I have come to do (John VI)) that I should die for the salvation of men, while you, considering only your own will, do not want a grain of wheat to fall to the ground, so that it may bring forth many fruits (John XII). Let the wise reader inquire how, after such great blessedness: Blessed are you, Simon Barjona; and: You are Peter; and on this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it; and: I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and: Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven; now let him hear: Go away from me, Satan, you are a stumbling block to me? But what kind of sudden conversion is this, that after so great rewards, he is called Satan? But if he considers who is asking this, he will understand that Peter received that blessing and beatitude, and power, and edification upon the Church, promised for the future, not given in the present. I will build, he says, my Church upon you and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And: I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. All these things are for the future, which if he had immediately given them to him, the error of wrong opinion would have never found a place in him.



<h2 id='tocuniq347'>(Vers. 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 24 seqq.) Then Jesus said to his disciples: If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own soul? Whoever puts off the old man with his works (Colossians 3), denies himself, saying: Now I live, but Christ lives in me (Galatians 2:20): and he takes up his cross and is crucified to the world. But the one to whom the world was crucified follows the crucified Lord.

But what exchange will a man give for his soul? For Israel, Egypt and Ethiopia are given in exchange, and Syene (Isaiah XLIII, 3, 4): for the human soul, that alone is the retribution, which the Psalmist sings: What shall I render to the Lord for all that He has rendered to me? I will take the cup of salvation, and will invoke the name of the Lord (Psalm CXV, 3).

<h2 id='tocuniq348'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27) For the Son of Man is coming in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each according to his deeds. Peter, scandalized by the preaching of the Lord's death, was rebuked by the Lord's sentence. The disciples were provoked to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow their teacher with a willing heart. The great terror of the listeners, and the ability of the chief apostle to instill fear in others, led to sadness followed by joy, and he said: The Son of Man is coming in the glory of His Father with His angels. Fear death, listen to the glory of the triumphant. Fear the cross, listen to the ministries of the angels. And then, it is said, he will repay each according to his works (Rom. X, 12). There is no distinction between Jew and Gentile, man and woman, poor and rich, where not persons, but works are considered.

<h2 id='tocuniq349'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28.) Truly I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom. He wanted to heal the terror of the apostles with the hope of promised things, saying: The Son of Man is coming in the glory of his Father with his angels. Moreover, with the authority of a judge added: and he will repay each one according to his works. The silent thought of the apostles could bear such a scandal: you now say that killing and death are coming, but what you promise to be present in the glory of the Father with the ministry of angels and the power of a judge, this will be in the future, and will be delayed for a long time. Therefore, foreseeing what the knowers of secret things could object, he counterbalances present fear with present reward. For he says: There are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom; so that the manner in which he will come afterwards may be shown to you at the present time, because of your unbelief.

<h2 id='tocuniq350'>(Chap. XVII.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 17 - Verse 1) And after six days, Jesus took Peter and James, and John his brother. Why Peter, James, and John are separated from the others in some places in the Gospels, or what privilege they have over the other apostles, we have frequently discussed. Now it is asked how he assumed them after six days, and led them to a high mountain apart: since the evangelist Luke mentions the number eight (Luke 9). But the answer is easy, because here the intermediate days are placed, the first and the last are added. For it is not said: After eight days Jesus took Peter, and James, and John; but on the eighth day.

He leads them to a high mountain apart. To lead the disciples to the mountains is part of the kingdom. They are led apart, because many are called, but few are chosen (Matthew 20:16 and 22:14).

<h2 id='tocuniq351'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(V2.) And he was transfigured before them. Just as he will be at the time of judgment, so he appeared to the apostles. But when it says, 'He was transfigured before them,' no one can think that he lost or abandoned his original form and appearance, or that he took on a spiritual or aerial body. Rather, the evangelist demonstrates how he was transformed, saying.

And his face shone like the sun, and his garments became white as snow. Where the splendor of his face is shown and the whiteness of the garments is described, substance is not taken away but glory is transformed. His face shone like the sun. Certainly the Lord was transformed into that glory in which he would come afterwards in his kingdom. Transformation added splendor, it did not take away his face. Even if his body was spiritual, were the garments also changed, which were so white that another evangelist said: Such as no fuller on earth can make. But what the lightning can do over the earth is corporeal, and subject to touch, and not spiritual and airy, which deceives the eyes, and can only be seen in a mere illusion.

<h2 id='tocuniq352'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him. When the scribes and Pharisees tested him, seeking signs from heaven, he did not want to give them, but refuted their wicked request with a prudent response. But in order to increase the faith of the apostles, he gives a sign from heaven, with Elijah descending from where he had ascended, and with Moses rising from the dead. This is also commanded to Ahaz through Isaiah, to ask for a sign from above or from below (Isaiah 7 and 2 Kings 2). For what was said: Moses and Elias appeared to them, speaking with him; and in another Gospel it is reported that he announced what he would suffer in Jerusalem (Luke IX): The law and the prophets are shown, who announced with frequent voices both the passion of the Lord and his resurrection.

<h2 id='tocuniq353'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) But Peter, replying, said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here. He who had ascended to the mountains does not want to descend to earthly things; but always to persevere in the lofty things.

If you wish, let us make here three tabernacles: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. You are mistaken, Peter, as another evangelist testifies. You do not know what you are saying. Do not seek three tabernacles, for there is one tabernacle of the Gospel, in which the Law and the Prophets are recapitulated. But if you seek three tabernacles, do not compare servants with the Lord, but make three tabernacles: indeed, one for the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; so that, since they are one divinity, there may be one tabernacle in your heart as well.



<h2 id='tocuniq354'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5) While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold, a voice from the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him. Because he had asked foolishly, he does not deserve an answer from the Lord, but the Father speaks for the Son, so that the word of the Lord may be fulfilled: I do not testify of myself, but the Father who sent me, he testifies of me (John 5:37 and 8:18). But the cloud is seen as both bright and shadowed: like those who sought the tabernacle from the fleshly leaves or tents, they would be covered by the shadow of the bright cloud. Moreover, the voice of the Father speaking from heaven is heard, which also testifies to the Son; and through Peter, with error removed, teaches the truth: even through Peter to the other apostles. This is, he says, my beloved Son: to him the tabernacle must be affixed, to him obedience must be given. Here is the son, those slaves are: Moses and Elias themselves must prepare a tabernacle for the Lord with you in the innermost depths of their heart.

<h2 id='tocuniq355'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were exceedingly afraid. They were terrified for three reasons: either because they realized they had made a mistake, or because a shining cloud had covered them, or because they had heard the voice of God the Father speaking. For human frailty cannot bear the sight of greater glory and, trembling in mind and body, falls to the ground. The more one seeks greater things, the more one will collapse into lower things if one does not know one's own measure.



<h2 id='tocuniq356'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) And Jesus came and touched them. Because they were lying down and unable to rise, he kindly approached and touched them, so that fear would flee with the touch and their weakened limbs would be strengthened.

And he said to them: Rise up, and do not be afraid. He who healed with his hand, heals with his command. Do not be afraid. First, fear is expelled, so that later, knowledge may be given.

<h2 id='tocuniq357'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) But lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus alone. Reasonably, after they had risen, they saw no one except Jesus alone: lest if Moses and Elijah had continued with the Lord, the uncertain voice of the Father would be seen, to whom he would give the testimony. Therefore, they see Jesus standing, the cloud having been taken away, and Moses and Elijah had vanished: because after the shadow of the Law and the Prophets had departed, which had covered the apostles with its veil, both lights are found in the Gospel.



<h2 id='tocuniq358'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying: Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man rises from the dead. The anticipation of the coming kingdom, and the glory of the triumphant one, had been shown on the mountain. Therefore, He does not want this to be preached to the people, lest it be regarded as unbelievable for the greatness of the matter, and lest the cross, following such glory, would become a stumbling block to simple minds.

<h2 id='tocuniq359'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) And the disciples asked him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first? Unless we know the reasons why the disciples asked about the name of Elijah, their questioning seems foolish and extraordinary. For what does it matter to inquire about the coming of Elijah, which is written above? The tradition of the Pharisees is, according to the prophet Malachi (who is the last of the twelve), that Elijah will come before the coming of the Savior and restore the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, and restore everything to its former state (Malachi 4). Therefore, the disciples think that this transformation of glory, which they see on the mountain, is the one they have seen, and they say: If you have already come in glory, why does your precursor not appear, especially since they saw Elijah depart? However, when they add: The scribes say that Elijah must come first; by saying 'first,' they show that unless Elijah comes, the coming of the Savior according to the Scriptures is not fulfilled.

<h2 id='tocuniq360'>(Vers. 11, 12.)</h2>

(Verse 11, 12.) But he answered and said unto them, Elias indeed cometh first, and restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought. But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.

And they did not recognize him; but they did to him whatever they wanted: That is, they despised him, and beheaded him.

<h2 id='tocuniq361'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) And so the Son of Man will suffer at their hands. Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist. Now, as Herod and Herodias are said to have killed John, how can they also say that they crucified Jesus, when we read that he was killed by the scribes and Pharisees? The answer is that both the Pharisees were in agreement with the death of John, and Herod willingly participated in the killing of the Lord. He sent him, mocked and despised, to Pilate to be crucified.



<h2 id='tocuniq362'>(Vers. 14, 15.)</h2>

(Vers. 14, 15.) Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic and suffers greatly: for he often falls into fire and frequently into water. And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him. This is why the devil, observing the course of the moon, seizes upon men and strives to defame the Creator through His creatures, as we have said above. But it seems to me, according to the spiritual interpretation, that the lunatic is one who is constantly changing to vice in the moments of the hours, not persisting in what he has begun, but growing and diminishing: and now he is carried to the fire, by which the hearts of adulterers are inflamed (Hosea VII): now to the waters, which cannot quench charity. But when he says, 'I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him,' he secretly accuses the apostles, since the inability to heal sometimes refers not to the weakness of those who are healing, but to the faith of those who are being healed, as the Lord says, 'Let it be done to you according to your faith' (Mark 5:34, and 10:52).

<h2 id='tocuniq363'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) But Jesus replied, saying: O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me. Not because he was overcome by weariness, and gentle and meek, who did not open his mouth like a lamb before the shearer (Isaiah 53), nor did he burst forth in words of fury; but because, in the likeness of a physician, if he sees a sick person behaving contrary to his instructions, he may say: How long shall I come to your house, until I lose the skill of my craft, you commanding one thing and doing another? But he is not angry with the man, but with the fault; and through one man he accuses the Jews of unfaithfulness, so that he immediately says: Bring him here to me.

<h2 id='tocuniq364'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was healed from that hour. It was not the boy who suffered, but rather the demon who ought to be rebuked. Whether he rebuked the boy, and the demon came out of him: because he had been oppressed by the demon due to his own sins.

<h2 id='tocuniq365'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18) And they said, why could we not cast him out? Jesus said to them: Because of your unbelief. Amen I say to you. This is what he says in another place: Whatever you ask in my name, believing, you will receive (John 15:2). Therefore, whenever we do not receive, it is not due to the impossibility of the one granting, but the fault of those praying.

<h2 id='tocuniq366'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain: Remove from hence, and it shall remove: and nothing shall be impossible to you. Some people think that faith compared to a grain of mustard seed is small, because the kingdom of heaven is compared to a grain of mustard seed; when the apostle says: And if I shall have all faith, so that I could remove mountains (I Cor. XV, 2). Therefore, great is the faith that is compared to a grain of mustard seed. The translation of the mountain does not signify the one that we see with our physical eyes, but rather the one who has been transferred by the Lord from the lunatic. For when he says, 'You will say to this mountain, "Move from here to there," and it will move,' it is understood to refer to the devil. From this, those are shown to be foolish who argue that the apostles and all believers, did not even have a little faith, because none of them moved mountains. For the movement of a mountain from one place to another is not beneficial in itself, and seeking the vain display of miracles; but this mountain must be moved for the benefit of all, which is said by the prophet to corrupt all the earth (Zech. IV).



<h2 id='tocuniq367'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20.) However, this kind does not go out, except by prayer and fasting. While he teaches how the most wicked demon can be expelled, he instructs everyone for life.

<h2 id='tocuniq368'>(Vers. 21 seqq.)</h2>

(Ver. 21 seq.) While they were conversing in Galilee, Jesus said to them: The Son of Man is to be handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and on the third day he will rise again. And they were greatly saddened. He always mixes sorrows with prosperity, so that when they come suddenly, they do not terrify the apostles; but they are carried by their prepared minds: For if they are saddened by his impending death, they should be joyful at the news of his resurrection on the third day. Furthermore, their grief and sorrow are not due to disbelief (otherwise they would have known that Peter was rebuked because he did not understand the things of God, but those of men), but rather because out of love for their master, they are willing to hear nothing negative or humiliating about him.

<h2 id='tocuniq369'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) And when they came to Capernaum, those who received the didrachma came to Peter and said, 'Does your teacher not pay the didrachma?' He said, 'Yes.' After Augustus Caesar, Judea became subject to taxes, and all were registered. Hence, Joseph with Mary, his betrothed, went to Bethlehem to be registered. Again, since he was brought up in Nazareth (which is a town in Galilee, adjacent to the city of Capernaum), they demand taxes as custom dictates. Because of the magnitude of the signs, those demanding taxes do not dare ask for it directly from Jesus, but approach his disciple and ask maliciously whether he pays taxes or opposes Caesar's will; as we read in another place: 'Is it lawful to pay tribute to Caesar or not?' (Mark 12:14)



And when he entered the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying: “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take toll or tribute? From their sons or from others?” And when he entered the house, before Peter could speak, the Lord asks, so that the disciples would not be scandalized by the demand for tribute; since they see him knowing what happened in his absence.

<h2 id='tocuniq370'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25) What do you think, Simon? Do the kings of the earth receive tribute or census from their sons or from strangers? And he said: From strangers. Jesus said to him: Therefore, the sons are free. Our Lord, both according to the flesh and according to the spirit, was the son of a king, either born of the lineage of David or begotten by the Almighty Word of the Father. Therefore, as a son of a king, he should not have to pay taxes, but because he took on the humility of the flesh, he had to fulfill all righteousness. And we, who are unhappy, are called by the name of Christ and yet do nothing worthy of such majesty: He endured the cross and paid tributes for us, we do not pay tributes for His honor, and we are like children of a king who are immune to paying taxes.

<h2 id='tocuniq371'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26) But that we may not offend them: go to the sea, and cast in a hook, and that fish which shall first come up, take: and when thou hast opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater: take that, and give it to them for me and thee. What I should first admire in this place, I know not, whether the foreknowledge, or the greatness of the Saviour. The foreknowledge that he knew the fish would have a stater in its mouth, and that he himself would be the first to be caught. The greatness and power, if at his word a stater was immediately created in the mouth of the fish, and that which was to come to pass he effected by his speaking. But it seems to me, according to a mystical understanding, that this is the fish that was first caught, which was in the depths of the sea and dwelled in salty and bitter waters, so that through the second Adam the first Adam might be freed; and that which was found in its mouth, that is, in its confession, would be given back to Peter and the Lord. And indeed, the same thing is given a beautiful price, but it is divided, because it was given as a price for Peter, as if for a sinner; but our Lord had not committed any sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth (Isaiah 53). The stater is called so because it has two didrachms, to show the likeness of the flesh, while both the slave and the Lord are redeemed at the same price. But it also builds up the understanding of the listener: that the Lord was of such great poverty that he had no means to pay taxes for himself and his apostle. If someone wants to object: how did Judas carry money in the purse? We will answer that he thought it would be wrong to convert the resources of the poor for his own use, and he gave us the same example.



<h2 id='tocuniq372'>(Chap. XVIII.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 18, Verse 1) At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who do you think is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? This has often been discussed and is still worth considering. We must examine the reasons for each of the Lord's words and actions. After finding the coin, after paying the taxes, what does the sudden question from the apostles mean? At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who do you think is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? Because they had seen the tribute paid by Peter and the Lord, equal in price, they decided that Peter should be preferred to all the other apostles, who had been compared to the Lord in the payment of the tribute. Therefore, they asked who is greater in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus, seeing their thoughts and understanding the causes of their error, wanted to heal their desire for glory and their striving for humility.

<h2 id='tocuniq373'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Verse 2.) And calling a little child, he set him in the midst of them, and said. Either simply any little child, to inquire about his age, and to demonstrate the likeness of innocence. Or certainly he placed a little child in their midst, who had come not to be served, but to serve, in order to give them an example of humility. Others interpret the little child as the Holy Spirit, whom he placed in the hearts of the disciples, in order to transform pride into humility.



<h2 id='tocuniq374'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Ver. 3.) Amen I say to you, unless you are converted and become like little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. It is not commanded to the apostles to have the age of children, but to have the innocence, and what they possess through years, let them possess through industry: so that they may be like little children in malice, not in wisdom.

<h2 id='tocuniq375'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Just like this little child, whose example I give to you, does not persist in anger, does not hold grudges, does not delight in seeing a beautiful woman, does not think one thing and say another; in the same way, unless you have such innocence and purity of heart, you will not be able to enter the kingdom of heaven. Or in another way: Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever imitates me and humbles himself as I have humbled myself, taking the form of a servant, he will enter the kingdom of heaven.

<h2 id='tocuniq376'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) And whoever receives such a little child in my name, receives me. And whoever is such, that he imitates the humility and innocence of Christ, in him Christ is received. And wisely, lest when it is reported to the apostles, they should think themselves honored, he added that they should be received not through their own merit, but through the honor of the master.

<h2 id='tocuniq377'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Note that whoever is scandalized is little: for the greater ones do not receive scandals.

Let him be hanged with a millstone around his neck, and let him be thrown into the depths of the sea. Although this general idea can be applied against anyone who causes scandal, it can also be understood in the context of the apostles, who seemed to be competing with each other over rank when they asked who was the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. If they had remained in this vice, they could have caused those whom they called to the faith to stumble through their scandal, as they saw the apostles fighting amongst themselves for honor. But when he said, 'It is expedient for him that a millstone be hung about his neck,' he speaks according to the custom of the province, with which the punishment for more grievous crimes among the ancient Jews was that they should be plunged into the deep with a stone fastened to them. It is expedient for him, because it is much better to receive a brief punishment for a fault than to be preserved for eternal tortures. For the Lord will not judge twice for the same thing (Nahum 1).

<h2 id='tocuniq378'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) Woe to the world because of scandals. For it is necessary that scandals come, but woe to the man through whom the scandal comes.

Not that it is necessary for scandals to come, otherwise those who cause scandal would be without guilt, but since it is necessary for scandals to occur in this world, everyone is exposed to scandal due to their own fault. At the same time, Judas, who had prepared his mind for betrayal, is struck by a general consensus.

<h2 id='tocuniq379'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Verse 8, 9) But if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. Indeed, it is necessary for scandals to come, but woe to the person through whom the scandal comes! Therefore, every affection is cut off and every proximity is amputated, so that no one of the believers may be exposed to scandals through the opportunity of piety. If, he says, someone is so connected to you like a hand, foot, eye, and is useful and caring, and sharp in discerning: but he causes scandal to you, and he drags you into hell because of the disparity of his behavior: it is better that you both avoid his proximity and carnal benefits, so that while you want to profit your relatives and necessary ones, you don't end up causing ruins. Therefore, neither brother, nor wife, nor children, nor friends, nor any affection that can exclude us from the kingdom of heaven, should be preferred to the love of the Lord. Each believer knows what harms themselves, what troubles their soul, and is often tested. It is better to lead a solitary life than to lose eternal life for the needs of this present life.

<h2 id='tocuniq380'>(Vers. 10, 11.)</h2>

(Verses 10, 11.) See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. The Son of Man came to save what was lost. Above, he had said that all close relationships and connections that could cause scandal should be cut off by hand, foot, or eye. Therefore, he tempers the severity of the sentence with a subordinate command, saying: See that you do not despise one of these little ones. Thus, he said, I command severity, so that I may teach the mixing of mercy. As much as is in you, do not despise, but seek the health even of those. But if you see them persevering in sins, and serving vices, it is better for you to be saved alone than to perish with many. For their angels in heaven always see the face of the Father. Great is the dignity of souls, so that each one has been assigned a guardian angel from birth to watch over them. Where do we read in the Apocalypse of John: 'To the angel of the church in Ephesus, write...' (Rev. 2:1). The apostle also commands women to cover their heads in the churches, because of the angels (1 Cor. 11).

<h2 id='tocuniq381'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>

(Vers. 12, 13.) What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine in the mountains, and goeth to seek that which is gone astray? And if it so be that he findeth it: Amen I say to you, he rejoiceth more for that than for the ninety and nine that went not astray. In conclusion he calls to clemency one who had despatched him, saying: See that you do not despise one of these little ones, and he adds the parable of the ninety and nine sheep left in the mountains, and of the one that went astray, which the good shepherd, because of its great weakness, could not go after, and so he brought it back on his shoulder to the rest of the flock. Some think that he, who was in the form of God, yet did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being obedient to the Father even unto death, even death on the cross (Philippians 2:6-8): and for this reason he descended to the earthly realm, to save the one lost sheep, that is, the human race. But others think that the number of ninety-nine sheep represents the righteous, and the one sheep, the sinner, as he said elsewhere: I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners: for it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick (Luke 5:32). This parable in the Gospel according to Luke is written with two other parables, the parable of the ten drachmas and the parable of the two sons (Luke 15).

<h2 id='tocuniq382'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. He refers to the previously stated proposition, of which he said: See that you do not despise one of these little ones; and he teaches this by means of a placed parable, so that the little ones may not be despised. And in what he says: It is not the will of your Father that one of these little ones should perish: whenever one of these little ones perishes, it is shown that it is not by the will of the Father.



<h2 id='tocuniq383'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 and following) But if your brother sins against you, go and confront him between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two more with you, so that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every word may be confirmed. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. If our brother sins against us, and he harms us in any way, we have the power, indeed the necessity, to forgive our debtors as is commanded. But if someone sins against God, it is not within our power. For divine Scripture says: If a man sins against another man, the priest will pray for him. But if someone sins against God, who will pray for him? On the contrary, we are kind in the face of God's injustice, and in our own insults we exercise hatred. However, the brother must be rebuked privately, so that if he has once lost shame and modesty, he may not remain in sin. And if indeed he listens, we gain his soul, and through the salvation of another, we also acquire salvation for ourselves. But if he refuses to listen, let a brother be called in. And if he does not listen to him, let a third person be called in, either to correct him or to meet with witnesses. But if he refuses to listen to them as well, then it is necessary to bring in many people, so that he may be held in detestation, and let him who could not be saved by shame be saved by disgrace. However, when it is said, 'Let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector,' it is shown that there is a greater detestation for someone who acts as a faithful person under the title of an infidel than for those who openly identify as Gentiles. For publicans are called according to tropology, those who pursue worldly gains and demand taxes through dealings and frauds, thefts, and wicked perjuries.

<h2 id='tocuniq384'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) Truly I tell you: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. For it was said: If, however, he does not listen to the Church, let him be to you like a Gentile and a tax collector, and it could be a hidden response of contempt for a brother, or a silent thought, if you despise me, I despise you, if you condemn me, you will be condemned by my judgment: he gives the power to the apostles, so that they may know that those who are condemned by such are confirmed by human judgment, and whatever is bound on earth is bound equally in heaven.



<h2 id='tocuniq385'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Verse 19, 20.) Again I say to you: if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them. The above discourse has encouraged us towards harmony. Therefore, it promises a reward so that we may hasten eagerly towards peace, as it says that it will be present among two or three. Similar to the example of a tyrant, who wanted to prove that he had captured two friends (when one returned to see his mother and gave his friend as a surety for himself), so he wanted to test one, and release the other. And when he returned on the appointed day, marveling at the faith of both, he asked that they have a third. We can also understand this spiritually, that where the spirit and soul and body agree and do not have war between themselves of different desires (or pleasures); with the flesh desiring against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, they obtain from the Father whatever they seek about any thing. And there is no doubt that the request of good things is certain, where the body wants to have those things which the spirit wants.



<h2 id='tocuniq386'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verse 21, 22.) Then Peter came to him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times? Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven. The Lord's words weighed heavily on him, and they could not be broken like a triple cord. Earlier, he had said, See that you do not despise one of these little ones; and he had added, If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. And he had promised a reward, saying, If two of you agree on earth about anything they ask for, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them. The apostle Peter, provoked, asks how many times he should forgive his brother who sins against him, and when he proposes the question, should it be up to seven times? Jesus responds: Not up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven, that is, four hundred and ninety times, so that he should forgive his brother who sins against him as many times in a day as that brother cannot sin.

<h2 id='tocuniq387'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23.) Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is likened to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. It is customary for the Syrians and especially the Palestinians to connect all their speech with parables, so that what cannot be understood by the listeners through a simple commandment may be understood through similarity and examples. Therefore, he instructed Peter using the comparison of a king and master, and servants. The servant, who owed ten thousand talents, begged the master for forgiveness and obtained it; so he also should forgive his fellow servants for their lesser sins. That king and lord forgave the servant debtors ten thousand talents as easily as he did. How much more should servants forgive their fellow servants lesser debts? To make it more clear, let's say it with an example: If one of us commits adultery, murder, sacrilege, greater crimes worth ten thousand talents, they are forgiven when asked, so should we forgive lesser sins of others. But if we, because of an insult, remain unforgiving and perpetuate discord because of a bitter word, don't we seem to be rightly sent to prison? And using our own work as an example, shouldn't we act in such a way that we don't receive forgiveness for greater offenses?



<h2 id='tocuniq388'>(Vers. 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 24 onwards) And when he began to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed ten thousand talents. But since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, along with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made. So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, 'Have patience with me, and I will repay you everything.' And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt. But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing him, he began to choke him, saying, 'Pay what you owe.' And his fellow servant falling down, besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will render thee all. And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. Now his fellow servants seeing what was done, were very much grieved, and they came and told their lord all that was done. Then his lord called him; and said to him: Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all the debt, because thou besoughtest me. Therefore, should you not also have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you? And his master, being angry, delivered him to the torturers until he should pay back all the debt. I know certain individuals who owed ten thousand talents, interpreting the devil, whose wife and children they wanted to sell while he persisted in wickedness, to represent foolishness and evil thoughts. For just as the wife of the righteous is said to be wisdom, so the wife of the unjust and sinner is called foolishness. But how will the master forgive him ten thousand talents; and he did not forgive us, his servants, one hundred denarii, neither is it of Ecclesiastical interpretation, nor should it be accepted by prudent men.

<h2 id='tocuniq389'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Verse 35) In this way, my heavenly Father will also do to you, unless each one of you forgives his brother from your heart. This is a frightening statement, if the divine judgment is turned and changed according to our own judgment. If we do not forgive our brothers for small offenses, God will not forgive us for great offenses. And because each one can say: I have nothing against him, he knows: he has God as judge, I do not care what he wants to do, I have forgiven him; he confirms his own judgment and destroys all pretense of false peace, saying: Unless each one of you forgives his brother from your heart.



<h2 id='tocuniq390'>(Chap. XIX.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter XIX. — Verse 1 and following) And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan; and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there. And the Pharisees came to him, tempting him and saying: Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause? He had come from Galilee to Judea; therefore, the faction of the Pharisees and Scribes questioned him, whether it is lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause, so that they may hold him in a trap as if he were caught in a syllogism, and whatever he answers, may be used against him. If he says that wives should be dismissed for any reason whatsoever, and other wives should be taken, he will appear to preach against chastity. But if he responds that not every reason warrants dismissal, he will be held guilty of sacrilege as if he were a transgressor of the law given through Moses and by Moses from God. Therefore, the Lord tempers his response so that their disciple may understand, citing sacred Scripture as evidence and opposing the natural law and the first intention of God with the second intention, which was granted not by the will of God but by the necessity of sinners.



<h2 id='tocuniq391'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(V. 4.) And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female? This is written in the beginning of Genesis. But in saying male and female, he pointed towards monogamous marriages. For he did not say males and females, which was sought after due to the repudiation of the former, but male and female, so that the bond of one spouse might be established.

<h2 id='tocuniq392'>(Vers. 5, 6.)</h2>

(Vers. 5, 6.) And he said: Because of this, a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Likewise, he said, a man must be united to his wife, not wives. And the two will become one flesh. The reward of marriage is for two to become one flesh. Chastity joined to the spirit makes one spirit.

Therefore, what God has joined together, let no man separate. God has joined, by making one flesh of man and woman: this the man cannot separate, unless perhaps by the power of God alone. Man separates, when, due to desire for a second spouse, he dismisses the first. God separates, who had also joined, when by consent due to the service of God (because time is limited) we have wives as though we have none (I Cor. VII).

<h2 id='tocuniq393'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) They said to him, 'So why did Moses command us to give a bill of divorce and dismiss?' They open the trap they had prepared. And certainly the Lord had not given his own opinion, but had remembered the old history and commandments of God.

<h2 id='tocuniq394'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) He said to them: because Moses allowed you to divorce your wives due to the hardness of your hearts, but it was not like that from the beginning. This is what he meant: Can God be opposed to himself, so that he would command one thing before and then nullify his own command with a new one? It should not be understood this way. Rather, Moses, seeing that because of the desire for second wives, who were either richer, younger, or more beautiful, the first wives were being killed or leading a bad life, preferred to tolerate discord rather than continue with hatred and murders (Deut. XXIV). At the same time, consider that God did not allow it because of the hardness of your hearts, but Moses did, so that, according to the Apostle's counsel (1 Corinthians 7), it may be a human choice, not a commandment from God.

<h2 id='tocuniq395'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) But I say to you, that whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. And he who marries a divorced woman, commits adultery. Only fornication is what overcomes a wife's affection: indeed, when she divides one flesh into another, and separates herself from her husband through fornication, she should not be held: lest she also make her husband subject to a curse, as Scripture says: Whoever holds onto an adulteress, is foolish and wicked. Therefore, whenever there is fornication, or even suspicion of fornication, the wife is freely dismissed. And because it could happen that someone falsely accuses the innocent person and implicates them in an old crime due to a second marriage, the husband is commanded to divorce the first wife so that he does not have a second wife while the first one is still alive. For what he says is as follows: If you divorce your wife not for lust but for injury, why do you expose yourself to the danger of unhappy previous marriages by entering into new ones? Moreover, because it could happen that, according to the same law, a wife could also give a divorce to her husband, the same caution is prescribed so that she does not marry a second man. And because a prostitute, and one who has once been an adulteress, does not fear disgrace, the same caution is prescribed for the husband, that if he marries such a woman, he is subject to the crime of adultery.

<h2 id='tocuniq396'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) His disciples said to him: If such is the case between a man and his wife, it is not expedient to marry. The burden of wives is heavy, for apart from the cause of fornication, they cannot be divorced. For what if she is drunken, if she is angry, if she is of bad morals, if she is lascivious, if she is gluttonous, if she is wandering, if she is quarrelsome, if she is abusive? She must be endured. For when we were free, we willingly subjected ourselves to servitude. Therefore, seeing the heavy burden of wives, the apostles express their thoughts and say, if it is so, it is not expedient for a man to marry.

<h2 id='tocuniq397'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) He said to them: Not everyone can understand this word, but only those to whom it is given. No one should think that under this word, either fate or fortune is introduced: these are the virgins to whom it has been given by God, or whom certain circumstances have brought to this, but it has been given to those who have asked, who have desired, who have worked to receive it. For everyone who asks will receive, and the one who seeks will find, and to the one who knocks, it will be opened (Matthew 7:8 and Luke 11:10).



<h2 id='tocuniq398'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it. There are three types of eunuchs: those who are eunuchs from birth, those who are made eunuchs by men, and those who make themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Some are born eunuchs, others are made eunuchs by men, and others choose to be eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. And those who can accept it should accept it. A reward is promised to these people, but to the previous ones, for whom the necessity of chastity is not voluntary, nothing is owed at all. We can say differently. There are eunuchs who are born from their mother's womb, who are of a colder nature and do not desire lust. And there are others who are made by humans: whom either philosophers make, or they are softened into women because of the worship of idols: or they pretend chastity due to heretical persuasion, in order to lie about the truth of religion. But none of them will inherit the kingdom of heaven unless he has castrated himself for the sake of Christ. Therefore, it is concluded: He who is able to receive this, let him receive it; so that each person may consider his own abilities, whether he can fulfill the commands of virginity and chastity. For chastity is enticing in itself, attracting anyone to itself. But one's abilities must be considered, so that he who is able to receive it, may receive it. It is like the voice of the Lord urging and inciting his soldiers to the reward of chastity. Let whoever is able to understand, understand; let whoever is able to fight, fight, overcome and triumph.

<h2 id='tocuniq399'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verses 13, 14.) Then little children were brought to him, so that he could lay his hands on them and pray. But the disciples rebuked them. Jesus said to them, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.'

<h2 id='tocuniq400'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) Allow the children, and do not prohibit them from coming to me: for such is the kingdom of heaven. And when he had laid his hands on them, he departed from there. He specifically said 'such', not 'these', to show that it is not age that reigns but character; and that those who have similar innocence and simplicity will be rewarded. The apostle also agrees with this sentiment: Brothers, do not be children in your thinking, but be infants in evil, and mature in your thinking (1 Corinthians 14:20).



<h2 id='tocuniq401'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(V. 16.) And behold, one approached him and said to him: Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? And he said to him: This one who asks how to obtain eternal life is both young and wealthy, and proud; and according to another evangelist, he asks not out of a desire to learn, but to test (Mark X).

<h2 id='tocuniq402'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one good God. Because he had called a good teacher, and not God, or the Son of God, he learns that even a holy man is not good in comparison to God, of whom it is said: Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good (Psalm 117:1). But lest anyone think that the goodness of God excludes the Son of God, we read in another place: The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep (John 10). And in the Prophet, the good Spirit and the good earth. Therefore, the Savior did not reject the testimony of goodness. But the teacher eliminated error without God.

<h2 id='tocuniq403'>(Vers. 18, 19.)</h2>

(Verse 18, 19.) But if you want to enter life, keep the commandments. He said to him, 'Which ones?' Jesus replied, 'You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false testimony. Honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.' This young man is tempting, and from this we can prove that when the Lord tells him, 'If you want to enter life, keep the commandments,' he deceitfully asks what those commandments are: as if he himself had not read them, or as if the Lord could command something contrary to God.



<h2 id='tocuniq404'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20.) The young man said to Him: All these things I have kept from my youth, what do I still lack? Jesus said to him: The young man lies. For if he had fulfilled the commandments: You shall love your neighbor as yourself, how then, upon hearing: Go, sell what you have and give to the poor, did he go away sad, for he had many possessions?

<h2 id='tocuniq405'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21.) If you wish to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. It is in our power to choose to be perfect. However, whoever wishes to be perfect must sell what they have: and not sell only a portion, as Ananias and Sapphira did (Act. V); but sell everything: and when they have sold, give everything to the poor, and thus prepare for themselves treasure in the kingdom of heaven. And this is not enough for perfection unless one follows the Savior after despising riches, that is, by leaving behind evils and doing good. For it is easier to despise a purse than pleasure. Many who leave behind riches do not follow the Lord. But he who is an imitator of the Lord follows him and walks in his footsteps. For whoever says that they believe in Christ should walk as he walked (1 John 2:6).



<h2 id='tocuniq406'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) He went away sad, for he had many possessions. This is the sadness that leads to death. And the cause of the sadness is that he had many possessions, that is, thorns and thistles, which choked the Lord's seed.

<h2 id='tocuniq407'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) But Jesus said to his disciples: Amen I say to you, that it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. And how did Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, being rich, enter into the kingdom of heaven (Genesis 13 and 36), and in the Gospel Matthew and Zacchaeus, leaving their riches behind, are proclaimed by the testimony of the Lord? But it must be considered that at the time they entered, they ceased to be rich. Therefore, they will not enter as long as they are rich. And yet, because riches are difficult to despise, he did not say, 'It is impossible for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven,' but rather 'It is difficult.' Where difficulty is presented, not impossibility is claimed; but rarity is demonstrated.

<h2 id='tocuniq408'>(Vers. 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 24 and following) And again I say to you: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven. When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, 'Who then can be saved?' But Jesus looked at them and said, 'With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.' This statement shows that it is not difficult, but impossible. For if a camel cannot enter through the eye of a needle, so a rich person cannot enter the kingdom of heaven, no rich person will be saved. But if we read Isaiah, how the camels of Midian and Ephah come to Jerusalem with gifts and offerings (Isa. 60): and how those who were previously bent and distorted by the corruption of vices enter the gates of Jerusalem, we will see how even these camels, to whom the rich are compared, when they have unloaded the heavy burden of sins and the corruption of the whole body, are able to enter through the narrow gate and the narrow way that leads to life (Above 7). But when the disciples asked and were amazed at the severity of his words, he tempered the severity of his statement with his mercy, saying: What is impossible for men is possible for God.

<h2 id='tocuniq409'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27) Then Peter answered and said to him: Behold, we have left everything and followed you: What therefore will be for us? Great confidence: Peter was a fisherman, he had not been wealthy, he sought food by hand and skill: and yet he speaks confidently, We have left everything. And because it is not enough to just leave, he adds what is perfect: and followed you. We have done what you commanded, so what reward will you give us?

<h2 id='tocuniq410'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28.) But Jesus said to them: Amen I say to you, that you who have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the seat of his majesty, you also shall sit on twelve seats, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. He did not say: you who have left all things, for this Crates the philosopher also did, and many others despised riches; but you who have followed me: which properly belongs to the apostles and believers. In the regeneration, when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory, you will also sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel: because they refused to believe in Him, who believed in you.

<h2 id='tocuniq411'>(Vers. 29, 30.)</h2>

(Verse 29, 30.) And everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall possess eternal life. But many who are first shall be last, and the last first. This passage is in agreement with that saying in which the Savior speaks: 'I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.' (Matthew 10:34) Therefore, those who for the sake of the faith of Christ and the preaching of the Gospel have despised all affections, as well as riches and worldly pleasures: they will receive a hundredfold and possess eternal life. In connection with this statement, some introduce the idea of a thousand years after the resurrection, saying that then a hundredfold of all the things we have given up will be restored to us, and eternal life will be given: not understanding that if in other matters there is a worthy promise, in the case of wives there appears a shameful thing; so that one who leaves one for the Lord will receive a hundred in the future. Therefore, this is the meaning: Whoever renounces earthly things for the sake of the Savior will receive heavenly things, which will be suitable and proportionate to the merit of the renunciation, as if a small number were compared to a hundred. Thus the Apostle says, he who has renounced only one house and the small fields of one province: As if having nothing, and possessing all things (2 Corinthians 6:10).

<h2 id='tocuniq412'>(Chap. XX.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

Chapter 20, Verse 1 onwards: The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. After agreeing to pay them the usual daily wage, he sent them into his vineyard. Going out again at about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace and said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and I will give you whatever is right.' So they went. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did the same. At about the eleventh hour, he went out and found others standing around, and he said to them, 'Why are you standing here idle all day?' They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard.' When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.' So when those hired at about the eleventh hour came, each one received a denarius. But when the first came, they thought that they would receive more; and they themselves also received each a denarius. And receiving it, they murmured against the householder, saying: These last have worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat? But answering one of them, he said: This parable or similitude of the kingdom of heaven is understood from the things that have been set forth. For it is written before it: Many will be first who will be last, and the last first. Not deferring to time but to faith. And he said that the householder went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard and agreed to pay them a denarius for their work. Then he went out again around the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, and he promised to pay them what is just, not a denarius. He also did the same at the sixth hour and the ninth hour. And the eleventh hour workers also found others standing idle all day long, and sent them into the vineyard. And when it was evening, the owner of the vineyard instructed his steward to begin paying the workers, starting with the last ones hired and ending with the first ones hired; and all were equally incited against the last ones, accusing the father of the household of unfairness. Not because they received less than what was agreed upon, but because they wanted to receive more than those upon whom the steward had shown his mercy. It seems to me that the first hour belongs to the workers Samuel, Jeremiah, and John the Baptist, who can say with the Psalmist: 'You are my God from my mother's womb' (Psalm 22:11). The third hour belongs to those who began to serve God from their youth. The sixth hour belongs to those who took up the yoke of Christ in mature age. The ninth hour belongs to those who are already declining towards old age. And the eleventh hour belongs to those in their final old age. Yet all receive the same reward, although the labor is different. There are those who explain this parable in a different way. The first hour is said to represent the time from Adam and the other patriarchs to Noah; the third, from Noah to Abraham and the giving of circumcision to him; the sixth, from Abraham to Moses, when the Law was given; the ninth, from Moses to the prophets; the eleventh, from the apostles to the Gentile people, whom everyone envies. Therefore, understanding this itself after the eleventh hour, when it was near the setting of the sun and towards evening, John the Evangelist speaks: My little children, it is the last hour (1 John 2:13). And at the same time, consider that the injustice of the head of the household, which everyone equally accuses the eleventh hour workers of, they do not understand in themselves. For if the head of the household is unjust, he is not unjust in one, but in all: because the worker who was sent to the vineyard in the third hour did not work as much as the one who was sent in the first hour. Similarly, the worker who was sent in the sixth hour worked less than the one in the third hour; and the worker in the ninth hour worked less than the one in the sixth hour. Therefore, every backward calling is envied by the peoples, and is twisted in the grace of the Gospel. Hence, the Savior concludes the parable, saying: The first will be last, and the last first. Thus, the Jews are turned from head to tail, and we are changed from tail to head.

<h2 id='tocuniq413'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) Friend, I do not harm you. I read in a certain book that this friend who is rebuked by the head of the household is understood as the first hour worker, the prototype, and those who believed at that time.

Did you not come with me from a denarius? A denarius has the figure of a king. Therefore, you have received the reward that I promised to you, that is, my image and likeness: what more do you seek? And it is not so much that you want to receive more yourself, but rather that you desire that no one else receive anything, as if the merit of the reward would be diminished by sharing it with another.

<h2 id='tocuniq414'>(Vers. 14, 15.)</h2>

(Verse 14, 15) Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last worker the same as I give to you. Or is it not lawful for me to do what I want with my own money? Is your eye evil because I am good? So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.

<h2 id='tocuniq415'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) Is your eye evil because I am good? So the last shall be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen. This is the same meaning as the parable of the prodigal son in Luke, where the older son envies the younger and does not want to receive him when he returns and accuses the father of injustice. And so that we may know that this is the meaning we have said, the title and the end of this parable agree. So the last shall be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.

<h2 id='tocuniq416'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Ver. 17 seqq.) And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took his twelve disciples aside privately, and said to them: Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified, and on the third day he will rise again. He had often told this to his disciples, but because they were engaged in many disputes among themselves, they could easily forget what they had heard. So, as he was about to go to Jerusalem and take the apostles with him, he prepared them for the trial, so that they would not be scandalized when persecution and the ignominy of the cross come.



<h2 id='tocuniq417'>(Vers. 20, 21.)</h2>

(Verse 20, 21.) Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, bowing down and asking something of him. He said to her, 'What do you want?' She replied to him, 'Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.' From this, we can infer that the mother of the sons of Zebedee has the expectation that when the Lord says, 'The Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified,' and when he announces the shame of the passion to the disciples who fear it, she desires the glory of the triumphant one. This, as I understand it, was the reason why, after everything the Lord had said, the woman believed that he would immediately begin ruling after the resurrection. And she desired this to be fulfilled in the first coming, what is promised in the second coming, and with feminine eagerness she longs for his presence, forgetting about the future. But when the Lord asks and she requests, 'What do you want?', it is not out of ignorance but is said from her perspective, who was to be scourged and crucified, just as with the woman with the issue of blood, 'Who touched me?' (Luke 8:15). And about Lazarus: Where have you laid him (John 11:34)? In the Old Testament as well: Adam, where are you (Genesis 3:9)? And: I will go down and see if they have indeed done all according to the outcry that has come to me; if not, I will know (Genesis 18:21). However, the mother of the sons of Zebedee, driven by feminine error and a sense of piety, requested without knowing what she was asking for. And it is not surprising if this is attributed to ignorance; as it is said about Peter, when he wanted to make three tabernacles, not knowing what he was saying (Mark 9).



<h2 id='tocuniq418'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22) But Jesus answered and said: You do not know what you ask. The mother asks, and the Lord speaks to the disciples, understanding her prayers to come from the will of the children.

Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink? They said to him: We can. In the Holy Scriptures, we understand the cup to represent suffering, as it is written: Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me (Matt. XXVI, 39). And in the psalm: What shall I render to the Lord for all the things he has rendered to me? I will take the cup of salvation, and will call upon the name of the Lord (Ps. CXV, 3 et seqq.); and immediately it explains what this cup is: Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.



<h2 id='tocuniq419'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Ver. 23.) He said to them: 'You will indeed drink my cup. But to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give you, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.' It is questioned how James and John, the sons of Zebedee, drank the cup of martyrdom, when the Scripture narrates that only James the Apostle was beheaded by Herod (Acts XII): but John ended his life by his own death. But if we read the ecclesiastical histories, in which it is reported that he himself, on account of martyrdom, was sent into a vat of boiling oil, and from there as an athlete proceeded to receive the crown of Christ, and was immediately banished to the island of Patmos, we will see that the spirit for martyrdom was not lacking, and that John drank the cup of confession: which three young men also drank in the fiery furnace (Dan. III), although the persecutor did not shed blood. But what he says: to sit at my right hand and my left, is not mine to give to you, but to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father, it is to be understood as follows: The kingdom of heaven is not about giving, but about receiving. For there is no partiality with God (Acts 10:34): but whoever presents themselves in such a way as to become worthy of the kingdom of heaven, will receive what has been prepared not for individuals, but for life. Therefore, if you are among those who will attain the kingdom of heaven, which my Father has prepared for the triumphant and victorious, you will also receive it. Others want to interpret the saying about Moses and Elijah, whom they had seen talking with him on the mountain a little while ago, but it does not seem so to me. For the names of those who are seated in the kingdom of heaven are not spoken; lest, with a few being named, the others are thought to be excluded.

<h2 id='tocuniq420'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24.) And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers. The ten apostles did not show indignation towards the mother of the sons of Zebedee, nor did they refer to the boldness of the woman making the request; but to the sons, because they, not understanding their own measure, were inflamed by excessive desire, to whom the Lord had also said: You do not know what you are asking. It is understood either from the Lord's response or from the indignation of the apostles that the sons sent their mother to make great requests.



<h2 id='tocuniq421'>(Vers. 25 seqq.)</h2>

(Verses 25 and following) But Jesus called them to Himself and said, 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them. It is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave. Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.' Therefore, it is in vain that some have sought excessive things, or that others grieve over the longing for their ancestors, since the summit of virtues is reached not through power, but through humility. Finally, he presents his own example, so that if his words were disregarded, they would be ashamed of their actions, and he says:

<h2 id='tocuniq422'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28) Just as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve. Note that we have frequently said that the one who serves is called the Son of Man.

And to give his life as a ransom for many. When he assumed the form of a servant, in order to shed his blood for the world (Philippians 2). He did not say that he would give his life as a ransom for all, but for many, that is, for those who would be willing to believe.

<h2 id='tocuniq423'>(Vers. 19 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 19 onwards) And as they were departing from Jericho, a great crowd followed him. And behold, two blind men sitting by the roadside, heard that Jesus was passing by, and they cried out, saying: Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David. But the crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent. Yet they cried out even more, saying: Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David. There were many robbers in Jericho who used to attack and harm those who were coming in and going out of Jerusalem; therefore the Lord came to Jericho with his disciples, to heal the wounded and to bring a large crowd with him. Finally, after they want to leave from Jericho, a large crowd followed him. If he had stayed in Jerusalem and never descended to the lowly things, the crowd would still be sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death until today. But there were also two blind men by the road. He calls blind those who could not yet speak: In your light we will see light (Ps. XXXV, 10). Along the road, because they seemed to have knowledge of the Law: but they were ignorant of the way, which is Christ: whom most understand as the Pharisees and Sadducees, and others as both the people, the old Testament and the New: because one, following the written Law, was blind without Christ. Because they could not see by themselves, they heard the proclamations of the Savior, and confessed him as the son of David. But if both blind men are referred to the Jewish people, what follows, 'The crowd rebuked them,' should be understood in relation to the Gentiles: whom the Apostle warns not to boast and be arrogant against their own root (Rom. 11); but since they themselves were grafted in by the error of those before them from the wild olive tree into the good olive tree, they should by no means envy the salvation of those before them. Have mercy on us, O son of David. They are reproached by the crowds, and yet they do not remain silent: but rather they repeat the same thing more frequently, so that they may show the desire for the fullness of true light.

<h2 id='tocuniq424'>(Vers. 32, 33.)</h2>

(Verse 32, 33.) And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What do you want me to do for you? They said to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. They were blind, not knowing where to go, and unable to follow the Savior. There were many pits in Jericho, many rocks and cliffs plunging into the deep: therefore the Lord stands, so that they can come and be called, lest the crowds hinder them: and he asks as if ignorant of what they want, so that from the blind men's answer their manifest weakness may be revealed, and the power may be known from the remedy.



<h2 id='tocuniq425'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) But Jesus, having mercy on them, touched their eyes: and immediately they saw, and followed him. He touches their eyes and provides as an artist what nature had not given. Or certainly what weakness had taken away, he restores with mercy. And immediately they saw, and followed him. Those who were previously sitting in Jericho, contracted and blind, had heard that he was passing by, and now they follow Jesus, not so much with their feet as with their virtues.

<h2 id='tocuniq426'>(Chap. XXI.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 21, verses 1 onwards) And when he drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, 'Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them,' and he will send them at once.' He went out of Jericho, with a multitude following him, and many blind people were healed, and he approached Jerusalem, greatly enriched with merchandise. The greeting of the believers was returned, he desired to enter the city of peace and the site of God's vision, and the fortress of the watchtower. And when he was approaching Jerusalem, and had come to Bethphage to the house of the jaws (which was a village of the priests, and bore the type of confession; and it was situated on the mount of Olives, where the light of knowledge, where the rest of labors and sorrows), he sent two of his disciples, the contemplative and the active, that is, knowledge and work, to enter the fortress. And he said to them: Go into the fortress that is opposite you. For it was opposite to the apostles, and he did not want to accept the yoke of teachings. And immediately, he says, you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her: untie them and bring them to me. The donkey was tied with many chains of sins. The colt, too, was wild and impatient with the reins, as according to the Gospel of Luke (Chapter 19), it had many owners, not subject to one error and doctrine: and yet many owners who claimed illegal power for themselves, seeing the true Lord and his servants who had been sent to untie, dared not resist. We will explain what a female donkey is, and the offspring of a female donkey, in the following sections.

<h2 id='tocuniq427'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

(Vers. 4, 5.) However, this happened so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: Tell the daughter of Zion, behold your king comes to you, meek and sitting on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden. This is written in the prophet Zechariah: of which, if there is enough time in life, it will be said in its proper place. Now, briefly, it must be understood that according to the literal meaning, it was not possible for him to sit on both animals in a short distance of the journey. For either the she-asses sat and the foal was without a rider, or if the foal, which is more fitting, was used for sitting, the she-ass was led freely. Therefore, when the story seems to have impossibility or shame, we are led to deeper meanings: so that that she-ass which was submissive, and tamed, and had taken the yoke of the law, may be understood as the Synagogue; the foal of the she-ass, wanton and free, may be understood as the people of the Gentiles, on whom Jesus sat, and when he sent two of his disciples to them, one to the Circumcision, and the other to the Gentiles.



<h2 id='tocuniq428'>(Vers. 6, 7.)</h2>

(Verse 6, 7) However, the disciples went and did as Jesus had ordered them. They brought the donkey and the colt, and put their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them. This colt and donkey, on which the apostles spread their cloaks so that Jesus might sit more comfortably, were naked before the coming of the Savior, and they shivered without cover, with many claiming dominion over them. But after they received the apostolic garments, they became more beautiful and had the Lord as their rider. The apostolic garment, or the teaching of virtues, or the exposition of Scriptures, can be understood, or the variations of ecclesiastical doctrines: unless the soul is instructed and adorned by these, it does not deserve to have the Lord as its dwelling.

<h2 id='tocuniq429'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) But a great crowd spread their garments on the road. Notice the difference in each person. The apostles put their garments on the donkey, while the crowd, which is more humble, lays their garments in front of the donkey's feet, so that it does not stumble on a stone, step on a thorn, or fall into a ditch.

On the other hand, some were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road. They were cutting branches from fruit-bearing trees, with which the Mount of Olives is planted, and spreading them on the road in order to make the crooked straight and the rough places smooth, so that Christ, the victor over demons and vices, could walk more easily and securely in the hearts of believers.

<h2 id='tocuniq430'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) But the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, saying, 'Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!' Let us now follow the spiritual order of discourse, for the story is clear. The crowds that had come out of Jericho and had followed the Savior and his disciples, after they saw the foal of a donkey loosed (which had been tied up before) and adorned with the apostles' garments, and the Lord Jesus sitting on it, they placed their garments on the ground and spread branches of trees on the road. And when they had completed all things with great effort, they also give testimony of their voice: and those who went before and those who followed after confessed not with a short and silent confession, but with a very loud clamor: Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. And what he says: The crowds that went before and that followed after, showed both the people who believed in the Lord before the Gospel, and those who believed in the Lord after the Gospel, praising Jesus with a unified voice of confession: and according to the example of the parable of the workers of different hours in the higher story, to accept one reward of faith. Furthermore, regarding what follows: 'Hosanna to the Son of David,' I remember having said, in a short letter to Damasus, who was the bishop of the city of Rome at that time, and now I will briefly explain. In the 117th psalm, which clearly speaks of the coming of the Savior, among other things we read: 'The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.' This was done by the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. And immediately it follows: O Lord, save me: O Lord, prosper me. Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord: we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord, etc. (Psalm 118:22 seqq.). For what is said in the Septuagint interpreters; O Lord, save now, that is, O Lord, save; in Hebrew we read: Hosanna, which Symmachus interprets more clearly, saying: I beseech thee, Lord, save, I beseech thee. Therefore, no one thinks that the phrase is composed of two words, namely Greek and Hebrew, but it is entirely Hebrew and signifies that the coming of Christ is the salvation of the world. Hence, it follows: Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. This is also confirmed by the Savior Himself in the Gospel: I came in my Father's name, and you did not receive me. Another will come in his own name, and you will receive him (John 5:43). Moreover, the joining of 'Hosanna', that is, 'salvation in the highest', clearly shows that the coming of Christ is not only the salvation of mankind, but of the whole world: connecting the earthly with the heavenly, so that every knee shall bow, of those in heaven, on earth, and under the earth (Philippians 2:10).



<h2 id='tocuniq431'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10) And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, 'Who is this?' And the people ((or Many)) were saying, 'This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.' As Jesus entered the city with the whole crowd, the city of Jerusalem was stirred up, amazed at the multitude, not knowing the truth, and saying, 'Who is this?' Indeed, we read in another place the angels saying: 'Who is this King of glory?' (Psalm 24:8). But to others who were doubting or asking, the lowly common people confess: starting from the least, in order to reach the greatest, and they say:

163 This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee. The prophet whom even Moses had said would come, and who is specifically written with the article among the Greeks. From Nazareth in Galilee because he was brought up there: so that, like a flower of the field, he would be nurtured in the flower of virtues.

<h2 id='tocuniq432'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>

(Verse 12, 13.) And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves. And He said to them, 'It is written: My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers.' Then Jesus entered the temple area accompanied by the crowd of believers (who had spread their garments so that the colt could walk on them without being harmed). He expelled all those who were selling and buying in the temple, overturned the tables of the money changers, and scattered the seats of those selling doves. And he said to them, quoting from the holy scriptures (Isaiah 56) and (Jeremiah 7), that his Father's house should be a house of prayer and not a den of robbers or a house of merchandise, as it is written in another Gospel (John 2). First of all, it must be known that according to the commands of the most august Law, in the whole world, in the temple of the Lord, and from almost all the regions of the Jews, countless offerings were being sacrificed, especially on festive days, of bulls, rams, and goats; so that the poor would not be without offering, those who offered would present young doves and turtles; it often happened that those who had come from afar did not have victims. Therefore, the priests devised a way to take prey from the people, and they sold all the animals they needed for sacrifices, so that they would sell to those who did not have them, and they themselves would receive them again when bought. He dispersed this band of people who were frequently coming due to their lack of resources, those who were in need of expenses, and not only did they not have offerings, but they didn't even have birds and cheap gifts to buy. So they appointed moneylenders who would lend money under collateral. But because there was a law, as commanded in Leviticus 25 and Deuteronomy 23, that no interest should be received, and borrowed money could not bring any benefit, as it had no gain, and sometimes it could even result in loss, they invented another technique, that they would make 'Collybistas' instead of moneylenders, which the Latin language does not express the exact meaning of the word. Among them, what we call trinkets or cheap gifts are called collybadicuntur. For example, roasted chickpeas, dried grapes, and various types of fruits. Therefore, because the moneylenders, called Collybistae, could not charge interest, they would accept various goods instead of interest, so that they could demand what was not allowed in currency, but could be purchased with these items, as if Ezekiel himself did not preach this, saying: 'You shall not take interest and profits.' (Ezek. XXII, 12). The Lord, seeing such a trade or robbery in his Father's house, was stirred with zeal (as it is written in the 68th Psalm, verse 10: The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up), and he made for himself a whip out of cords, and drove out such a great multitude of people from the temple, saying: It is written: My house shall be called a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves. For he is a thief, and he turns the temple of God into a cave of thieves, who seeks profits from religion, and whose worship is not so much the worship of God as it is an opportunity for business. According to the story, Jesus enters the temple of the Father daily, and drives out all, both bishops and priests and deacons, as well as lay people, and the entire crowd from His Church, and He has only one crime, that of buying and selling. For it is written: Freely you have received, freely give. He also overturns the tables of the money changers. Note, because of the greed of the priests, the altars of God are called the tables of money changers. And he overturned the seats of those who were selling doves, who were selling the grace of the Holy Spirit, and they do everything to devour the subject peoples, of whom it is said (as is said): They devour my people like bread (Ps. 13:4). According to simple understanding, doves were not in seats but in cages, unless perhaps the caretakers of the doves were sitting in seats. But that is completely absurd, because in seats, the dignity of teachers is more clearly indicated, which is reduced to nothing when it is mixed with profits. Concerning the churches, let each one understand concerning themselves. For the Apostle says: You are the temple of God, and the Holy Spirit dwells in you (I Cor. VI, 15, and II Cor. III, 16). Let there be no dealing in the house of our hearts, no buying and selling, no desire for gifts, lest Jesus enters angry and stern, and does not cleanse His temple except by using a whip, so as to make a house of prayer out of a den of thieves and a house of commerce.



<h2 id='tocuniq433'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. If he had not overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves, the blind and the lame would not have deserved to receive their former sight and the ability to walk.

<h2 id='tocuniq434'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15) But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, 'Hosanna to the Son of David', they were indignant and said to him, 'Do you hear what these are saying?' Many believe that the raising of Lazarus is the greatest sign, that the blind man received sight from birth, that the voice of the Father was heard at the Jordan, and that he showed the glory of the triumphant one when he was transfigured on the mountain. Among all the signs that he performed, it seems more amazing to me that one man, at that time considered despicable and exceedingly lowly to the point of being crucified later, could drive out such a multitude with a whip of cords, overturn tables, break chairs, and do other things that an infinite army would not have done. For a fiery and heavenly radiance shone forth from his eyes, and the majesty of divinity shone upon his face. And though the priests dared not lay hands on him, they nevertheless plotted against him, and they twisted the testimony of the people and children who cried out, 'Hosanna to the son of David,' into a slander: for it is clear that this can only be said of the Son of God alone. Therefore, let the bishops and all holy men see with what danger they allow these things to be said of themselves, if the Lord to whom this was truly said is accused of a crime, since the faith of the believers was not yet solidified.



<h2 id='tocuniq435'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) But Jesus said to them: Of course. Have you never read that from the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have perfected praise? How moderate is this statement, and how balanced is the response, not giving in to slander? He did not say what the Scribes wanted to hear, that children do good, to testify to me, nor did he say they are mistaken: they are children, you should forgive their age; but he brings forward an example from the eighth psalm, to strengthen the testimony of the Scriptures through the words of children, when the Lord is silent.



<h2 id='tocuniq436'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) And leaving them, he went out outside the city to Bethany, and he stayed there. He left the unbelievers and, leaving the city of opposition, he went to Bethany, which means house of obedience, foreshadowing at that time the calling of the gentiles, and he stayed there because he could not remain in Israel. This also should be understood, that he was of such great poverty and was not flattered by anyone, that in the greatest city he found no guest, no dwelling, but he lived in a small field with Lazarus and his sisters: for their village is Bethany.



<h2 id='tocuniq437'>(Vers. 18, seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 18 and following) But when he returned to the city in the morning, he was hungry. And seeing a fig tree by the road, he went to it and found nothing on it except leaves. And he said to it, 'May no fruit ever come from you again!' And immediately the fig tree withered. And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, 'How did the fig tree wither at once?' After the darkness of the night had dispersed, as the morning light shone and midday approached, during which the Lord was going to illuminate the world by means of his passion, when he returned to the city, he was hungry. Whether to reveal the truth of his human flesh or to hunger for the salvation of believers and to burn with incredulity towards the Jews. And when he saw a certain tree (which we understand to be the Synagogue and assembly of the Jews) by the road, for it had the Law and therefore it was by the road, because it did not believe in the way, he came to it, standing namely and immobile, and not having the feet of the Gospel: and he found nothing in it, except leaves alone, the noise of promises, Pharisaic traditions, and the ostentation of the Law, and the ornaments of words without any fruits of truth. And another evangelist says: For the time had not yet come (Mark 10:13); either because the time of the salvation of Israel had not yet come, since the Gentile people had not yet entered, or because the time of faith had passed, because, coming to him first, and rejected, it had passed to the nations. And he said to him: May no fruit ever be born from you, either forever or for eternity: for both αἰὼν (( Al. αἰῶνα)) in Greek means. And the little bed was dried up, which did not have the food that the hungry Lord desired. Likewise, the leaves withered, so that only the trunk remained, and with the branches broken, the root revived. If it wishes to believe in the last times, may the shoot of faith sprout, and may the Scripture be fulfilled, saying: 'There is hope for a tree.' (Job 14:7). However, according to the letter, the Lord, who was to suffer among the peoples and bear the scandal of the cross, had to strengthen the hearts of his disciples with the anticipation of a sign. And the disciples were amazed, saying: How did it wither immediately? Therefore, by the same power, could the Savior also dry up his enemies, unless he had awaited their salvation through repentance.

<h2 id='tocuniq438'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verse 21, 22.) And Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will happen. And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive. The dogs of the Gentiles bark against us in their volumes, which they have left as a memorial of their own impiety, asserting that the apostles did not have faith because they were not able to move mountains. To which we will respond, many signs were done by the Lord, according to the testimony of St. John the Evangelist, which were written down, the world could not contain them all (John 21:25). Not that the world could not contain the books, which it can, even though they are many, in one small chest or bookcase; but rather that the magnitude of the signs cannot be borne by miracles and unbelief. Therefore, we believe that the apostles did these things, but they were not written down so as not to give greater occasion to unbelievers to contradict. Otherwise, let us ask them whether they believe in these signs that are written about or not. And when we see them as unbelievers, we will consequently prove that they will not believe in greater things if they do not believe in smaller things. This is against them. But let us understand the devil, who is called corrupt mountain by the prophet, as we have said before, proud and boasting against his Creator. And when it possesses the soul of a man and is rooted in it, it can be transferred by the apostles and those who are similar to the apostles into the sea, that is, into salty, turbulent, and bitter places that have no sweetness of God. And it is read in the Psalms: We will not fear when the earth is troubled, and the mountains are carried into the heart of the sea (Ps. XLV, 2).

<h2 id='tocuniq439'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23.) And when he came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached him as he was teaching, saying, 'By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?' In different words, they construct the same accusation as before, when they said, 'He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of demons.' For when they say, 'By what authority are you doing these things?' they doubt the authority of God and want it to be understood that what he does is by the power of the devil. Moreover, they added: Who gave you this authority? They openly deny the Son of God, whom they consider to be not working by his own power, but by the power of others, to perform miracles.

<h2 id='tocuniq440'>(Vers. 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 24 onwards) But Jesus, answering, said to them: I will also ask you one question, which if you tell me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, whence was it? From heaven or from men? But they thought within themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven, he will say to us: Why then did you not believe him? But if we say, From men, we are afraid of the multitude: for all held John as a prophet. And answering Jesus, they said: We do not know. This is what is commonly said: A bad knot of a tree, a bad nail or wedge must be driven in. The Lord could have refuted the calumny of the tempters with an open response, but He wisely asks a question, so that they themselves, either by silence or by their answer, may be condemned. For if they had answered that the baptism of John was from heaven (as they cleverly handled in their malice), the consequent response would have been: Why then were you not baptized by John? If they had wanted to say that it was a human invention and had nothing divine, they feared the rebellion of the people. For all the crowds had received John's baptism in groups, and they held him as a prophet. Therefore, the most impious faction responded and, using the word of humility by which they claimed not to know, used it to plot deceit.

<h2 id='tocuniq441'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27) He also said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. They answered and said to him: We don't know. Then Jesus also replied to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. But the Truth cannot lie, and he said: Neither do I tell you. From this, he shows that they know but refuse to answer, and he knows but refuses to say, because they keep silent about what they know. And immediately he tells a parable that not only condemns their impiety, but also teaches that the kingdom of God will be given to the Gentiles.



<h2 id='tocuniq442'>(Vers. 28 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 28 and following) What do you think? A certain man had two sons; and going to the first, he said: Son, go today to work in my vineyard. But he, answering, said: I do not want to. Afterwards, however, moved by repentance, he went. Going to the second, he said similarly. But he, answering, said: Yes, sir, and he did not go. Which of the two did the will of the father? And they said to him: The first. Jesus said to them (Luke XV). Hi sunt duo filii, qui et in Lucae parabola describuntur, frugi et luxuriosus, et de quibus Zacharias propheta loquitur: Assumpsi mihi duas virgas: unam vocavi decorem, et alteram vocavi funiculum, et pavi gregem  (Zach. XI, 7) . Primo dicitur Gentilium populo per naturalis legis notitiam: Vade, et operare in vinea  mea: hoc est, quod tibi non vis fieri, alteri ne feceris  (Tob. IV) . Qui superbe respondit: Nolo. But afterwards, upon the arrival of the Savior, the works of repentance were done in the vineyard of God, and the insolence of speech was corrected by labor. However, the second son, who is the people of the Jews, replied to Moses: 'We will do everything that the Lord has spoken' (Exod. XXIV), but he did not go into the vineyard because, thinking himself the heir after the son of the household had been killed. But others do not consider it as a parable of the Gentiles and Jews, but rather of sinners and the righteous, as the Lord Himself later expounded on the matter.



Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.

<h2 id='tocuniq443'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32.) For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him. Now, which of the two did the will of his father?’ They said, ‘The first.’ Jesus said to them, ‘Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. Even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him.



<h2 id='tocuniq444'>(Vers. 33.)</h2>

(Verse 33.) Listen to another parable: There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants, and then went on a journey. This is what the Lord meant by the proverb: It is hard to kick against the goads (Acts 9:5). The chief priests and the elders of the people, who questioned the Lord, said to him, 'By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?' And they desired to attain wisdom in words, they are surpassed by their own skill; and they listen in parables, because they did not deserve to listen with an open face. This man, the head of the household, is the one who had two sons; and in another parable, he hired workers for his vineyard; who planted a vineyard, of which Isaiah speaks most fully in the Song, bringing it to a conclusion: The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel (Isaiah 5:7). And in the Psalm: You have brought a vine out of Egypt, he says, you have driven out the nations, and planted it (Psalm 80:9). And he surrounded her with a hedge, or with the walls of a city, or with the help of angels: and he dug into her a winepress, or an altar, or those things for pressing wine, which are noted in the title of three Psalms: the eightieth, and the eighty-third. And he built a tower: no doubt the temple, of which it is said through Micah: And you, O cloudy tower, daughter of Zion (Mic. 4:8). And he placed it for the farmers, whom elsewhere he called vineyard workers: who were hired at the first, third, sixth, ninth, and eleventh hour (Matt. 20). And he went on a journey: yes, not by a change of place; for how can God be absent where all things are fulfilled? And as it says through Jeremiah: I am a God who is near and not far away, says the Lord (Jeremiah 23:23). But he seems to be leaving the vineyard so as to leave the vine-dressers free will in their work.

<h2 id='tocuniq445'>(Vers. 34 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 34 and following) But when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive the fruits of it. And the vinedressers took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. And last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. We read the letter of Paul to the Hebrews (Heb. XI) ; and from it we learn in great detail the sufferings endured by the servants of the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq446'>(Vers. 37, 38.)</h2>

(Verse 37, 38.) But lastly, he sent his son to them, saying: They will respect my son. However, the farmers, upon seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and we shall have his inheritance. In the passage above, we read: Again, he sent other servants more than the previous ones, and they did the same to them. The patience of the householder is shown in that he sent them more frequently, in order to provoke the wicked tenants to repentance. But they treasured up wrath for themselves on the day of wrath (Rom. 2). Moreover, that which is joined: They fear for my son, he does not come from ignorance. For what does the head of the household not know, who in this place is understood as God the Father? But God is always said to be ambiguous, so that free will may be preserved for man. Let us ask Arius and Eunomius. Behold, the Father is said to be ignorant, and he tempers his judgement, and as far as you are concerned, he is proven to be lying. Whatever they may answer on behalf of the Father, let them understand it as being on behalf of the Son, who himself says that he does not know the day of consummation.



<h2 id='tocuniq447'>(Vers. 39.)</h2>

(Verse 39) And they apprehended him, cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. And the Apostle speaks, that Jesus was crucified outside the gate (Heb. 13). We can also understand it differently; that he was cast out of the vineyard, and there he was killed: so that when the gentiles received him, the vineyard would be given to others.

<h2 id='tocuniq448'>(Vers. 40, 41.)</h2>

(Verse 40, 41.) When therefore the Lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to those farmers? They say to him: He will destroy those wicked men and will lease out his vineyard to other farmers who will render to him the fruits in their seasons. The Lord asks them not because he doesn't know what they will answer, but in order to condemn them by their own response. And a vineyard has been leased to us, and it has been leased under the condition that we render to the Lord the fruits in their seasons, and we should know at all times what we must either say or do.



<h2 id='tocuniq449'>(Vers. 42.)</h2>

(Verse 42.) Jesus said to them: Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected, the same has become the head of the corner? This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes. (Psalm 118:22-23). Various parables and different teachings are woven into this story. For those whom he previously called workers, vine-dressers, and farmers, he now calls builders, that is, masons. Hence the Apostle says: You are God's field, you are God's building. (1 Corinthians 3:9). So just as bricklayers and vine-growers take possession of a vineyard, they also took possession of a stone, which they either place in the foundations, next to the architect Paul (Ibid.), or in the corner, to join together two walls, that is, both peoples (Ephesians 2), who were rejected by them, became the cornerstone. And this was done by the Lord, not by human strength, but by the power of God. Peter also confidently speaks of this stone of support: This stone, which was rejected by you builders, has become the cornerstone (1 Peter 2:7). And Isaiah said: Behold, I will send a chosen, precious, corner stone into the foundations of Zion: and he that believeth in him, shall not be confounded (Isa. II, 16).

<h2 id='tocuniq450'>(Vers. 43.)</h2>

(Verse 43.) Therefore I say to you, that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and it will be given to a nation producing its fruits. I have said many times that the kingdom of God is to be understood as the holy Scriptures, which the Lord took away from the Jews and gave to us, so that we may produce their fruits. This is the vineyard that is entrusted to the farmers and winegrowers, and those who do not work in it, having only the name of the Scriptures, will lose the fruits of the vineyard.

<h2 id='tocuniq451'>(Vers. 44.)</h2>

(Verse 44.) And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder. It is one thing to offend Christ through evil works, another to deny Him. Whoever is a sinner, yet believes in Him, falls indeed on the stone and is broken, but is not utterly crushed; for he is preserved through repentance for salvation. But on whomever the stone falls, that is, on whom the stone itself will crash down, and who completely denies Christ, it will grind him to powder, so that not even a shard remains, in which a little water could be poured.



<h2 id='tocuniq452'>(Vers. 45, 46.)</h2>

(Verse 45, 46.) And when the chief priests and Pharisees heard his parables, they realized that he was speaking about them. And they sought to arrest him, but they feared the crowds because they regarded him as a prophet. Though they had hard hearts and were dull in their disbelief and impiety towards the Son of God, they could not deny the clear accusations, and they understood that all of the Lord's judgments were directed against them. Therefore, they indeed wanted to kill him, but they feared the crowds because they regarded him as a prophet. The crowd is always fickle, and does not persist in a fixed will: it is like the waves, being carried back and forth by the force of different winds. They now venerate and worship him as if he were a prophet, but later they shout against him: Crucify him, crucify such a person (John 19:6).

<h2 id='tocuniq453'>(Chap. XXII.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 22—Verses 1, 2.) And Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying: The kingdom of heaven is like a king who made a marriage for his son. The Pharisees, understanding that these parables were about them, sought to seize him and kill him. Knowing their intention, the Lord rebuked them, undeterred by their rage, and without fear, so as to convict the sinners. This king who made a marriage for his son is the almighty God. But it signifies the union of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Church, which is gathered from both Jews and Gentiles.

<h2 id='tocuniq454'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(V. 3.) And he sent his servant to call the invited guests to the wedding, but they did not want to come. There is no doubt that it refers to Moses, through whom the Law was given to the invited guests. But if we read it in reference to the servants, as most copies have it, it should be understood as referring to the prophets, who were ignored by those invited through them.

<h2 id='tocuniq455'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

(Vers. 4, 5.) He sent other servants again, saying: Tell those who are invited: Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and fatted cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready: come to the wedding feast. But they disregarded him. The servants who were sent the second time are better understood as prophets than apostles, if the word 'servant' is written above. But if you read 'servants' in the same place, then the second servants should be understood as apostles. The prepared dinner, the oxen, and the slaughtered fatted cattle either describe the riches of the kingdom using a metaphor, so that the spiritual may be understood from the carnal, or certainly the greatness of doctrine and the richness of God's teaching can be perceived.



<h2 id='tocuniq456'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6) And they went away, some to their own village, and others to their business. The rest held his servants, and treating them with contempt, they killed them. Among those who do not accept the truth of the Gospel, there is much diversity. For those who were occupied with other matters and did not want to come are guilty of a lesser crime than those who, despite the invitation of the host, turned their affection into cruelty and mistreated or killed the king's servants. In this parable, the silence of the wedding guests and the deaths of the servants illustrate the contempt for the wedding feast.

<h2 id='tocuniq457'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) But when the king heard this, he was angry. Regarding what was said above: The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast and showed acts of mercy. The man's name was given, but now when it comes to vengeance, the man is silent and only the king is mentioned.

And having sent his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. The armies, or avenging angels, of whom it is written in the Psalms: He sent upon them a destroying angel (Psalm 77:49); or we may understand the Romans, under the leadership of Vespasian and Titus, who, having killed the Jewish people, burned the rebellious city.

<h2 id='tocuniq458'>(Vers. 8 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 8 and following) Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. Therefore, go to the street corners and invite to the wedding feast whoever you find.' So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, the bad and the good alike, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. There were no Gentiles on the streets, but at the exits of the streets. However, it is questioned how among those who were outside, some bad and good ones were found. The Apostle to the Romans discusses this place more fully ((al. added, saying)) (Rom. 2:14): that the Gentiles, who naturally do the things that are of the law, condemn the Jews who have not made the written law. Among the ethnic groups themselves, there is infinite diversity; since we know that some are prone to vices and inclined to evil, while others are dedicated to the virtues of honorable customs.

<h2 id='tocuniq459'>(Vers. 11, 12.)</h2>

(Verse 11, 12.) But the king entered to see the guests, and he saw there a man who was not wearing a wedding garment. And he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?' But he was speechless. Those who were invited to the wedding feast had filled it up from the hedges and corners and streets and various places. But later, when the king came in to see the guests at his feast (that is, those who were resting in his trust, so that on the day of judgment he could visit the guests and discern the merits of each one), he found one who was not wearing a wedding garment. This one, all those who are associated with wickedness are understood. But the wedding garment, the commandments of the Lord, and the works that are fulfilled from the law and the Gospel, make the clothing of the new man. Therefore, if anyone is found at the time of judgment not having the wedding garment, that is, the garment of the heavenly ((Al. celestial)) man; but having a polluted garment, that is, the old man's rags, he is immediately seized and it is said to him: Friend, how did you enter here? He calls his friend because he was invited to a wedding: he accuses him of impudence because he has stained the wedding with his dirty clothes. But he remained silent. For in that moment there will be no place for repentance, nor the opportunity to deny, when all the angels and the world itself are witnesses of sins.

<h2 id='tocuniq460'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) Then the king said to the servants: Bind his hands and feet and send him into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The hands and feet being bound, the weeping of the eyes, and the gnashing of teeth, signify the truth of the resurrection being tested. Or certainly, the hands and feet are bound so that they may not do evil and run to shed blood. In the weeping of the eyes and the gnashing of teeth, the intensity of the torments is shown metaphorically through the limbs of the body.



<h2 id='tocuniq461'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) For many are called, but few are chosen. This parable encompasses in a brief sentence: that in the work of the vineyard, in the building of the house, and in the wedding feast, the focus should be on the end rather than the beginning.

<h2 id='tocuniq462'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to trap him in his words. And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere, and teach the way of God in accordance with truth, and show deference to no one; for you do not regard people with partiality. Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to the emperor, or not?” Caesar Augustus had appointed Herod, the son of Antipater, a foreigner and a proselyte, as the king of the Jews, who would be in charge of collecting taxes and obeying the Roman rule. Therefore, the Pharisees sent their disciples along with the Herodians, that is, the soldiers of Herod, or those who were called Herodians by the Pharisees because they paid taxes to the Romans and were not devoted to divine worship. Some Latin speakers foolishly believed that the Herodians were those who believed Herod to be the Christ, but we never read this anywhere at all.



<h2 id='tocuniq463'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not care about anyone's opinion. For you do not show partiality to people. So tell us, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? This is a clever and deceitful question, designed to trap the one being questioned and force him to fear God more than Caesar, and say that taxes should not be paid, so that the Herodians listening will immediately arrest him for sedition against the Roman ruler.



<h2 id='tocuniq464'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said: Why do you tempt me, hypocrites? The first virtue of a respondent is to understand the minds of those who ask, and to call not disciples, but tempters. Therefore, a hypocrite is called someone who is one thing and pretends to be another, that is, someone who acts one way in action and another in words.

<h2 id='tocuniq465'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) Show me the coin of the census. And they offered him a denarius. Wisdom always acts wisely, so that its accusers are mainly confuted by their own words. Show me, he said, the denarius, that is, the kind of coin which was valued at ten coins and had the image of Caesar.

<h2 id='tocuniq466'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) And Jesus said to them, Whose image is this and superscription? Those who think that this question indicates ignorance on the part of the Savior, and not dispensation, let them learn from the present passage that Jesus could certainly know whose image was on the coin; but he asks in order to respond appropriately to their words.

<h2 id='tocuniq467'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) They said to Him, 'Caesar's.' Then He said to them, 'Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.' We cannot consider Augustus as Caesar, but Tiberius is understood to be his stepson, who succeeded him and under whom our Lord suffered. However, all the Roman emperors, from the first Caesar, who seized power, have been called Caesars. Furthermore, what He says, 'Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's,' that is, the tribute and money, and to God the things that are God's, let us understand as tithes, first fruits, offerings, and sacrifices, just as He Himself paid taxes for Himself and Peter (Matthew 17). And He rendered to God the things that are God's, doing the will of the Father (John 6).



<h2 id='tocuniq468'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22) And those who listened were amazed. They, who should have believed in such wisdom, were amazed that their cunning for plotting had found no opportunity.

And having left him, they departed. Bringing back unfaithfulness along with a miracle.

<h2 id='tocuniq469'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) On that day the Sadducees approached him, who say that there is no resurrection. There were two sects among the Jews: the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The Pharisees prioritized the righteousness of traditions and observances, which they call 'second law', and this is why they were referred to as 'separated' from the people. However, the Sadducees, who are referred to as 'just', claimed for themselves what they were not: while the former believed in the resurrection of the body and soul and confessed angels and spirits, the Sadducees denied all of these (according to the Acts of the Apostles). These are two houses, of which Isaiah teaches more clearly that they are causes of offense in the stumbling block (Isaiah 8).

<h2 id='tocuniq470'>(Vers. 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 24 seqq.) And they asked him, saying: Master, Moses said: If any man die, having a wife, and he have no children, that his brother should take her to wife, and raise up seed to his brother. Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, having taken a wife, died; and, not having issue, left his wife to his brother. In like manner the second and the third, unto the seventh. And last of all the woman died also. Those who did not believe in the resurrection of the body and thought that the soul perished with the body rightly invent such a fable, which demonstrates their madness in asserting the resurrection of the dead. However, it is possible that this might actually happen in their nation at some point.

<h2 id='tocuniq471'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28) Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For they all had her. They oppose the absurdity of the story in order to deny the truth of the resurrection.

<h2 id='tocuniq472'>(Vers. 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29.) But Jesus, answering, said to them: You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. Therefore, they err because they do not know the Scriptures, and because they are ignorant of the Scriptures, they consequently do not know the power of God, that is, Christ, who is the power of God and the wisdom of God (I Cor. 1).

<h2 id='tocuniq473'>(Vers. 30.)</h2>

(Verse 30) For in the resurrection neither do they marry, nor are they given in marriage; but they are as the angels of God in heaven. The Latin custom does not correspond to the Greek idiom. For to marry is properly said of women, and to take wives of men; but let us simply understand the statement, that to marry is written of men, and to be given in marriage of women. If in the resurrection they do not marry, nor are they given in marriage, then the bodies that are able to marry and be given in marriage will rise again. For no one indeed says about a stone and a tree, and these things which do not have reproductive organs, that they do not marry, nor are they married; but about those things which can marry, they do not marry in a different way. But what is brought forth: But they are like the angels of God in heaven. A spiritual conversation is promised.

<h2 id='tocuniq474'>(Vers. 31 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 31 seqq.) But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken by God, saying to you: I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob: God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. And when the crowds heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. To prove the truth of the resurrection, he could have used many other more obvious examples, among which is: The dead will be raised up, and those who are in the graves will rise again (Isaiah 26:19). And in another place: Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake: some unto everlasting life, and others unto shame and everlasting contempt (Dan. XII, 2). Therefore, it is asked what the Lord intended by this testimony, which seems ambiguous or not sufficiently related to the truth of the resurrection: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and as if having proclaimed this, he proved what he wanted by immediately adding: God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Those who also surrounded the turmoil, knowing the mystery, were amazed at his teaching and answers. We have already said above that the Sadducees, confessing neither angel, nor spirit, nor resurrection of bodies, also preached the destruction of souls. These accepted only the five books of Moses, rejecting the prophecies of the prophets. Therefore, it was foolish to present testimonies whose authority they did not follow. Furthermore, in order to prove the eternal nature of souls, he presents the example of Moses: 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' (Exodus 3:6). And immediately he deduces: 'God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,' so that when he has proven that souls continue to exist after death (for it could not be that God would be their God if they did not exist at all), the resurrection of the bodies, which have carried out good or evil deeds along with the souls, would consequently be introduced. In the final part of the first Epistle to the Corinthians, the apostle Paul expands on this topic more fully (1 Cor. XV).

<h2 id='tocuniq475'>(Vers. 34 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 34 and following) But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him: "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?" And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. In his two commands, the whole law and the prophets hang. What we read about Herod and Pontius Pilate, that they conspired in the death of the Lord, we also see now concerning the Pharisees and the Sadducees, who are opposed to each other, but agree with the same mind in testing Jesus. Therefore, those who had already been confuted in the display of the coin and had seen the faction of the opposing party undermined, should have been warned by example not to plot further snares: but malice and envy nourish audacity. One of the legal experts, not desiring to not know but attempting, asks whether the one being questioned knew what was being asked, what the greater commandment is: not asking about the commandments, but what the first and great commandment is; so that when all that God has commanded is great: whatever he may answer, he may have an opportunity to slander, asserting that something else is great among many. Therefore, whoever knows and asks not by desire to learn, but by the desire to know, whether the one who is going to respond knows, approaches in the likeness of the Pharisees, not as a disciple, but as a tempter.

<h2 id='tocuniq477'>(Vers. 41 seqq.)</h2>

(verses 41 onwards) But when the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them, saying, 'What do you think about the Christ, whose son is he?' They said to him, 'David.' He said to them, 'How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying, "The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?" If David then calls him Lord, how is he his son?' Those who had gathered together to test Jesus and tried to capture the truth through deceitful questioning, gave an opportunity for their own refutation. They are asked (or, it is asked) about Christ whose son he is. The questioning of Jesus benefits us even today against the Jews. And indeed those who confess that Christ is to come assert that he is a simple man and a holy man from the lineage of David. Let us therefore question those who are taught by the Lord: if he is a simple man and only a son of David, how does David call him his Lord? Not by uncertain error or personal will, but in the Holy Spirit (or, but in the Holy Spirit, he is silent). The testimony, however, which he presents, is taken from the one hundred and ninth Psalm. Therefore, David is called Lord, not according to what he was born, but according to what he always was, born from the Father, surpassing his own Father in the flesh. The Jews, in order to evade the truth of the question, invent many idle things, asserting that the native of Abraham, whose son was Damascus Eliezer, and that the psalm was written from that person's perspective, in which the Lord God said to his lord, Abraham, after the slaughter of the five kings: Sit at my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool. (Genesis 14). Whom should we ask: How did God say to Abraham these things that follow: With you is the beginning in the day of your power, in the splendors of the saints, I have begotten you before Lucifer; and: The Lord has sworn, and will not regret it; you are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek? And we should try to answer how Abraham was born before Lucifer and was a priest according to the order of Melchizedek: regarding whom Melchizedek offered bread and wine, and from whom he received tithes of the spoils.



<h2 id='tocuniq478'>(Vers. 46.)</h2>

(Verse 46) And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask him any more questions. The Pharisees and Sadducees, seeking an opportunity to accuse him, and to find some word by which they could trap him, because they were confounded by his teachings, no longer questioned him, but were clearly apprehended and handed over to the Roman authorities. From this we understand that the poisons of envy can indeed be overcome, but it is difficult for them to rest.



<h2 id='tocuniq479'>(Chap. XXIII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 23, Verses 1 and following.) Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples, saying: The scribes and Pharisees have seated themselves on the chair of Moses. Therefore, whatever they tell you, observe and do it, but do not do their works. For they speak, but do not practice. What is gentler, what is kinder than the Lord? He is tempted by the Pharisees, their plots are crushed, and according to the Psalmist: The arrows of little children have become their wounds (Psalm 63:8). And nevertheless, because of their priesthood and the dignity of their office, he urges the people to submit to them, considering not their works, but their teaching. But when He says, 'The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat,' He shows that the seat represents the teaching of the Law. Therefore, we must also understand the teaching in the passages that say, 'He did not sit on the throne of pestilence' (Psalm 1:1) and 'He overturned the seats of those selling doves' (Matthew 21:12; Mark 11:15).

<h2 id='tocuniq480'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) However, they bind heavy and burdensome loads and lay them on people's shoulders; but they themselves are unwilling to move them with their finger. This applies generally to all teachers who command heavy things but do not do smaller things. However, it should be noted that both the shoulders, the finger, the burdens, and the chains with which the burdens are bound should be understood spiritually.

<h2 id='tocuniq481'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) All their works they do to be seen by others. Therefore, whoever does anything to be seen by others, is a scribe and a Pharisee.

<h2 id='tocuniq482'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) For they enlarge their phylacteries and magnify their fringes. They love the places of honor at banquets, the chief seats in the synagogues, greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called Rabbi by men. Woe to us, miserable ones, to whom the vices of the Pharisees have been passed on. When the Lord gave the commandments of the Law through Moses, He added at the end: Bind them upon your hand, and they shall be before your eyes (Deut. VI, 8). And the meaning is: Let my precepts be in your hand, so that they may be fulfilled in action: let them be before your eyes, so that day and night you may meditate on them. The Pharisees, by misinterpreting this, wrote the Ten Commandments of Moses on scrolls, folding them up and binding them on their foreheads, making them like a crown on their heads so that they would always be before their eyes. This is still done today by the Indians, Persians, and Babylonians, and those who do this are considered religious among the people. Moses also commanded (Num. XV) that the Israelite people should make blue tassels on the corners of their garments, to distinguish them as the chosen people, just as circumcision is a sign for the Jewish people's bodies, so their clothing should have some distinction. Superstitious teachers, seeking popular applause, and pursuing gains from women, made large phylacteries and bound the sharpest thorns in them so that, as they walked or sat, they would be punctured and, as it were, be drawn by this admonition to the duties of the Lord and to the ministries of his service. Therefore, because the Lord had said that they do all their works to be seen by men, which he had accused in general, he now divides them into parts. Those little tablets of the Decalogue were called phylacteries, which whoever had them would have as a safeguard and a reminder of themselves: the Pharisees not understanding that these things should be carried in the heart, not on the body; otherwise, even cabinets and chests have books, but do not have knowledge of God. This is done among us by superstitious women, in little Gospels, and in the wood of the cross, and in similar things (which indeed they have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge). (Romans 10) Even today, they strain out a gnat and swallow a camel (Below, in the same place). Such was the fringe, small and short, from the Law and the precepts, which was touched by the woman who was flowing with blood, in the cloak of the Lord (Luke 8, above). But she was not moved by the superstitious thorns of the Pharisees; rather, she was healed by touching it. And when they excessively enlarge their phylacteries and make large fringes, seeking glory from men, they are accused in the rest, why they seek the first places at dinners, and the first seats in synagogues; and in public they cut throats and glory; and they are called Rabbi by men, which is said in Latin language, teacher. Denique sequitur:

<h2 id='tocuniq483'>(Vers. 8 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 8 onwards) But you must not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, who is in heaven. Nor are you to be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Christ. But the greatest among you shall be your servant. Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted. Neither be called masters; for One is your Master, that is, Christ. And do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven. Father, because from Him all things are. Teacher, because through Him all things: or because through the dispensation of His flesh, we all are reconciled to God. It is asked why the Apostle, the teacher of the Gentiles, declared himself to be against this precept (2 Corinthians 5; Colossians 1); or how, in the common language, especially in the monasteries of Palestine and Egypt, they call each other Fathers? This is resolved as follows: It is one thing to be a father or a teacher by nature, another thing by indulgence. If we call someone our father, we show honor to their age, not that they are the author of our life. Likewise, a teacher is called such from the fellowship of a true teacher. And to avoid endless repetition, just as one God and one Son do not prejudice others from being called gods and sons by adoption, so one father and one teacher do not prejudice others from being called fathers and teachers in an abusive manner.

<h2 id='tocuniq484'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Ver. 13, 14.) But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive the greater condemnation. The scribes and Pharisees have knowledge of the Law and the Prophets, and they know that Christ is the Son of God; they are not ignorant that He was born of a Virgin. But while they seek to prey on the subject people, they themselves do not enter the kingdom of heaven, nor do they allow those who could enter to do so. This is what the Prophet Hosea accuses: The priests have hidden the way, they have murdered Shechem (Hosea 6:9). And again: The priests have not said, 'Where is the Lord?' (Hosea 4). Indeed, every teacher who scandalizes his disciples with evil deeds shuts the kingdom of heaven before them.

<h2 id='tocuniq485'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel over sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves. We do not serve with the same zeal with which we seek. Scribes and Pharisees, while traversing the whole world for the sake of gains or different profits to be sought both by attracting disciples and by the image of holiness, they had the intention to make a proselyte, that is, a stranger and uncircumcised, mix with the people of God. But he, who before, while he was an ethnick, simply wandered, and was once the son of Gehenna, seeing the vices of the masters, and understanding to destroy them by works, what they were teaching by words, returns to his vomit: and becoming a gentile, as if a transgressor, he will be worthy of a greater punishment. But he is called the son of Gehenna, just as the son of perdition, and the son of this age. For each one is called the son of him whose works he does.



<h2 id='tocuniq486'>(Vers. 16 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 16 onwards) Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple is nothing, but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is bound by his oath.' Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold? And, 'Whoever swears by the altar is nothing, but whoever swears by the gift that is on it is obligated.' Blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift? Therefore, whoever swears on the altar, swears on it and on all things that are above it. And whoever swears in the temple, swears in it and in him who dwells in it. And whoever swears in heaven, swears on the throne of God and on him who sits on it. Above, as it seemed to us, we have explained what the tradition of the Pharisees meant, saying: Whatever gift is from me will benefit you: now the double tradition of the Pharisees, enticing to one occasion of greed, is condemned, so that they may be proved to do everything for gain and not for the fear of God. For just as in the phylacteries and fringes, by enlarged expectations of holiness, it was trying to capture glory, and was seeking gains through the opportunity of glory, so another tradition found fault with the teachers of impiety. If anyone were to swear in the temple during a dispute, or in some argument, or in a doubtful case, and later be convicted of lying, they were not held accountable for the crime. But if they were to swear on gold and money, which was offered to the priests in the temple, they were immediately compelled to fulfill what they had sworn. Again: If anyone swore upon the altar, no one held him guilty of perjury; but if he swore falsely on a gift, or on offerings, that is, on victims and on fine flour and on the rest, which are offered to God upon the altar, these were most diligently sought after. Therefore, the Lord reproached them both for foolishness and deceit, because the temple is much greater than the gold that is sanctified by the temple, and the altar is greater than the offerings that are sanctified by the altar. But they did it not out of fear of God, but out of greed for riches.

<h2 id='tocuniq487'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23.) Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. Many precepts are given in the law that foreshadow future events. But others are open, according to the Psalmist, saying: The commandment of the Lord is clear, enlightening the eyes (Psalm 19:8), which are immediately to be desired. For example, thou shalt not commit adultery: thou shalt not steal: thou shalt not bear false witness, etc. But the Pharisees, because the Lord had commanded (let us for the present leave out the mystical understanding) tithes to be offered in the temple for the maintenance of the priests and Levites, whose portion was the Lord’s, were studious in this one thing, that the commands should be observed: but as to the other matters, whether a man should do them or not, they made little account. And from this chapter it accuses them of greed, because they eagerly demand tithes even of cheap vegetables, and neglect justice in the handling of business disputes, and mercy towards the poor, orphans, and widows, and faith in God, which are great.

<h2 id='tocuniq488'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) Blind leaders, straining out a gnat but swallowing a camel. I believe the camel refers to the understanding of the present situation, the magnitude of the teachings, judgment, mercy, and faith. The gnat, on the other hand, represents the tithing of mint, dill, cumin, and other cheap herbs. We devour and neglect these great commandments of God, while showing diligence in matters of religion that bring profit and have little importance.



<h2 id='tocuniq489'>(Vers. 25, 26.)</h2>

(Verse 25, 26.) Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and impurity. Blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and the plate, so that the outside also may be clean. In different words, with the same meaning as above, Jesus accuses the Pharisees of hypocrisy and deceit, because they pretend one thing to others outwardly, but do something different at home. Not that their superstition delayed them in the cup and dish; but that they displayed holiness to others, in their attire, in their speech, in their phylacteries, in the fringes, in the length of their prayers, and other such things, while internally they were full of the filth of vices.

<h2 id='tocuniq490'>(Vers. 27, 28.)</h2>

(Verse 27, 28.) Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful to people, but inside are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness. So you also outwardly appear righteous to people, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness. Just as he had shown with the cup and dish, that they were clean on the outside but dirty on the inside, he now repeats the same example with tombs: how tombs are whitewashed on the outside and decorated with marble and gold and different colors, but inside they are full of dead people's bones. This is how the perverse teachers, who teach one thing and do another, demonstrate cleanliness with their clothing and humility of speech, but inside they are full of all uncleanness and desire. Finally, this expresses more clearly the very thing itself, inferring: Thus you indeed appear just to men on the outside: but within, you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

<h2 id='tocuniq491'>(Vers. 29 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 29 onwards) Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous, and you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' Thus you bear witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. In the most skillful syllogism, they are proven to be the offspring of murderers, while they themselves, by the opinion of goodness and glory among the people, build tombs for the prophets whom their forefathers killed, and they say, 'If we had lived in that time, we would not have done what our fathers did.' However, even if they do not say it in words, they speak through their actions by ambitiously and magnificently building monuments to the slain, whom they do not deny were killed by their forefathers.

And you, fulfill the measure of your fathers. Having proven with the previous words that they were the children of murderers and those who killed the prophets, he now concludes what he wanted and puts forth the final part of the syllogism. And you, fulfill the measure of your fathers. What was lacking for them, you complete. They killed the servants, you crucify the Lord. They killed the prophets, you kill him who was preached by the prophets.

<h2 id='tocuniq492'>(Vers. 33.)</h2>

(v. 33) Serpents, ((Al. additur et)) offspring of vipers, how can you escape the judgment of Gehenna? This very thing John the Baptist also said (Luke III). Therefore, just as vipers give birth to vipers, so you, he says, are born of murderers fathers, are murderers.

<h2 id='tocuniq493'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town. And so upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation. At the same time, observe the Apostle writing to the Corinthians (1 Cor. VII), that there are various gifts of the disciples of Christ; some are prophets, who preach the coming things; some are wise, who know when they should speak; some are scribes, most learned in the Law, from whom Stephen was stoned, Paul was killed, Peter was crucified, the disciples were whipped in the Acts of the Apostles: and they were persecuted from city to city; driven out of Judea, so that they might migrate to the Gentile people.



<h2 id='tocuniq494'>(Vers. 35, 36.)</h2>

(Verses 35, 36.) So that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. Truly I tell you, all these things will come upon this generation. Regarding Abel, there is no doubt that he is the one whom his brother Cain killed. But the righteousness of Zechariah is not only confirmed now by the judgment of the Lord, but also by the testimony of Genesis (Gen. IV), where the offerings accepted by God are narrated. We inquire who this Zacharias son of Barachiah is, because we have read of many Zachariases. And so that no opportunity for error might be given, it has been added: whom you have killed between the temple and the altar. Different things are read in different places, and I ought to present the opinions of different authors. Some say that it is Zacharias son of Barachiah, who is the eleventh among the twelve prophets, and that the name of the father agrees with him; but where he was killed between the temple and the altar, Scripture does not speak: especially since during his time there were hardly any ruins of the temple. Some suggest that Zacharias is the father of John, approving this based on certain apocryphal dreams, stating that he was killed because he preached the coming of the Savior. However, since this does not have authority from the Scriptures, it is dismissed with the same ease with which it is proven. Others believe this Zacharias to be the one who was killed by King Joash of Judah between the temple and the altar, as the history of the Kings narrates. But it should be noted that this Zacharias is not the son of Barachiah, but the son of Jehoiada the priest. And Scripture also reports: He did not remember the kindness Joash, his father, had shown him (2 Chronicles 24:22). Therefore, if we consider Zachariah and the place where he was killed, we wonder why he is called the son of Barachiah and not Joiada. Barachiah in our language means blessed by the Lord, and the righteousness of the priest Joiada is demonstrated in the Hebrew language. In the Gospel used by the Nazarenes, we find written that he is the son of Joiada instead of Barachiah. The simpler brethren among the ruins of the temple and the altar, or at the exits of the gates that lead to Siloam, pointing to the red stones, consider them to be polluted with the blood of Zechariah. We do not condemn the error that stems from hatred of the Jews and devotion to the faith. Let us briefly explain why the blood of the righteous Abel to the son of Barachiah is sought from that generation, even though neither of them killed him. The rule of the Scriptures is to present two generations, of the good or the evil, that is, one for each individual. Let us take examples of good things: Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord? or who shall rest in his holy mountain? (Ps. 23:3) And when he has described those who are going to ascend into the mountain of the Lord, who were of different ages, afterward he adds: This is the generation of them that seek the Lord, that seek the face of the God of Jacob. And in another place concerning all the saints: The generation of the righteous shall be blessed. (Ps. 112:2) But concerning the wicked, as in the present place: The generation of vipers. And all things will be required from this generation. And in Ezekiel, when he described the sins of the land, the prophetic word added: If Noah, and Job, and Daniel were found there, I will not forgive the sins of that land (Ezek. 14:14): All the righteous who would be like them in virtues, by Noah and Job and Daniel, wanting to be understood. Therefore, those who have done similar things to Cain and Joash against the apostles are referred to as being from the same generation.



<h2 id='tocuniq495'>(Vers. 37.)</h2>

(Verse 37.) Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you: how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling! Jerusalem, He calls not the stones and buildings of the city, but the inhabitants, whom He mourns for with a fatherly affection, as we also read in another place that He wept upon seeing her (Luke 19). And in saying, how often I have longed to gather your children together, He testifies that all the prophets sent by Himself were rejected. We also read in the song of Deuteronomy the image of a chicken gathering its chicks under its wings: As an eagle protects its nest and desires its young, spreading its wings, it receives and carries them on its feathers (Deut. XXXII, 11).

<h2 id='tocuniq496'>(Vers. 38.)</h2>

Verse 38. Behold, your house shall be left desolate. This very thing Jeremiah had already said in the person of Jeremiah: I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my inheritance: my inheritance is become to me as a lion in the forest. We see with our eyes the house of the Jews left desolate, that is, that temple which shone more brightly, because it lost its inhabitant Christ, and, desiring to seize the inheritance, killed the heir.



<h2 id='tocuniq497'>(Vers. 39.)</h2>

(Verse 39) For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' He is speaking to Jerusalem and to the people of Judaea. However, this verse, in which even infants and nursing babies used at the entrance of the Lord's Savior in Jerusalem, when they said, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, hosanna in the highest,' is taken from the 117th psalm, which clearly is written about the coming of the Lord. And what he says, he wants this to be understood: Unless you repent (Luke 13), and confess that I am the one about whom the Prophets sang, the Son of the almighty Father, you will not see my face. The Jews have been given a time of repentance: let them confess the blessed one who comes in the name of the Lord, and let them contemplate the face of Christ.

<h2 id='tocuniq498'>(Chap. XXIV.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 24 - Verses 1, 2.) And Jesus went out of the temple and was going on his way. And his disciples came to show him the buildings of the temple. But he answered and said to them: Do you see all these things? Amen I say to you: there shall not be left here a stone upon a stone, that shall not be destroyed. According to the manifest sense of the story, when the Lord departed from the temple, all the buildings of the law, and the composition of the commandments, were so destroyed that nothing could be fulfilled by the Jews; and with the head removed, all the members fight among themselves.



<h2 id='tocuniq499'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(Vers. 3, 4.) But while he was sitting on the Mount of Olives,    the disciples came to him privately, saying: Tell us, when will these things be,    and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age? And Jesus    answered them, saying: See that no one deceives you. He sits on the Mount of    Olives, where the true light of knowledge was born, and the disciples come to    him privately, who desired to know the mysteries and revelations of the future,    and they ask three things: When will Jerusalem be destroyed; when will Christ    come; when will the end of the age be.



<h2 id='tocuniq500'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) For many will come in my name, saying: I am the Christ, and they will deceive many. One of them is Simon the Samaritan, whom we read about in the Acts of the Apostles, who claimed to be a great power of God (Acts 8). Leaving these things aside, he also wrote among other things in his own volumes: I am the word of God, I am beautiful, I am the Paraclete, I am omnipotent, I am all things of God. But even the apostle John speaks in his epistle: You have heard that the Antichrist is coming, now many antichrists are already here (1 John 2:18). I believe that all heresiarchs are Antichrists, and they teach under the name of Christ those things which are contrary to Christ. It is not surprising if we see some being led astray by them, since the Lord has said: And many will be led astray.

<h2 id='tocuniq501'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) For you will hear of battles and rumors of battles: see that you are not troubled. For these things must happen; but the end is not yet. Therefore, when we see these things happening, let us not think that the day of judgment is imminent, but that it is reserved for that time, whose sign is clearly set forth in the following events.

<h2 id='tocuniq502'>(Vers. 7, 8.)</h2>

(Verses 7, 8.) For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be pestilences and famines, and earthquakes in various places. But all these things are the beginnings of sorrows. I do not doubt that these things indeed shall come to pass literally as they are written. But it seems to me that the kingdom against kingdom and their pestilence, whose speech spreads like cancer (2 Timothy 2), and the famine to hear the word of God, and the commotion of the whole earth, and the separation from true faith, are more understood in heretics who fight against each other, making victory for the Church. But what he said: These things, however, are the beginnings of sorrows, are better translated as birth pains, so that it may be understood as a kind of conception of the coming of the Antichrist, not as childbirth.

<h2 id='tocuniq503'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(V. 9.) Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. The apostles are a representation of all believers, not that the apostles themselves will be found in physical form at that time.

<h2 id='tocuniq504'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>

(Verse 12, 13.) And since iniquity will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who perseveres to the end, he will be saved. He did not deny the faith of all, but of many. For many are called, but few are chosen. For in the apostles and those like them, charity will remain, of which it is written: 'Many waters cannot quench love' (Song of Solomon 8:7). And even Paul himself said: 'Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?' tribulation, or distress, or famine (Rom. VIII, 35)? and so on.

<h2 id='tocuniq505'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) And this Gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world, as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come. The sign of the Lord's coming is the preaching of the Gospel in the whole world, so that no one may be without excuse; which has either already been fulfilled, or is about to be fulfilled very soon. For I do not think that any nation remains which does not know the name of Christ. And although it may not have had preachers, it cannot ignore the expectation of faith from neighboring nations.



<h2 id='tocuniq506'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) When therefore you shall see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place: he that readeth, let him understand. When we are called to understanding, it is shown to be a mystical happening. We read in Daniel in this way: And in the middle of the week, sacrifice and oblation shall be taken away: and in the temple shall be the abomination of desolation: and the desolation shall continue even to the consummation, and to the end. The apostle speaks about this (II Thess. II): that the man of sin and the adversary will be exalted against everything that is called God and worshiped, so that he dares to stand in the temple of God and show himself to be God, whose coming is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, and destroys those who do not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. It can be understood either simply or of the Antichrist, or of the image of Caesar, which Pilate placed in the temple, or of the equestrian statue of Hadrian, which stood in the holy of holies until the present day. Abominatio quoque, secundum veterem Scripturam, idolum nuncupatur; et idcirco additur, desolationis; quod in desolato templo atque destructo idolum positum sit.

<h2 id='tocuniq507'>(Vers. 16 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 16 onwards) Then those who are in Judea, let them flee to the mountains; and those who are on the roof, let them not come down to take anything from their house; and those who are in the field, let them not turn back to take their cloak. The abomination of desolation can be understood, and every perverse teaching; when we see it standing in the holy place, that is, in the Church, and proclaiming itself as God, we must flee from Judea to the mountains, that is, leaving behind the letter of the law and Jewish corruption, and approach the eternal mountains, from which God wonderfully enlightens (Psalm 75); and be on the roof and in the inner room, where the fiery darts of the devil cannot reach: neither coming down and taking anything from the former way of life: nor turning back are they to seek; but rather to sow in the field of spiritual Scriptures, so that we may bear fruit from it. Neither to take off the other tunic, which the apostles are forbidden to have. On this subject, that is, on the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by the prophet Daniel, Porphyry blasphemed against us in the thirteenth volume of his work, while standing in a holy place. To him, Eusebius of Caesarea, the bishop, responded in three volumes: the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth. Apollinaris ((also known as Apollinarius)) also wrote extensively, and attempted to discuss in one chapter what has been disputed in so many thousands of verses.



<h2 id='tocuniq508'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) But woe to those who are pregnant and nursing in those days. Woe to those souls who have not brought forth their offspring to perfect manhood, but have the beginnings of faith, that they should need the nourishment of masters. This can also be said, that in the persecution of Antichrist, or the Roman captivity, those who are pregnant and nursing, burdened with the weight of their wombs and their children, were unable to make an easy escape.

<h2 id='tocuniq509'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20.) Pray, however, that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. If we wish to receive the captivity of Jerusalem, when it was captured by Titus and Vespasian, they ought to pray that their flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath; for in the former, the harshness of the cold prevents them from going to the desolate places and hiding in the mountains and deserts; in the latter, it is either a violation of the Law if they wish to flee, or imminent death if they remain. But if the end of the world is understood, this commands us, that our faith may not grow cold and our love for Christ may not grow dim, nor may we become idle in the work of God, languishing in the virtues of the Sabbath.

<h2 id='tocuniq510'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) And unless those days had been shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. The shortened days, not according to the delusions of some (who think that the moments of time can be changed; and do not remember that writing: Your ordinance endures  (Ps. CXVIII, 91)), but we should understand it according to the quality of time, that is, the days are shortened not in measure, but in number; just as in the blessing it is said; I will satisfy him with long life  (Ps. XC); so now the shortened days should be understood: lest the delay of time shake the faith of the believers.



<h2 id='tocuniq511'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23.) Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There!' do not believe it. Many leaders arose during the time of the Jewish captivity who claimed to be the Christ, to the extent that there were three factions inside the besieged Romans. But the end of the world is better understood.

<h2 id='tocuniq512'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will perform great signs and wonders, so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect. Behold, I have told you beforehand. There are three ways, as I have already said, in which this may be interpreted: either concerning the time of the siege of Rome, or concerning the end of the world, or concerning the struggle of heretics against the Church and similar antichrists, who under the guise of false knowledge fight against Christ.



<h2 id='tocuniq513'>(Vers. 25, 26.)</h2>

(Verses 25, 26.) So if they say to you, 'Look, he is in the wilderness,' do not go out; 'Look, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. If someone promises you that Christ is staying in the wilderness of the Gentiles and philosophers' doctrine, or in the inner rooms of heretics who promise the secrets of God, do not go out, do not believe it; or (because during times of persecution and distress false prophets always find a place for deception) if someone wants to boast under the name of Christ, do not immediately give them your trust.



<h2 id='tocuniq514'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) For as the lightning comes from the east and shines even to the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. Do not go out, do not believe that the Son of man is in the deserts of the nations or in the inner chambers of heretics; but rather that from the east even unto the west, his faith may shine forth in the Catholic Churches. It must also be said that the second coming of the Savior will not be in humility as before, but in glory to be shown. It is foolish, therefore, to seek him in a small or hidden place, who is the light of the whole world.

<h2 id='tocuniq515'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28.) Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together. From the natural example that we see every day, we are instructed by the sacrament of Christ. Eagles and vultures are also said to sense corpses even across the seas, and to gather for such food. Therefore, if irrational birds with their natural sense can feel a small corpse wherever it lies, separated by such vast distances of land and the waves of the sea: how much more should we and the whole multitude of believers hasten to him, whose lightning comes from the East and appears even to the West! But we can understand the body, that is, the corpse, which is more significantly called cadaver in Latin, as a representation of the passion of Christ, in which we are called to participate. So whenever it is read in the Scriptures, let us gather and through it, come to the Word of God, as it is written: They have pierced my hands and feet (Ps. 22:17). And in Isaiah: Like a sheep being led to the slaughter (Isa. 53:7). And similar things can be found in other passages. But the holy ones are called eagles, to whom youth is renewed like the eagles; and they who grow feathers like Isaiah, and assume wings, so as to come to Christ's passion.

<h2 id='tocuniq516'>(Vers. 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29.) But immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. The sun and the moon will be darkened and will not give their light; and the other stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken, not by a diminishing of light (otherwise we read that the sun will have sevenfold light (Ibid. XXX)), but because all things will be dark to the sight compared to true light. Therefore, if that sun, which now shines throughout the whole world, and the moon, which is the next luminary, and the stars, which are kindled for the solace of the night, and all the powers (which we understand to be the multitudes of angels) shall be regarded as darkness in the coming of Christ, let the pride of those who, thinking themselves saints, do not fear the presence of judgment, be cast down.

<h2 id='tocuniq517'>(Vers. 30.)</h2>

(Verse 30) And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven. Let us understand this sign, either as the cross, so that the Jews may see the one they crucified (according to Zechariah (Zech. XII) and John (John XIX)); or as the banner of triumphant victory.

And then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. Those who did not have citizenship in heaven will mourn, but they are written in the earth.

<h2 id='tocuniq518'>(Vers. 31.)</h2>

(Ver. 31.) And He will send His angels with a trumpet and a loud voice; and they will gather His chosen ones from the four winds, from the highest heavens to their ends. The Apostle speaks of this trumpet in I Corinthians XV; I Thessalonians IV: and we read in the Apocalypse of John (Apocalypse VIII): and in the Old Testament (Numbers X), we are instructed to make trumpets of gold, silver, and bronze, so that the lofty mysteries of doctrine may resound.



<h2 id='tocuniq519'>(Vers. 32, 33.)</h2>

(Verse 32, 33.) But learn a parable from the fig tree: when its branch is already tender and the leaves have sprouted, you know that summer is near. So also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors. Under the example of the tree, he taught the coming of the consummation. How, he says, when the twigs of the fig tree become tender and a bud comes forth into a flower, and the bark brings forth leaves, you understand the coming of summer, and the entrance of the west winds and spring: so when you see all these things that have been written, do not think that the consummation of the world is already here, but rather like some preludes and forerunners coming, to show that it is near and at the doors.



<h2 id='tocuniq520'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34) Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen. Above, we mentioned the generations of the righteous and, on the contrary, the wicked being separate. Therefore, it either signifies all types of people or specifically the Jews.

<h2 id='tocuniq521'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Verse 35.) Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. Heaven and earth will pass away by change, not by their destruction: otherwise, how will the sun be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall, if the heaven in which these things are, and the earth, do not exist?

<h2 id='tocuniq522'>(Vers. 36.)</h2>

(Ver. 36.) But about that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, except the Father alone. In some Latin manuscripts, it is added, not even the Son: since in Greek and especially in the exemplars of Adamantius and Pierius, this is not found written, but because it is read in some, it seems worthy of discussion. Arius and Eunomius rejoice, as if the ignorance of the teacher is the glory of the disciples, and they say: One who knows and one who is ignorant cannot be equal. Against whom are these things to be said briefly: When Jesus has done all things, that is, the Word of God: For all things were made through him, and without him was made nothing (John 1:3), in all times, even the day of judgment: by what consequence can he ignore a part of which he knows the whole? This also must be said: What is greater, the knowledge of the Father, or of the judgment? If he knows the greater, how does he not know what is lesser? We have read the scripture. All that belongs to the Father has been handed over to me (Luke 10:22). If all that belongs to the Father also belongs to the Son, then how is it that the Son reserved the knowledge of one day for himself and did not want to share it with the Son? But we must also infer this: If he is ignorant of the last day of times, he is also ignorant of nearly the last, and, looking backward, of all. For it cannot happen that one who is ignorant of the first knows what the second is. Therefore, because we have proven that the Son does not ignore the day of the consummation of all things (God is added in some versions), a reason must be given why he is said to be ignorant. The Apostle writes about the Savior: In whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge (Colossians 2:3). Therefore, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are in Christ, but they are hidden. Why are they hidden? After the resurrection, when questioned by the apostles, he answered more explicitly about the day: It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has established in His own authority (Acts 1:7). When he says, 'It is not for you to know,' he shows that he himself knows, but it is not expedient for the apostles to know, so that they may always live uncertain about the coming of the Judge, as if every day were a different Judgment Day. Finally, the consistent sermon of the Gospel urges us to understand this same thing, saying that only the Father knows: in the Father he includes the Son. For every father, the name of the son is.

<h2 id='tocuniq523'>(Vers. 37 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 37 onwards) Just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. It is asked how the following is written: For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be famines and earthquakes; and now they should remember those things that are signs of peace. But it is to be considered, according to the Apostle, that after wars, and strife, and plagues, and famines, and earthquakes, and other things by which the human race is devastated, peace will soon follow, which promises tranquility to all, so that the faith of believers may be confirmed, whether they may hope that the judge will come after the evils have been completed. For this is what we read in Paul: When they shall say, peace and security, then sudden destruction shall come upon them, as the pain of a woman in labor, and they shall not escape (I Thess. V, 3).



<h2 id='tocuniq524'>(Vers. 40, 41.)</h2>

(Verse 40, 41.) Then there will be two in the field: one will be taken, and one will be left. Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken, and one will be left. Then, He said, there will be two in the field, when, at the time of the consummation and judgment, two will be found in the field having the same labor and almost the same sowing, but not receiving the fruits of labor equally. Two women grinding together will also be there: one will be taken, and one will be left. In the two who reside in the field, and in the two who grind together, understand either the Synagogue and the Church, which seem to grind together in the Law, and to grind the flour of God's precepts from the same Scriptures, or the other heresies, which seem to grind the flour of their doctrines from either Testament or from the other, and when they have the same Christian name as their purpose, they will not receive the same reward: some being chosen, and others being left behind.



<h2 id='tocuniq525'>(Vers. 42, 43.)</h2>

(Verse 42, 43.) Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know at what hour your Lord is coming. But understand this, that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Clearly, he is showing why he said earlier: But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only: because it is not expedient for the apostles to know, so that they may always believe he is coming in uncertain expectation, whom they do not know when he is coming. And he did not say, because we do not know at what hour the Lord will come; but you do not know. And by giving the example of the father of the family, why he keeps silent about the day of the end, he teaches more clearly, saying:

Therefore, you also must be ready, for you do not know at what hour the Son of Man will come. Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. He further emphasizes and repeats why he did not predict the day of judgment and hour to the angels or himself, but only to the Father, because it is not fitting for the apostles to know; and he uses the example of a householder, that is, himself and faithful servants, that is, the apostles, to encourage their anxious minds, so that they may provide spiritual nourishment to their fellow servants at the proper time.



<h2 id='tocuniq526'>(Vers. 48, 49.)</h2>

<h2 id='tocuniq527'>(Vers. 50, 51.)</h2>

(Verse 50, 51.) The lord of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and he will divide him and place his portion with the hypocrites. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. This teaches that they should know when the lord is not expected, then he will come, and it warns the stewards of vigilance and diligence. Furthermore, when it says he will divide him, it does not mean that he will cut him with a sword; but rather, that he will separate him from the company of the saints and place his portion with the hypocrites; namely, with those who were in the field and grinding, yet were still abandoned. We often say that a hypocrite is one thing, and another thing to show: just as it seemed to be doing the same thing in the field and in the mill, that is, the man of the church, but the outcome of different wills appeared.

<h2 id='tocuniq528'>(Chap. XXV.—Vers. 1 seq.)</h2>

(Chapter 25, verses 1 onwards) Then the kingdom of heaven shall be like ten virgins who, taking their lamps, went forth to meet the bridegroom and the bride. But five of them were foolish, and five were wise. The foolish ones, having taken their lamps, took no oil with them. But the wise ones took oil in their vessels with their lamps. This parable, that is, the similitude of the ten virgins, some interpret simply in the virgins: some of whom, according to the Apostle, are virgins in both body and mind, while others only preserve the virginity of their bodies, lacking similar works or being kept by their parents, nevertheless they have married in their minds (I Cor. VII). But it seems to me that there is another meaning from what is said before, and it pertains not to virgin bodies, but to the whole human race. For just as two in a field and two grinding at the mill signify two peoples, Christians and Jews, saints and sinners, who are in the Church, they indeed appear to plow and grind themselves; but they do everything in hypocrisy: so now all the ten virgins embrace all men, who seem to believe in God and applaud themselves in the holy Scriptures, both ecclesiastics and Jews, and heretics. Therefore, all women are called virgins because they boast in the knowledge of one God, and their minds are not defiled by a crowd of idolatry (or lust). Virgins have oil, who are adorned with faith and good works. Those who appear to confess the Lord with a similar faith do not have oil; but they neglect the works of virtue. We can interpret the five virgins, wise and foolish, as the five senses: some hasten to heavenly things and desire heavenly things; others, gaping at earthly dregs, do not have the ointments of truth with which to enlighten their hearts. It has been said spiritually by sight, hearing, and touch: What we have seen, what we have heard, what we have beheld with our own eyes, and what our hands have touched (1 John 1:1). As for taste: Taste and see that the Lord is sweet (Psalm 34:9). As for smell: We run after the fragrance of your ointments (Song of Solomon 1:3). And: We are the sweet fragrance of Christ (2 Corinthians 2:15).

<h2 id='tocuniq529'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5) And while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. For not a little time passes between the first and second coming of the Lord. They all slumbered, that is, they died, because the death of the saints is called sleep. Moreover, it is said that they slept, because they will be raised afterwards.

<h2 id='tocuniq530'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) But at midnight there was a cry, 'Look, the bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him.' For suddenly, like in the darkest night and with calmness all around, when the heaviest sleep is upon everyone, the arrival of Christ will resound through the loud cry of angels and the trumpets of preceding powers. Let us say something that might be useful to the reader. It is the tradition of the Jews that Christ will come at midnight in a similar way to the time of the Egyptians, when the Passover was celebrated and the exterminator came, and the Lord passed over the tabernacles, and the blood of the lamb consecrated the doorposts of our foreheads (Exodus 12). Hence I think that the apostolic tradition has remained, that on the eve of Easter it is not allowed to dismiss half of the people, waiting for the coming of Christ. And after that time has passed, with assumed security, everyone celebrates the feast day. Hence the Psalmist said: At midnight I rise to give you thanks for your righteous rules (Psalm 119:62).

<h2 id='tocuniq531'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) Then all those virgins arose, and adorned their lamps. All the virgins arose, and each adorned their lamps, that is, their senses, in which they received the oil of knowledge, so that they may have the works of virtue, which would shine before the true judge.

<h2 id='tocuniq532'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) But foolish women say to the wise: Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out. They show that their lamps shine in part, and yet they do not have an inexhaustible light, nor perpetual works. Therefore, if anyone has a virgin soul and is a lover of chastity, they should not be satisfied with mediocre things that quickly fade away and wither when the heat is turned on. Instead, they should pursue perfect virtues, so that they may have eternal light.



<h2 id='tocuniq533'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) The wise men answered, saying: Lest perhaps there may not be enough for us and for you. They respond, not out of greed, but out of fear. For each one will receive a reward according to his deeds, and on the day of judgment, the virtues of some cannot mitigate the vices of others. And just as during the Babylonian captivity, Jeremiah could not help the sinners, and it is said to him: Do not pray for this people (Jeremiah 7:16): so fearful will be that day, when each one will be concerned for himself.



Go instead to the sellers and buy for yourselves. This oil is sold and is bought at a high price, and it is acquired with difficult labor, which we understand in acts of charity and all virtues and counsels of the masters.

<h2 id='tocuniq534'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) But while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came. Indeed, they give a wise counsel, that they should not meet the bridegroom without oil for their lamps: but because the time for buying had already passed, and on the day of judgement- being imminent- there was no place for repentance, as the Psalmist says: In hell, who will confess to you? (Psalm 6:6). They are not compelled to perform new deeds, but rather to give an account of their past actions.

And those who were invited came in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut. After the day of judgment, the opportunity for good works and justice will not be left (or abandoned).

<h2 id='tocuniq535'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11) And lastly come the remaining virgins, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us. Truly, an excellent confession in addressing the Lord, and the repetition of the same is an indication of faith. But what use is it to invoke with words, when you deny him with your actions?

<h2 id='tocuniq536'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12) But he answered and said, Amen I say to you, I do not know you. The Lord knows those who are His, and those who do not know, will not be known (2 Timothy 2:19). The Lord does not know the workers of iniquity: and although they may be virgins, and boast of their bodily purity and true confession of faith (1 Corinthians 14:38); yet because they do not have the oil of knowledge, it is enough for them as punishment that they are unknown by the Bridegroom.



<h2 id='tocuniq537'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) Therefore, watch, for you do not know the day or the hour. I always advise the prudent reader not to rely on superstitious interpretations, and not to consider what is said in a fictitious manner, but to consider the previous, middle, and subsequent parts, and to connect everything that is written. From this, therefore, he concludes: Watch, for you do not know the day or the hour. All that he said is understood, that is, about the two in the field, and about the two grinding at the mill, and about the master of the house who entrusts his possessions to his servant, and about the ten virgins. Therefore, these parables have been given, so that because we all do not know the day of judgment, we may diligently prepare the light of good works, lest, while we are unaware, the judge comes.



<h2 id='tocuniq538'>(Vers. 14, 15.)</h2>

(v. 14, 15) For just as a man going on a journey called his servants and entrusted to them his goods. And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his ability. Then he went away. This man, the head of the household, undoubtedly is Christ, who after his resurrection victoriously ascended to the Father and, calling the apostles, handed down the gospel teaching, not giving more to one and less to another based on generosity and stinginess, but according to the abilities of the recipients: just as the Apostle says that he fed those who could not receive solid food with milk (I Cor. IV). And finally, he who had made five talents also gained ten, and he who had made two gained four, receiving the same joyful reward; not considering the magnitude of the gain, but the willingness to strive. Let us understand the various gifts that have been given to each, whether it be five, two, or one talent. In the first, let us consider all the senses examined: In the second, understanding and actions: In the third, reason, which separates humans from animals.


<h2 id='tocuniq539'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16) And he who had received the five talents went and worked with them, and gained five more talents. With the earthly senses, he doubled his knowledge of heavenly things: understanding the Creator through His creation, the incorporeal through the corporeal, the invisible through the visible, the temporal through the eternal.

<h2 id='tocuniq540'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) Likewise, the one who received two, gained two more. And this person, according to their abilities, doubled whatever they had learned in the Law in the Gospel: whether knowledge and works of the present life or understanding the types of future blessedness.

<h2 id='tocuniq541'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) But the one who had received one went away and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. The wicked servant, through earthly works and worldly pleasure, neglected and defiled God's commandments: although it is written by another evangelist that he bound it in a burial cloth (Luke 19), meaning that he weakened the teaching of the master of the house by living softly and delicately.

<h2 id='tocuniq542'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Verse 19, 20.) After a long time, the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five more talents, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have made five talents more.' It is a great time between the ascension of the Savior and his second coming. But if the apostles are going to give an account and be judged with fear, what should we do?



<h2 id='tocuniq543'>(Vers. 21-23.)</h2>

(Verse 21-23) His master said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master. And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, I have made two talents more.' His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.' I keep reminding both those who had made five talents and those who had made ten, and likewise the same speech flatters the master of the household who had made four from two. And it should be noted that all the things we have at present, though they may seem great and numerous, are small and few in comparison to what is to come. 'Enter into the joy of your master,' he says, 'and receive what neither eye has seen nor ear heard nor has it entered the heart of man.' (I Cor. II) But what greater gift can be given to a faithful servant than to be with the Lord and see the joy of his Master?

<h2 id='tocuniq544'>(Vers. 24, 25.)</h2>

(Verse 24, 25.) But he who had received one talent came forward and said: Lord, I know that you are a hard man; you reap where you did not sow, and gather where you did not scatter seed. And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours. Truly it is written: To make excuses for sins (Ps. 140:4), even to this servant, the crime of sloth and negligence was added, along with the sin of pride. For he who should simply confess his laziness and beg the head of the family, on the contrary, accuses and says that he acted wisely, so that while seeking monetary gains, he would not even endanger his own fate.

<h2 id='tocuniq545'>(Vers. 26-28.)</h2>

(Verse 26-28) But his master answered and said to him, 'You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed. So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest. Therefore take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents. For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' The lazy person, because he did not want to double the talent, was condemned in one part to pride, in the other part to negligence. 'If,' he said, 'you had known that I am harsh and cruel, and pursue what is not mine, and reap where I have not sown, why did not such a thought instill fear in you, so that you would know that I would diligently seek what is mine, and give my money, or rather silver, to the moneylenders? For both ἀργύριον, as the Greek word signifies. The words, he said, of the Lord are chaste words, silver tested in the fire, proven to the earth, purified sevenfold (Ps. 11:7).' Therefore, money and silver are the proclamation of the Gospel and a divine message, which should be given to money changers and bankers, that is, to other teachers (which the apostles did, appointing elders and bishops in each province), or to all believers who can double money and return it with interest, so that they may fulfill whatever they have learned in word with actions. However, the talent is taken away and given to the one who had made ten talents, so that we may understand that even though the Lord's joy is equal in both labors, that is, in the one who had doubled five to ten and the one who had doubled two to four, a greater reward is owed to the one who has worked more with the Lord's money. Where the Apostle says: Honor the elders who are truly elders, especially those who labor in the word of God (I Tim. V, 17). From the fact that the wicked servant dared to say: You reap where you did not sow, and gather where you did not scatter, we understand that even the good life of the Gentiles and philosophers receives the Lord, and that those who act justly are different from those who act unjustly, and that those who neglect the written law are condemned in comparison to those who serve the natural law.



<h2 id='tocuniq546'>(Vers. 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29) For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who doesn't have, even that which he seems to have will be taken away. Many, though naturally wise and possessing sharp intellect, if they are negligent and laziness corrupts the good of their nature, in comparison to the one who is slightly slower but has compensated for what he lacked through effort and industry, they lose the good of their nature and the reward that had been promised to them, and see it pass to others. It can also be understood thus: to him who indeed has faith and a good will in the Lord, even if he may have something lacking in his works as a man, it will be given by the good judge. But to him who does not have faith, even the other virtues that he seemed to naturally possess, he will lose. And elegantly also, as it appears, he says, what he seems to have will be taken away from him. For whatever is without the faith of Christ, it should not be imputed to him who has wrongly abused it, but to him who even attributes good to the evil servant of nature.



<h2 id='tocuniq547'>(Vers. 30)</h2>

(Verse 30) And cast out the useless servant into outer darkness: there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The Lord is the light; whoever is sent out from Him is truly without light. But what we mean by weeping and gnashing of teeth, we have already explained above.

<h2 id='tocuniq548'>(Vers. 31 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 31 onwards) But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them from one another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will place the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then the king will say to those on his right hand, 'After two days I will celebrate the Passover, be handed over to the cross, mocked by men, and be given vinegar and gall to drink, for he rightly precedes the glory of the triumpant, so that he may compensate for the scandals that will follow with the reward of his promise.' And it should be noted that the one who is to be seen in majesty is the Son of Man. And what follows: He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left, understand this according to what you read elsewhere: The heart of the wise is in his right hand, but the heart of a fool is in his left (Eccl. 10:2). And above in this same Gospel: Let your left hand not know what your right hand does (Matt. 6:3). The sheep are commanded to stand on the right side of the righteous: the goats, that is, sinners, on the left, who are always offered for sin in the Law (Exod. 12). And he did not say, the goats, which can have offspring, and when they are shorn they come out of the bath, all with twin offspring, and there is none sterile among them (Canon 4); but the kids, a lustful and playful animal, and always eager for copulation.

<h2 id='tocuniq549'>(Vers. 34 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 34 onwards) Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.' Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink? When did we see you as a guest, and welcome you? Or naked, and clothe you? When did we see you sick, or in prison, and visit you? And the king will answer and say to them, 'Truly I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.' This should be understood according to God's foreknowledge, in whom the future has already happened.

<h2 id='tocuniq550'>(Vers. 40, 41.)</h2>

(Verse 40, 41.) Amen, I say to you: as long as ((Also: when)) you did it to one of these, my least brothers, you did it to me. Then he will say to those on his left: Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink. I was a stranger and you did not welcome me. I was naked and you did not clothe me. I was sick and in prison and you did not visit me. Then they will answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you? Then he will answer them, saying: Amen I say to you, as long as you did not do it to one of these least ones, neither did you do it to me. It was fitting for us to understand that in every poor person Christ, hungry, would be fed, thirsty would be given drink, a stranger would be brought into shelter, the naked would be clothed, the sick would be visited, the imprisoned would have the consolation of speaking with him. But from this that follows: As long as you did it to one of these least brothers of mine, you did it to me, it does not seem to me that he spoke generally about the poor, but about those who are poor in spirit, to whom he extends his hand and said: These are my brothers and my mother, who do the will of my Father (Mark 3:34-35; Luke 8:21).

<h2 id='tocuniq551'>(Vers. 46.)</h2>

(Verse 46.) And these shall go into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. Wise reader, take note that both eternal punishments and perpetual life should no longer have fear of ruin.

<h2 id='tocuniq552'>(Chap. XXVI.—Vers. 1 seq.)</h2>

(Chapter 26, Verses 1 and following) And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished saying all these words, He said to His disciples: You know that after two days the Passover will take place, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified. Let those who think that the Savior feared death be ashamed, and let them realize that He spoke out of fear of suffering when He said, 'Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me' (Luke 22:42). He knew that He would be handed over to be crucified two days after the Passover, and yet He does not avoid the snares, nor does He flee in fear, to the extent that, even when the others do not want to go, He continues boldly, as Thomas says: 'Let us also go, that we may die with Him' (John 11:16). And desiring to put an end to the carnal celebration, and while the shadow is passing, to restore the truth of Easter, he said: ‘With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you, before I suffer’ (Luke 22:15). Indeed, our pasch is sacrificed, Christ, if, however, we eat it in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth (1 Corinthians 5:7). Furthermore, when he says ‘After two days the pasch shall be’ (Matthew 26:2), let us seek with a simple understanding that which is sacred, without neglecting the sacrament. After two days of clear light, the true Passover of the world is celebrated, of the old and new Testament. The Passover, which is called in Hebrew Phase (), is not named after suffering as many suppose, but after the passage: because the exterminator, seeing the blood, passed over the doors of the Israelites and did not strike them. Or rather the Lord himself, providing assistance, walked above his people. In the book of Exodus (Ch. XI, XII), which we will discuss more fully if life permits, we can find more about this. But our passage, that is, the Passover, is celebrated in such a way that, leaving behind earthly things and Egypt, we hasten to heavenly things.

<h2 id='tocuniq553'>(Vers. 3 seqq.)</h2>

(Ver. 3 and following) Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, and they plotted to arrest Jesus by trickery and kill him. But they said, 'Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.' Now those who were supposed to prepare the Passover sacrifices, cleanse the walls of the temple, sweep the floors, purify the vessels, and be ritually purified according to the Law in order to be worthy to eat the Passover lamb, were gathered together to devise a plan on how to kill the Lord, not fearing rebellion, as the simple words show; but careful that they were not hindered by the help of the people.



<h2 id='tocuniq554'>(Vers. 6)</h2>

(Verse 6) But when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper. About to suffer for the whole world and redeem all nations with his blood, he stayed in Bethany, the house of obedience, which was once Simon the leper's. Not that he remained a leper at that time, but he who was formerly a leper was cleansed by the Savior, with his former name remaining, so that the power of the healer may be apparent. For in the list of apostles, with his former vice and occupation, Matthew is called a tax collector, who had certainly ceased to be a tax collector. A certain Simon, a leper's house, they want it to be understood as a part of the people, which has believed in the Lord, and has been cured by him. Simon himself is also said to be obedient, who can be interpreted in another sense as the world, in whose house the Church is healed.

<h2 id='tocuniq555'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) A woman came to him with an alabaster jar of expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table. No one should assume that she who poured the perfume on his head is the same as she who poured it on his feet. For she washes with her tears, wipes with her hair, and is clearly called a prostitute. However, nothing of this sort is written about her. For the prostitute could not immediately become worthy of the Lord's favor. Another Gospel writer placed the precious perfume in an alabaster jar (which is a type of marble), and called it pure and without deceit, to demonstrate the faith of the Church and the Gentiles.



<h2 id='tocuniq556'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Ver. 8, 9.) But when the disciples saw this, they were indignant and said, “Why this waste? This could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.” I know that some criticize this passage, questioning why only one evangelist, Judas, is mentioned as being upset, when it is said that all the apostles were indignant. They do not understand the figure of speech known as synecdoche, by which one person can be used to represent all, or one can be used to represent many. For even Paul, in his Epistle to the Hebrews (although many Latin writers doubt it), when he described the sufferings and merits of the saints, introduced the following: They were stoned, they were tested, they were sawn in two, they were killed by the sword (Heb. 11:37), since the Jews only admit that Isaiah the Prophet was sawn. We can also say that the apostles were truly indignant because of the poor: but Judas because of his gains. And his muttering is also attributed to the crime that he did not have care for the poor, but wanted to provide for his own theft.

<h2 id='tocuniq557'>(Vers. 10, 11.)</h2>

(Verse 10, 11.) But Jesus, knowing this, said to them: Why do you trouble this woman? For she has done a good work upon me. For the poor you have always with you, but me you do not always have. Another question arises, why did the Lord say to the disciples after the resurrection: Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the world; and now he says, but you do not always have me. But it seems to me that in this place he is speaking of his bodily presence, which will not be with them in the same way after the resurrection, as it is now in all their meetings and familiarity. The Apostle, being mindful of this matter, says: 'Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we no longer know Him.' (II Cor. 5:16)

<h2 id='tocuniq558'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) For she has poured this ointment on my body, to bury me. What you perceive as a waste of ointment is actually a burial ritual. It is not surprising that she has given me the sweet smell of her faith, as I am about to shed my blood for her.

<h2 id='tocuniq559'>(Vers. 12-14.)</h2>

(Verse 12-14) Truly I tell you, wherever this Gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her. Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests. In the whole world, not so much this woman, as the Church is preached, that she has buried the Savior, that she has anointed his head. And pay attention to the knowledge of the future, that he will suffer in two days and die, and his Gospel will be celebrated in the whole world.



<h2 id='tocuniq560'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) And he said to them: What do you want to give me, and I will betray him to you? Unfortunate Judas, he believed that he could make up for the loss caused by the spillage of the ointment with the price of the master. However, he does not demand a specific amount, so that the betrayal would at least appear profitable, but rather, like someone selling a cheap slave, he put it in the power of the buyers to give as much as they wanted.

<h2 id='tocuniq561'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) But they agreed to give him thirty pieces of silver. And from then on he was looking for an opportunity to betray him. Joseph was not sold for twenty gold pieces, as many think according to the Septuagint translators, but according to the Hebrew Truth, for twenty silver pieces; for no servant could be more precious than the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq562'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, 'Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?' The first day of Unleavened Bread is the fourteenth day of the first month, when the lamb is sacrificed and the moon is full, and the yeast is thrown out. Among the disciples who came to Jesus, they asked him, 'Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?' And I suspect Judas to have been the traitor.

<h2 id='tocuniq563'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Version 18.) And Jesus said: Go into the city to a certain person, and say to him: The teacher says: My time is near; I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house. The new Scripture preserves the custom of the old Testament. Often we read: He said to him, and in that place and that place; which in Hebrew is called Pheloni Elmoni (), and yet the names of persons and places are not mentioned. And you will find there a certain person carrying a jar of water. For this reason, these words were omitted so that a free opportunity for celebration would be offered to all who would observe Easter.

<h2 id='tocuniq564'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them, and they prepared the Passover. In another Gospel it is written (Luke 22) that they found a large upper room furnished and prepared, and there they made ready for him. But it seems to me that the upper room is to be understood as the spiritual law, which, departing from the confines of the letter, receives the Savior in a lofty place, as Paul himself speaks (Philippians 3), that he has counted as dung and refuse whatever things he previously regarded as gain, in order to prepare a worthy dwelling for the Lord.



<h2 id='tocuniq565'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20.) And when evening came, he was reclining at table with the twelve disciples. Judas acts in such a way that suspicion of being a traitor is removed.

<h2 id='tocuniq566'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21.) And while they were eating, he said: Amen I say to you: that one of you will betray me. He who had foretold of his passion also predicts the traitor, giving him an opportunity for repentance, so that when he understands his own thoughts and hidden plans, he may repent of his actions, and yet he does not specifically identify him, so that he may not be openly accused and become more shameless. He attributes the crime to a number, so that the guilty party may repent.



<h2 id='tocuniq567'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) And greatly saddened, they began to each say: Am I the one, Lord? And certainly the eleven apostles knew that they had not thought anything like that against the Lord: but they believed more in their teacher than in themselves, fearing their own weakness, they sadly asked about the sin whose consciousness they did not have.

<h2 id='tocuniq568'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) But He answering, said: He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me. Oh, the wondrous patience of the Lord! He had said first: one of you shall betray me. The traitor persists in evil, making it more evident, yet without clearly indicating his name. With the others saddened, holding back their hands, and denying the food to his mouth, with audacity and impudence, by which he was to betray, he even sends his hand into the dish with the master, in order to falsely testify to a clear conscience.



<h2 id='tocuniq569'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24.) Woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. Neither at first nor at second exposure to treachery does he retract his step, but the patience of the Lord nurtures his impudence, and in the day of wrath he accumulates wrath for himself (Rom. II). Punishment is predicted, so that those whom shame did not conquer, may be corrected by proclaimed punishments. But what follows:

It would have been good for him if that man had not been born: He is not to be considered as having existed before he was born, because no one can be well off unless they have existed: but it was simply stated that it is much better not to exist than to exist badly.

<h2 id='tocuniq570'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) But Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said: 'Is it I, Lord?' Lest he should appear to betray himself by remaining silent, he likewise asks, being tormented by his conscience, who had boldly put his hand into the dish.

Am I, Rabbi? He said to him: You have said it. And he joins a mingling of emotion, or a sign of disbelief. For the others who were not going to betray, they say: Am I, Lord? This one who was going to betray did not call him Lord, but rather teacher, as if he had an excuse, if he denied the Lord, at least he betrayed the teacher. And he said to him: You have said it. The betrayer is refuted by the same response, with which he will later answer Pilate.



<h2 id='tocuniq571'>(Vers. 26 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 26 seqq.) However, while they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it, he broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, 'Take, eat; this is my body.' And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, 'Drink of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. After the symbolic Passover had been fulfilled, and he had eaten the flesh of the lamb with the apostles, he took bread, which strengthens the heart of man, and transcended to the true sacrament of Passover, so that just as in its prefiguration Melchizedek, the high priest of the Most High God, had offered bread and wine (Gen. XIV), he himself also in the truth would represent his own body and blood. In Luke, we read about two cups which Jesus gave to his disciples (Luke 22). One was for the first month, and the other for the second, so that he who could not eat the lamb among the saints in the first month would eat the goat among the repentant in the second month.

<h2 id='tocuniq572'>(Vers. 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29.) But I say to you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. He transitions from the physical to the spiritual, citing that the vineyard transplanted from Egypt is the people of Israel, to whom the Lord speaks through Jeremiah: I planted you a true vine, but how you have turned into the bitter fruit of a foreign vine (Jeremiah 2:21). And the prophet Isaiah sings in a song to his beloved, and the entire Scripture testifies accordingly. He says, therefore, that he will in no way drink of this vine until the kingdom of his Father comes. The kingdom of the Father, I believe, is the faith of believers, as the Apostle also confirms: The kingdom of God is within you (Luke 17:21). Therefore, when the Jews have received the kingdom of the Father (notice that he says Father, not God), every Father is named the Son. When, I say, they have believed in God the Father, and the Father has brought them to the Son, then the Lord will drink of their wine, and, reigning in Egypt in the likeness of Joseph, he will be intoxicated with his brothers (Genesis 43).



<h2 id='tocuniq573'>(Vers. 30.)</h2>

(Vers. 30.) And having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. This is what we read in a certain psalm: All the fat of the earth have eaten and adored (Ps. XXI, 30). According to this example, whoever is satisfied with the Savior's bread and intoxicated with the chalice can praise the Lord and ascend to the Mount of Olives, where there is refreshment from labors, consolation from sorrow, and knowledge of true light.

<h2 id='tocuniq574'>(Vers. 31.)</h2>

(Verse 31.) Then Jesus said to them: All of you will be scandalized by me in this night. He predicts that they will suffer, so that when they have suffered, they will not despair of salvation, but by repenting, they will be freed. And he specifically added, in this night you will be scandalized; for just as those who get drunk, get drunk at night: likewise those who are scandalized, endure in the night and in darkness (I Thess. 5). But let us say: The night has passed, and the day is at hand (Rom. 13:12).



<h2 id='tocuniq575'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32.) For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee. This is also written in different words by the prophet Zachariah; and (if I am not mistaken) it is said by the voice of the prophet to God: Strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered (Zech. 13:7). In the sixty-eighth Psalm, which is completely devoted to the Lord, this meaning is also in agreement: For those whom you have struck, they have pursued. But the good shepherd is struck, so that he may lay down his life for his sheep; and out of many flocks of errors, one flock is made, and one shepherd  (John. X) . This testimony is further explained in the book that we wrote about the Best Way of Interpretation.

<h2 id='tocuniq576'>(Vers. 33.)</h2>

(Verse 33.) But Peter, answering, said to him: Even if all shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized. It is not rashness, nor falsehood; but it is the faith of the apostle Peter, and a fervent affection towards the Lord and Savior, of whom we have spoken above.

<h2 id='tocuniq577'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) Jesus said to him: Truly I say to you, that in this night before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times. And Peter, with fervor of faith, promised, and the Savior, as if God, knew the future. And note that Peter will deny in the night, and deny a third time. But after the rooster crowed, and the darkness diminishing, the approaching light was announced, he turned and wept bitterly, washing away the stains of denial with tears of repentance.

<h2 id='tocuniq578'>(Vers. 36.)</h2>

(Verse 36.) Then Jesus came with them to a village called Gethsemane and said to his disciples, 'Sit here while I go over there and pray.' Gethsemane means 'very fertile valley,' in which he ordered the disciples to sit for a little while and wait for the Lord to return, while he prayed for everyone alone.

<h2 id='tocuniq579'>(Vers. 37.)</h2>

(Verse 37) And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sad and sorrowful. What we have said above about the passion and pre-passion is also shown in the present chapter, that the Lord, in order to prove the truth of his assumption as a man, was truly saddened, but so that the passion would not dominate his soul, he began to be saddened through pre-sorrow. For it is one thing to be saddened, and another thing to begin to be saddened. But He was saddened not by the fear of suffering, for which He had come, that He might suffer; and He had reprimanded Peter for his timidity; but on account of the most unfortunate Judas, and the scandal of all the apostles, and the rejection of the Jewish people, and the destruction of miserable Jerusalem. Hence Jonas also, grieving over the withering of a gourd or a ivy, was grieved (Jonah 4), unwilling to lose his former shelter. But if the sadness of the soul is interpreted by the heretics not as the affection of the Savior towards those who are about to perish, but as the suffering, let them answer how they explain that which is said through Ezekiel in the person of God: And in all these things you have saddened me (Ezekiel 16, Septuagint version).



<h2 id='tocuniq580'>(Vers. 38.)</h2>

(Verse 38.) Then he said to them, My soul is sorrowful, even to death; wait here, and watch with me. The soul is saddened and not, however, by death, but is saddened even unto death, until he frees his apostles by his suffering. And what he commanded: wait here, and watch with me, he does not forbid sleep, the time of which was not imminent with danger, but he forbids sleep of unfaithfulness, and dulness of mind. Therefore, let those who suspect that Jesus took on an irrational soul declare how he could be saddened and know the time of sadness. Although even dumb animals die, they do not know the reasons or the time until which they must be saddened.

<h2 id='tocuniq581'>(Vers. 39.)</h2>

(Verse 39) And going forward a little, he fell on his face, praying and saying: My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will. Having given the apostles the command to endure and keep watch with the Lord, he advanced a little and fell on his face, showing the humility of his mind in the appearance of his flesh, and he said in a gentle way: My Father, and he asked that, if possible, the cup of suffering pass from him, about which we have spoken above. But, he does not ask to be spared out of fear, but out of mercy for the earlier people, so as not to drink from the cup that they have offered. Therefore, he specifically does not say, let this cup pass from me, but let this cup pass, that is, the cup of the Jewish people, who cannot claim ignorance as an excuse, if they kill me, having the Law and the prophets, who daily prophesy about me. Yet, turning back to himself, what he had hesitantly declined from the perspective of a human, he confirms from the perspective of God the Son. However, not as I want, but as you. No, he says, let this not be done, which I speak with human emotion; but because of what I descended to earth by your will.

<h2 id='tocuniq582'>(Vers. 40.)</h2>

(Verse 40.) And he came to his disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, 'So you could not watch with me one hour? He who said above, 'Even if all are scandalized in you, I will never be scandalized,' now cannot overcome sleep due to the magnitude of sorrow.'

<h2 id='tocuniq583'>(Vers. 41.)</h2>

(Verse 41.) Watch and pray, so that you do not enter into temptation. It is impossible for the human soul not to be tempted. Hence, in the Lord's Prayer, we say: Lead us not into temptation, which we cannot bear (or be able to bear) (Matthew 6:13; Luke 11:4). Not completely rejecting temptation, but praying for the strength to endure it. Therefore, at present, it does not say: Watch and pray, lest you be tempted; but, lest you enter into temptation, that is, lest the temptation overcomes and conquers you, and keeps you within its grasp. For example, the martyr, who sheds his blood for the confessing the Lord, is indeed tempted; but he is not caught in the snares of temptations. However, whoever denies, falls into the traps of temptation.

The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is weak. This is against the reckless ones, who think they can achieve whatever they believe. Therefore, as much as we trust in the ardor of the mind, so much do we fear the fragility of the flesh. But nevertheless, according to the Apostle, in the spirit the works of the flesh are put to death (1 Peter 3).

<h2 id='tocuniq584'>(Vers. 42.)</h2>

(Verse 42.) Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, saying: Father, if this chalice cannot pass away, unless I drink it, let your will be done. He prays for the second time, that if Nineveh cannot be saved in any other way, unless the gourd withers, let the will of the Father be done, which is not contrary to the will of the Son, as he himself said through the prophet: To do your will, O God, I desired (Ps. 39:9).

<h2 id='tocuniq585'>(Vers. 43, 44.)</h2>

(Verse 43, 44.) And he came again and found them sleeping. For their eyes were heavy. And leaving them, he went away again and prayed for the third time, saying the same thing. He alone prays for all, just as he alone suffers for everyone. But the apostles' eyes grew weak and burdened by imminent denial.

<h2 id='tocuniq586'>(Vers. 45.)</h2>

(Verse 45.) Then he came to his disciples and said to them: Sleep now, and rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of sinners (Matthew 26 and 2 Corinthians 13). After he had prayed three times, that every word might stand in the mouth of two or three witnesses, and had obtained by subsequent penance that the fear of the apostles be corrected, he proceeds secure in his passion to his persecutors, and offers himself to be put to death, and says to his disciples:

<h2 id='tocuniq587'>(Vers. 46, 47.)</h2>

(Verse 46, 47) Get up, let's go, behold the one who will betray me is approaching. While He was still speaking, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people. Let us not be found as if fearing and retreating, let us willingly go towards death, so that they may see the confidence and joy we will endure.

<h2 id='tocuniq588'>(Vers. 48.)</h2>

(Verse 48.) But he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying: Whomever I shall kiss, that is he, hold him fast. Miserable Judas, and yet not pitiable, with the same unfaithfulness with which he betrayed his master and Lord, he believed that the signs which he had seen the Savior performing were not done by divine majesty, but by magical skills. And because he had heard that he was transfigured on the mountain, he feared that he might slip away from the hands of the attendants through a similar transformation. Therefore, he gave a sign so that they would know that it was him, whom he demonstrated with a kiss.

<h2 id='tocuniq589'>(Vers. 49.)</h2>

(Verse 49.) And immediately coming to Jesus, he said, Hail, Rabbi! And he kissed him. Shameless indeed and wickedly confident, to call the master and to throw a kiss to the one he was handing over. Nevertheless, the disciple still has something of discretion, as he does not openly hand him over to the persecutors, but through the sign of a kiss. This is the sign that God placed on Cain, so that whoever found him would not kill him (Genesis 4).

<h2 id='tocuniq590'>(Vers. 50.)</h2>

(Verse 50.) And Jesus said to him: Friend, why have you come? Then they drew near and laid hands on Jesus, and seized him. The word 'Friend' should be understood either in the opposite sense, or certainly according to what we have read above: Friend, how did you enter here without a wedding garment? (Matt. XXII, 12)?

<h2 id='tocuniq591'>(Vers. 51.)</h2>

(Verse 51) And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and striking the high priest's servant, cut off his ear. In another gospel, it is written that Peter did this with the same zeal as the other things. The servant of the high priest is also called Malchus: the ear that was cut off is the right one. By way of a passing remark, it should be said that Malchus, meaning the former king of the Jewish people, became a servant of the impious and devouring priests. And he may have lost his right ear, so that he hears all the worthlessness of letters in his left: but the Lord in those who wanted to believe from the Jews restored the right ear, and made them a royal and priestly people.

<h2 id='tocuniq592'>(Vers. 52.)</h2>

(Verse 52.) Then Jesus said to him: Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword. And if one does not carry a sword in vain, who is appointed as the avenger of the Lord's wrath against those who do evil: nevertheless, whoever takes up the sword will perish by the sword. Which sword? That same one which turns fiery before Paradise (Genesis 3): and the sword of the spirit, which is described as the armor of God (Ephesians 6).



<h2 id='tocuniq593'>(Vers. 53, 54.)</h2>

(Verse 53, 54.) Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way? I do not need the help of twelve apostles, even if they all defended me. I could have twelve legions of angelic armies. In ancient times, one legion consisted of six thousand men. In order to keep this brief, I will not go into the exact number for now. Just know that seventy-two thousand angels, divided into twelve legions, is the approximate count for the number of nations divided by language. The following sentence demonstrates a ready mind to suffer, because the prophets sang in vain unless the Lord truly affirmed their words by his own suffering.

<h2 id='tocuniq594'>(Vers. 55.)</h2>

(Verse 55.) At that hour Jesus said to the crowds: Are you coming out with swords and clubs to arrest me like a robber? Every day I was sitting in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. It is foolish, he said, to seek him with swords and clubs, who willingly surrenders himself to your hands, and to search for him like a lurking fugitive in the night, and to investigate him through a betrayer, who teaches in the temple every day. But you are gathering against me in the darkness, because your power is in darkness.


<h2 id='tocuniq595'>(Vers. 56.)</h2>

(Verse 56.) But all this has happened so that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples, leaving him, fled. What are the Scriptures of the prophets? They have pierced my hands and feet (Psalm 22:17); and elsewhere: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter (Isaiah 53:7). And in another place: He was led to death because of the iniquities of my people (Ibid., sec. 70).

<h2 id='tocuniq596'>(Vers. 57.)</h2>

(Verse 57.) And they who were holding Jesus led Him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together. Moses, by God's command, had decreed that the priests should succeed their fathers, and that the line of succession should be preserved among the priests (Exodus 29). Josephus reports that Caiaphas purchased his high priesthood from Herod for a sum of money for only one year. Therefore, it is not surprising if this wicked high priest judges unjustly.



<h2 id='tocuniq597'>(Vers. 58.)</h2>

(Verse 58.) But Peter followed Him from afar off, even unto the palace of the high priest. He followed Him from afar off, who was to deny the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq598'>(Vers. 59, 60.)</h2>

(V. 59, 60.) And entering inside, he sat with the ministers, to see the end. But the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, so that they could deliver him to death. And they did not find any, although many false witnesses came forward. Whether out of love for his disciples or out of human curiosity, the high priest wanted to know what he would decide about the Lord: whether he would condemn him to death or release him after beating him. And there was a difference of opinion among the ten apostles and Peter. Those (people) flee, but this one, although far away, still follows the Savior.

<h2 id='tocuniq599'>(Vers. 61.)</h2>

(Verse 61.) But finally came two false witnesses, and said: He said: I can destroy the temple of God, and after three days rebuild it. How are they false witnesses if they say the things that we read the Lord said? But a false witness is one who does not understand the words in the same sense in which they are spoken. For the Lord had spoken about the temple of his body. But even in the words themselves, they slander, and by adding or changing a few things, they make it seem like a just accusation. The Savior had said: Destroy this temple; those men change it and say: I can destroy the temple of God. You, he said, destroy it, not me, because it is unlawful for us to lay hands on ourselves. Then they turn it: and after three days rebuild it; so that it may seem he had spoken properly about the Jewish temple. But the Lord, in order to show that an animal and breathing temple, had said: And in three days I will raise it up. To build is one thing, to raise is another.



<h2 id='tocuniq600'>(Vers. 62.)</h2>

(Verse 62) And the high priest stood up and said to Him, 'Do You answer nothing? What is it that these men testify against You?' But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest became furious and impatient, unable to find a place for false accusations, he threw the high priest off his seat, in order to demonstrate his madness of mind through the movement of his body. The more Jesus remained silent in response to unworthy individuals, false witnesses, and wicked priests, the more the high priest, overcome with rage, provoked Him to respond, so that he could find an opportunity in any occasion of conversation to accuse Him. Nevertheless, Jesus remained silent. For he knew, as if God, whatever response he gave would be twisted into a false accusation.

<h2 id='tocuniq601'>(Vers. 63.)</h2>

(Verse 63.) And the high priest said to him, I adjure you by the living God that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God. Why do you swear, most wicked of priests, to accuse rather than to believe? If to accuse, others argue: condemn the silent one. If to believe, why did you not want to believe the one confessing?

<h2 id='tocuniq602'>(Vers. 64.)</h2>

(Verse 64.) Jesus said to him: You have said it. Nevertheless, I tell you: from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the power of God, and coming on the clouds of heaven. And against Pilate, and against Caiaphas, a similar response, so that they are condemned by their own sentence.

<h2 id='tocuniq603'>(Vers. 65, 66.)</h2>

(Vers. 65, 66.) Then the high priest tore his garments, saying: He has blasphemed. What further need do we have of witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. What do you think? And they answered, saying: He is deserving of death. The same fury that had driven him from the priestly throne now provokes him to tear his garments. He tore his garments to show that the Jews had lost the glory of priesthood and that the high priests had an empty seat. But it is also a Jewish custom, when they hear something blasphemous and seemingly against God, to tear their garments. We read that Paul and Barnabas did the same when they were esteemed as gods in Lycaonia. However, Herod, because he did not give honor to God but acquiesced to the excessive favor of the people, was immediately struck by an angel.

<h2 id='tocuniq604'>(Vers. 67.)</h2>

(Verse 67.) Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. As it was foretold: I have given my cheeks to those who struck me; I have not turned my face from disgrace and spitting. (Lamentations 3:30)

<h2 id='tocuniq605'>(Vers. 68.)</h2>

(Verse 68.) But others slapped his face and said: Prophesy to us, Christ, who is it that struck you? It would have been foolish to respond to those who were beating him and to prophesy about the one who was striking him, since it would seem like madness to openly predict someone who was already striking. But just as he did not prophesy this to you, so he prophesied very clearly that Jerusalem would be surrounded by an army and not a single stone would be left upon another in the temple.

<h2 id='tocuniq606'>(Vers. 69.)</h2>

(Verse 69.) But Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. He was sitting outside to see the outcome. And he did not come near Jesus, so that no suspicion would arise among the servants.

<h2 id='tocuniq607'>(Vers. 72.)</h2>

(Verse 72.) And again he denied it with an oath, 'I do not know the man.' And after a little while those standing there came up and said to Peter, 'Surely you also are one of them, for your accent betrays you.' Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, 'I do not know the man.' And immediately the rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, 'Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.' And he went out and wept bitterly. Some pious people have interpreted this passage in such a way that they say Peter did not deny God but only a man, and the meaning is: 'I do not know the man, for I know God.' A discerning reader understands how frivolous this interpretation is; they defend Peter in such a way as to make God guilty of lying. For if he did not deny, then the Lord lied, who said, 'Truly I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.' See what he says, you will deny me, not a man.

<h2 id='tocuniq608'>(Vers. 73.)</h2>

(Verse 73.) Truly, you are also one of them: for even your speech gives you away. Not that Peter spoke a different language or came from a foreign nation. For all of them were Hebrews, both those who accused and those who were accused. But each province and region has its own peculiarities, and cannot avoid the sound of their native language. Hence, even the Ephraimites in the Book of Judges (chapter 12) could not pronounce the word σύνθημα.



<h2 id='tocuniq609'>(Vers. 74, 75.)</h2>

(Verse 74, 75.) Then he began to curse and swear, saying that he did not know the man. And immediately the rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus that he had said: Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times. In another Gospel, we read that after Peter's denial and the rooster's crowing, the Savior looked at Peter and with his gaze, he caused him to burst into bitter tears. It was not possible for him to remain in the darkness of denial, whom the light of the world had looked upon.



And going out, he wept bitterly. Sitting in the courtyard of Caiaphas, he could not do penance. He goes out from the wicked council to wash the fearful filth of his denials with bitter tears.

<h2 id='tocuniq610'>(Chap. XXVII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 27, verses 1 onwards) Now when morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. And they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor. He was not only taken to Pilate, but also to Herod, so that both of them might mock the Lord. And see the eagerness of the priests for evil. They stayed awake all night in order to commit murder. And they handed him over bound to Pilate. For they had this custom, that whoever they had condemned to death, they would hand over to the judge bound.

Then seeing Judas, who had betrayed Him, that He was condemned, being moved by repentance, he returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying: I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. He cast away the weight of impiety from the greatness of his greed. Seeing that the Lord was condemned to death, Judas returned the price to the priests, as if he had the power to change the sentence of those who persecuted. Therefore, although he changed his will, he did not change the outcome of his first intention. But if he who handed over the innocent blood sinned, how much more did the Jews sin, who bought the innocent blood, and by offering a price, provoked the betrayal of the disciple? Let those who attempt to introduce different natures and say that Judas, the traitor, had an evil nature, and could not be saved by election, answer how an evil nature could have repented.

<h2 id='tocuniq611'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) But they said: What is that to us? You see. And throwing the silver coins into the temple, he left: and going away, he hanged himself. It availed him nothing to have repented, by which he could not correct his crime. If at any time a brother sins against his brother, so that he is able to amend what he has sinned, it can be forgiven to him. But if his works remain, repentance is taken up in vain with words. This is what is said in the psalm concerning the same most unfortunate Judas: Let his prayer be turned into sin (Psalm 108:7); so that he not only could not correct the wickedness of his betrayal, but also added the crime of his own homicide to the former sin. Here's what the Apostle says in his second Epistle to the Corinthians: 'So that on the contrary ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.' (2 Corinthians 2:7)

<h2 id='tocuniq612'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) But the chief priests, having received the silver, said: It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. Truly straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel. For if they do not put money into the treasury, that is, into the storeroom for gifts to God, because it is the price of blood, why is the blood itself being spilled?

<h2 id='tocuniq613'>(Vers. 7, 8.)</h2>

(Vers. 7, 8.) However, with a plan devised, they bought a field from that potter, for the burial of strangers, therefore that field was called Acheldemach, which means the field of blood, to this day. Indeed, they acted with a different intention, that they might leave a lasting monument of their impiety from the purchase of the land. But we, who were strangers to the Law and the prophets, have embraced their corrupt practices for salvation: and we find rest in the price of his blood. But the field is called 'figulus' because our potter is Christ.

<h2 id='tocuniq614'>(Vers. 9, 10.)</h2>

(Verse 9, 10) Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, 'And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the value of Him who was priced, whom they of the children of Israel priced, and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.' This testimony is not found in Jeremiah. But in Zechariah, who is almost the last of the twelve prophets, a certain similarity is mentioned (Zech. 11). And although the meaning does not differ much, nevertheless both the order and the words are different. I recently read in a certain Hebrew volume, which a Hebrew of the Nazarene sect offered to me, an apocryphal book of Jeremiah, in which I found the following words written verbatim. However, it seems to me more like a testimony taken from Zechariah: just like the Evangelists and Apostles commonly do, who, omitting the order of words, only present the meaning from the Old Testament as an example.

<h2 id='tocuniq615'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) But Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying: Are you the king of the Jews? The Jews accuse Jesus of impiety, because they were not even able to find anything false to accuse the Savior.

Jesus said to him: You say so. Thus he answered so as to speak the truth and not reveal his speech to calumny. And notice that although Pilate, who unwillingly pronounced the sentence, answered in part: yet he did not want to answer the priests and rulers, considering them unworthy of his speech.

<h2 id='tocuniq616'>(Vers. 13 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 13 and following) Then Pilate said to him: Do you not hear how many testimonies they speak against you? And he did not respond to him with any word, so that the governor wondered greatly. Now it was customary for the governor to release one prisoner to the people on the solemn day, whom they desired. Indeed, it is a Gentile who condemns Jesus, but he refers the matter to the Jewish people. Do you not hear how many testimonies they speak against you? But Jesus refused to respond, in order to not diminish the accusation from the governor, and to prevent the delay of the usefulness of the cross.

<h2 id='tocuniq617'>(Vers. 16 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 16 onwards) At that time he had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them: Whom do you want me to release to you, Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ? For he knew that they had handed Him over out of envy. Now, in the Gospel written according to the Hebrews, 'the son of their teacher' is interpreted as referring to this man, who had been condemned for sedition and murder. However, Pilate offers them the option of releasing whoever they want, either the robber or Jesus, not doubting that they would choose Jesus, knowing that He had been handed over out of envy. Therefore, the evident cause of the cross is envy.

<h2 id='tocuniq618'>(Vers. 19 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 19 onwards) Now while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, 'Have nothing to do with that righteous Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him.' But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. The governor answered and said to them, 'Which of the two do you want me to release to you?' They said, 'Barabbas!' Note that God often reveals dreams to the Gentiles; and that the testimony of the people is that Pilate and his wife confess the righteous Lord.



<h2 id='tocuniq619'>(Vers. 22, 23.)</h2>

(Verse 22, 23.) Pilate said to them: What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all said: Let him be crucified. The governor asked: What evil has he done? But they shouted even louder, saying: Let him be crucified. Pilate gave many opportunities to release the Savior. First, he compared him to a just thief. Then he asked: What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? That is, who is your king. When they replied, Let him be crucified, he did not immediately agree; but according to the suggestion of his wife, who had said: Have nothing to do with that righteous man, he also replied: What evil has he done? By saying this, Pilate absolved Jesus. But they shouted even more, saying: Crucify him. So that what was said in the twenty-first psalm would be fulfilled: Many dogs have surrounded me; A congregation of evildoers have encircled me. And that which Jeremiah said: My inheritance has become like a lion in the forest; They have raised their voices against me. Isaiah also agrees with this statement: I waited for them to do justice, but they did iniquity, not righteousness; they made a loud cry.



<h2 id='tocuniq620'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) But Pilate, seeing that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a tumult was taking place, took water and washed his hands before the people, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just man: you shall see. Pilate took water, according to that prophetic saying: I will wash my hands among the innocent (Ps. 25:6); so that in the washing of his hands, the works of the Gentiles might be cleansed, and he might separate us from the impiety of the Jews, who cried out, crucify him, thereby attesting in a way that I indeed wanted to free the innocent man; but since sedition arises and an accusation of treason against Caesar is brought against me: I am innocent of the blood of this just man. The judge who is forced to pass sentence against Christ does not condemn the accused; but he accuses those who offer him, pronouncing that the one who must be crucified is just. He says, 'You will see. I am the minister of the laws: your voice sheds blood.'

<h2 id='tocuniq621'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25) And all the people answered and said, 'His blood be on us and on our children.' This curse persists upon the Jews until the present day, and the blood of the Lord is not removed from them. Hence, Isaiah speaks: 'If you raise your hands to me, I will not listen to you. For your hands are full of blood' (Isaiah 1:15). The Jews leave the best inheritance to their children, saying, 'His blood be on us and on our children.'



<h2 id='tocuniq622'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Ver. 26.) Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus, after he had been scourged, he handed over to them to be crucified. Barabbas, a robber, who had caused insurrections in the crowds, who was a murderer, was released to the Jewish people, that is, the devil, who reigns in them even to this day, and therefore they cannot have peace. But Jesus, being handed over by the Jews, is acquitted by Pilate's wife, and is called just by the governor himself. And the centurion confesses that he is truly the Son of God. The learned reader may wonder how it is fitting for Pilate to have washed his hands and said, 'I am innocent of the blood of this just man,' and then handed over Jesus to be crucified after he had been scourged. But it should be known that he served the Romans' laws, which decreed that whoever is to be crucified should first be scourged. Therefore, Jesus was handed over to the soldiers to be scourged, and they tore into that most sacred body, capable of containing the heart of God, with lashes. However, this was done so that, as it is written: 'Many are the scourges of the wicked' (Psalm 31:10), by him being scourged, we might be freed from scourges, as the Scripture says to the righteous man: 'No scourge shall come near your tent' (Psalm 90:10).

<h2 id='tocuniq623'>(Vers. 27 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 27 onwards) Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around him. And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe around him. And twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!' The soldiers, since Jesus had been called the King of the Jews and the scribes and priests had accused him of claiming to be the ruler of the people of Israel, did this mockingly. They dressed him in the scarlet robe as a symbol of royalty, put a crown of thorns on his head, gave him a reed as a scepter, and pretended to worship him as a king. But we must understand all these things mystically. For just as Caiphas said, 'It is necessary for one man to die for all' (John 11:50), not knowing what he was saying, so these people, whatever they did, although they had different intentions, nevertheless gave us, who believe, the sacraments. In the scarlet robe, he bears the bloody works of the Gentiles; in the crown of thorns, he undoes the ancient curse; with the pen, he kills poisonous animals. Whether he held the pen in his hand to write the sacrilege of the Jews.



<h2 id='tocuniq624'>(Vers. 30.)</h2>

(Verse 30) And spitting on him, they took a reed and struck his head. At that time it was fulfilled; I did not turn my face away from the shame of spitting  (Isaiah 50:6), yet when they strike his head with the reed, he endures everything patiently, to fulfill the true prophecy of Isaiah, which says: He will not break a bruised reed  (Isaiah 42:3).

<h2 id='tocuniq625'>(Vers. 31.)</h2>

(Verse 31) And after they had mocked him, they stripped him of his cloak and dressed him in his own clothes, and led him away to be crucified. When Jesus is whipped, spat upon, and mocked, he does not have his own garments, but those which he had taken on for our sins. But when he is crucified and the spectacle of mockery and illusion is over, then he receives his former clothes again and puts on his own attire. And immediately the elements are disturbed, and the creature gives testimony to its Creator.



<h2 id='tocuniq626'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32) And as they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they compelled to bear his cross. Lest anyone think that this account is contradictory to the story of John the Evangelist. For he said that the Lord, going out of the praetorium, carried his own cross; but Matthew reports that they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon, whom they compelled to bear Jesus' cross. But this is to be understood, that Jesus, going out of the praetorium, himself carried his own cross; afterward they encountered Simon, to whom they imposed the task of carrying the cross. According to anagoge, the nations accept the cross of Jesus, and the obedient stranger carries the ignominy of the Savior.

<h2 id='tocuniq627'>(Vers. 33.)</h2>

(Verse 33.) And they came to a place called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary. I have heard someone explain the place of Calvary, where Adam was buried, and therefore it is called that because there the head of the ancient man is buried, and this is what the Apostle says: Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will give you light. A favorable interpretation that pleases the ears of the people, but not true. For outside the city and beyond the gate, there are places where the heads of the condemned are severed, and they took the name of Calvary, that is, beheaders. Therefore the Lord was crucified there, so that where there had been a place of condemnation, there might be erected the banners of martyrdom. And just as He was made a curse for us, and was scourged, and was crucified, so for the salvation of all, even though guilty among the guilty, He would be crucified. But if someone should wish to argue, why was the Lord crucified there, so that His blood might drop upon the tomb of Adam, let us ask him why, then, were the other thieves crucified in the same place? From which it is clear that Calvary does not signify the tomb of the first man, but the place of the beheaded, so that where sin abounded, grace might more abound (Rom. 5). But we read in the volume of Jesus son of Navé that Adam was buried near Hebron and Arbee (Josh. 14).

<h2 id='tocuniq628'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) And they gave him vinegar to drink mixed with gall, and when he had tasted it, he would not drink. God speaks to Jerusalem: I have planted you as a true vine, how have you become bitter like a foreign vine (Jeremiah II, 21)? A bitter vine makes bitter wine, which they gave to the Lord Jesus, so that what is written may be fulfilled: They gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink (Psalm LXVIII, 22). But when it is said, 'And when he had tasted, he did not want to drink,' this indicates that he did indeed taste the bitterness of death for us, but on the third day he rose again.

<h2 id='tocuniq629'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Verse 35.) And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided my garments among themselves, and upon my vesture they cast lots. And this was prophesied in the same psalm: They divided my garments among themselves, and upon my vesture they cast lots (Psalm 22:18).

<h2 id='tocuniq630'>(Vers. 36.)</h2>

(Verse 36.) And they kept watch over him while he was sitting. The diligence of the soldiers and priests helps us so that the greater and more evident power of his resurrection may appear.

<h2 id='tocuniq631'>(Vers. 37.)</h2>

(Verse 37.) And they placed over his head the charge against him, written, 'This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.' I cannot sufficiently admire the magnitude of the matter, that, for the sake of the redeemed, with a false accusation and having incited the unfortunate people to sedition and outcry, they found no other cause for his execution except that he was the King of the Jews. And perhaps they did this in mockery and ridicule. However, Pilate also responded unwillingly, 'What I have written, I have written.' Whether you want it or not, Jews, a crowd of all nations responds to you: Jesus is the king of the Jews, that is, the emperor of believers and confessors.

<h2 id='tocuniq632'>(Vers. 38.)</h2>

(Verse 38.) Then they crucified him with two thieves, one on his right hand, and one on his left. If Golgotha is the hill of Adam and not the place of the condemned, and therefore the Lord is crucified there to raise up Adam, why are the two thieves crucified in that same place?

<h2 id='tocuniq633'>(Vers. 39 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 39 seqq.) And those passing by were blaspheming him, shaking their heads, and saying, 'Vah! You who destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days, save yourself; if you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.' Similarly, the chief priests, mocking with the scribes and elders, said, 'He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him; for he said, "I am the Son of God."' But he, mocking, says that the foolish people had produced false witnesses.

<h2 id='tocuniq634'>(Vers. 42.)</h2>

(Verse 42.) He saved others, but he cannot save himself. Even unwillingly, the scribes and Pharisees confess that he saved others. Therefore, your own judgment condemns you. For if he, who saved others, had wanted to, he could have saved himself.

<h2 id='tocuniq635'>(Vers. 43.)</h2>

(V. 43) If he is the king of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusted in God; let Him deliver him now if He wants. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.' A fraudulent promise. What is more difficult, to come down from the cross while still alive, or to rise from the grave when dead? He has risen, and you did not believe. Therefore, even if he were to come down from the cross, you would not believe. But it seems to me that demons are sending him this message. For as soon as the Lord was crucified, they sensed the power of the cross and understood that their powers had been broken. And they are doing this in order for him to come down from the cross. But the Lord, knowing the snares of his adversaries, remains on the cross to destroy the devil.



<h2 id='tocuniq636'>(Vers. 44.)</h2>

(Verse 44) Now even the robbers who were crucified with him were reviling him. Here, in a figurative sense known as σύλληψις, both robbers are depicted as blaspheming him. However, Luke asserts that while one blasphemed, the other confessed, and contrary to expectations, rebuked the blasphemer (Luke 23). It is not that the Gospels are inconsistent; rather, both robbers initially blasphemed, but then, as the sun set and the earth shook, and with rocks splitting and darkness descending, one believed in Jesus and rectified his previous denial with a subsequent confession. Among the two thieves, both the Gentiles and the Jews initially blasphemed the Lord. Later, one of them, struck by the magnitude of the signs, repented and to this day scolds the Jews for blaspheming.

<h2 id='tocuniq637'>(Vers. 45.)</h2>

(Verse 45) But at the sixth hour, darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. Those who wrote against the Gospels suspect a solar eclipse, which usually occurs at certain fixed times, as the reason for the disciples of Christ being misunderstood about the resurrection of the Lord: since a solar eclipse only occurs when the moon is rising. However, there is no doubt that during the time of Passover, the moon was full. And so it would not seem that the shadow of the earth, or the opposite side of the moon, made brief and rusty darkness, is placed in a space of three hours, so that every opportunity of causing harm is removed. And I think this was done in order to fulfill the prophecy, saying: The sun shall go down at noon, and it shall be dark over the earth in broad daylight (Amos 8:9); and in another place: The sun went down while it was still day (Jeremiah 15:9). And it seems to me that the most radiant light of the world, that is, the greater luminary, withdrew its rays so as not to see the Lord hanging, or so that the wicked blasphemers might not enjoy their own light.

<h2 id='tocuniq638'>(Vers. 46.)</h2>

(Verse 46.) And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lammasabacthani, which means: My God, My God, why have you forsaken me? He made use of the beginning of the twenty-first psalm, and that which is read in the middle of the verse: Look upon me, for it is useless. For it is read in Hebrew: My God, My God, why have you forsaken me? Therefore, those who think that this psalm is spoken from the perspective of David, Esther, or Mordecai are wicked, since the evangelists also understand the testimonies taken from it concerning the Savior, as in: They divided my garments among themselves, and for my clothing they cast lots. And another thing: They pierced my hands and my feet. Do not be surprised at the lowly words and the complaints of one who is forsaken, when you see the form of a servant and the scandal of the cross.

<h2 id='tocuniq639'>(Vers. 47.)</h2>

(Verse 47.) But some of those standing there, when they heard it, said: This man is calling Elijah. Not all, but some whom I believe were Roman soldiers, not understanding the nature of the Hebrew language, but from what he said: Eli, Eli, thinking that he was calling Elijah. But if we want to understand the Jews who said this, they do this in their usual way, to dishonor the Lord of weakness, who invokes the aid of Elijah.



<h2 id='tocuniq640'>(Vers. 48.)</h2>

(Verse 48.) And immediately one of them, running, filled a sponge with vinegar and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. And these things were done so that the prophecy would be fulfilled: They gave me vinegar for my thirst (Psalm 68:22). Even to this day, the Jews and all the unbelievers give Jesus vinegar and gall to drink on the Sunday of his resurrection; and they give him wine mixed with myrrh to make him sleepy, so that he does not see their evil.

<h2 id='tocuniq641'>(Vers. 50.)</h2>

(Verse 50.) But Jesus, again crying out with a loud voice, gave up his spirit. It is a sign of divine power to release the spirit, as he himself also said: No one can take my life from me; but I lay it down of my own accord, and I will take it up again (John 10:18).

<h2 id='tocuniq642'>(Vers. 51.)</h2>

(Verse 51.) And behold, the veil of the Temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The veil of the Temple was torn, and all the sacred mysteries of the Law, which were previously covered, were revealed and passed on to the Gentile people. In the Gospel, which we often mention, we read that the threshold of the Temple, of infinite size, was broken and divided. Josephus also reports that the angelic powers, the former guardians of the Temple, together cried out: Let us leave these seats.



<h2 id='tocuniq643'>(Vers. 52.)</h2>

(Verse 52) And the earth shook, and the rocks were split, and the tombs were opened. There is no doubt that this signifies, literally, the magnitude of the signs, such as the crucified Lord and the heavens and the earth, demonstrating everything. But it seems to me that the earthquake and the rest symbolize the belief of the believers, who, having abandoned the vices of their past errors and softened the hardness of their hearts, who were previously like the tombs of the dead, have now recognized the Creator.



<h2 id='tocuniq644'>(Vers. 53.)</h2>

(Verse 53.) And many bodies of saints who had fallen asleep were raised. And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many. Just as Lazarus, who was dead, rose again, so too many bodies of saints rose again to show the rising of the Lord (John 11). And yet, although the tombs were opened, they did not rise before the Lord rose, so that he would be the firstborn of the resurrection from the dead. But let us understand the holy city, in which they [the risen ones] were seen, either as the heavenly Jerusalem, or as this earthly one, which was previously holy. Just as Matthew is called a tax collector, not because he still remains a tax collector, but because he retains the former title. The city of Jerusalem was called holy because of the temple and the holy of holies, and in distinction from other cities where idols were worshipped. When it is said 'truly', they appeared to many, it is shown that the resurrection was not general, which would appear to everyone: but specific to many, so that those who were worthy could see.

<h2 id='tocuniq645'>(Vers. 54.)</h2>

(Verse 54) But the centurion and those who were with him, guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that were happening, were very afraid, saying: Truly, this was the Son of God. In another Gospel, after the earthquake, a more clear cause of the centurion's miracle is explained: when he saw him breathe his last, he said: Truly, this was the Son of God. For no one has the power to dismiss the spirit except the one who is the creator of souls. But in this place, let us understand spirit as the soul, either because it constitutes a spiritual and vital body, or because the substance of the soul itself is a spirit, according to what is written: 'You will take away their spirit, and they will die' (Psalm 103:29). And it should be considered that the centurion, before the cross, truly confesses the Son of God in the scandal of his passion, while Arius preaches a creature in the Church.

<h2 id='tocuniq646'>(Vers. 55, 56.)</h2>

(Verse 55, 56.) And there were many women there from afar who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him; among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Joseph's mother, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. It was a Jewish custom, and it was not considered wrong according to the ancient customs of the gentiles, for women to provide food and clothing to their teachers out of their own means. Paul mentioned that he had rejected this because it could cause scandal among the nations. For he himself says: Do we not have the power to lead about sisters, women, as the other Apostles do? And the Lord commanded that they ministered of the substance they had, to support their carnal needs, which they themselves were able to provide for their spiritual needs. Not that the Lord needed the food of creatures, but to show by example to teachers that they should be content with the food and clothing provided by their disciples. But let us see what companions he had: Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons, and Mary the mother of James, and Joseph's mother, the sister of Mary, the mother of the Lord, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee, who had asked just a little before for a kingdom for her children, and others whom we read about in the other Gospels (Luke 8).



<h2 id='tocuniq647'>(Vers. 57, 58.)</h2>

(Verse 57, 58.) And when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given. The mention of Joseph being rich is not to boast of the writer, but to show why he was able to obtain Jesus' body from Pilate. It would not have been possible for a poor and unknown person to approach Pilate, the governor of Roman authority, and obtain the body of someone who had been crucified. In another passage of the Evangelist (Luke 23), Joseph is called βουλευτὴς, that is, counselor, and some believe that the first psalm was composed about him: Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, and so on.

<h2 id='tocuniq648'>(Vers. 59.)</h2>

(Verse 59.) And taking the body, Joseph wrapped it in a clean linen cloth. Through the simple burial of the Lord, the ambition of the rich is condemned, who cannot even be without riches in their tombs. However, we can understand spiritually and also feel that the body of the Lord should be wrapped not in gold, gems, and silk, but in pure linen cloth; although this also signifies that he wrapped Jesus in a clean linen cloth, who received him with a pure mind.



<h2 id='tocuniq649'>(Vers. 60.)</h2>

(Verse 60) And he placed it in his new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock, and rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. The new tomb could be understood as a symbol that after the resurrection, being mistaken for someone else among the other bodies that remained, would not have occurred. It can also represent the virgin womb of Mary: the stone placed at the entrance, and the large stone, showing that the tomb could not be opened without the help of many people.



<h2 id='tocuniq650'>(Vers. 61 seqq.)</h2>

(V. 61 seqq.) Now there was there Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, sitting opposite the sepulchre. And on the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together to Pilate, saying: Lord, we remember that that seducer said, while he was yet alive: After three days I will rise again. But the rest having left the Lord, the women persevered in their duty, expecting what Jesus had promised; and therefore they were the first to see the risen Lord, for he who perseveres to the end shall be saved (Matthew 10:22; 24:13).



<h2 id='tocuniq651'>(Vers. 64 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 64 and following) Therefore, command that the tomb be guarded until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first." Pilate said to them, "You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can." So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard. It was not enough for the chief priests, scribes, and Pharisees to have crucified the Lord and Savior, unless they also guarded the tomb, took a cohort, sealed the stone, and opposed their hands to the one rising, so that their diligence would benefit our faith: For the more it is kept hidden, the more the power of the resurrection is revealed. And in the new monument, which had been cut out of the rock, He was buried, so that if it had been built with many stones, the foundation of the tomb being dug up, it could be easily taken away by thieves. But as for where He was to be placed in the tomb, there is the testimony of the prophet, saying: He shall dwell in the rocky cave which is the strongest rock (Isaiah 33:16). And immediately after two verses, it follows: You shall see the King with glory (Ibid., 17).



<h2 id='tocuniq652'>(Chap. XXVIII.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 28, Verse 1) But on the evening of the Sabbath, which dawns on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. The fact that different times of these women are described in the Gospels is not a sign of falsehood, as the wicked claim, but rather the diligent duty of visitation, as they frequently go and come back, and do not allow themselves to be away from the Lord's tomb for a long time or further.

<h2 id='tocuniq653'>(Vers. 2, 3.)</h2>

(Vers. 2, 3.) And behold, there was a great earthquake. For an Angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and approaching, rolled away the stone, and sat upon it. And His appearance was like lightning, and His garment like snow. Our Lord, the one and the same Son of God and Son of Man, according to both natures, divinity and flesh, now demonstrates signs of His greatness and humility. Therefore, even in this place, though He is a man who was crucified, who was buried, who was confined in a tomb, whom a stone held back, yet the things that happen outside reveal the Son of God: the sun fleeing, darkness falling, the earth shaking, the veil torn, rocks split, the dead raised, the ministry of angels, which from the beginning of His nativity confirmed Him as God. Gabriel came to Mary, while Joseph speaks with the angel; the same announces it to the shepherds, afterwards the chorus of angels is heard saying: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will (Luke II). He is tempted in solitude, and after victory immediately served by angels. Now also the Angel comes, the guardian of the Lord's tomb, and in white garments signifies the glory of the triumphant. Moreover, as the Lord ascends to heaven, two angels are seen on the Mount of Olives, promising the apostles according to the Saviour's coming (Acts I).


<h2 id='tocuniq654'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

(Vers. 4, 5.) However, because of his fear, the guards were terrified and became like dead men. But the angel, responding, said to the women: Do not be afraid. For I know that you seek Jesus, who was crucified: He is not here, for he has risen as he said. The guards, terrified by fear, lie stupefied like dead men, and yet the angel comforts not them, but the women. Do not be afraid. Let them, he says, fear: let fear continue in those in whom unbelief persists. Furthermore, because you seek Jesus who was crucified, listen to the fact that He has risen and fulfilled the promises.

<h2 id='tocuniq655'>(Vers. 6, 7.)</h2>

(Vers. 6, 7.) Come and see the place where the Lord was laid. And quickly going, say to his disciples. That if you do not believe my words, you may believe in the empty tomb, and go with quick steps and announce to his disciples.

Because he has risen, and behold, he goes before you to Galilee: there you will see him: behold, I have told you.

<h2 id='tocuniq656'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) And they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, running to tell his disciples. The women's minds were filled with mixed emotions, fear and joy: one because of the greatness of the miracle, the other out of longing for the risen one; and yet both stirred up a feminine fervor. They went to the apostles, so that through them the seed of faith might be scattered.

<h2 id='tocuniq657'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) And behold, Jesus met them, saying: Greetings. Those who were searching, those who were running in this manner, deserved to meet the risen Lord, and first to hear, Greetings: so that the curse of the woman Eve would be overturned in women.

But they drew near and held his feet, and adored him. These came near and held his feet, because they adored him. But she, who sought the living among the dead, and still did not know that the Son of God had risen, rightly hears: Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father (John 20:17).

<h2 id='tocuniq658'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) Then Jesus said to them, 'Do not be afraid. And in the old and new Testament, this must always be observed: that when a more august (or narrower) vision appears, fear is first dispelled so that, with the mind calmed, the things that are said can be heard.'

Go, tell my brothers to go to Galilee, there they will see me. And when they had gone, behold, some of the guards came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened. These brothers, of whom he spoke elsewhere: I will announce your name to my brothers (Ps. XXI, 23): who do not see the Savior in Judea, but in the multitude of the Gentiles.

(Vers. 12 seqq.) And when they were gathered with the elders, after taking counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, saying: Tell them that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep. And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble. So they took the money and did as they were instructed. And the story spread among the Jews to this day. The guards confessed the miracle: they returned to the city and reported to the chief priests all that they had seen and experienced. Those who were supposed to convert to repentance and seek the risen Jesus persist in wickedness, and they turn the money that was given for the use of the temple into the redemption of lies, just as they had previously given thirty pieces of silver to Judas the betrayer. Therefore, all those who misuse the temple offerings and those things that are given for the use of the church for other purposes, in order to fulfill their own desires, are similar to the scribes and priests who bought the lie and the Savior's blood.



<h2 id='tocuniq660'>(Vers. 16, 17.)</h2>

(Verse 16, 17.) However, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted. After the resurrection, Jesus is seen on a mountain in Galilee and is worshipped there; although some doubt, their doubt strengthens our faith. Then he shows himself more clearly to Thomas and shows him the wound in his side from the spear and the nails in his hands.

<h2 id='tocuniq661'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Ver. 18.) And Jesus came to them and spoke, saying: All power has been given to me in heaven and on earth. The power was given to him who was recently crucified, who was buried in a tomb, who had been dead, and who later rose again. Power has been given in heaven and on earth, so that he who previously reigned in heaven may now reign on earth through the faith of believers.

<h2 id='tocuniq662'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) Therefore, go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. First they teach all nations, then they immerse the instructed ones in water. For it cannot be that the body receives the sacrament of baptism unless the soul has first embraced the truth with faith. But they are baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, so that there may be one divinity among them, one bestowal: and the name of the Trinity is one God.



<h2 id='tocuniq663'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. The main order: He commanded the apostles to first teach all nations, then to immerse them in the sacrament of faith, and after faith and baptism, to command what should be observed. And lest we think that what has been commanded is light and few, he added: All things whatsoever I have commanded you. So that whoever believes, who has been baptized in the Trinity, may do all the things that are commanded.


And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age. He who promises to be with his disciples until the end of the age, and shows them that they will always be victorious, and that he will never leave those who believe in him. But he who promises his presence until the end of the world, does not ignore the day when he knows he will be with the apostles.
