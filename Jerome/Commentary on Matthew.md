<h2 id='tocuniq2'>Prologue</h2>

The Commentaries on the Gospel of Matthew by Saint Jerome of Stridon, a Presbyter. Four Books addressed to Eusebius.

There were indeed many who attempted to arrange the narrative of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning and ministers of the word handed them down to us. And up to the present time, the persistence of these accounts demonstrates that diverse authors have produced the beginnings of various heresies, such as that of the Egyptians, Thomas, Matthew, Bartholomew, and the twelve apostles, as well as Basilides, Appelles, and others, whom it would be too lengthy to enumerate. However, it is necessary to say at present that there have been some who, without the spirit and grace of God, have attempted to arrange the narrative more than to weave the truth of history. To whom can that prophecy be applied? Woe to those who prophesy from their own heart, who follow their own spirit and have said, 'This is what the Lord says,' when the Lord has not sent them (Ezekiel 13:3). The Savior also spoke about them in the Gospel of John: All who came before me were thieves and robbers (John 10:8). They came on their own, not sent by God. For he himself says, 'They were coming to me, but I did not send them' (Jeremiah 14:14; and 23:21). To those who come, presumption is rashness; to those who are sent, obedience is servitude. But the Church, which is founded upon the rock of the Lord's voice, which the king introduced into his chamber (Song of Songs, 1 and 2), and to which he reached out his hand through the hidden opening (Song of Songs, 5), is like a damsel and a little deer (Song of Songs, 2:9), pouring forth four rivers like the paradise (Genesis 2), and having four corners and rings, through which, like the Ark of the Covenant and the guardian of the Law of the Lord, it is carried on immovable wood (Exodus 25:10ff).


Matthew, a tax collector by the name of Levi, is the first of all, who published the Gospel in Judea in the Hebrew language, for the sake of those who had believed in Jesus from the Jews, and did not keep the shadow of the Law once the truth of the Gospel succeeded. Mark is the second, the interpreter of the Apostle Peter, and the first bishop of the Church in Alexandria. He himself did not see the Lord and Savior, but narrated the things he heard the teacher preach, not in chronological order but according to the faith of the deeds. Tertius Lucas, a physician from Antioch, Syria (whose praise is in the Gospel), who himself was a disciple of the Apostle Paul, wrote a volume in the regions of Achaia and Boeotia (2 Corinthians VIII), delving deeper into some matters and, as he confesses in the preface, describing things he heard more than things he saw. The last Apostle and Evangelist, John, whom Jesus loved greatly, who reclined on the Lord's chest (John XIII and XXI), drank from the pure streams of teachings and was the only one who deserved to hear from the cross: Behold your mother (John XIX, 27)." } When he was in Asia, and now when the seeds of heretics were sprouting, Cerinthus, Ebion, and the others who deny that Christ came in the flesh (whom he himself calls antichrists in his letter (1 John 2:18), and the apostle Paul frequently rebukes (Romans 3; 2 Corinthians 5)), he was compelled by almost all the bishops of Asia at that time, and by delegations from many Churches, to write more deeply about the divinity of the Savior and to burst forth, not so much audaciously as luckily, to the very Word of God Himself, as it were. And the Ecclesiastica history recounts that when he was asked by the brothers to write, he responded that he would do so if they all prayed to God in common after a fast was declared. And when this was done and he was filled with divine revelation, he burst forth upon coming to that introduction with these words: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God' (John 1). These four Gospels, therefore, are proven by the book of Ezekiel, in which the first vision is described as follows: 'In the midst of the likeness of the four living creatures, their faces were like those of men, and the face of a lion, and the face of a calf, and the face of an eagle' (Ezekiel 1:5 and 10). The first appearance of man signifies Matthew, who began to write as it were about a man: The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham (Matthew 1). The second signifies Mark, in which the voice of a roaring lion is heard: The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight (Mark 1:3). The third signifies the calf, which foreshadows the beginning that the evangelist Luke took from the priest Zacharias. In the fourth (Gospel), John the evangelist, who had eagle's wings and was hastening to higher things, discusses the Word of God. The other things which follow in the same sense advance. Their legs were straight, and they had feathered feet, and wherever the spirit went, they went, and did not turn back. And their backs were full of eyes, and sparks and lamps were running in their midst, and wheel within wheel, and in each of the four faces. Hence the Revelation of John, after the exposition of the twenty-four elders who were holding harps and bowls, worshiped (or adore) the Lamb of God. It introduces flashes of lightning and thunder, and seven spirits running, and a glassy sea, and four living creatures full of eyes (Rev. IV and V), saying: The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature was like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle. And after a little while: Their eyes were full and had no rest day and night, saying: Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come (Apoc. IV, 7, 8). It is clearly shown to all that only the four Gospels should be accepted, and all the nonsense of the apocrypha should be sung to the dead heretics rather than the living Church. And I am amazed, dearest Eusebius, why, suddenly sailing to Rome, you wanted me to give you this book as a gift, so that I could briefly explain Matthew, summarize it in words, and expand on its meaning. If you remember my response, you would never ask for a matter of years in a few days. Firstly, it is difficult to read all those who have written on the Gospels 7-8. Secondly, it is much more difficult, with critical judgment, to accept what is best. I admit that I read many years ago the twenty-five volumes of Origen on Matthew, as well as his Homilies, and the comical genre of interpretation; and the Commentaries of Theophilus, Bishop of the city of Antioch; also those of Hippolytus, Theodore of Heraclea, Apollinaris of Laodicea, and Didymus of Alexandria; and of the Latins, the writings of Hilary, Victorinus, and Fortunatianus, among which even if I were to carp at something small, something worthy would be written in memory. But you, in these two weeks, with Easter approaching and the winds blowing, force me to dictate, so that when the notaries take note, when the documents are written, when they are corrected, how they are arranged to be clean, especially since you know that I have been ill for three months, so that I can barely start walking now; and I cannot compensate for the extent of the work with the brevity of time. Therefore, disregarding the authority of the Ancients, whom I have neither the opportunity to read nor to follow, I have briefly arranged the historical interpretation that you especially demanded: and at times I have mixed in flowers of spiritual insight, reserving the complete work for the future. But if my life is prolonged, or if you fulfill your promises upon your return, then I will strive to complete what remains, nay, I will lay the foundations and partly construct the walls, and place a most beautiful finishing touch, so that you may know the difference between sudden boldness in speaking and studious diligence in writing. Surely you know, and I would be ashamed to call you a witness to my falsehood, that I have dictated this little work with such speed that you might think I write more readily what others have written than what I have composed myself. And do not think that this is said out of arrogance and confidence in my own intelligence, but rather because I desire to show you how highly I regard you. I would rather risk being criticized by the learned than deny anything to you, who diligently ask for something. Therefore, I beg you to attribute any clumsiness in my speech or any deviation from the usual style to haste rather than lack of skill, and provide copies when you come to Rome, to the Virgin Princess of Christ, who asked me to write a Commentary on the Song of Songs. Due to a long illness, I have postponed this work for the future. And under this condition, I bind you, so that if you keep the letters I wrote to you, she should also keep the letters that she will write to her own little chest afterwards.


<h2 id='tocuniq3'>First Book</h2>

First Book

<h2 id='tocuniq4'>9 (Caput I.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

9 (Chapter 1, Verse 1) The book of the generation of Jesus Christ. In Isaiah we read: Who shall declare his generation? (Isaiah 53:8). Therefore, we should not think that the Evangelist contradicts the prophet, so that what he said was impossible, he begins to narrate here, because there it was said about the generation of divinity, here it is said about the incarnation. But he begins with the carnal, so that we may begin to say that God is also man.

The sons of David, the sons of Abraham. Abraham begot Isaac. Isaac, however, begot Jacob. Jacob, however, begot Judah and his brothers. The order is reversed, but necessarily altered. For if Abraham had been placed first, and then David, Abraham would have needed to be repeated in order to complete the series of generations. Therefore, leaving aside the others, he called them his sons because the promise of Christ was made only to them, to Abraham: 'In your seed, all nations will be blessed' (Gen. XXII, 18), which is Christ. To David: Of the fruit of your womb I will set upon your throne. (Ps. 131:11)

<h2 id='tocuniq5'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) But Judas begot Phares and Zaram from Thamar. Phares begot Esron. Esron begot Aram. Aram begot Aminadab. Aminadab begot Naasson. It should be noted in the genealogy of the Savior that no holy women are included, but rather those whom Scripture reproves, for he came for sinners, being born of sinners, to erase the sins of all. Therefore, in the following genealogy, Ruth the Moabite and Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, are mentioned.


<h2 id='tocuniq6'>(Vers. 4 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 4 and following) Naasson begot Salmon. Salmon begot Boaz from Rahab. Boaz begot Obed from Ruth. Obed begot Jesse. Jesse begot King David. David begot Solomon from the woman who had been Uriah's wife. Solomon begot Rehoboam. Rehoboam begot Abijah. Abijah begot Asa. Asa begot Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat begot Joram. This is Naasson, the chief of the tribe of Judah, as we read in the Book of Numbers (Num. 1 and 2).


But Joram begot Oziam. Ozias begot Joathan. Joathan begot Achaz. Achaz begot Ezechiam. Ezechias begot Manassen. Manasses begot Amon. Amon begot Josiam. Josias begot Jechoniam and his brothers in the Babylonian exile. In the fourth book of Kings (Chapters III, VIII and following) we read that Joram was begotten by Ochoziam, and when he died, Josabeth, daughter of King Joram and sister of Ochozia, took Joas, the son of her brother, and rescued him from the death inflicted by Athaliah. His son Amaziah succeeded him as king, followed by his son Azariah, also known as Uzziah (or Ahaziah). His son Jotham succeeded him. You see, according to historical records, there were three kings in between, whom the Evangelist omitted: Jehoram did not father Uzziah, but Ahaziah, and the others we listed. However, because the purpose of the Evangelist was to present the three fourteens in different periods of time, and Jehoram had mixed in with the wicked Jezebel, his memory is erased up to the third generation, so it would not be included in the order of the Holy Nativity.


<h2 id='tocuniq7'>(Vers. 12 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 12 ff.) And after the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah fathered Salathiel. Salathiel fathered Zerubbabel. Zerubbabel fathered Abiud. Abiud fathered Eliakim. Eliakim fathered Azor. Azor fathered Sadoc. Sadoc fathered Achim. Achim fathered Eliud. Eliud fathered Eleazar. Eleazar fathered Matthan. Matthan fathered Jacob. If we include Jechoniah at the end of the first fourteen generations, in the next there will not be fourteen, but thirteen. Therefore, let us know that Jechoniah is the same as Joacim: the former is written with 'c' and 'm', while the latter is written with 'ch' and 'n', which has been confused by the error of scribes and the passage of time among the Greeks and the Latins.

<h2 id='tocuniq8'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16) But Jacob fathered Joseph. Julianus Augustus objects to us at this point the discordance of the Evangelists, why the evangelist Matthew said that Joseph is the son of Jacob, and Luke called him the son of Heli, not understanding the custom of the Scriptures, that one according to nature, the other according to the Law is his father. For we know this through Moses, by God's command, as a precept, that if a brother or relative without children dies, another should take his wife to raise up offspring for his brother or relative (Deuteronomy 25). Both Africanus, a historian of his time, and Eusebius of Caesarea extensively discussed the discrepancies in the Gospels in their books.

<h2 id='tocuniq9'>(Vers 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) The husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. When you hear the word 'husband,' do not suspect anything about marriage, but remember the custom of the Scriptures, that husbands are called spouses, and wives are called wives.

<h2 id='tocuniq10'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Ver. 18.) And from the deportation to Babylon to Christ, there are fourteen generations. Count from Jechoniah to Joseph, and you will find thirteen generations. Therefore, the fourteenth generation will be considered as Christ himself.

But the generation of Christ was like this. Let the diligent reader ask and say: Since Joseph is not the father of the Lord and Savior, what does the order of the generation have to do with Joseph? To this we will respond first, that it is not the custom of the Scriptures to trace the order of women in generations. Then, Joseph and Mary were from the same tribe: hence, according to the Law, she had to be regarded as a close relative, and that they were both registered in Bethlehem, being generated from the same lineage.


When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, why was she conceived not by a simple Virgin, but by a betrothed one? First, so that through the genealogy, Joseph's origin would be shown as Mary's. Second, so that she would not be stoned by the Jews as an adulteress. Third, so that, fleeing into Egypt, she would have the comfort of a husband. The martyr Ignatius also added a fourth reason why she was conceived by a betrothed one: so that the birth, he says, could be hidden from the devil, who thought that He was born not of a Virgin, but of a wife.


Before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. She was found to be pregnant by Joseph, who knew everything about his future wife through nearly marital consent. However, what is said, Before they came together, does not imply that they later came together; but Scripture shows that it did not happen.

<h2 id='tocuniq11'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19) But Joseph, her husband, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. As he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: “Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel” (which means, God with us). When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.


<h2 id='tocuniq12'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son. And as we have said before, the word 'spouse' is used for wives, which is more fully taught against Helvidius. And with a gentle affection, an Angel speaks to him in a dream to confirm the righteousness of silence. At the same time, it should be noted that Joseph is said to be the son of David, so that Mary would also be shown to be from the line of David.


<h2 id='tocuniq13'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) And you shall call his name Jesus. For he will save his people from their sins. Jesus, in the Hebrew language, means Savior. Therefore, the evangelist indicated the etymology of his name, saying: You shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people.

<h2 id='tocuniq14'>(Vers. 22 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 22 and following) But all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him. And Matthew the evangelist says, she shall be with child, which was written by the prophet, she shall conceive. But the prophet, because he predicts the future, signifies what will happen, and he writes, he will receive: but the evangelist, because he narrates a past history, not a future event, changed 'will receive' to 'has received', and put 'will have'. For he who has, will by no means receive. We read something similar in the Psalms: "Ascending on high, he led captivity captive: he received gifts among men" (Ps. 68:18). When the apostle cited this testimony, he did not say 'received', but 'gave', because there it signified a future event that he would receive; here it narrates the history of the one who had already given what he had received.


<h2 id='tocuniq15'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) And he took his wife, and he did not know her until she gave birth to her firstborn son; and he called his name Jesus. From this passage, some wickedly suspect and claim that Mary had other children, saying that firstborn is not said unless one has brothers: whereas this is the custom of the divine Scriptures, that they do not call the firstborn him whom 14 brothers follow, but him who is born first. Read the aforementioned book against Helvidius.


<h2 id='tocuniq16'>(Chap. II.—Vers. 2 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 2 — Verses 2 and following) For we have seen his star in the East, and have come to worship him. When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And he gathered together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, and inquired of them where Christ would be born. To confuse the Jews, so that they might learn of the birth of Christ from the Gentiles, a star rises in the East, which the successors of Balaam, who were familiar with his prophecy, had known would happen. Read the Book of Numbers (Chapter XXIV). Now the wise men were led by the stars to Judea, so that when the priests were asked by the wise men where Christ would be born, they would be without excuse concerning His coming.

<h2 id='tocuniq17'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) But they said to him: in Bethlehem of Judea. For thus it is written by the prophet: And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the leaders of Judah. For from you shall come forth a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel. This is an error of the scribes. For we think it was first written by the evangelist, as we read in the Hebrew itself, Judah, not Judea. For what is the Bethlehem of other nations, that here it should be distinguished as Bethlehem of Judea? But it is written 'Judae' because there is another Bethlehem in Galilee. Read the book of Joshua, the son of Nun (Joshua 19). Finally, even in the very testimony, which is taken from the prophecy of Micah, it is thus stated: And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah (Micah 5:2).

<h2 id='tocuniq18'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) And opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh. The sacrament of the most beautiful gifts is captured by Juvencus the priest in one verse:

Thus, they bring gifts of gold, myrrh, and frankincense to the king, the people, and to God.

And having received a response in a dream, they did not return to Herod, but went back to their own country by another route, etc. Those who had offered gifts to the Lord subsequently receive a response. However, the response (which in Greek is called χρηματισθέντες) is not made through an angel, but through the Lord himself, in order to demonstrate the merit of Joseph. They return by another route, because they were not inclined to join in the unfaithfulness of the Jews.


<h2 id='tocuniq19'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verses 13, 14) Behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying: Get up and take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For it will happen that Herod will seek the child to destroy him. So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother at night, and went to Egypt; and he stayed there until the death of Herod. When he takes the child and his mother to go to Egypt, he does so at night and in darkness; but when he returns to Judea, neither night nor darkness is mentioned in the Gospel.


<h2 id='tocuniq20'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Vers. 15, 16.) So that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: Out of Egypt I called my son. Then Herod, seeing that he had been fooled by the wise men, became very angry; and sending, he killed all the boys who were in Bethlehem, and in all its territories, from two years old and under, according to the time that he had diligently inquired from the wise men. Let those who deny the truth of the Hebrew scriptures answer where this is read in the Septuagint translators. But when they do not find it, we will tell them that it is written in the prophet Hosea (Chap. 11), as they can also prove from the copies we have recently published. However, we can reconcile ((or console)) this passage differently for the contentious, whose behavior the Apostle Paul denies having. We also bring forward the testimony from Numbers, with Balaam saying: God has called him out of Egypt; his glory is like that of a wild ox (Num. XXIII, 22).


<h2 id='tocuniq21'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 17 and following) Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying: A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not (Jeremiah 31:15). But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying: Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel. Out of Rachel was born Benjamin, in whose tribe Bethlehem is not (Genesis 35). So the question is, how does Rachel weep for the sons of Judah, that is, Bethlehem, as if they were her own? We will answer briefly, because she is buried near Bethlehem in Ephrath, and she received her name from her mother's lodging place. Either because Judah and Benjamin were two joined tribes, and Herod had ordered not only the killing of the children in Bethlehem, but also in all its borders. By the killing of Bethlehem, we mean that many of Benjamin were also killed. But he weeps for his sons, and does not receive consolation, according to a twofold understanding. Either because he considered them to be dead forever, or because he did not want to be comforted concerning those whom he knew would survive. And what is said in Rama, let us not think that the name of the place is, near Gabaa, but Rama is interpreted as elevated, so that the sense may be: A voice was heard on high, that is, widely and far and wide.

<h2 id='tocuniq22'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20.) For those who sought the life of the child are dead. From this passage we understand that not only Herod, but also the priests and scribes at the same time had planned the death of the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq23'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) He arose and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. He did not say, 'I took my son and my wife,' but the child and his mother, as if a caregiver, not a husband.

<h2 id='tocuniq24'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) But hearing that Archelaus reigned in Judea, in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee. Many fall into error due to ignorance of history, thinking that he is the same Herod who is mocked by the Lord in his passion and who is now reported to be dead. Therefore, this Herod, who later made friends with Pilate, is the son of that Herod and the brother of Archelaus. And Tiberius Caesar himself exiled both him and his brother Herod, who became the successor of the kingdom, to Lugdunum, which is a city of the Gauls. Read the story of Joseph.

<h2 id='tocuniq25'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23.) And he came and lived in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled: 'He shall be called a Nazarene.' If he had set an example from the Scriptures, he would never have said, 'what was spoken by the prophets,' but simply, 'what was spoken by the prophet.' But now, from using the plural 'prophets,' he shows that he did not take his words from the Scriptures, but the meaning. Nazarene, saint, is interpreted. However, all of Scripture testifies that the Lord will become holy. We can also say in another way, that in the same words, according to the Hebrew truth, it is written in Isaiah: A twig will come out from the root of Jesse, and a Nazarene will ascend from his root (Isaiah 11:1).

<h2 id='tocuniq26'>(Chap. III.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter III—Verse 1) Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. John the Baptist proclaims the kingdom of heaven first, so that he may be honored as the precursor of the Lord with this privilege.

<h2 id='tocuniq27'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) For this is he who is spoken of through the prophet Isaiah, saying: 'The voice of one crying out in the desert, prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.' He prepared the souls of the believers in which the Lord would walk, so that he would walk in the purest ways, saying: 'I will dwell in them and walk among them; I will be their God, and they shall be my people' (Leviticus 26:12). Porphyry compares this passage to the beginning of the Gospel of Mark, where it is written: 'The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as it is written in the prophet Isaiah: Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.'" } The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths. (Isaiah 40:3). For even though the testimony is from Malachi (Chapter 3) and the context is from Isaiah, they ask how we can consider it as an example taken from one Isaiah. To this, the learned men of the Church have answered fully. However, we think that the name of Isaiah was added due to an error of the scribes, which we can also prove in other places, or certainly that one body has been made from various testimonies of the Scriptures. Read the thirteenth Psalm, and you will find the same.

<h2 id='tocuniq28'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) Now John himself had a garment made of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist. He said he had clothing made of hair, not wool. The type of clothing he wore indicated austerity, not luxury. The leather belt that he was girded with, like Elijah, is a symbol of mortification (IV Kings 1). Furthermore, what follows is...

But his food was locusts and wild honey. It is fitting for a dweller of solitude to fill not the delights of food, but the necessity of human flesh.

<h2 id='tocuniq29'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) God is able to raise up children of Abraham from these stones. He calls them heathen stones because of their hardness of heart. Read Ezekiel: 'I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh' (Ezekiel 36:26). In the stone, hardness is shown; in the flesh, softness is shown. It either simply indicates God's power, that he who created all things out of nothing can also bring forth a people from the hardest stones.


<h2 id='tocuniq30'>(Vers. 10, 11.)</h2>

(Verses 10, 11.) For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. I indeed baptize you with water for repentance; but he who is coming after me is mightier than I. The preaching of the Gospel, which is sharp on both sides, is called an axe, according to the prophet Jeremiah, who compares the word of the Lord to a cutting axe splitting the rock (Jeremiah 46).


Whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. In another Gospel: Whose, he says, I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal: here humility is demonstrated, there mystery is shown, that Christ is the bridegroom, and John does not deserve to untie the strap of the bridegroom, lest his house be called according to the law of Moses, and the example of Ruth, the house of the barefoot (Deut. XXV, and Ruth. IV).

<h2 id='tocuniq31'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire. This is because the Holy Spirit is like a fire, as the Acts of the Apostles teach, when it descended and appeared like tongues of fire over each of the believers (Acts 2). And the word of the Lord was fulfilled when he said, 'I have come to bring fire to the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!' (Luke 12:49)." } Whether because in the present we are baptized in the Spirit, and in the future, by fire. The Apostle also agrees with this idea, saying: The work of each one will be revealed by fire, what sort it is. (1 Corinthians 3:13).

<h2 id='tocuniq32'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verse 13, 14.) Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. But John tried to prevent him, saying: I should be baptized by you, and yet you come to me? But Jesus answered and said to him. The Savior received baptism from John for three reasons. First, because he was born as a man, to fulfill all the righteousness and humility of the Law. Second, to confirm John's baptism with his own baptism. Thirdly, as Jordan sanctifies the waters by the descent of the dove, may the Holy Spirit in the baptismal font reveal His coming to the believers.

<h2 id='tocuniq33'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15) Without hesitation. He spoke beautifully, without hesitation, to demonstrate Christ in the water, John to be baptized by Christ in the Spirit. Or in another way, without hesitation: so that as one who took on the form of a servant, I may also fulfill his humility. Otherwise, know that you must be baptized by me on the day of judgment. Without hesitation, says the Lord Jesus, I have another baptism by which I must be baptized. You baptize me in water, so that I may baptize you on behalf of me in your blood.


<h2 id='tocuniq34'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) For it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he let him go. And when Jesus was baptized, he immediately came up from the water. He did not add the righteousness of the Law or of nature, so that we may understand both: that if God received baptism from a man, no one should disdain to receive it from a servant.

<h2 id='tocuniq35'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) And behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon him. And behold, a voice from heaven said, 'This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.' The mystery of the Trinity is demonstrated in baptism: the Lord is baptized, the Spirit descends in the form of a dove, and the voice of the Father, bearing witness to the Son, is heard. The heavens are opened not by the unlocking of physical elements, but by spiritual eyes; as Ezekiel also states at the beginning of his book. And a dove also sat upon the head of Jesus, so that no one would think that the voice of the Father was directed to John and not to the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq36'>(Chap. IV.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter IV - Verse 1) Then Jesus was led into the desert by the spirit. There is no doubt that it was by the Holy Spirit. For it follows:

In order to be tempted by the devil. However, he is led not unwillingly or captured, but by the will to fight.

<h2 id='tocuniq37'>20 (Vers. 2.)</h2>

20 (V. 2.) And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward he was hungry. And the tempter came and said to him, If you are the Son of God. In this number of the forty days, the sacrament is shown to us, in which both Moses fasted on Mount Sinai (Exod. 24), and Elijah beside Mount Horeb (1 Kings 19). However, it is allowed for the body to hunger, so that there may be an opportunity for the devil to tempt.

<h2 id='tocuniq38'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) Say that these stones be made bread. It is fittingly said to the hungry: say that these stones be made bread: you tempt him with two opposing things, O devil. If these stones can be made bread at his command, then you are trying in vain the one who has such great power. But if he cannot do it, then you wrongly suspect the Son of God. If you are the Son of God, say that these stones be made bread.

<h2 id='tocuniq39'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) And he answered, saying: It is written: Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. The testimony is taken from Deuteronomy (Deut. VIII, 3). The Lord responded in this way because his purpose was to overcome the devil through humility, not power. It should also be noted that unless the Lord had begun to fast, there would not have been an opportunity for the devil to tempt him, according to the saying: Son, when you come to serve God, stand in righteousness and fear, and prepare your soul for temptation (Ecclus. II, 1)." } But the response of the Savior itself indicates that he was a man who was tempted. Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. Therefore, if anyone does not feed on the word of God, they do not live.

<h2 id='tocuniq40'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5) Then the devil took him to the holy city. This assumption, which is spoken of, did not come from the weakness of the Lord, but from the pride of the enemy, who considers the will of the Savior as a necessity. It is understood from this place what that which is written in another place means: They went into the holy city and appeared to many (Matthew 27:53).

<h2 id='tocuniq41'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6) And he set him upon the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'

If you are the Son of God. In all temptations the devil does this, to understand if you are the Son of God; but the Lord tempers the answer in such a way as to leave him ambiguous.

Send yourself downward. For it is written. The voice of the devil, who always desires all to fall downward, says, Send yourself downward, he can persuade, he cannot compel to fall.

He has commanded his angels concerning you, that they shall lift you up in their hands, lest you strike your foot against a stone. We read this in the ninety-first psalm; but there it is not about Christ, but about a holy man. Therefore, the devil misinterprets the Scriptures. Certainly, if he truly knew that it was written about the Savior, he should have also said what follows against himself in the same psalm: You will tread on the viper and the basilisk, and you will trample the lion and the dragon. He speaks of the help of angels as if to an infirm person: he is silent about his own trampling as if a deserter.

<h2 id='tocuniq42'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) Jesus said to him again: It is written: You shall not tempt the Lord your God. He breaks the false arrows of the devil with the true shields of the Scriptures. And it should be noted that he brought forth necessary testimonies only from Deuteronomy, in order to demonstrate the sacraments of the second law.

<h2 id='tocuniq43'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, and he said to him, 'All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.' The glory of the world, which is passing away with the world, is shown on the mountain and on the pinnacle. But the Lord descends to lowly and humble places to overcome the devil with humility. Furthermore, the devil hastens to lead him to mountains, so that through the mountains by which he himself fell, others may also fall, according to the saying of the Apostle: 'lest he become conceited and fall into the condemnation of the devil' (1 Timothy 3:6)." }


<h2 id='tocuniq44'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) I will give you all this, if you fall down and worship me. This arrogant and proud one also speaks of this boastfully: not that the devil has power over the whole world or can give all kingdoms, since we know that many holy men have been made kings by God. If you fall down and worship me, he says. Therefore, the one who is going to worship the devil falls down beforehand.

<h2 id='tocuniq45'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10) Then Jesus said to him, 'Go away, Satan! For it is written: Not as many suppose, Satan and the apostle Peter are condemned with the same opinion. For it is said to Peter: Get behind me, Satan (Mat. XVI, 23), that is, follow me, who are contrary to my will. But here he hears, go away, Satan, and it is not said to him, behind me, so that it may be understood, go into the eternal fire, which is prepared for you and your angels.'


You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only Him. The devil said to the Savior: if you fall down and worship me, on the contrary, it is heard that he himself should worship the Lord his God more.

<h2 id='tocuniq46'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11) Then the devil left him: and behold, angels came and ministered to him. Temptation precedes victory for it to be followed. Angels minister to confirm the dignity of the victor.

<h2 id='tocuniq47'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Verse 15, 16.) The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles: The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them a light has shined. These are the first ones who heard the Lord preaching, that where the Israelites were first taken captive by the Assyrians, there the proclamation of the Redeemer would be born.

<h2 id='tocuniq48'>(Vers. 17, 18.)</h2>

(Vers. 17, 18.) Then Jesus began to preach and say: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. And walking by the sea of Galilee, Jesus saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen. And he said to them. With John delivered, he rightly begins to preach: with the Law ending, the Gospel consequently arises. But if the Savior preaches the same things that John the Baptist had previously foretold, he shows himself to be the Son of the same God, of whom that prophet is.


<h2 id='tocuniq49'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Verse 19, 20.) Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men. And immediately they left their nets and followed him. These were the first called, to follow the Lord: fishermen and illiterate were sent to preach, so that the faith of believers would not be thought to come about by the power of God, but by eloquence and teaching.

<h2 id='tocuniq50'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24.) And he cured the lunatics and the paralyzed. And many crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judea, and from beyond the Jordan. Not truly lunatics, but those who were thought to be lunatics due to the deception of demons, who, by observing the movements of the moon, wished to defame the creation so that they might overflow with blasphemies against the Creator.

<h2 id='tocuniq51'>(Chap. V.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 5, Verses 1-2.) But seeing the crowds, Jesus went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. And opening his mouth, he taught them, saying: The Lord goes up to the mountains, so that the crowds may be drawn to higher things with him. But the crowds are not able to ascend. And the disciples follow, to whom he speaks not standing, but sitting and gathered. For they were not able to understand him shining in his majesty. According to the literal meaning, some of the simpler brothers think that he taught the Beatitudes and the rest of what follows on the Mount of Olives, which is by no means the case: for from what precedes and follows, the place is shown to be in Galilee, which we believe to be either Mount Tabor or any other lofty mountain. Finally, after he finished his discourse, immediately it follows: And when he had entered Capernaum.

<h2 id='tocuniq52'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. This is what we read elsewhere: And the humble in spirit he will save (Ps. 33:16): But lest anyone should think that poverty, which is sometimes borne out of necessity, is being preached by the Lord, he added in spirit, so that you would understand that it is humility, not destitution. Blessed are the poor in spirit, who are poor by their own will for the sake of the Holy Spirit. Hence, concerning such poor, the Savior speaks through Isaiah: The Lord has anointed me; therefore he has sent me to preach good news to the poor (Isa. 61:1)." }


<h2 id='tocuniq53'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4) Blessed are the meek, for they themselves shall inherit the earth. Not the land of Judah, nor the land of this world; not the accursed land that brings forth thorns and thistles, which the most cruel and warlike possess more; but the land that the Psalmist desires, saying: I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living. Such a possessor, and after victory, a triumphator, is also described in the forty-fourth psalm: Attend, proceed and reign prosperously: because of truth, meekness, and justice. No one possesses this land by gentleness, but by arrogance.

<h2 id='tocuniq54'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5) Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. This mourning is not for the dead, according to the common law of nature, but for the sins and vices of the dead. Thus, Samuel wept for Saul because he regretted that God had anointed him king over Israel (1 Samuel 15). So too, the apostle Paul says that he weeps and mourns for those who have not repented after committing fornication and impurity (2 Corinthians 12).

<h2 id='tocuniq55'>24 (Vers. 6.)</h2>

24 (Verse 6.) Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. It is not enough for us to desire justice, unless we also endure the hunger for justice: so that, under this example, we may never consider ourselves fully just, but always understand the hunger for the works of justice.

<h2 id='tocuniq56'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy. Mercy is not only understood in acts of charity, but also in bearing the burdens of one another's sins (Galatians 6).

<h2 id='tocuniq57'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Those who are not accused by any conscience of sin. The pure in heart are seen by the pure: the temple of God cannot be defiled.

<h2 id='tocuniq58'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God. They first make peace in their own hearts, and then among their discordant brethren. For what good is it to pacify others through you, when there are wars of vices in your own soul?

<h2 id='tocuniq59'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. He specifically added (or says), for righteousness' sake. For many indeed suffer persecution for their own sins and are not righteous. Also, consider that the blessedness of true circumcision is concluded with martyrdom.

<h2 id='tocuniq60'>(Vers 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. That curse should be despised which creates blessedness, which is falsely uttered by the mouth of one who curses. Hence, he specially defined what should be the blessed curse: every curse uttered against you falsely on my account. Where Christ is therefore the cause, there also is the desirable curse.


<h2 id='tocuniq61'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. For so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. I do not know who among us can fulfill this, that our reputation be torn apart by insults, and yet we rejoice in the Lord. Those who pursue empty glory cannot fulfill this. Therefore, we must rejoice and be glad, so that a reward may be prepared for us in heavenly things. We elegantly read in a certain volume: 'Do not seek glory, and you will not grieve when you are without glory.'" } »

<h2 id='tocuniq62'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) You are the salt of the earth. The apostles are called salt, because through them the entire human race is preserved.

25 Quod si sal evannerit, in quo salietur? Si doctor erraverit, a quo alio doctore emendabitur?

It is worth nothing more, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. An example is taken from agriculture. For salt, indeed, is necessary as a seasoning for food and for preserving meat: it has no other use. Certainly we read in the Scriptures that certain cities, sown with the salt of the conquered, so that no seed would sprout in them (Judith. IX). Therefore let the doctors and bishops beware and see: the powerful can withstand torment powerfully (Sap. VI, 7); and that there is no remedy: but to lead the ruins of the ancestors to Tartarus.


<h2 id='tocuniq63'>(Vers. 14 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 14 onwards) You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. It teaches confidence in preaching, so that the apostles do not hide out of fear and be like a lamp under a basket, but rather freely reveal themselves, so that what they heard in private, they may preach on the housetops (Matthew 10:27)."  }


<h2 id='tocuniq64'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill. Whether it is that He fulfilled the prophecies about Himself through others, or that He fulfilled those things which were rudimentary and imperfect before due to the weakness of the listeners, by His preaching, removing wrath, excluding the principle of retaliation, and the hidden desire in the mind.

<h2 id='tocuniq65'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) Until heaven and earth pass away. The new heavens and the new earth are promised to us, which the Lord God will make. Therefore, if new things are to be created, the old ones will pass away as a result. But what follows:

Iota unum, aut unus apex non praeteribit a Lege, donec omnia fiant. Ex figura litterae ostenditur, quod etiam quae minima putantur in Lege, sacramentis spiritualibus plena sint, et omnia recapitulentur in Evangelio. Cujus ergo eruditionis est, cujusque doctrinae, etiam diversa sacrificia, et quae superstitiosa videntur, in victimis quotidie demonstrare compleri?

<h2 id='tocuniq66'>(Vers. 19 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 19 onwards) Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. You have heard that it was said to the ancients: 'You shall not murder,' and whoever murders will be liable to judgment. But I say to you. This chapter agrees with the previous testimony, in which he said: One iota or one dot will not pass from the Law, until all things are accomplished. Therefore, it condemns the Pharisees who, disregarding the commandments of God, established their own traditions, which do not benefit the people if they destroy even the smallest thing that is commanded in the Law. However, we can also understand it differently, that the teaching of the masters, even if liable to a small sin, takes them down from the highest position and does not benefit them in teaching righteousness, which the slightest fault destroys. And let perfect happiness consist in fulfilling in action what you have taught in words.

<h2 id='tocuniq67'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) Because everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. In some codices, it is added 'without cause,' but in true definitive sentence it is stated, and anger is completely abolished, the Scripture saying: 'Whoever is angry with his brother.' For if we are commanded to offer the other cheek to one who strikes us and to love our enemies and pray for those persecuting us (Luke VI), every occasion of anger is removed. Therefore, 'without cause' must be removed, because the anger of man does not accomplish the justice of God (James I).


But whoever says to his brother 'Raca,' shall be guilty before the council. And this word is properly of the Hebrews: Raca () for κενὸς, that is, empty or void: which we can express in common insult, without brains, we can say. If we are going to render an account for idle talk, how much more for insult! But it is also emphatically added: Whoever says to his brother, 'Raca.' For our brother is no one else, but the one who has the same Father as us. So, when he believes in God in the same way, and knows the wisdom of God in Christ (I Cor. I): by what reasoning can it be indicated by the praise of folly?

But whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire. From a common perspective, it is understood that whoever says to his brother, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire. For anyone who insults a believer by calling them a fool is impious in religion.

<h2 id='tocuniq68'>(Vers. 23, 24.)</h2>

(Verse 23, 24.) Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar, and go first to reconcile with your brother; and then come and offer your gift. He did not say, if you have something against your brother, but if your brother has something against you, so that a more difficult necessity of reconciliation may be imposed on you. As long as we cannot appease him, I do not know if we should consequently offer our gifts to God.


<h2 id='tocuniq69'>(Vers. 25 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 25 and following) Be agreeable with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. Amen I tell you, you shall by no means get out of there, until you have paid the last penny. You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I tell you, that everyone. But from the preceding and following, it is clear that our Lord and Savior, while we run on the way of this world, encourages us to peace and concord, according to the Apostle, saying: If it is possible, as much as it depends on you, have peace with all men (Rom. XII, 18). For in the preceding chapter he also said: If you offer your gift at the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you: and when that is finished, he immediately adds: Be agreeable or benevolent to your adversary, and so on. And in the following, he commands: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute and slander you. When this is evident, and the consequent understanding, many think it to be about the flesh and the soul, or the soul and the spirit: which is not entirely true. For how can the flesh be thrown into prison if the soul does not consent? Since both the soul and the flesh must be confined together, and the flesh can do nothing except what the mind commands, or the Holy Spirit dwelling in us hands over the flesh or the soul opposing judgment, for he himself is the judge. Others, according to the Epistle of Peter, saying: Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about (I Pet. V, 8), and the rest, interpret the adversary as the devil, and they desire to be commanded by the Savior that, while it is in our power, we may be kind towards the devil, who is an enemy and avenger, and not make him suffer punishment on our behalf. For when he himself supplies the incentives of vices, and we also willingly sin, if we consent to him suggesting vices, he must be tortured on our behalf as well. And they say it is pleasing for each saint to resist their adversary if they do not make them suffer torment for themselves. Some argue more forcefully, saying that in Baptism each person enters into a pact with the devil and says: I renounce you, devil, and your pomp, and your vices, and your world, which is placed in wickedness (1 John 5:19). Therefore, if we keep the pact, we are kind and agreeable to our adversary and should not be imprisoned. But if we should transgress anything of what we promised to the devil, we shall be handed over to the judge and the officer, and we shall be thrown into prison, and we shall not be released from it until we pay the last quadrant. A quadrant is a kind of coin that has two minutes. Hence, in another Gospel, that poor and widowed woman is said to have sent a quadrant into the treasury  (Mark 12), and in another, two minutes  (Luke 21). Not that the Gospels are inconsistent, but because one quadrant has two minute coins. This is therefore what he says: You will not leave the prison until you have also paid for the smallest sins.

<h2 id='tocuniq70'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28) Whoever looks at a woman with the intention of lusting after her, he has already committed adultery with her in his heart. Between πάθος and προπάθεια, that is, between passion and pre-passion, there is this difference, that passion is considered a vice: pre-passion, although it has the fault of beginning, is not held accountable for the crime. Therefore, whoever looks at a woman and his soul is tickled, he is struck by pre-passion. But if he consents and allows himself to be affected by the thought, as it is written in David: "They passed over to the affectation of the heart" (Ps. 73:7), from pre-passion he passes to passion, and it is not a lack of will to sin, but an opportunity. Therefore, whoever sees a woman with the intention of lusting after her, that is, if he looks in order to desire or plan to act, he is rightly said to commit adultery in his heart.

<h2 id='tocuniq71'>(Vers. 29, 30.)</h2>

(Verse 29, 30) But if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into Hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into Hell. He had previously spoken about the desire for a woman, and now he aptly called the wandering thought and sense "the eye. But by the right hand and the other parts of the body, the beginnings of will and emotions are shown: so that what we conceive in our mind, we may accomplish by action. Therefore, we must be careful that what is best in us does not quickly fall into vice. For if the right eye and right hand offend, how much more those things that are on the left side of us! For if the soul falls, how much more the body, which is more inclined to sin! Otherwise. In the right eye and in the right hand, the affection of brothers, wives, and children, as well as of relatives and friends, is shown. If we see that these hinder us from contemplating the true light, we must cut off such attachments, so that while we desire to benefit others, we ourselves do not perish forever. And it is said about the high priest, whose soul is dedicated to the worship of God: He shall not defile himself for the dead among his people, except for his relatives. (Lev. 21:11), that is, he shall not have any emotional attachment except to those to whom he is dedicated.

<h2 id='tocuniq72'>(Vers. 31 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 31 onwards) It was said, however: Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce. But I say to you: that whoever divorces his wife, except for the cause of fornication, allows her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not swear falsely, but you shall fulfill your oaths to the Lord. In the later part, the Savior further explains this passage, that Moses commanded the giving of a certificate of divorce because of the hardness of the hearts of the husbands, not permitting divorce but removing homicide (Deut. XXIV). For it is much better, even if mournful discord arises, than for blood to be shed through hatred.

<h2 id='tocuniq73'>(Vers. 34 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 34 onwards) But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Nor shall you swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black. Let your 'yes' be 'yes,' and your 'no' be 'no.' Anything more than this comes from the evil one. The Jews have always had this worst custom of swearing by the elements, as the prophet frequently condemns them (Isaiah 65). Whoever swears, either reveres or loves the one by whom he swears." } In the law it is commanded that we do not swear, except by the Lord our God (Deut. VI and VII). The Jews, by swearing through angels, the city of Jerusalem, the temple, and the elements, honored and worshipped creatures and carnal things, but God should be honored and obeyed. Finally, consider that here the Savior did not forbid swearing by God, but by heaven, earth, Jerusalem, and by your own head. And this was allowed as if to little children by the law, so that just as they sacrificed victims to God and not to idols, they would be permitted to swear by God; not that they were doing this rightly, but because it was better to show this to God than to demons. However, the truth of the Gospel does not require an oath, since every faithful word is considered as an oath.

<h2 id='tocuniq74'>(Vers. 38.)</h2>

(Verse 38.) You have heard that it was said: An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But I say to you, do not resist evil. The one who says an eye for an eye does not want to take away the other, but to preserve both. Our Lord, abolishing vengeance, cuts off the beginnings of sins. And in the Law there is retribution, but in the Gospel there is grace. There, guilt is corrected; here, the beginnings of sins are removed.

<h2 id='tocuniq75'>(Vers. 39.)</h2>

(Verse 39.) 31 But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, offer him the other also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. And whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two. The man of Ecclesiastes is described as an imitator of him who says, 'Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart' (Below II, 29). And he proves his promise by being slapped in the face: 'If I have spoken wrongly,' he says, 'testify to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?' (John 18:23)." } Such is what David spoke in the Psalm: 'If I have repaid those who have done evil to me' (Ps. 7:5). And Jeremiah in the Lamentations: 'It is good for a man when he bears' ('sits under', etc.) 'the yoke from his youth. Let him offer his cheek to the one who strikes him; he will be filled with reproach' (Lam. 3:27, 30). This is directed against those who think there is one God of the Law and another of the Gospel; both there and here, gentleness is taught. According to a mystical understanding: our right hand, when struck, we are not commanded to offer our left, but rather our other right hand. For the just man does not have his left hand. If he should strike us in a dispute as a heretic and want to wound the right doctrine, let another testimony from the Scriptures be presented to him, and let us offer our right hands to him while he continues striking until the anger of the enemy subsides.

<h2 id='tocuniq76'>(Vers. 42, 43.)</h2>

(Verse 42, 43.) Whoever asks of you, give to him, and whoever wishes to borrow from you, do not turn away. You have heard that it was said: Love your neighbor and hate your enemy. If we understand this as only referring to almsgiving, it cannot apply to most of the poor. But even if the rich always give, they cannot always give. Therefore, after the good of almsgiving, the apostles, that is, the teachers, are given precepts, so that those who have received freely may give freely (Matthew 10). Money of this kind never runs out; but the more it is given, the more it is multiplied. And when it irrigates the fields subject to it, the water of the fountain never dries up.

<h2 id='tocuniq77'>(Vers. 44.)</h2>

(Verse 44.) But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute and calumniate you. Many consider the precepts of God impossible due to their own weakness, not appreciating the power of the saints, and they say that virtues are sufficient, not to hate one's enemies. However, it is commanded to love more than human nature can endure. Therefore, it must be understood that Christ does not command the impossible, but the perfect: what David did to Saul and Absalom (1 Samuel 24 and 26, and 2 Samuel 18). Stephanus also prayed for his enemies who were stoning him (Acts 7). And Paul desires to be accursed for his persecutors (Romans 9). Jesus both taught and did these things, saying: 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do' (Luke 23:34).

<h2 id='tocuniq78'>(Vers. 45.)</h2>

(Verse 45.) That you may be children of your Father who is in heaven; who makes his sun rise on the good and the evil, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? Therefore you must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. If one keeps the commandments of God, they become a child of God. Therefore, they are not a child by nature, but by their own choice.

<h2 id='tocuniq79'>(Chap. VI.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 6, Verse 1) Take heed that you do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father who is in heaven. Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father who seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. From all of these things it is gathered that they are hypocrites, who do everything in order to be glorified (or honored) by men. It seems to me that even the one who says to his brother, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye' (Matthew VII, 4), does this for the sake of appearing righteous. Hence the Lord says to him: Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your own eye. Therefore, it is not virtue but the motive behind virtue that receives reward from God. If you have strayed a little from the right path, it doesn't matter whether you go to the right or to the left, since you have lost the true path.

<h2 id='tocuniq80'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(Verses. 3, 4.) But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.


Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. Not God's reward, but their own. For they were praised by men, for whom they performed their virtuous acts.

<h2 id='tocuniq81'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6) But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. This is simply understood, it instructs the listener to avoid vain glory in prayer. But it seems to me that this is more of a command to pray with inward thoughts, and with lips shut, as we read that Anna did in the Book of Kings; Her lips moved only (1 Kings 1:13).


<h2 id='tocuniq82'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) But when praying, do not use many words as the pagans do. For they think that by their many words they will be heard. Therefore, do not be like them. If a pagan speaks many words in prayer, then a Christian ought to speak few. For God is not the listener of words, but of the heart. (Wisdom 1:6).

<h2 id='tocuniq83'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) For your Father knows what you need before you ask him. So you should pray like this. There arises in this place a certain heresy, and also a perverse teaching of the philosophers, who say: If God knows what we pray for, and what we need before we ask, then we speak in vain to the one who knows. To this, we must respond briefly that we are not narrators, but askers. For it is one thing to narrate to someone who is ignorant, and another to ask of someone who knows. In that there is evidence, here there is obedience. There we faithfully indicate, here we plead miserably.

<h2 id='tocuniq84'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) Our Father, who art in heaven. By saying 'Father,' they confess themselves as sons.

Hallowed be thy name. Not in you, but in us. For if the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of sinners (Rom. 8), on the contrary, it is hallowed because of the righteous.

<h2 id='tocuniq85'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) Your kingdom come. Either generally for the kingdom of the whole world, that the devil may cease to reign in the world, or that God may reign in each one, and sin may not reign in the mortal body of man (Rom. VI). And at the same time, this must also be noted, that it is a great boldness and pure conscience to demand the kingdom of God and not to fear judgment.

Your will be done, as in heaven and on earth. Just as the Angels serve you blamelessly in heaven, so may humans serve you on earth. Let those be ashamed who daily lie about the falling of ruins from heaven. For what benefit is there to us in the likeness of heaven, if there is sin even in heaven?

<h2 id='tocuniq86'>(Vers. 11-13.)</h2>

(Verses 11-13.) Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation. But deliver us from evil. The word 'supersubstantialem' that we have translated is rendered as 'epiousios' in Greek, a word that the Septuagint translators often render as 'periousios'. Therefore, we have considered the Hebrew, and wherever they have rendered 'periousios', we have found 'Sgolla', which Symmachus has translated as 'exaireton', meaning special or excellent, although he has provided a different translation in one particular place. Therefore, when we ask for special or excellent bread from God, we ask for Him who says: I am the living bread which came down from heaven (John 6:51). In the Gospel called according to the Hebrews, instead of supersubstantial bread, I found the word Mahar, which means tomorrow; so the sense is: Give us our bread for tomorrow, that is, for the future, today. We can also understand supersubstantial bread in another way, as that which is above all substances and surpasses all creatures. Others simply think, according to the words of the Apostle saying (1 Tim. 6:8): Having food and clothing, with these we are content, that we should only be concerned with providing holy food for the present. Hence, in what follows, it is commanded: Do not worry about tomorrow.

Amen. The sign of the Lord's Prayer is: which the Eagle interprets faithfully: we, truly, can say.

<h2 id='tocuniq87'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you your offenses. This is what is written: I said, You are gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High; but you shall die like men, and fall as one of the princes. (Psalm 82:6-7) This is said to those who, because of their sins, deserved to be considered gods. Therefore, it is right that even those to whom sins are forgiven are called men.


<h2 id='tocuniq88'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) For they disfigure their faces, so that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward. The word exterminant, which is often misunderstood in the Scriptures, means something far different than it is commonly understood. For exterminant refers to those who are expelled and sent outside the boundaries. Therefore, we must always take care with this expression: which in Greek is ἀφανίζουσιν. However, the hypocrite demolishes his face to simulate sadness; and with a strong mind rejoicing, he carries grief on his countenance.

<h2 id='tocuniq89'>(Vers. 17 seq.)</h2>

(Ver. 17 seq.) But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not appear to be fasting to men, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you. Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where rust and moth consume, and where thieves break in and steal. He speaks according to the custom of the province of Palestine, where they are accustomed to anoint their heads on feast days. Therefore, he commanded that when we fast, we should show ourselves to be cheerful and festive. Those who read the Psalmist say: The oil of sinners shall not anoint my head (Ps. CXL, 5), on the contrary, they want the good oil, of which it is said elsewhere: God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows (Ps. XLIV, 8). And He commands that we, who exercise virtues, should anoint the principal (ἡγεμονικὸν) of our heart with spiritual oil.

<h2 id='tocuniq90'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. This applies not only to money, but also to all possessions. The greedy god is the stomach: there, therefore, he has his heart, where his treasure is. (Verse 36) The treasure of the gluttonous is feasts. For the lustful, it is games. For the lover, it is desire. Each person serves whom they are conquered by. (2 Peter 2:19).

<h2 id='tocuniq91'>(Vers. 22, 23.)</h2>

(Verse 22, 23.) If your eye is clear, your whole body will be bright. But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be dark. Therefore, if the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! Those with blurred vision ((Or: with blemished eyes)) tend to see many lights: a clear and pure eye sees clear and pure things. This can be applied to the sense as a whole. Just as the body is in darkness if the eye is not clear, so the soul, if it loses its principal brightness, will dwell in darkness with all its senses. If therefore the light which is within is darkness, how great is that darkness! If the sense which is light is clouded by the vice of the soul, how much darkness do you think will envelop it!

<h2 id='tocuniq92'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) You cannot serve God and mammon. Mammon is called wealth in the Syriac language. You cannot serve God and mammon. Let the greedy hear this, let those who are considered Christians by name know that they cannot serve both wealth and Christ at the same time. And yet, it is not said, 'he who has wealth,' but 'he who serves wealth.' For whoever is a servant of wealth, guards it like a servant; but whoever shakes off the yoke of servitude, distributes it like a master.


<h2 id='tocuniq93'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25) Therefore I tell you: do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. In some manuscripts it is added: nor what you will drink. Therefore, what nature gives to all, and is common to both animals and humans, we are completely free from the care of this. But we are commanded not to be anxious about what we will eat, because with the sweat of our brow we prepare bread for ourselves. Labor must be exercised, anxiety must be removed. This which is said: Do not be anxious about what you will eat, nor about what you will wear (Gen. III), let us understand it concerning carnal food and clothing. However, we should always be concerned about spiritual food and clothing.

<h2 id='tocuniq94'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26.) Is not the soul more than food, and the body more than clothing? What he is saying is this: He who has provided greater things will certainly provide lesser things as well.

Look at the birds of the sky, that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they? The Apostle teaches (Rom. XI) that we should not be wiser than we ought to be. This testimony should be kept in mind in the present chapter. For there are some who, while they desire to surpass the limits of the fathers and soar to the heights, are plunged into the depths, saying that the birds of the sky are angels and that the other powers in the service of God, which are nourished without concern by the providence of their God. If this is true, as they want it to be understood, how does the statement follow to men: Are you not more valuable than them? Thus it must be understood simply: if the birds are nourished by God's providence without care and toil, which exist today and will not exist tomorrow, how much more are men, to whom eternity is promised, governed by God's will!

<h2 id='tocuniq95'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) But which of you, being anxious, can add one cubit to his stature? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the birds of the air, that they don't sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns. Your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you of much more value than they?

<h2 id='tocuniq96'>(Vers. 28-30.)</h2>

(Vers. 28-30.) Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin. And yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin. Why does the lily shine so brightly? The violet, indeed, surpasses even purple, not with any purple dye, but with the judgment of the eyes rather than of words.

<h2 id='tocuniq97'>(Vers. 31 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 31 and following) Do not be anxious, saying: What shall we eat, or what shall we drink, or what shall we wear? For all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. Therefore, he conceded that those who prohibit thinking about the future should be anxious about present matters. And the Apostle says: 'Night and day, we worked with our own hands, so as not to be a burden to any of you' (1 Thess. 2:9). In the Scriptures, 'tomorrow' is understood to mean a future time, as Jacob said: 'He will listen to me tomorrow, because of my righteousness' (Gen. 30:33). And in the vision of Samuel, the witch of Endor speaks to Saul: 'Tomorrow you will be with me' (1 Sam. 28:19).

<h2 id='tocuniq98'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) Each day has enough trouble of its own. Here, he placed malice, not contrary to virtue, but rather labor and affliction, and the hardships of the world: just as Sarah afflicted her maidservant Hagar (Gen. XVI), which is significantly said in Greek ἐκάκωσεν αὐτὴν. Therefore, let us be content with the thoughts of the present time; let us leave the care of the future, which is uncertain.

<h2 id='tocuniq99'>(Chap. VII.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter VII - Verses 1, 2) Do not judge, so that you may not be judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. If judging is prohibited, what is the consequence of Paul judging the fornicator in Corinth (1 Corinthians 5) and Peter rebuking Ananias and Sapphira for their lie (Acts 5)? But he shows what he prohibits from the consequences, saying: for with the judgment you pronounce, you will be judged. Therefore, he did not prevent judgment, but he taught.

<h2 id='tocuniq100'>(Vers. 3-5.)</h2>

(Verses 3-5.) But why do you see the speck in your brother's eye and not notice the beam in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take out the speck from your eye,' when you yourself do not see the beam in your own eye? Hypocrite, first take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck from your brother's eye. He is speaking about those who, while themselves guilty of mortal sin, do not forgive minor sins in their brothers: straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel (Matthew 23)." } Therefore, those who, as we have said above, are falsely called hypocrites, are rightly condemned. They look at the splinter in their brother's eye through the beam in their own.

<h2 id='tocuniq101'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) Do not give what is holy to dogs. Holy, bread is for the children. Therefore, we should not take the bread of the children and give it to the dogs.

Do not cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. A swine does not appreciate ornaments when it wallows in the mire. And according to the Proverbs of Solomon: If he has a golden ring, he is found more repugnant (Prov. XI, 22). Some understand them as dogs who return to the vomit of their sins after having believed in Christ: but pigs are those who have not yet believed in the Gospel and are immersed in the mud of unbelief and vices. Therefore, it is not fitting for people of this kind to quickly believe the Gospel pearl, lest they trample it and, having been converted, begin to scatter.

<h2 id='tocuniq102'>(Vers. 7 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 7 onwards) Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Or what man is there among you, who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent? He demonstrates what we should seek, having forbidden to ask for carnal things. If it is given to the one who asks, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it is opened, therefore it is clear that he who does not receive, and does not find, and to whom it is not opened, has not asked, sought, and knocked well. Let us therefore knock at the door of Christ, of which it is said: This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall enter through it (Ps. CXVII, 20); so that when we have entered, hidden and dark treasures may be revealed to us in Christ Jesus, in whom all knowledge is (Coloss. II).

<h2 id='tocuniq103'>(Vers. 11, 12.)</h2>

(Verses 11, 12.) So if you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him! Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. It should be noted that he called the apostles evil, unless perhaps under the guise of the apostles the entire race of men is condemned, whose hearts from infancy are inclined towards evil in comparison to divine mercy. Read Genesis (Gen. VIII). It is not surprising if people of this age are called evil, since the Apostle Paul also reminds us: Redeeming the time, because the days are evil (Ephes. V, 16).

<h2 id='tocuniq104'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Ver. 13, 14.) Enter through the narrow gate, because wide is the gate and spacious is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it. How narrow is the gate, and tight the way that leads to life! And few are those who find it. The wide way is the pleasure of the world, which men desire. Narrow is the path, which is opened through labors and fasts, which even the Apostle entered (2 Corinthians 6, 11): and he encourages Timothy to enter through it (1 Timothy 5). At the same time, consider how clearly he speaks about both paths. Many walk on the broad path, but few find the narrow one. We do not seek the broad path, nor is there a need for discovery: it presents itself spontaneously, and it is the path of those who wander. However, not everyone finds the narrow path, nor do those who find it immediately enter it. Indeed, many, having discovered the path of truth, are captivated by the pleasures of the world and turn back from the middle of the journey.

<h2 id='tocuniq105'>(Vers. 15 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 and following) Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. And by their fruits, you will know them. It can be understood in general that those who promise one thing in appearance and speech, but show another thing in action, are deceptive. But specifically, this should be understood about heretics, who seem to wrap themselves in the garment of piety, such as continence, chastity, and fasting, but inwardly have a poisoned mind, deceiving the hearts of the simple-minded brothers. Therefore, from the fruits of the soul, which lead innocence to ruin, they are compared to rapacious wolves.

<h2 id='tocuniq106'>(Vers. 18 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 18 and following) A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. So, by their fruits you will know them. Let us ask the heretics who claim that there are two contrary natures in themselves, if, according to their understanding, a good tree can never bear bad fruit, how did Moses, a good tree, sin by striking the rock with his staff (Deut. XXXII), and how did David, after killing Uriah, commit adultery with Bathsheba (II Sam. XI)? Also, how did Peter, during the Passion of the Lord, deny Him, saying, 'I do not know the man' (Matt. XXVI, 72)? What is the connection between Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, who certainly did not believe in the God of Israel, giving good advice to Moses (Exod. XVIII), and Achior speaking something useful to Holofernes (Judith. V)? And as the comedian said (which the Apostle approved): 'Evil conversations corrupt good manners' (I Cor. V). And when they do not find what to reply, we will bring up the example of Judas (John 13), who was once a good tree but produced bad fruits after betraying (or delivering) the Savior; and of Saul (Philippians 3), who was a bad tree when he persecuted (or hunted down) the Church of Christ, but produced good fruits afterwards when he was converted into a vessel of election (Acts 9). Therefore, a good tree does not bear bad fruits as long as it perseveres in the pursuit of goodness, and a bad tree continues to bear the fruits of sin as long as it does not turn to repentance. For no one remains in that which was, but begins to be that which has not yet begun.

<h2 id='tocuniq107'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. As he said before, those who have the garment of a good life should not be received because of the wickedness of their teaching; now, on the contrary, he asserts that even faith should not be accommodated to those who, though they possess the integrity of faith, live in a shameful manner and destroy the integrity of doctrine with evil works. For both the work by word and the word by works are necessary for the servants of God to be proven. This statement can be seen as contrary to that saying: No one can say, 'Jesus is Lord,' except in the Holy Spirit (I Cor. XII, 3). However, it is customary for the sayings of the Scriptures to be understood as actions, as immediately in the following it is confirmed, refuting those who boast of having knowledge of the Lord without works, and they hear from the Savior: Depart from me, you workers of iniquity, I do not know you (Luke XIII). And the Apostle speaks in this sense: They confess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him (Titus 1:16).

<h2 id='tocuniq108'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Vers. 22.) Many will say to me on that day: Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons, and in your name perform many miracles? Sometimes, it is not the merit of the one who works to prophesy, perform miracles, or cast out demons, but either the invocation of the name of Christ that accomplishes it, or for the condemnation of those who invoke it, and for the benefit of those who see and hear, it is granted: so that even though people may despise those who perform signs, they may still honor God, for whose invocation such great miracles are done. For both Saul (1 Samuel 10) and Balaam (Numbers 23) and Caiaphas (John 11) prophesied without knowing what they were saying. And Pharaoh (Genesis 41) and Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 2) understood future events through dreams. And in the Acts of the Apostles, the sons of Sceva were seen casting out demons (Acts 19). But it is also told that Judas the apostle, with the intention of a traitor, performed many miracles among the other apostles.

<h2 id='tocuniq109'>42 (Vers. 23.)</h2>

42 (Verse 23.) And then I will confess to them, because I never knew you. He specifically said, I will confess, because he had previously pretended not to know them: I never knew you. The Lord does not know those who perish. However, observe why he added, I never knew you, if, according to some, they have always been among rational creatures.

<h2 id='tocuniq110'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) Depart from me, you workers of iniquity. Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. He did not say, 'You who have worked in iniquity,' so as not to seem to take away the opportunity for repentance, but rather 'you who work' - that is, those who, up to the present moment, when the time of judgment arrives, though you may not have the ability to sin, still have the inclination.


<h2 id='tocuniq111'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) And the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. This rain which tries to subvert the house is the devil. The rivers represent all the Antichrists who oppose Christ. The winds of spiritual wickedness are in the heavenly places (Ephesians 6).

<h2 id='tocuniq112'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26) For it was founded upon a rock. And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man. Upon this rock the Lord built the Church (Matthew 15): from this rock the apostle Peter received his name. Upon such a rock the tracks of a serpent are not found (Proverbs 30). The prophet confidently speaks about this: He set my feet upon a rock (Psalm 40:3). And in another place: The rock is a refuge for rabbits, or hedgehogs (Psalm 104:8). For a timid animal seeks refuge in the caves of the rock: and with rough skin and fully armed with spears, it protects itself with such a defense. Hence it is said to Moses, at that time when he had fled from Egypt, and he was the little hare of the Lord: Stand in the hole of the rock, and you shall see my back (Exod. XXXIII, 21).

<h2 id='tocuniq113'>(Vers. 27, 28.)</h2>

(Vers. 27, 28.) He who built his house upon sand: and the rain came down, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, and they rushed against that house, and it fell: and its ruin was great. And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, that the crowds were amazed at his teaching. The foundation which the Apostle, the architect, laid (I Cor. III), is one (or, one is) our Lord Jesus Christ. Upon this stable and firm foundation, and by itself a solid mass founded, the Church of Christ is built. Truly, every heretic speech is built towards the purpose of collapsing, just as [it is] unable to be joined together and unable to be reduced into one unity, indeed, which is loose.

<h2 id='tocuniq114'>(Vers. 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29.) For he was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes and Pharisees. For they taught the people the things that were written in Moses and the Prophets. But Jesus, as though God and Lord Himself, added to the law for the sake of the freedom of His will, or changing it, preached to the people, as we also read above: It was said to the ancients: But I say to you.

<h2 id='tocuniq115'>(Chap. VIII.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 8, Verse 1) When Jesus descended from the mountain, many crowds followed him, and behold, a leper came and worshiped him, saying, 'When the Lord descended from the mountain, the crowds met him because they were unable to ascend to higher places. And the leper was the first to meet him. For he had not yet been able to hear the Savior's speech with such a multitude of leprosy on the mountain. And it should be noted that he was the first to be specifically cured: secondly, the Centurion's servant; thirdly, Peter's mother-in-law, who had a fever; fourthly, those who were presented to him, vexed by a demon, whose spirits he cast out with a word, when he cured all who were sick.' And behold, a leper came and worshiped Him, saying, 'Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.' After the preaching and teaching, there is an opportunity for a sign to be offered: that the word spoken may be confirmed in the hearing by the power of a miracle.

<h2 id='tocuniq116'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Verse. 2.) Lord, if you will, you can cleanse me. He who asks for the will, does not doubt the power.

<h2 id='tocuniq117'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) And Jesus, extending his hand, touched him, saying: I will it, be cleansed. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. When the Lord extended his hand, the leprosy immediately fled. Also, consider how humble and without boasting his response was. He had said, if you will: the Lord responded, I will. He had said, you can cleanse me: the Lord joins in and says, be cleansed: Therefore, it is not, as many Latin speakers think, to be joined and read as 'I want to be cleansed', but separately, as first, he says, I want: then, commanding, he says, be cleansed.


<h2 id='tocuniq118'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4) And Jesus said to him: See that you tell no one. And in truth, what was the necessity for him to boast in speech, which he surpassed in body?

44 But go, show yourself to the priests, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them. He sends him to the priests for various reasons. First, out of humility, so that he may seem to defer honor to the priests. For it was commanded by the law that those who were cleansed from leprosy should offer gifts to the priests. Secondly, so that, seeing the leper cleansed, they either believe in the Savior or not believe. If they believe, they will be saved; if they do not believe, they will be without excuse. And at the same time, not to appear to violate the law with respect to that which they were most frequently accused of.

<h2 id='tocuniq119'>(Vers. 5 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 5 onwards) A centurion approached Him, begging Him and saying: Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed and suffering terribly. And Jesus said to him: I will come and heal him. But the centurion replied, saying: Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. We should not accuse the Lord of boasting, because He immediately promises to go and heal, recognizing the faith, humility, and prudence of the centurion. He believed that a paralytic from the Gentiles could be healed by the Savior. He judged himself unworthy for the Lord to enter his house. He had the wisdom to see the hidden divinity within the flesh, knowing that what appeared to be unprofitable from the outside would be beneficial on the inside. Regarding this wisdom, he also said:

<h2 id='tocuniq120'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Ver. 9.)  For I am also a man under authority ((or it can be added "appointed")), having soldiers under me: and I say to this one, go, and he goes: and to another, come, and he comes: and to my servant, do this, and he does it. Willing to show that the Lord can fulfill his will not only through the coming of his body, but also through the ministry of angels.

<h2 id='tocuniq121'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10) And Jesus, hearing this, marveled and said to those following Him, 'I marvel that even my centurion understands my authority. For the weaknesses of the body needed to be driven away, as did the opposing strengths that often lead humans to weakness. And with the word of the Lord and the ministry of the angels, they were expelled.'

Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith in Israel. He is speaking about the present, not about all the past patriarchs and prophets: unless perhaps the faith of the Gentiles is preferred over that of Israel.

<h2 id='tocuniq122'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) But I say to you that many will come from the East and the West and sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. Because God, the creator of heaven, is the Father of Christ, therefore Abraham is also in the kingdom of heaven, with whom the nations that believe in Christ, the Son of the Creator, will recline. And likewise, that same meaning is fulfilled, which we mentioned earlier, in the faith of the centurion, that the privilege would be given to the nations: as the peoples who will believe from the East and the West are mentioned.


<h2 id='tocuniq123'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12) But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness. The children of the kingdom refers to the Jews, over whom God reigned before. They shall be cast out into outer darkness. Darkness is always internal, not external. But since one who is expelled by the Lord leaves behind the light, therefore outer darkness is the term used.

There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth. If there is weeping of the eyes, and the gnashing of teeth demonstrates the bones: therefore the resurrection of the bodies and the same members that had fallen is true.

<h2 id='tocuniq124'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) And when Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying down and having a fever (alternate reading: burning with fever). And he touched her hand, and the fever left her. The hand of the woman is touched, and with his healing works, the weakness of sin flees. It is the nature of humans in this way, that after the fever, their bodies become even more weak: and as health begins, they feel the troubles of illness. But the health that is given by the Lord restores everything at once, and it is not enough to be healed; but to show an increase in strength, it is added:

<h2 id='tocuniq125'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) And he arose, and served them. The hand that had been touched and healed also served." }

<h2 id='tocuniq126'>(Vers. 16-18.)</h2>

(Vers. 16-18.) And when evening came, they brought to him many who were possessed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick, so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: 'He took away our infirmities and bore our diseases.' And seeing the crowds around him, Jesus commanded his disciples to go across the sea. Everyone is healed, not in the morning or at noon, but in the evening, when the sun is setting. Like a grain of wheat that dies in the ground to produce many fruits (John 12).


<h2 id='tocuniq127'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Verse 19, 20.) And a certain scribe approaching said to him: Master, I will follow you wherever you go. And Jesus said to him: Foxes have dens, and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head. This scribe of the law, who only knew the letter that kills, if he had said: Lord, I will follow you wherever you go, he would not have been rejected by the Lord; but because he esteemed one teacher among many, and was a mere scholar, which is more significantly said in Greek, γραμματεὺς, and not a spiritual listener: therefore, he has no place where Jesus can lay his head. It is shown to us, and for this reason the scribe is rejected, that seeing the greatness of the signs, he wanted to follow the Savior in order to seek profits from the miracles of his works, desiring the same thing that Simon Magus had wanted to purchase from Peter (Acts 8). Such faith, therefore, is rightly condemned by the Lord's judgment, and he says to him: Why do you desire to follow me for the sake of wealth and worldly gain, when I am so poor that I don't even have a place to stay, and I don't have a roof of my own to use?


<h2 id='tocuniq128'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21.) Another of his disciples said to him: Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father. What is the similarity between a scribe and a disciple? The former calls him master, the latter confesses him Lord. The former desires to go and bury his father due to a matter of piety: the latter promises to follow him wherever he goes, not seeking a master, but seeking gain from the master.

<h2 id='tocuniq129'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) But Jesus said to him: follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead. Whoever does not believe is dead. But if a dead person buries the dead, we should not be concerned with the dead, but with the living: lest while we are anxious about the dead, we ourselves also be called dead.

<h2 id='tocuniq130'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. And behold, there was a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves. The fifth sign he performed was when he got into the boat from Capernaum, he commanded the winds and the sea. The sixth sign was when he gave power to the demons in the region of the Gerasenes and they entered into the pigs. The seventh sign was when he entered his own city and healed a paralytic man lying on a bed. For the first is the paralyzed boy of the centurion.

<h2 id='tocuniq131'>(Vers. 24, 25.)</h2>

(Verse 24, 25.) But he was sleeping. And they came to him and woke him up, saying, 'Lord, save us! We are perishing!' And Jesus said to them, 'Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?' We read in the story of Jonah (Jonah 1) the foreshadowing of this sign, when, as others were in danger, he himself was secure, asleep, and awakened; and by the power and mystery of his passion, he saved those who woke him up.

<h2 id='tocuniq132'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26) Then, rising up, he commanded the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. And from this place we understand that all creatures feel the Creator. For those which are rebuked and those which are commanded, feel the one who commands: not by the error of the heretics, who think that all things are animate; but by the majesty of the Creator, which to us is imperceptible, but to them is perceptible.

<h2 id='tocuniq133'>(Vers. 27-29.)</h2>

(Verses 27-29.) And the men marveled, saying: What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him? And when Jesus came across the sea to the region of the Gerasenes, two men with demons met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass by that way. And behold, they cried out, saying. Not the disciples, but the sailors, and others who were in the boat, marveled. But if anyone wants to argue that those who marveled were disciples, we will answer that they were rightly called men who had not yet known the power of the Savior.


<h2 id='tocuniq134'>(Vers. 30, 31.)</h2>

(Verse 30, 31.) What have we to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here before the time to torment us? Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding not far from them. And the demons begged him, saying, 'This is not a voluntary confession, which is followed by the reward of the confessor, but a forced confession, which compels the unwilling, as if runaway slaves, to see their master after a long time: they pray for nothing else but to be spared from the beatings.' And so, when the demons saw the Lord suddenly present on earth, they believed that they had come to be judged. The presence of the Savior is torment for the demons. Some people foolishly think that the demons know the Son of God and are ignorant of the Devil; because these demons are of lesser evil than the one whose servants they are. Since all knowledge of the disciples is to be referred to the teacher, and both demons and the Devil are more suspicious of the Son of God than they are capable of understanding or knowing. No one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him (Matthew 11:27).

<h2 id='tocuniq135'>(Vers. 32, 33.)</h2>

(Verse 32, 33.) If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs. And he said to them: Go. So they came out and went into the pigs. And behold, with a great rush, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they died in the water. The shepherds fled, and coming into the city, they reported all these things, and concerning those who had demons. Not because the Savior granted what the demons requested, but he said, go: so that through the destruction of the pigs, an opportunity for salvation would be given to men. For when the shepherds saw this, they immediately announced it to the city. Let Manichaeus be ashamed, if souls of humans and animals are of the same substance and from the same author, how is it that for the salvation of one man, two thousand pigs are suffocated?

<h2 id='tocuniq136'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) And behold, the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged him to pass through their territory. They are making this request not out of pride, as some think, but out of the humility with which they considered themselves unworthy of the Lord's presence, just as Peter fell to his knees before the Savior, saying: Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man (Luke 5:8).

<h2 id='tocuniq137'>(Chap. IX.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 9, Verses 1, 2.) And Jesus, getting into a boat, crossed over and came to his own city. And behold, they brought to him a paralyzed man lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, 'Take courage, my son, your sins are forgiven.' By 'his own city' we understand Nazareth, from where he was also called Nazarene. They brought to him, as we have said before, a paralyzed man lying on a bed, because he was unable to enter himself. But Jesus, seeing not the faith of him who was being offered, but of those who were offering, said to the paralytic: Have confidence, son, your sins are forgiven you. O wondrous humility, calling despised and weak, fragmented in all the joints of his limbs, a son whom the priests did not deign to touch. Indeed, he is called a son because his sins are forgiven him. According to the tropology, sometimes the soul lying in its body, with all the powers of its limbs dissolved, is offered to the Lord to be healed by the perfect teacher. If she is healed by his mercy, she receives so much strength that she immediately carries her bed.


<h2 id='tocuniq138'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(Ver. 3, 4.) And behold, some of the scribes said among themselves: He blasphemes. And when Jesus saw their thoughts, he said: Why do you think evil in your hearts? We read in the Prophet, saying God: I am the one who blots out your iniquities (Isaiah 43:25). Therefore the scribes, because they thought him to be a man and did not understand the words of God, accuse him of blasphemy. But the Lord, seeing their thoughts, shows himself to be God who can know the secrets of the heart, and he speaks in a somewhat silent manner: With the same majesty and power with which I behold your thoughts, I can also forgive sins to humans. Understand what the paralytic encounters from you.

<h2 id='tocuniq139'>(Vers. 5, 6.)</h2>

(Verses 5, 6.) What is easier to say: 'Your sins are forgiven' or 'Rise up and walk'? But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” then He said to the paralytic. There is a great difference between saying and doing. Only the one who forgives knew whether the sins of the paralytic were forgiven. But both the paralytic who rose up and those who saw him rise could approve of it. Therefore, a physical sign is given in order to prove the spiritual, although it has the same power to forgive the vices of both body and soul. And intelligence is given to us, because many bodily weaknesses occur due to sins. And perhaps your sins are forgiven first, so that with the causes of weakness removed, health may be restored.

<h2 id='tocuniq140'>(Vers. 7, 8.)</h2>

(Verses 7, 8.) Rise, take up your bed, and go to your house. And he arose, and went to his house. And when the multitudes saw it, they marveled, and glorified God, who had given such power to men. And if the paralyzed soul rises, if it regains its former strength, it carries its bed in which it lay before in pieces, and carries it to the home of its virtues.

<h2 id='tocuniq141'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) And as Jesus passed from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. And he said to him, 'Follow me.' And he rose and followed him. The other evangelists, out of respect and honor for Matthew, did not want to mention his name publicly, but they said, 'Levi,' for he had two names. However, Matthew himself, according to what is commanded by Solomon, says, 'The righteous one is his own accuser at the beginning of his speech' (Prov. 18:17). And in another place: Declare your sins, that you may be justified (Isaiah 43:26). He calls Matthew and the tax collector to show those who read the Gospel that no one should despair of salvation if they have turned to better things; for he himself was suddenly changed from a tax collector to an apostle. Porphyry and Julian the Emperor argue in this place, either the incompetence of a lying historian or the foolishness of those who immediately followed the Savior, as if they unreasonably followed anyone who called them, when there were so many virtues and signs that the Apostles undoubtedly saw before they believed. Certainly, the very radiance and majesty of hidden divinity, which also shone forth in his human face, could attract those who saw it from the first sight. For if it is said that this power exists in a magnet and amber, so that it can attract rings, straws, and twigs to itself, how much more could the Lord of all creatures attract those whom he willed?

<h2 id='tocuniq142'>(Vers. 10 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 and following) And it happened, as he was reclining at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?" But when Jesus heard it, he said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners." They saw the tax collector who had repented of his sins and had found a place of repentance, and because of this they do not despair of salvation. They do not remain in their former vices but come to Jesus, as the Pharisees and scribes grumble. But they are repenting, as the following words of the Lord indicate, saying:

<h2 id='tocuniq143'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) I desire mercy, and not sacrifice. For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners. Now the Lord was going to the feasts of sinners, so that he might have an opportunity to teach and provide spiritual food to his invited guests. Finally, although it is frequently mentioned that he went to feasts, nothing else is reported except what he did there, what he taught, in order to demonstrate both the humility of the Lord in going to sinners and the power of his teaching in the conversion of the penitent. But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. (Matthew 9:13). And: I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance (Mark 2:17), giving testimony of the prophet, Jesus rebukes the scribes and Pharisees, who considered themselves righteous, for avoiding the company of sinners and tax collectors.

<h2 id='tocuniq144'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) Then the disciples of John approached him, saying: Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast? This is a proud question, full of the arrogance of the Pharisees. Certainly, if we may say so, their boastful fasting should be criticized. The disciples of John could not avoid blame, for they were slandering him, whom they knew had been preached by their teacher, and were joining with the Pharisees, whom they knew had been condemned by John, saying (above, III, 7): "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?


<h2 id='tocuniq145'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) And Jesus said to them: Can the children of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast. Christ is the bridegroom: the Church is the bride. From this holy and spiritual marriage, the Apostles are born, who cannot mourn as long as they see the bride in the bridal chamber and know that the bridegroom is with the bride. But when the wedding is over and the time of passion and resurrection has come, then the children of the bridegroom will fast." } Some believe that after forty days of the Passion, fasting should be observed: although immediately the days of Pentecost and the Holy Spirit coming indicate a feast to us. And on this occasion, Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla also observe Lent after Pentecost, because with the spouse removed, the children of the spouse should fast. However, the custom of the Church comes to the passion of the Lord and the resurrection through the humility of the flesh, so that we may be prepared for the spiritual richness of fasting of the body. According to the tropology, it must be known that as long as the bridegroom is with us and we are in joy, we cannot fast or mourn. But when he departs from us because of our sins, then fasting must be observed, then mourning received.

<h2 id='tocuniq146'>(Vers. 16, 17.)</h2>

(Verse 16, 17.) However, no one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. For the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins burst, the wine is spilled, and the skins are destroyed. But they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved. These were the words he spoke to them. What he meant was, until someone is born again and has put off the old self, through my suffering, and has put on the new self, they cannot bear the stricter rules of fasting and self-control, so as not to lose even the faith that they seem to have now, through excessive austerity. However, he gave two examples, both of the old and the new, and of the garment. The old wineskins, we must understand, represent the scribes and the Pharisees. The new patch of clothing and the new wine represent the teachings of the Gospel, which the Jews cannot bear, lest a greater tear be made. The Galatians also desired to do something similar, mixing the precepts of the Law with the Gospel, and putting new wine into old wineskins; but the Apostle speaks to them: O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you into not obeying the truth? (Galatians III, 1). Therefore, the Evangelical message must be imparted to the apostles rather than the scribes and Pharisees who, corrupted by the traditions of their ancestors, could not uphold the sincerity of Christ's teachings. For the purity of a virgin soul is different from that which has been tainted by the contamination of previous vices, as are the impurities of someone who has succumbed to the lusts of many.

<h2 id='tocuniq147'>(Vers. 18, 19.)</h2>

(Verse 18, 19.) Look, one ruler approached and worshipped him, saying: My daughter has just died, but come, lay your hand upon her, and she will live. And Jesus rose and followed him, and so did his disciples. This is the eighth sign, in which the ruler asks for his daughter to be raised, not wanting to be excluded from the mystery of true circumcision; but a woman with a flow of blood enters, and is healed in the eighth place, so that the ruler's daughter comes in ninth, according to what is said in the Psalms: Ethiopia will stretch out her hands to God. (Ps. 68:32). And so, all Israel will be saved; as it is written: 'The deliverer will come out of Zion; he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob. And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.' (Romans 11:25-26)

<h2 id='tocuniq148'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) And behold, a woman who had been suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment. In the 53rd Gospel according to Luke, it is written that the ruler's daughter was twelve years old (Luke 8). Note therefore that at that time this woman, that is, the Gentile people, began to get sick, when the people of the Jewish race believed. For unless vice is shown by comparison of virtues. But this woman, who was flowing with blood, does not approach the Lord in the house or in the city, because according to the Law she was excluded from the cities (Lev. 15, Num. 5); but on the road, as the Lord was walking, so that while He went to another, another might be healed. Hence the apostles also say: It was necessary to preach the word of God to you; but since you have judged yourselves unworthy of salvation, we turn to the Gentiles (Acts 13, 46).

<h2 id='tocuniq149'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21.) For she said within herself: If I shall touch only his garment, I shall be saved. But Jesus, turning and seeing her, said: According to the Law, whoever touches a woman who is menstruating or flowing with blood is unclean (Leviticus 20:25). She touches the Lord for this reason, so that she herself may be cured of the defect of blood.

<h2 id='tocuniq150'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) Trust, daughter, your faith has saved you: and the woman was saved from that hour. Therefore, daughter, because your faith has saved you. He did not say, your faith will save you, but has saved you. In what you believed, you have already been made whole.

<h2 id='tocuniq151'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) And when Jesus came into the ruler's house: and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise, He said: Give place, for the girl is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn. And when the multitude was put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand. And the maid arose." }

<h2 id='tocuniq152'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24.) Step back, for the girl is not dead, but sleeping. And they laughed at him. Because all things live for God.

<h2 id='tocuniq153'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25) And when the crowd had been expelled, he entered. For they were not worthy to witness the mystery of the resurrection, as they had ridiculed the one who raises the unworthy with insults.

<h2 id='tocuniq154'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26.) And he took her by the hand. And the girl arose: And this news went throughout all that land. Unless the hands of the Jews, which are filled with blood, are first cleansed, their synagogue will not rise again.

<h2 id='tocuniq155'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, 'Have mercy on us, Son of David.' And when he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, 'Do you believe that I am able to do this?' They said to him, 'Yes, Lord.' Then he touched their eyes, saying, 'According to your faith be it done to you.' And their eyes were opened. The aforementioned sign that we have explained about the daughter of the ruler and the hemorrhaging (or sick) woman is followed by this: that as in those cases there was death and weakness, here blindness is demonstrated. For both peoples were blind, as the Lord passed through this world and desired to return to his home. Unless they confess and say, 'Have mercy on us, Son of David,' and Jesus asks, 'Do you believe that I am able to do this?' Respond to him: Certainly, Lord, he does not receive his former sight. In another Gospel, one blind man is mentioned, with torn garments, sitting in Jericho, who is forbidden by the apostles to cry out; but he receives his healing through his impudence (Mark 10). This passage properly belongs to the crowd of Gentiles, and it should be explained in its own volume.

<h2 id='tocuniq156'>(Vers. 28, 29.)</h2>

(Verse 28, 29.) Have mercy on us, Son of David. And when he entered the house, the blind approached him, and Jesus said to them: Do you believe that I can do this for you? They said to him: Certainly, Lord. Then he touched their eyes, saying: Let it be done for you according to your faith. And their eyes were opened. Let Marcion and Manichaeus, and the other heretics who tear apart the Old Testament, hear and learn that the Savior is called the Son of David; for if he were not born in the flesh, how would he be called the son of David?


<h2 id='tocuniq157'>(Vers. 30, 31.)</h2>

(Ver. 30, 31.) And Jesus warned them, saying: Take care that no one knows. But when they went out, they spread the news about him throughout that whole land. And the Lord, in order to avoid the glory of boasting, had commanded this. And they, because of the gratitude of the miracle, cannot keep silent about the goodness. Therefore, it is noted that something contrary was commanded between them. These blind men are healed in the tenth place.

<h2 id='tocuniq158'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32) And when they had departed, behold, they brought to Him a mute man possessed with a demon. And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. The eleventh mute received his tongue to speak. However, what is called 'κωφὸν' in Greek is more commonly understood in ordinary speech as 'deaf' rather than 'mute'. But it is the custom of the Scriptures to use 'κωφὸν' interchangeably, meaning either 'mute' or 'deaf'. Spiritually, just as the blind receive sight, so too are the mute able to speak as their tongue is loosened, to confess the One whom they had previously denied.


<h2 id='tocuniq159'>(Vers. 33, 34.)</h2>

(Vers. 33, 34) And the crowds marveled, saying, 'Never has anything like this been seen in Israel.' But the Pharisees said, 'He casts out demons by the prince of demons.' The crowd acknowledges the works of God and says, 'Never has anything like this been seen in Israel.' In the crowd, there is the confession of nations. However, because the Pharisees could not deny the power of God, they slander his works and say, 'He casts out demons by the prince of demons,' thus demonstrating the unbelief of the Jews through their slander to this day.


<h2 id='tocuniq160'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Verse 35.) And Jesus went around all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the Gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness. You see that he preached the Gospel equally to both villages and cities, that is, to both great and small, so that he would not consider the power of nobles but the salvation of believers. He went around the cities, having this work that the Father had commanded: and he had this hunger, to save the unbelievers with his teaching. But he taught in the synagogues and villages the Gospel of the kingdom: and after preaching and teaching he cured every sickness and every infirmity; so that those whom his words did not persuade, his actions did persuade. It is said specifically of the Lord: Curing every sickness and every infirmity, for nothing is impossible for him.

<h2 id='tocuniq161'>(Vers. 36.)</h2>

(Verse 36) But seeing the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, 'The distress of the flock and the sheep and the crowds is the fault of the shepherds and the vice of the leaders.' Hence, it follows.

<h2 id='tocuniq162'>(Vers. 37, 38.)</h2>

(Verse 37, 38.) The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. The abundant harvest represents a multitude of people: 56 few laborers, a scarcity of workers. And he commands them to pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. These are the workers of whom the Psalmist speaks, saying: 'Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy.' They went out, they went, and they wept, carrying their seeds. But when they come, they will come with joy, carrying their sheaves. (Psalm 126:7-8). And to speak more clearly, the abundant harvest is the whole crowd of believers. However, there are few workers, and the apostles, and those who imitate them, are sent to the harvest.

<h2 id='tocuniq163'>(Chap. X.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter X, Verse 1) And having summoned his twelve disciples, he gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out and to heal every sickness and every disease. The kind and merciful Lord and Master does not withhold his powers from his servants and disciples. And just as he healed every sickness and every disease, he also gave his apostles the power to heal every sickness and every disease among the people. But there is a great difference between having and giving, donating and receiving. Whatever he does, he acts by the power of the Lord: they, if they do anything, confess their weakness and the power of the Lord, saying: In the name of Jesus, rise up and walk (Acts 3:6). However, it should be noted that in the twelfth place, the power of performing miracles is granted to the apostles.

<h2 id='tocuniq164'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Ver. 2.) However, the names of the twelve apostles are as follows. The catalog of the apostles is given in order to exclude those who are to become false apostles.

<h2 id='tocuniq165'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3) The first is Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother. Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus. The order and merit of the apostles was distributed by him who probes the secrets of the heart. The first is written Simon, called Peter; to distinguish him from the other Simon, who is called the Cananaean, from the village of Cana in Galilee, where the Lord turned water into wine (John 2). He also calls James the son of Zebedee, because another James, the son of Alphaeus, follows. And he associates pairs of apostles. He joins together Peter and Andrew as brothers, not so much in flesh as in spirit. James and John, who left the bread of the body behind, followed the true Father. Philip and Bartholomew, as well as Thomas and Matthew the tax collector. The other evangelists, in the order of names, first mention Matthew; and then Thomas, but they do not attribute the name of tax collector, so as not to appear to mark the Evangelist by recalling his former occupation. Truly, as we said above, he uses himself and calls himself a sinner, so that where sin has abounded, grace may also superabound (Rom. V, 20).

<h2 id='tocuniq166'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) Simon the Cananean. He is the one who is written about in another Gospel (Luke VI) as the Zealot. Cana indeed is interpreted as zeal. Thaddeus the apostle, as the Church's history teaches, was sent to Edessa to King Abgarus of Osrhoene, who is called Judas the son of James by the evangelist Luke, and elsewhere is called Lebbaeus (Acts I), which is interpreted as little heart. And it is to be believed that he had a triple name: Just as Simon is also called Peter (Mark III); and the Sons of Zebedee, Boanerges (alternatively Banerges), were named because of the firmness and greatness of their faith.


And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. He took his name either from the village or city where he was born, or from the tribe of Issachar: so that it could be understood that he was born for his own condemnation by a certain prophecy. For Issachar is interpreted as 'reward' in order to signify the price of the traitor.

<h2 id='tocuniq167'>(Vers. 5, 6.)</h2>

(Vers. 5, 6.) Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into the cities of the Samaritans. But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. This place is not contrary to the commandment that is said later: Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. XXVIII, 19). For this was commanded before the resurrection, while that was commanded after the resurrection. And it was necessary to first announce the coming of Christ to the Jews, so that they would not have a just excuse for rejecting Him; because He sent the apostles to the Gentiles and to the Samaritans. According to the tropology, it is commanded to us who are called by the name of Christ, that we do not walk in the error of the way of the Gentiles and heretics, so that as their religion is separated, so let their way of life be separated.

<h2 id='tocuniq168'>(Vers. 7, 8.)</h2>

(Vers. 7, 8.) But going forth, preach, saying: 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. Give freely to the country people and those without eloquence, who are uneducated and illiterate, so that no one would believe the promise of the kingdom of heaven. They promise to heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons, in order to prove the greatness of their promises through the greatness of their signs. And because spiritual gifts (if the reward is material) always become less valuable, condemnation of greed is added.

Freely you have received, freely give. As a master and Lord, I am giving this to you without cost, and you also give it without cost, so that the grace of the Gospel may not be corrupted.

<h2 id='tocuniq169'>(Vers. 9, 10.)</h2>

(Verses 9, 10.) Do not possess gold, nor silver, nor money in your belts. Do not take a bag on the road, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff. For the worker deserves his food. Therefore, he gives these precepts to the evangelizers of the truth, to whom he had said before: Freely you have received, freely give. For if they preach in such a way that they do not accept payment, the possession of gold, silver, and money is unnecessary. For if they had gold and silver, they seemed to preach not for the sake of the salvation of men, but for the sake of profit. Nor was there any money in their purses. He who cut off wealth also cut off, almost entirely, the necessities of life, so that the apostles, the teachers of true religion, who taught that all things are governed by the providence of God, showed by their example that they thought nothing of tomorrow. No bag on the way. From this commandment he refutes the philosophers, who are commonly called Bactroperitae, because they despised the world and regarded everything as worthless, and carried a storeroom with them. Not only two tunics. In two tunics, it seems to me that a double garment is being shown. Not that in the regions of Scythia and freezing snow one should be content with just one tunic: but rather so that we understand the garment in the tunic: that we may not clothe ourselves in one thing and preserve ourselves from the fear of future events with another. Not even footwear. And Plato advised that the two highest parts of the body should not be covered, nor should we become accustomed to the softness of the head and feet. When these things have firmness, the rest are stronger. Neither a rod: Why do we seek the aid of a staff, we who have the help of the Lord? 59 And because he had sent the apostles to preach in a certain manner and speedily, and the condition of the teachers seemed difficult, he tempered the severity of the instruction with the following statement, saying: Worthy is the worker of his wages. Only take, he says, what is necessary for you in food and clothing. And the Apostle repeats: Having food and clothing, let us be content with these (1 Tim. 6:8). And in another place: But let him who is being catechized communicate the word to him who catechizes him in all good things (Gal. 6:6), so that those who reap spiritual things may make them partakers of their carnal things, not out of greed, but out of necessity. These things we have said historically. But according to the anagoge, it is not permissible for teachers to possess gold and silver, and money that is in belts. We often read gold for meaning, silver for conversation, bronze for voice; these are not permitted for us to receive from others, but are given to possess by the Lord. Nor should we accept the teachings of heretics and philosophers and perverse doctrines, nor be oppressed by the weight of the world, nor have a double mind, nor have our feet bound by deadly chains, but rather, entering the holy land, be naked; nor should we have a staff that turns into a serpent, nor rely on any support of the flesh, for such a staff is made of reed, if you press it a little bit, it breaks and pierces the hand of the one pressing on it.


<h2 id='tocuniq170'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11) In whatever city or town you enter, inquire who is worthy in it, and stay there until you go out. Concerning the ordination of bishops and deacons, Paul speaks, 'Moreover, they must have a good testimony from those who are outside.' (I Tim. III, 7). When the apostles entered a new city, they could not know what kind of person he was. Therefore, a host must be chosen based on the reputation of the people and the judgment of the neighbors, so that the dignity of the preaching may not be tarnished by the infamy of the recipient. When everyone should preach, one guest is chosen, not giving a benefit to the one who is about to stay, but receiving, for it is said, who is worthy in it, that he may know himself more capable of receiving grace than giving.

<h2 id='tocuniq171'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>

(Verses 12, 13.) But when you enter the house, greet it. And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. He expresses the hidden greeting of the Hebrew and Syriac language. For what is said in Greek, χαῖρε, and in Latin, ave, in the Hebrew and Syriac language is called Salom Lach or Salom Emmach, which means peace be with you. And what he commands is this: When you enter the house, greet the guest with peace, and as much as you can, settle disputes and conflicts. But if a contradiction arises, you will receive a reward for the offered peace: those who wish to have war will possess it.

<h2 id='tocuniq172'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet. The dust is shaken off from their feet as a testimony against them, that they entered the city and the apostolic preaching reached them. Whether the dust is shaken off so that they receive nothing from them, not even necessary sustenance, who have rejected the Gospel.


<h2 id='tocuniq173'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city. If it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah ((or Gomorthea)) than for that city which did not receive the Gospel, and therefore more tolerable, because to Sodom and Gomorrah the Gospel was not preached, but to this city it was preached, and yet it did not receive the Gospel: therefore, among sinners, there are different punishments.


<h2 id='tocuniq174'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16) Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. He calls them wolves, scribes and Pharisees, who are the clerics of the Jews.

<h2 id='tocuniq175'>(Vers. 17, 18.)</h2>

(Verse 17, 18.) Therefore be shrewd as serpents, and innocent as doves. But beware of men: for they will deliver you up in councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues. And you will be led before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. So that they may avoid traps through prudence, and not do evil through simplicity. The shrewdness of the serpent is set as an example: because it hides its head with its whole body, and protects the part where life is. In this way, let us also guard our head, which is Christ, with our whole being at great risk. The simplicity of doves is demonstrated by the appearance of the Holy Spirit. Hence the Apostle says: Be innocent in evil (I Cor. XIV, 20).

<h2 id='tocuniq176'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Verse 19, 20.) But when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you are to say; for it will be given you in that hour what you are to say. For it is not you who speak, but it is the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you. Earlier He had said: For they will hand you over to courts and to synagogues, and you will be flogged in their synagogues, and you will also be brought before governors and kings for My sake. So when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you are to say; for it will be given you in that hour what you are to say. Moreover, Christ himself who dwells in us will speak for himself, and the grace of the Holy Spirit will be supplied in responding.

<h2 id='tocuniq177'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21.) But brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death. And you will be hated by all for my name's sake. We often see this happening during persecutions: there is no faithful affection among them, as their beliefs are different.

<h2 id='tocuniq178'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22) But he who perseveres until the end, he will be saved. For it is not to begin, but to complete virtue.

<h2 id='tocuniq179'>(Vers. 23, 24.)</h2>

(Verse 23, 24.) But when they persecute you in this city, flee to another. Amen I say to you, you will not have finished going through the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man comes. A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. This is to be understood in reference to that time when the apostles were being sent out to preach, to whom it is also specifically said: Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into the cities of the Samaritans (above, v. 5), which means that they should not fear persecution, but should avoid it. Which indeed we see (or rather, saw), in the beginning they did who believed: when a persecution arose at Jerusalem, they were scattered into all Judea, that the occasion of tribulation might become the seedbed of the Gospel. But spiritually we can say: When they persecuted us in one city, that is, in one book of the Scriptures or testimony, let us flee to other cities, that is, to other volumes. Although the persecutor may be contentious, the protection of the Savior will come before victory is granted to the adversaries.


<h2 id='tocuniq180'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25) If they called the head of the household Beelzebub, how much more his household members! Therefore, do not be afraid of them. Beelzebub is an idol of Acaron, which is called in the Book of Kings the idol of flies (2 Kings 1). Beel is the same as Bel or Baal; Zebub means fly. So they named the prince of demons using the most despicable name of the idol, which means fly, because of the filthiness that destroys the sweetness of oil (Ecclesiastes 10).


<h2 id='tocuniq181'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26.) For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not be known. And how, in the present age, are the vices of many unknown? But concerning the future time, it is written, when God will judge the hidden things of men and will illuminate the dark places, and will make the counsels of hearts manifest. And the meaning is: Do not fear the cruelty of persecutors and the rage of blasphemers, for the day of judgment will come, in which both your virtue and their wickedness will be demonstrated.


<h2 id='tocuniq182'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27) What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim from the housetops. What you have heard in secret, proclaim openly; what you have learned in private, speak publicly. What I have taught you in a small place in Judea, proclaim boldly in all the cities and throughout the whole world.

<h2 id='tocuniq183'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28) And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Truly, the soul is invisible and incorporeal, according to the denser substance of our body. However, it will certainly be punished and experience torments when it receives its original body, so that it may be punished with the one with whom it sinned.

But rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. The name Gehenna is not found in the old books, but is first mentioned by the Savior. Let us therefore inquire what is the occasion of this discourse. We read in the third book of Kings that there was an idol of Baal near Jerusalem at the foot of Mount Moriah, where the Siloam flows, not once. This valley and the plain of the small fields were irrigated and wooded, full of delights, and a grove consecrated to the idol was in it. But the people of Israel had fallen into such great madness that they used to sacrifice animals in the deserted vicinity of the temple and overcome the strictness of religion with indulgences, and they would burn or initiate their own children with demons. And that place was called Gehenna, that is, the Valley of the Sons of Hinnom. This is written in detail in the Books of Kings (2 Kings 23), Chronicles (2 Chronicles 28), and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 7, 19, and 32). And God threatens that he will fill the place itself with the corpses of 63 dead, so that it may by no means be called Tophet and Baal, but be called Polyandrium, that is, a tomb of the dead. Therefore, the future punishments and eternal torments by which sinners are tortured are indicated by the name of this place. But we read in the Book of Job (Job 24) that there are two kinds of hell, the excessive fire and coldness.

<h2 id='tocuniq184'>(Vers. 29 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 29 onwards) Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. And even the hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. Therefore, whoever confesses me before men, him I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven. But whoever denies me before men, him I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven. The speech of the Lord clings to Himself, and the following depend on the previous statements. Wise reader, always beware of a superstitious understanding; so that you do not adapt the Scriptures to your own sense, but connect your sense with the Scriptures and understand what follows. Above, He had said, 'Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul'; now He speaks as a consequence, 'Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.' And there is this understanding: If small and worthless animals do not perish without God as their author, and there is providence in all things, and what is destined to perish in them does not perish without God's will: you who are eternal should not fear that you live without God's providence. This understanding and what is said above is: Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you worth more than them? And furthermore: Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow, and so on. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith! Some interpret the two sparrows as representing soul and body. Five sparrows, according to Luke (Luke XII), which are sold for two pennies, represent the senses. But how that understanding relates to the whole body of the Gospel message is not a small difficulty. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. The clearer meaning of our previous exposition is expressed: that those who can kill the body should not be afraid, for they cannot kill the soul, since even small animals do not fall without God's knowledge, how much more so a man, who is supported by apostolic dignity! What it means when it says 'But even the hairs of your head are all numbered' shows immense providence of God towards humans, and signifies an incomprehensible affection, that nothing about us escapes God, and even small and idle words do not escape His knowledge. They mock ecclesiastical intelligence in this place, those who deny the resurrection of the flesh, as if we were to say that all the hairs that have been counted and cut by the barber will rise again, when the Savior did not say, 'But all the hairs of your head will be saved,' but 'they are numbered.' Where there is a number, the knowledge of number is demonstrated, not the preservation of the same number.

<h2 id='tocuniq185'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34) Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth: I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. As he had said before: What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. Now he explains what follows after the preaching. By the faith of Christ, the whole world has been divided against itself: every house has had both unbelievers and believers, and therefore a good war has been sent to break the evil peace. Such is reported in Genesis that God, in opposition to rebellious men who had been moved from the East and were hastening to build a tower (Gen. XI), by which they might penetrate the heights of heaven, caused their languages to be divided. Therefore, in the psalm David prays: Scatter, O Lord, the people who desire war (Ps. LXVII, 32).

<h2 id='tocuniq186'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Verse 35.) For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. This passage, with almost the same words, is written in the book of Micah the prophet (Micah 7). And it should be noted that whenever a testimony from the Old Testament is cited, it is important to determine whether it is just the meaning or also the wording that is being referred to.

<h2 id='tocuniq187'>(Vers. 37.)</h2>

(Verse 37.) Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. And whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. He who had said before: I did not come to bring peace, but a sword; and to divide people against father and mother, and mother-in-law, so that no one would put love of family before religion, added saying, Whoever loves father or mother more than me. And in the Song of Songs we read: Set me as a seal upon your heart (Song 2:4). This order is necessary in every affection. Love God the Father first, love the mother, love the children. But if necessity arises, that the love of parents and children is compared to the love of God, and both cannot be preserved, let there be hatred towards one's own, and piety towards God. Therefore, he did not prohibit loving the father or mother, but expressly added: Whoever loves the father or mother more than me.

<h2 id='tocuniq188'>(Vers. 38, 39.)</h2>

(Verse 38, 39.) And whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it. In another Gospel it is written: Whoever does not take up their cross daily. Let us not think that the ardor of faith can be enough once, the cross must always be carried, so that we may always teach ourselves to love Christ.

<h2 id='tocuniq189'>(Vers. 40.)</h2>

(Verse 40.) Whoever receives you, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives the one who sent me. Beautiful order. He sends for preaching, teaches not to fear dangers, subjects his feelings to religion. He had taken gold above, had taken off his sword belt. The condition of the evangelists is difficult. So where did he get the resources, where did he get the necessary food? He tempers the severity of the commandments with the hope of promises. Whoever receives, he says, you, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives the one who sent me, so that in receiving the apostles, each of the believers may consider that they have received Christ.


<h2 id='tocuniq190'>(Vers. 41.)</h2>

(Verse 41.) Whoever receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward. And whoever receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward. Whoever receives a prophet because they are a prophet, and understands their speaking about the future, will receive a prophet's reward. Therefore, the Jews, understanding the prophets in a carnal way, will not receive the reward of the prophets. Another way: In every profession, there is a mixture of weeds with wheat. He had previously said: Whoever receives you, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives the one who sent me. He had called the students to the reception of teachers. The response of the believers could have been hidden; therefore, we must also receive false prophets and the traitor Judas, and provide them with sustenance. The Lord, pre-proclaiming this, says that it is not individuals who should be received, but names; and that those who receive should not lose their reward, even if the one who is received is unworthy.

<h2 id='tocuniq191'>(Vers. 42.)</h2>

(Verse 42.) And whoever gives a drink to one of these little ones, only a cup of cold water, in the name of a disciple, amen I say to you, he will not lose his reward. We read in the prophet David: To excuse excuses in sins (Psalm 140:4): that many present their sins as legitimate occasions, so that what they do wrongfully, they may seem to do out of necessity: the Lord, who examines hearts and kidneys, observes future thoughts in each individual. He said, 'Whoever receives you, receives me.' But this commandment could be hindered by many false prophets and false preachers; he also healed this scandal, saying, 'Whoever receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person, will receive the reward of a righteous person.' Again, another could argue and say, 'I am prohibited by poverty, my thinness keeps me, so I cannot be hospitable.' And he diluted this excuse with a very light precept, that we should offer a cup of cold water with our whole heart. He said that cold water, not hot, was the cause of poverty and lack of firewood, both in hot weather and in cold. The Apostle also advised the Galatians (as we have already mentioned) to share everything good with the one who instructs them in the word, and he encourages disciples to provide refreshment for their teachers. Because anyone could claim poverty and evade the commandment, he addresses the imminent question before it is posed, saying: Do not be deceived, God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. And the meaning is: you complain about poverty in vain; when your conscience tells you something else: you can deceive me encouragingly; but know that however much you sow, that much you will also harvest.

Second Book

<h2 id='tocuniq193'>67 (Chap. XI.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

Chapter 11, verses 1, 2: And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan; And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there. And as the disciples were ignorant, he asked where Lazarus was buried, so that they could prepare themselves for faith and witness the resurrection of the dead. In the same way, John sent his disciples to Christ to see the signs and miracles, and believe in him. But the disciples of John, in their arrogance against the Lord, and with some bitterness and envy, also demonstrated their superiority in questioning, as the Evangelist reports: Then the disciples of John approached him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast (cf. John 9:14)? And elsewhere: Master, to whom you have borne ((or shown)) witness at the Jordan, behold, his disciples are baptizing, and everyone is coming to him (cf. John 3:26), as if they were saying: We are being abandoned, while he is attracting a crowd.


<h2 id='tocuniq194'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect another? He does not say: You are the one who came, but rather, You are the one who is to come. And the meaning is: Send me, for I am about to descend into the underworld, whether I should announce your coming to the dead, I who have announced your coming to the living? Does it not befit the Son of God to taste death, and then send another to these sacraments?

<h2 id='tocuniq195'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

(Verses 4, 5.) And Jesus answering, said to them: Go and relate to John what you have heard and seen. The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise again. John had sent his disciples to ask him: Art thou he that art to come, or look we for another? Christ showeth forth his miracles, and leaveth John to his own thoughts. And Jesus making answer, said to them: Go and relate to John what you have heard and seen. The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise again. And what is not less than these,

The poor are evangelized. Either the poor in spirit, or certainly the poor in wealth (or works), so that there is no difference in preaching between the noble and the lowly, the rich and the poor. These affirm the rigor of the teacher, these confirm the truth of the instructor, for in his eyes, everyone who can be saved is equal. But what he says is:

<h2 id='tocuniq196'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) Blessed is he who is not scandalized by me. He strikes down the messengers, as will be shown in the following.

<h2 id='tocuniq197'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) But as they were going away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. If a harsh judgment had been passed against John, as many suppose, then why is he now being praised so highly? But because the surrounding crowd did not know the mystery of the question, and thought that John doubted Christ, whom he had pointed out with his finger, so that they understood that John was not questioning himself, but his disciples: Why, he said, do you go out into the desert? Is it perhaps to see a reed shaken by every wind, and to doubt in your mind about him whom he had previously preached? Or is it by the prickings of envy that he is forced, and his preaching seeks empty glory, so that he might gain profit from it? Why does he desire riches, so that he may abound in delicacies? He feeds on locusts and wild honey. Should he be dressed in soft clothing? The covering of his body is made from camel hair. Such food and clothing are received in the lodging of a prison, and the proclamation of truth has such a dwelling. But those who are flatterers, and pursue profits, and seek riches, and abound in pleasures, and are dressed in soft clothing, these are in the houses of kings. From which it is shown that a rigorous and austere life and preaching should avoid the courts of kings, and decline the palaces of soft people.


<h2 id='tocuniq198'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) But why did you go out to see, a prophet? I tell you, and even more than a prophet. Among those born of women, John the Baptist is greater than the prophets, because he pointed out with his finger the one whom they had prophesied to come, saying: Behold the Lamb of God, behold he who takes away the sins of the world. And because to the privilege of prophethood the reward also came to John the Baptist, that he should baptize his Lord, it follows the increase of merits, making a testimony of Malachi, in whom even an angel is foretold (Malachi II). However, we cannot say that the term 'angel' here refers to John by nature, but by the dignity of his office, that is, a messenger who announced the coming of the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq199'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist. Among those born of women, I tell you, no one is greater than him. He is greater than those who are born of women and of the union of a man and a woman, and greater than he who is born of the Virgin and the Holy Spirit. Although when he said, 'No one greater has risen among those born of women than John the Baptist,' he did not elevate John above the other prophets and patriarchs and all other men, but he considered them equal to John. For it does not immediately follow that if others are not greater, that he is greater than others; but rather that he has equality with the other saints.

But whoever is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. Many want to understand this about the Savior, that whoever is least in time, is greater in dignity. But let us simply understand: that every saint, who is now with God, is greater than he who is still engaged in battle. For it is one thing to possess the crown of victory, another to still fight in the field. Some want to accept that the last angel in heaven, serving the Lord, is better than any first man who dwells on earth.


<h2 id='tocuniq200'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12) But from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. For if John had come to you in the way of righteousness, then you would have repented; but I tell you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in the Day of Judgment than for you. The kingdom of heaven is forcibly advancing, and the forceful ones seize it. For truly, great is the force, that we, who are born on earth, seek the heavenly throne and possess it through virtue, which we did not obtain through nature.


<h2 id='tocuniq201'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John. Not that after John the Prophets are excluded. For we read in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 11:21) that Agabus prophesied, as well as the four daughters of Philip. But what the Law and the prophets, which we read in writing, have prophesied, they have foretold about the Lord. Therefore, when it is said, 'All the prophets and the Law prophesied until John,' it indicates the time of Christ, so that John's coming would show that the one whom they said would come had come.


<h2 id='tocuniq202'>(Vers. 14, 15.)</h2>

(Vers. 14, 15.) And if you are willing to receive, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. The statement, 'If you are willing to receive, he is Elijah,' is to be understood as mystical and requiring understanding, as the following words of the Lord indicate, saying: He who has ears to hear, let him hear. For if the meaning were clear and the sentiment evident, why would it be necessary for us to be prepared for understanding? Therefore, John is called Elijah, not according to foolish philosophers and certain heretics who introduce the concept of transmigration, but because, according to another testimony of the Gospel, he came in the spirit and power of Elijah, having the same holy Spirit or grace, or measure. But the strictness of life and the austere mind of Elijah and John are similar. For Elijah lived in the desert, and so did John: Elijah was girded with a leather belt, and John had a similar belt. Elijah, because he accused King Ahab and Jezebel of impiety, was compelled to flee (3 Kings 19); and John, because he accused Herod and Herodias of unlawful marriages, was beheaded. Some think that John is called Elijah because just as Elijah will precede the second coming of the Savior according to Malachi, and will announce the coming Judge, so John did in the first coming; and both are messengers of either the first coming of the Lord or the second.


<h2 id='tocuniq203'>(Vers. 16 seq.)</h2>

(Vera. 16 seq.) To what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplace, who call to their companions and say: 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we mourned to you, and you did not lament.' For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' And wisdom is justified by her children. To the boys sitting in the forum and shouting and saying to their peers: We have sung to you, but you have not danced; we have mourned, but you have not wailed; the generation of the Jews is compared, as the Scripture says: To whom shall I compare this generation? It is like the boys sitting in the forum, and so on. Therefore, free intelligence and passive interpretation of allegories are not attributed to us, but whatever we are about to say about the boys is to be referred to the likeness of the generation. You were the children who sit in the marketplace, of whom Isaiah speaks: Behold, I and the children whom God has given to me (Isa. VIII, 18). And in the eighteenth psalm (Verse 8): The testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones. And elsewhere: Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings you have perfected praise (Ps. VIII, 3). Therefore, these children sat in the forum, or ἐν ἀγορᾶς, which is more significantly said in Greek, where many things are for sale. And because the people of the Jews did not want to listen, they not only spoke to them but shouted with full throats: We sang to you, and you did not dance; we called you to do good works to our song, and to dance to our pipe, just as David danced before the Ark of the Lord (2 Samuel 6), and you did not want to. We lamented, and we provoked you to repentance, and you did not want to do this either, despising both preaching, both the exhortation to virtues, and repentance after sins. It is not surprising that you have despised both the fasting of God, and also fullness in the same way. 72 If you prefer fasting, why did John displease you? If you prefer indulgence, why did the Son of Man displease you? You call the one possessed by a demon and the other a glutton and a drunkard. Therefore, because you refused to accept both forms of discipline, wisdom has been justified by her children; that is, by God's dispensation and teaching. And I, who am the power and wisdom of God, have been deemed just by my apostolic children, to whom the Father has revealed the things that had been hidden from the wise and prudent. In some Gospels it is read: Wisdom is justified by her works (Luke 7:35). For indeed, wisdom does not seek the testimony of words, but of works.

<h2 id='tocuniq204'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) Then he began to reproach the cities where most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent. The reproach of the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida and Capernaum is set forth in this chapter. And the reason he reproached them was that after performing many miracles and signs, they did not repent.

<h2 id='tocuniq205'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verse 21, 22) Woe to you, Chorazin; woe to you, Bethsaida: for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you. Chorazin and Bethsaida, cities of Galilee, are mourned by the Savior, because after so many signs and wonders they did not repent, and Tyre and Sidon, idolatrous and sinful cities, are preferred over them."  } However, they are preferred because Tyre and Sidon have trampled only the natural law, but these, after transgressing the natural law, have also disregarded the signs that were performed among them. We are looking for where it is written that the Lord performed signs in Chorazin and Bethsaida. Above, we read: And he went around all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and healing every disease and sickness, and so on (Above, IV, 23). Therefore, among the other cities and villages, it is to be assumed that the Lord also performed signs in Chorazin and Bethsaida.


<h2 id='tocuniq206'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! In another version, we find: And you, Capernaum, who were exalted to heaven, will be brought down to the depths of Hades. And there are two ways to understand this. Either you will descend to Hades because you have resisted my preaching in the most arrogant manner. Or, because you were exalted to heaven by my hospitality, and by my signs and miracles, having such a great privilege, you will be punished with even greater torments, because you refuse to believe in them as well.


<h2 id='tocuniq207'>(Vers. 23, 24.)</h2>

(Verse 23, 24) For if the miracles that have been done in you had been done in Sodom (or Sidon), they would have remained until this day. However, I tell you that the land of Sodom will be treated more lightly on the day of judgment than you. Let the wise reader ask and say: if Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom were able to repent at the preaching of the Savior and the signs of miracles, they are not at fault for not believing; rather, the fault lies in the one who does not wish to preach repentance to those who will act. To which an easy and open response is: to be ignorant of the judgments of God, and to not know the sacraments of His dispensations. It was the purpose of the Lord not to exceed the boundaries of Judea, so as not to give the Pharisees and priests a just occasion for persecution. Therefore, before His passion, He commanded the apostles: Do not go on the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter the cities of the Samaritans (Matthew 10:5). Therefore, Chorazin and Bethsaida are condemned because they refused to believe in the present Lord. Tyre and Sidon are justified because they believed in his apostles. Do not seek the times when you behold the salvation of the believers. In Capernaum, however, which is interpreted as the most beautiful city, unbelieving Jerusalem is condemned, to whom it is said through Ezekiel: Sodom is justified because of you (Ezek. XVI, 52).

<h2 id='tocuniq208'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) At that time, Jesus responded and said: I will confess to You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth. Confession, not always repentance, but also signifies thanksgiving; as we often read in the psalms. Let those who accuse the Savior of not being born but created hear that He calls His Father Lord of heaven and earth. For if He Himself is a creature, and a creature can call its creator father, it would have been foolish not to also call the Lord of Himself and of heaven and earth, or the Father in the same way.


74 Because you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding, and have revealed them to little children. Thanks and rejoices in the Father, because the coming of his apostles has revealed the sacraments, which the scribes and Pharisees, who consider themselves wise, have ignored, and in their own sight have acted prudently. Wisdom is justified by her children.

<h2 id='tocuniq209'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26.) Yes, Father, because it was pleasing before you. Speaking with affectionate persuasion to the Father, that the begun favor may be completed in the apostles.

<h2 id='tocuniq210'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27) All things have been handed over to me by my Father. And understand mystically the one who hands over the Father, and the one who receives the Son. Otherwise, if we want to feel according to our frailty, when the one receiving begins to have, the one who gave will begin not to have. However, all things handed over to him are not to be understood as heaven, and earth, and the elements, and the others which he himself made and established: but those who have access to the Father through the Son, and who were previously rebellious, began to feel God afterwards.


And no one knows the Son except the Father, nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and to whomever the Son wills to reveal Him. Let Eunomius be ashamed for claiming to have such knowledge of the Father and the Son as they have of each other. But if he insists on this, and consoles himself in his madness, let him consider: And to whomever the Son wills to reveal Him. It is one thing to know by the equality of nature what you know, and another by the graciousness of the revealer.

<h2 id='tocuniq211'>(Vers. 28, 29.)</h2>

(Verse 28, 29.) Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you. Take up my yoke upon you, and learn from me, because I am gentle and humble of heart; and you will find rest for your souls. The Prophet Zacharias testifies that the burdens of sin are heavy, saying, 'iniquity sits upon a talent of lead' (Zacch. 5). And the Psalmist laments, 'My iniquities are weighed down upon me' (Psal. 37:6). Indeed, it certainly invites those who were oppressed by the heavy burden of the Law to the grace of the Gospel.

<h2 id='tocuniq212'>(Vers. 30.)</h2>

(Verse 30.) For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. How is the Gospel easier than the Law, when in the Law there is condemnation for murder, but in the Gospel there is condemnation for anger? By what rationale is the grace of the Gospel easier, when in the Law there is adultery, but in the Gospel there is punishment for desire? In the Law there are many commandments, which the Apostle teaches cannot be fully fulfilled (Acts 15). In the Law, works are required, and whoever does them shall live by them (Ezekiel 20:11). In the gospel, the will is sought: even if it does not have the desired effect, it does not lose its reward. The gospel commands what we are able to do: namely, not to desire. This is within our power. The law does not punish the will, it punishes the action, so that you do not commit adultery. Imagine a virgin who is forced into prostitution during a persecution. In the gospel, she is accepted because she did not sin willingly, but in the law she is rejected as if corrupted.


<h2 id='tocuniq213'>(Chap. XII.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 12, Verse 1) At that time, Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath; His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and eat. In another Gospel, we read that because of their insistent hunger, they didn't even have a place to eat, and so they were hungry like any other people (Mark 2 and Luke 6). The fact that they rubbed the heads of grain with their hands and satisfied their hunger is a sign of a stricter way of life; they sought simple foods, not prepared feasts.


<h2 id='tocuniq214'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Verse 2) But the Pharisees, seeing this, said to him: Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath. Note that the first apostles of the Savior destroyed the observance of the Sabbath, against the Ebionites, who, while accepting the other apostles, reject Paul as a violator of the law.

<h2 id='tocuniq215'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(Verses 3, 4.) But he said to them: Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? To refute the Pharisees' accusation, he recalls an old story, when David, fleeing from Saul, came to Nob and was received by the priest Ahimelech, and he asked for food. Since he did not have any ordinary bread, Ahimelech gave him consecrated bread, which was not allowed to be eaten except by the priests and Levites alone. And he only asked if there were children of the world born from women: and when he answered that from yesterday and the day before yesterday, he did not hesitate to give bread, considering it better to deliver people from the danger of hunger, as the prophet says: I desire mercy, and not sacrifice (Hosea, VI, 6), than to offer sacrifice to God. For a merciful offering is pleasing to God, and it is the salvation of men. Therefore, the Lord opposes and says: If even David, who is holy, and the high priest Achimelech are not reproached by you, although they have both transgressed the commandment of the Law with probable excuse, and hunger is the cause, why do you not approve the same hunger in the apostles, which you approve in others? Although there is also a great difference in this. Those people rub the spikes in their hands on Saturday, those Levite ate bread, and they approached the solemnity of the Sabbath and the days of the New Moon, on which he was asked to flee from the royal palace. Note that neither David nor his servants took the bread of the offering until they answered that they were clean from women.

<h2 id='tocuniq216'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) Have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath and yet are without guilt? But I tell you, the disciples have been falsely accused, for they have passed through the fields and have crushed the heads of grain out of necessity due to hunger, while you yourselves violate the Sabbath in the temple by sacrificing animals, slaughtering bulls, and burning offerings on a heap of wood. And according to another Gospel (John 6), you even circumcise infants on the Sabbath, so that while you desire to keep another Law, you destroy the Sabbath. However, the Laws of God are never contrary to themselves. And wisely, where the disciples could be accused of transgression, David and Achimelech cite examples followed: but a true and unfounded violation of the Sabbath is attributed to those who had committed slander.

<h2 id='tocuniq217'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) But I tell you that here is something greater than the temple. Here, not a pronoun but an adverb of place; that the place may be greater than the temple, which holds the Lord of the temple.

<h2 id='tocuniq218'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) But if you knew what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice' (Hosea 6:6): you would never have condemned the innocent. We have already explained what it means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' But what follows, 'you would never have condemned the innocent,' refers to the apostles. And the meaning is this: If you approved of Achimelech showing mercy to David and his men who were in danger of starvation, then why do you condemn my disciples who have done nothing of the sort?


<h2 id='tocuniq219'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) And when He had passed from there, He came into their synagogue. And behold, there was a man with a withered hand. This is the thirteenth miracle, which is performed in the synagogue. And it should be noted that the withered hand was healed not on a journey or outside, but in the gathering of the Jews.

<h2 id='tocuniq220'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Ver. 9.) And they questioned him, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? That they might accuse him. But he had already defended himself against the accusation of the Pharisees regarding the healing on the sabbath day, using a convincing example, so now they want to slander him. And they ask whether it is lawful to heal on the sabbath day, so that if he does not heal, they can accuse him of cruelty or weakness; but if he does heal, they can accuse him of transgression.

<h2 id='tocuniq221'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Ver. 10 and following) But he said to them: Which one of you, if he has one sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath. In this way, he resolved the proposed question, to condemn those who were asking out of greed. If you, he said, hurry to rescue a sheep or any other animal that falls into a pit on the Sabbath, not because of the animal, but because of your own greed, how much more should I, who is much better than a sheep, set free a man!" }


<h2 id='tocuniq222'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) Then he said to the man: Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out, and his health was restored as the other. In the Gospel used by the Nazarenes and Ebionites (which we have recently translated from Hebrew into Greek, and which is called by many the authentic Gospel of Matthew), this man, who has a withered hand, is described as a mason, praying for help in these words: I was a mason, seeking my livelihood with my hands. I pray to you, Jesus, to restore my health, so that I may not shamefully beg for food. Until the coming of the Savior, the hand of God was dry in the synagogue of the Jews, and His works were not done in it. But after He came into the world, His right hand was given back to the believing apostles, and the former work was restored.

<h2 id='tocuniq223'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) But the Pharisees, going out, plotted against him how they might destroy him. The envy is the cause that they contrive a snare for the Lord. For what had he done, that he might provoke the Pharisees to his own death? Surely it was because he had stretched out his hand. For who among the Pharisees has not stretched out his hand on the Sabbath day, carrying food and extending the cup, and all other things that are necessary for sustenance? Therefore, if to stretch out one's hand and lift up food or drink on the Sabbath is not a crime, why do they accuse him of this when they themselves are being reproved for doing the same, especially since this carpenter has not carried anything like that, but has only stretched out his hand in accordance with the commandment of the Lord?


<h2 id='tocuniq224'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 and following) But Jesus, knowing this, withdrew from there, and many followed him, and he healed them all. And he commanded them, not to make him known, so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, saying, Knowing their plots, that they wanted to destroy their Savior, he withdrew from there, in order to remove from the Pharisees the opportunity for impiety against him.

<h2 id='tocuniq225'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18) Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles. He will not contend, nor cry out. This is spoken by the Father through the prophet Isaiah: I will put my Spirit upon him (Isaiah 42:1). The Spirit is not placed upon the Word of God or upon the Only Begotten, who proceeds from the Father's bosom, but upon him, of whom it is said: Behold my servant (Ibid.)." }


<h2 id='tocuniq226'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) And no one will hear his voice in the streets. For the way is broad and spacious that leads to destruction, and many enter through it (Above VIII). Those who do not hear the voice of the Savior are many, because they are not on the narrow path, but on the spacious one.

<h2 id='tocuniq227'>(Vers. 20, 21.)</h2>

(Verse 20, 21.) He will not break a bruised reed, and he will not extinguish smoking flax, until he brings forth judgment unto victory. And in his name the Gentiles will hope. He who does not extend his hand to the sinner, nor bears the burden of his brother, breaks a bruised reed. And he who despises a small spark of faith in the little ones, extinguishes smoking flax. Christ did neither of these things; for this reason he came, to save what was lost.


<h2 id='tocuniq228'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him so that the man could both speak and see. All the crowds were astonished and said, 'Could this be the Son of David?' But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, 'This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.' Three signs were performed at once in this man: the blind could see, the mute could speak, and the one possessed by a demon was set free. This was done in a physical sense at that time, but it is also fulfilled daily in the conversion of believers, as they are freed from the power of the demon and first see the light of faith, then open their mouths in praise of God.


<h2 id='tocuniq229'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself will be made desolate, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand. The crowds were amazed and confessed that he who performed such great signs was the son of David. But the Pharisees attributed the works of God to the prince of demons. To them, the Lord did not respond to their words, but to their thoughts, so that they might be compelled to believe in the power of him who could see the secrets of their hearts.


<h2 id='tocuniq230'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26.) And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; so how then will his kingdom stand? A kingdom and a city cannot stand divided against themselves; but just as unity makes small things grow, so discord destroys great things. Therefore, if Satan fights against himself, and a demon is an enemy of a demon, then the end of the world should have already come; so that there would be no place for opposing powers, whose war is peace among humans. But if you think, O Scribes and Pharisees, that the casting out of demons is by the obedience of their prince, so that they may deceive ignorant men by deceitful simulation, what can you say about the healings of bodies which the Lord has performed? It is something else if the weaknesses of limbs and the signs of spiritual virtues are also assigned to demons.

<h2 id='tocuniq231'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. He refers to the sons of the Jews, or the exorcists of that nation, or the apostles, who were born from their lineage. If they were exorcists who expelled demons by invoking God, he cleverly limits them with this question, so that they may confess that the work is of the Holy Spirit. 80 If the casting out of demons, he says, is attributed to God in your sons, and not to demons, why should the same work and cause not have the same meaning in me?" } Therefore, they themselves will be your judges, not by power, but by comparison: while they assign the expulsion of demons to God; you to Beelzebub, the prince of demons. But if it is said about the apostles, which we should understand even more, they themselves will be their judges: because they will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel (Matthew XIX, and Luke XX).

<h2 id='tocuniq232'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28.) But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. In Luke, we read this passage as follows: But if I cast out demons by the finger of God (Luke 11:20). This is the finger which the Magi confessed, who were making signs against Moses and Aaron, saying: This is the finger of God (Exodus 4:29), by which the stone tablets were written on Mount Sinai (Deuteronomy 9). Therefore, if the hand and arm of God is the Son, and his finger is the Holy Spirit, then the essence of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is one substance. Let not the inequality of the members scandalize you, when unity builds the body.


Therefore, the kingdom of God has come upon you. It also signifies himself, about whom it is written elsewhere: The kingdom of God is among you (Luke 17:21). And: There is one standing among you whom you do not know (John 26). Or certainly that kingdom which both John and the Lord himself preached: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand (Matthew 3:2). There is also a third kingdom of Holy Scripture, which is taken away from the Jews and given to a nation producing its fruits (Matthew 21).


<h2 id='tocuniq233'>(Vers. 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29.) Or how can anyone enter the house of a strong man and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house. We should not be secure: Our adversary is strong, proven also by the voices of the victor. His house is the world, which is in the power of the evil one (1 John 5), not by the greatness of the Creator, but by the wrongdoing of the transgressor. We were once his possessions. The strong man has been bound and bound in Tartarus, and has been crushed by the foot of the Lord. And with the tyrant's seats plundered, captivity has been led captive.


<h2 id='tocuniq234'>(Vers. 30, 31.)</h2>

(Verse 30, 31) Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Let no one think that this is said about heretics and schismatics (although it can also be understood in that way from what is superfluous), but it is referred to the devil by the following and the context of the discourse: because they cannot be compared to the works of the Savior with the works of Beelzebub. He desires to keep captive the souls of men; the Lord desires to liberate. He preaches idols; this one brings knowledge of the one God. He draws towards vices; this one calls back to virtues. How then can they have concord with each other, when their works are divided (or different)?

<h2 id='tocuniq235'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32.) And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. And how is it that some of our bishops and priests, after blaspheming against the Holy Spirit, are restored to their position, when the Savior says that all sins and blasphemies will be forgiven, except for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, which will not be forgiven in either the present time or in the future? Unless perhaps we take that example about Mark the evangelist, who expressed the causes of such anger more clearly, saying: Because they were saying, He has an unclean spirit. Therefore, whoever attributes the works of the Savior to Beelzebul, the ruler of demons, and says that the Son of God has an unclean spirit, to this person blasphemy will never be forgiven. Or perhaps this passage should be understood as follows: Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, offending my flesh and considering me only a man, thinking that I am the son of a carpenter and have brothers named James, Joseph, and Judas, and that I am a glutton and a drunkard, such an opinion and blasphemy, although it lacks the guilt of error, yet it may have forgiveness on account of the lowliness of the body. But those who clearly understand the works of God, since they cannot deny the power, are driven by the same envy to slander; and they say that Christ, the Word of God, and the works of the Holy Spirit are Beelzebub: these will not be forgiven in this age or in the age to come.

<h2 id='tocuniq236'>(Vers. 33.)</h2>

(Verse 33.) Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad. For a tree is known by its fruit. He constrains them with an irrefutable syllogism, which the Greeks call ἄφυκτον, and we can call it inevitable: it concludes from interrogations here and there, and it presses on both horns. If, he says, the devil is evil, he cannot do good works. But if the works you see are good, it follows that it is not the devil who does them. For it is not possible for good to arise from evil, nor for evil to arise from good. But what follows:

<h2 id='tocuniq237'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) Brood of vipers, how can you speak good when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. He shows them a corrupt tree, which bears bad fruits of blasphemy, which have the seeds of the devil.

<h2 id='tocuniq238'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Verse 35.) A good person brings forth good things from a good treasure. And a bad person brings forth bad things from a bad treasure. It either shows the Jews themselves blaspheming the Lord, from what kind of treasure they bring forth blasphemies, or with the previous question the opinion is stuck, that just as a good person cannot bring forth bad things, nor can a bad person bring forth good things: in the same way, Christ cannot do evil and the devil cannot do good works.

<h2 id='tocuniq239'>(Vers. 36, 37.)</h2>

(Verse 36, 37.) But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. This also agrees with what was said before. The meaning is: If idle words, which do not benefit those who hear them, are not without danger for the one who speaks them, and each person will have to give an account of their words on the day of judgment, then how much more will you, who slander the works of the Holy Spirit and say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub, be accountable for your slander! An idle word is one that is spoken by the speaker and heard by the listener without any utility: if, setting aside serious matters, we speak of trivial things and tell ancient stories. However, whoever responds with foolishness, and dissolves into laughter and utters something indecent, this person will be considered guilty not of idle speech, but of a crime.

<h2 id='tocuniq240'>(Vers. 38.)</h2>

(Verse 38.) Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying: Master, we want to see a sign from you. They request a sign as if the signs they had seen were not enough. But in another Gospel, it is explained more fully what they were asking for: We want to see a sign from heaven (Mark 8:11). Either they wanted fire to come down from above like Elijah, or they wanted thunder to roar, lightning to flash, and rain to pour down out of season like Samuel, as if they could not accuse Him of doing these things through hidden and various disturbances of the atmosphere. For you who falsely accuse the things that you see with your eyes, hold in your hand, and feel in usefulness: what will you do with those things that come from heaven? Certainly you will answer, and say that the magicians in Egypt performed many signs from heaven (Exod. VII).

<h2 id='tocuniq241'>(Vers. 39.)</h2>

(Verse 39.) And he, answering, said to them: A wicked and adulterous generation. Excellently said adulterous: because she had left her husband, and according to Ezechiel, she had joined herself with many lovers (Ezek. 16).

<h2 id='tocuniq242'>(Vers. 40.)</h2>

(Verse 40) He seeks a sign, and a sign will not be given to him, except the sign of Jonah the prophet (John 2). For as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. We have discussed this passage more fully in the Commentaries of the prophet Jonah: therefore, we refer the diligence of the reader to that place. Having briefly said this, we are content to understand that the whole is meant by a part: not that the Lord stood in hell for all three days and three nights, but that in part the preparation day, and the Lord's day, and the whole Sabbath day, are understood as three days and three nights.


<h2 id='tocuniq243'>(Vers. 41.)</h2>

(Verse 41.) The men of Nineveh will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. They were not condemned by the power of judgment, but by the example of comparison.

And behold, there is more than Jonah here. Here, understand 'here' as an adverb of place, not as a pronoun. Jonah, according to the Septuagint translators, preached for three days: I for so much time. He to the unbelieving Assyrian nation: I to the Jewish people, the people of God. He to foreigners: I to fellow citizens. He spoke to them plainly, doing nothing of signs: I doing so many signs, yet I endure the slander of Beelzebub. Therefore, there is more Jonah here, that is, at present among you.


<h2 id='tocuniq244'>(Vers. 42.)</h2>

(Verse 42.) The Queen of Austria will rise in judgment with this generation, and will condemn it because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And behold, there is someone greater than Solomon here. In the same way, the Queen of Austria will condemn the people of Judah, just as the men of Nineveh condemned the unbelieving Israel. But this is the Queen of Sheba, of whom we read in the Book of Kings and Chronicles: she came to Judea amidst so many difficulties, leaving behind her people and kingdom, to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and she brought him many presents. But in Nineveh also, the queen of Sheba, secretly, the faith of the nations is preferred to Israel.

<h2 id='tocuniq245'>(Vers. 43.)</h2>

(Verse 43) But when an unclean spirit goes out of a man, it passes through dry places, seeking rest and finding none. Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when it comes, it finds it empty, swept, and put in order. Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter and dwell there. And the last state of that man is worse than the first. For heretics are in a much worse condition than pagans: because in the former, there is hope of faith, and in the latter, the battle of discord. When this understanding prefers a certain applause and color of doctrine, I do not know whether it has the truth. For from the fact that a finite or parable or example follows: It will be the same for this wicked generation: we are not compelled to refer to heretics and any other people, but to the Jewish people, so that the context of the passage does not fluctuate passively and vaguely in various directions, and is disturbed in the manner of fools, but rather adheres to itself and responds to either previous or subsequent things. The unclean spirit went out from the Jews, when they received the Law, and walked through dry places, seeking rest for itself. Being expelled, of course, by the Jews, it walked through the desolate places of the Gentiles: which, when they later believed in the Lord, he, not finding a place among the nations, said:

<h2 id='tocuniq246'>(Vers. 44.)</h2>

(Verse 44.) I will return to my house, from which I came out. This means, I will go to the Jews, whom I had previously sent away.

<h2 id='tocuniq247'>(Vers. 45.)</h2>

(Verse 45.) And coming, he finds it empty, swept clean, and adorned. Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So it will be with this wicked generation. For the temple of the Jews was empty, and it did not have Christ as a guest, who said: "Rise, let us go from here" (John 14:31). And in another place: "Your house is left to you desolate" (Luke 13:35). Since, therefore, they had no protection from God and the angels, and they were burdened with excessive observances of the Law and the traditions of the Pharisees, the devil returns to his former seat: and with the addition of seven demons to himself, he dwells in his former house, and the last state of that people becomes worse than the first. For now they are possessed by a much greater number of demons, blaspheming Christ Jesus in their synagogues, than they were possessed by in Egypt before the knowledge of the Law: for it is one thing to not believe in the coming, and another thing to not receive him who has come. But the number seven is attributed either to the devil, because of the Sabbath, or because of the number of the Holy Spirit: just as in Isaiah it is narrated that the seven spirits of virtues descended upon the rod from the root of Jesse, and the flower that rises from the root (Isa. XI); so likewise the number of vices is consecrated in the devil.

<h2 id='tocuniq248'>(Vers. 46 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 46 and following) While he was still speaking to the crowd, behold, his mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him. And someone said to him, 'Behold, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, seeking you.' But he replied to the man who told him, 'Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?' And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, 'Here are my mother and my brothers. For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.' Then someone announces to Savior that his mother and brothers are standing outside, looking for him. It seems to me that this person who announces is not doing so by chance and simply: but rather to lay a trap for Savior, whether he prefers spiritual work over flesh and blood. Hence, the Lord, not because he denied his mother and brothers, ignored their request to come out; but because he responded to the one laying a trap, extending his hand towards his disciples, he said:

<h2 id='tocuniq249'>(Vers. 49, 50.)</h2>

(Verse 49, 50.) Behold, my mother and my brothers. For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother. These are my mother, who daily give birth to me in the souls of believers. These are my brothers, who do the works of my Father. Therefore, he did not deny his mother, as Marcion and Manichaeus claimed, so that he would be considered born from a phantom; but he preferred the apostles to his blood relatives, so that we too, in comparison to our love for the flesh, would prefer the spirit. Behold, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, seeking you. Some of the Lord's brothers suspect that Joseph had children from another wife, following the delusions of the apocryphal writings and inventing a certain Melcha or Escha as a little woman. However, as it is stated in the book that we wrote against Helvidius, by the term 'brothers of the Lord,' we understand not the sons of Joseph, but the cousins of the Savior, the children of Mary's sister, who is called the mother of James the Less and Joseph and Judas, whom we read about as the brothers of the Lord in another place in the Gospel. But the brothers are called cousins, as all Scripture demonstrates. Let us say it another way: the Savior speaks to the crowds, he educates the nations from within. His mother and brothers, that is, the synagogue and the Jewish people, stand outside and desire to enter, but they are unworthy of his speech. And when they have asked and searched and sent a messenger, they will receive the answer, that they are free to enter and can do so if they themselves believe and are willing. However, they will not be able to enter unless they ask others.


<h2 id='tocuniq250'>87 (Chap. XIII.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

In that day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea. And great multitudes were gathered together to Him, so that He got into a boat and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore. The people couldn't enter the house of Jesus, nor be where the apostles heard the mysteries. Therefore, the merciful and compassionate Lord went out from His house and sat by the sea of this world, so that great multitudes would gather to Him and hear on the shore what they didn't deserve to hear inside. He got into a boat and sat, and the whole multitude stood on the shore. Jesus is in the midst of the waves, being beaten by the sea from all sides, but in His majesty He is secure, and He makes His boat approach the shore. But the people, having no endurance for danger and not surrounded by temptations that they could not bear, stand firmly on the fixed shore, so that they may hear what is being said.

<h2 id='tocuniq251'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3) And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying. The crowd is not of one opinion, but of different desires in each person. Therefore, he speaks to them in many parables, so that they may receive diverse teachings according to their various desires. And it should be noted that he did not speak everything to them in parables, but many things. For if he had said everything in parables, they would have departed without benefit to the people. He mixes the clear with the obscure, so that through the things they understand, they may be provoked to knowledge of those things which they do not understand.


<h2 id='tocuniq252'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) Behold, the one who sows went out to sow. And while he was sowing, he was inside, at home, speaking to the disciples about the mysteries. Therefore, the one who sows the word of God went out from his home, in order to sow among the crowds. However, it is signified that this sower who sows is the Son of God, and he sows the word of the Father among the people. And at the same time, observe that this is the first parable, which is given with its interpretation. And we must be careful whenever the Lord explains his teachings, and when asked by the disciples, he explains privately, so that we do not want to understand anything else, or more or less, than what he has explained.


<h2 id='tocuniq253'>(Vers. 5 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 5 and following) Some fell along the path, and the birds of the air came and devoured it. Others fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil. And when the sun rose, they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. Others fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. Others fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. Valentinus takes up this parable to confirm his own heresy, introducing three natures: spiritual, natural or animal, and earthly; while there are four here: one, by the way; another rocky, a third full of thorns; the fourth good soil. We delay for a little while the interpretation of it with the disciples, desiring to hear privately what is said.

<h2 id='tocuniq254'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) He who has ears to hear, let him hear. We are challenged to understand these sayings whenever we are engaged with these words.

<h2 id='tocuniq255'>(Vers. 10, 11.)</h2>

(Verses 10, 11.) And the disciples came to him and said, 'Why do you speak to them in parables?' And he answered them, 'To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. Therefore I speak to them in parables, because they seeing, see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.' It is necessary to understand how the disciples come to him, when Jesus is sitting in the boat; unless, perhaps, it is understood that some time ago they boarded the ship with him, and there, standing, they inquired about the interpretation of the parable.


<h2 id='tocuniq256'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12) For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. It is not added to those who have an equal judgment, and what they seem to have is taken away from those who do not have; but to the apostles who have faith in Christ, even if they have less virtuous acts, it is granted. But to the Jews who did not believe in the Son of God, even if they possess any natural good, it is taken away. For those who do not have wisdom, they cannot understand anything intelligently.

<h2 id='tocuniq257'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verse 13, 14.) Therefore I speak to them in parables: because seeing, they do not see; and hearing, they do not hear, nor do they understand. And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says: You will listen indeed, but will not understand; and you will look, but will not see. This is spoken about those who stand on the shore, and are separated from Jesus, and do not hear clearly what is being said because of the noisy sound of the waves; and the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in them: You will listen indeed, but will not understand; and you will look, but will not see (Isaiah 6:9)." } These things are prophesied about the crowds, which stand on the shore, and do not deserve to hear the word of God. Therefore, let us also approach Jesus with the disciples, and let us ask him for an explanation of the parable, so that we do not seem to have ears and eyes in vain with the crowds.

<h2 id='tocuniq258'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15) For the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard heavily with their ears. They see and do not see, and hear and do not hear, because, he says, the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard heavily with their ears. And lest we perhaps think that the thickness of the heart and the heaviness of the ears are by nature and not by will, he adds the blame of choice and says:

And they closed their eyes: lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. But blessed are your eyes, because they see: and your ears, because they hear.

<h2 id='tocuniq259'>(Vers. 16)</h2>

(Verse 16) But blessed are your eyes, because they see: and your ears, because they hear. Unless we had read above that the hearers were provoked to understanding, with the Savior saying: He who has ears to hear, let him hear, we would now think that the eyes and ears which receive blessedness are understood to be physical (or bodily). But to me those blessed eyes seem to be the ones that can recognize the sacraments of Christ, and those which Jesus commanded to be lifted up on high, so that they may behold the shining harvest (John 4:35); and those blessed ears, of which Isaiah speaks: The Lord has given me an ear (Isaiah 50:5).


<h2 id='tocuniq260'>(Vers. 17, 18.)</h2>

(Verse 17, 18.) Truly I say to you, many prophets and righteous people desired to see what you see, and did not see it; and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. Therefore, listen to the parable of the sower. It seems that this passage is contrary to what is said elsewhere: Abraham desired to see my day and saw it and rejoiced (John 8:56). However, it does not say that all prophets and righteous people desired to see what you see, but many. Among many, it can happen that some see, while others do not see: although in this interpretation can be dangerous, as it seems we make any discretion among the merits of the saints. Therefore Abraham saw in a riddle, he did not see in a clear form: but you hold him in the present, and you have your Lord, and you ask according to your will, and you dine with him.

<h2 id='tocuniq261'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) Everyone who hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it. Before saying this, He exhorts us to listen more carefully to what is being said.

<h2 id='tocuniq262'>(Vers. 20, 21.)</h2>

(Verse 20, 21.) The evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart: this is the one who was sown along the path. As for the one who was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, but he has no root in himself, and endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. The evil one snatches away the good seed. And also understand what was sown in the heart and the different types of soil are the souls of believers.

But in fact, in both tribulation and persecution, he is scandalized constantly because of the word. Pay attention to what is said, he is scandalized constantly. Therefore, there is a distinction between someone who is compelled to deny Christ by many tribulations and punishments, and someone who is immediately scandalized and falls at the first persecution.

<h2 id='tocuniq263'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) But he who was sown among thorns, this is he who hears the word, and the care of this worldly age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. It seems to me that what is said literally to Adam: Among thorns and thistles you shall eat your bread (Gen. III, 18), signifies mystically that whoever gives himself to the pleasures and cares of this world, shall eat heavenly bread and true food among thorns. And he cleverly added: the fallacy of riches suffocates the word. For riches are deceitful, promising one thing and doing another. The possession of them is slippery, as they are carried here and there, and those who have them either abandon them or those who do not have them seek them out. Therefore, the Lord asserts that it is difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven, as the word of God is suffocated by riches and weakened by the rigor of virtues.


<h2 id='tocuniq264'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) But he who was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and yields, one a hundredfold, another sixty, and another thirty. As for the seed sown on bad soil, there were three different types: by the wayside, on rocky ground, and among thorns. Similarly, in good soil, there are three different types of fruit: a hundredfold, sixtyfold, and thirtyfold. And in both the good and the bad soil, the substance does not change, but the will; and it is the hearts of both the unbelievers and the believers that receive the seed. He comes, he said, the evil one, and snatches away what was sown in his heart; and second and third, this is he, he says, who hears the word. In the explanation of the good ground also, this is he who hears the word. Therefore, first we must hear, then understand, and after understanding, yield the fruits of teachings, and produce either a hundredfold, or sixtyfold, or thirtyfold, of which we have spoken more fully in the book against Jovinian, and now we briefly touch upon: a hundredfold to virgins, sixtyfold to widows and the continent, thirtyfold to chaste marriage. For honorable are the nuptials, and the marriage-bed undefiled (Heb. 13:3, 4). Some of our people refer the hundredth fruit to the martyrs: if this is the case, the holy fruit of marriage is excluded from the good fruit." }

<h2 id='tocuniq265'>(Vers. 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 24 seqq.) Another parable He put forth to them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way. But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop, then the tares also appeared. So the servants of the owner came and said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? So where does the darnel come from? He replied to them: 'An enemy has done this.' The servants said to him: 'Do you want us then to go and gather them?' He said: 'No, lest perhaps while gathering the darnel, you uproot the wheat along with it. Allow both to grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers: Gather the darnel first, and bind it into bundles to be burned; but gather the wheat into my barn.' This is the second parable with its interpretation not immediately given, but explained after other parables were inserted. For here it is proposed, and afterwards the crowds are dismissed and they come to his house and his disciples approach him, asking: Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field, and the rest. Therefore we should not seek with hasty desire to understand before his knowledge is sought, than to be explained by the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq266'>(Vers. 31.)</h2>

(Verse 31) He proposed another parable to them, saying: The Lord was sitting in a boat, and the crowd was standing on the shore: those far away, the disciples heard more closely: he proposed another parable to them, as if a rich father of the family providing food for invited guests, so that each one according to the nature of his stomach would receive various foods. Hence, in the previous parable, he did not say another one, but another. For if he had mentioned another one, we could not expect a third, so he mentioned another one, so that more would follow.


<h2 id='tocuniq267'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32) The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches. It should not be burdensome to the reader if we present all the parables. For those that are obscure, they should be explained more fully, so that they are not enveloped in too much brevity and their meaning is not clarified. The kingdom of heaven is the preaching of the Gospel and the knowledge of the Scriptures which leads to life. And concerning this it is said to the Jews: 'The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing its fruits' (Matthew 21:43). Therefore, the kingdom of God is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field. The man who sows in his field is understood by most to be the Savior, who sows in the souls of believers. By others, the man himself sowing in his field is understood to be in himself and in his heart. Who is the one who sows, if not our perception and mind, which, receiving the seed of preaching, and nurturing the seed with the moisture of faith, makes it sprout in the field of one's heart? The preaching of the Gospel is the smallest of all disciplines. For in the first teaching, it does not have the faith of truth, preaching a man as God, God as dead, and the scandal of the cross. Compare this teaching with the dogmas of the philosophers and their books, the splendor of eloquence, and the composition of speeches, and you will see how much smaller it is than the other seeds of the seed of the Gospel. But when it grows, it shows nothing biting, nothing lively, nothing vital, but everything weak, withered, and softened boils down into vegetables and herbs, which quickly dry up and decay. However, this preaching, which seemed small in the beginning, when it has been sown either in the soul of the believer or in the whole world, does not spring up in vegetables, but grows into a tree: so that the birds of the sky (which we should understand as either the souls of believers or the strengths bound to the service of God) may come and dwell in its branches. The branches of the Evangelical tree, which grew from the grain of mustard, are diverse dogmas, in which each of the aforementioned birds finds rest. Let us also assume the wings of the dove (Ps. LIV), so that flying to higher things, we may dwell in the branches of this tree and make nests for ourselves of teachings, fleeing earthly things and hastening to heavenly things. Many, reading the grain of mustard as the smallest of all seeds, and that which is said in the Gospel by the disciples: 'Lord, increase our faith' (Luke XVII, 6); and it is answered to them by the Savior: 'Amen I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard, and you say to this mountain, move from this place, it shall move', think that the apostles are either asking for a small faith or doubting the Lord's small faith; whereas the apostle Paul considers faith compared to a grain of mustard as the greatest. For what does he say? If I shall have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have charity, it profits me nothing (I Cor. XIII, 2). Therefore, what the Lord said to be done by faith, which is compared to a mustard seed, the Apostle teaches can be done with all faith.

<h2 id='tocuniq268'>(Vers. 33.)</h2>

(Verse 33) He spoke another parable to them. The kingdom of heaven is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until it was all leavened. The stomachs of different people are different: some are delighted by bitter foods, others by sweet, others by more austere, and others by mild. Therefore, the Lord presents, as we have already said, various parables, so that there may be different remedies according to the variety of wounds. That woman, who took the leaven and hid it in three measures of flour, until the whole was leavened, seems to me to represent the apostolic preaching or the Church, which is gathered from various nations. She takes the leaven, namely knowledge and understanding of the Scriptures, and hides it in three measures of flour, so that the spirit, soul, and body, brought together as one, do not differ from each other; but when two or three come together, they may obtain from the Father whatever they ask for (Matthew 18:19). This place is being discussed, and in another way. We read in Plato, and the commonly held belief of philosophers is that there are three passions in the human soul: the rational (which we can interpret as reasonable), the spirited (which we call full of anger or irascible), and the appetitive (which we refer to as concupiscent). And that philosopher believes that our reason dwells in the brain, anger in the gallbladder, and desire in the liver. And therefore if we receive the Gospel leaven of the Holy Scriptures, of which it was said above, three human passions will be brought together into one, so that we may possess the prudence of reason: in anger, hatred against vices; in desire, the longing for virtues; and all this will be accomplished through the Gospel teaching, which the Mother Church has provided for us. I will also speak of a third interpretation, so that the curious reader may choose from among many what pleases him: This woman and the Church itself are interpreted, which has sufficiently mixed the faith of man with the flour for the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit's credulity. And when it is leavened into one, it leads us to the knowledge not of a threefold God, but of the unity of divinity. Also, three seeds sown are brought together into one substance, as long as there is no difference in each seed's nature. A pious sense, indeed, but it can never advance to the authority of doctrines through parables and the understanding of doubtful riddles. And the sown seed is a measure, according to the custom of the province of Palestine, containing one and a half bushels. Other things are said about this parable, but it is not the purpose of this material to discuss everything.

<h2 id='tocuniq269'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds, and he did not speak to them without parables. He speaks in parables to the crowds, not to the disciples; and even today, the crowds listen to parables: the disciples ask the Savior at home.

<h2 id='tocuniq270'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Ver. 35) That which was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world. This testimony is taken from the 77th Psalm (Ver. 2). In some codices it is read, and a diligent reader may find the same in the place where we have placed 95, and the Vulgate edition has: That which was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, there written, by the prophet Isaiah, saying. Because it was not found in Isaiah, I think it was later removed by wise men. But it seems to me that it was originally written like this: What was written by the prophet Asaph, saying. For the seventieth psalm, about which this testimony is taken, is inscribed with the title of Asaph the prophet. And the first writer did not understand Asaph, and thought it was an error of the writer, and corrected the name of Isaiah, whose name was more evident. It should be known, therefore, that in the psalms and hymns and songs of God, not only David, but also the others whose names are mentioned, are to be called prophets: namely Asaph and Heman and Idithun and Eman the Ezrahite, and Ethan and the sons of Korah, and the rest whom Scripture mentions. And the saying of the Lord is attributed to them: I will open my mouth in parables; I will declare hidden things from the foundation of the world, to be considered more attentively and to be found described, the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt and all the signs which are contained in the story of Exodus. From this we understand that all those things which are written should be understood figuratively: not only the clear letter sounding, but also hidden mysteries; for the Savior promises that He will declare Himself in parables, and will bring forth hidden things from the creation of the world.

<h2 id='tocuniq271'>(Vers. 36.)</h2>

(Verse 36) Then he dismissed the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, 'Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.' Jesus sent the crowds away and went into the house so that his disciples could come to him and privately ask him what the people were not deserving to hear or understand. 'Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.'

<h2 id='tocuniq272'>(Vers. 37 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 37 and following) And he answered, saying: The one who sows good seed is the Son of Man. But the field is the world. And the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom. But the weeds are the sons of the evil one. And the enemy who sowed them is the devil. And the harvest is the end of the age. And the reapers are angels. Therefore, just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so it will be at the end of the age. The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and those who do lawlessness, and they will throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. He clearly explained that the field is the world: the sower, the Son of Man; the good seed, the children of the kingdom; the weeds, the children of the evil one; the enemy who sows the weeds, the devil; the harvest, the end of the world; the reapers, the angels. All scandals are attributed to the weeds; the righteous are considered as children of the kingdom. Therefore, as I said above, we must apply our faith to what has been explained by the Lord. However, those things that are left unspoken and abandoned by our understanding must be briefly examined. Understand the people who sleep as the leaders of the churches. Do not accept anyone other than the angels, who daily see the face of the Father (Matthew 18). The devil, however, is called the enemy of man because he ceased to be God. And it is written about him in the ninth psalm: Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail (Psalm 9:20). Therefore, let not the one who is in charge of the Church sleep, lest through his negligence the enemy sows weeds, that is, the teachings of heretics. But what is said: Lest while you gather up the cockle, you root up the wheat also together with it. Give place to repentance, and be admonished not to cut off hastily a brother who may, to-morrow, rise again changed from his fault, and begin to defend the truth. That which follows also seems to be opposed to this precept: Let both grow together until the harvest (Deut. XIII, 5) ; but this seems inconsistent with the command: Take away the evil one from among you (Isai. I); and there should by no means be any fellowship with those who are called brethren, and are fornicators and adulterers. For if uprooting is forbidden and patience must be maintained until the harvest, how are some to be expelled from among us? Between wheat and weeds, which we call darnel, there is a great similarity, and in distinguishing them there is either no difference or a very difficult one. Therefore, the Lord warns us not to hastily pronounce judgment when there is any ambiguity, but to leave the judgment to God: so that when the day of judgment comes, He may cast out not a mere suspicion of guilt, but a clear accusation from the gathering of the saints. But what he said, that the bundles of the tares are to be burned with fire, and the wheat gathered into barns, is manifest, that heretics and hypocrites are to be consumed by the fires of hell; but the saints who are called wheat, are to be received into barns, that is, into celestial mansions.

<h2 id='tocuniq273'>(Vers. 43.)</h2>

(Verse 43.) Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear. In the present age, the light of the saints shines before men; but after the end of the world, the righteous themselves will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.

<h2 id='tocuniq274'>(Vers. 44.)</h2>

(Verse 44.) The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. Hindered by frequent obscurities of parables, we surpass the interpretive commentary, so that it seems we have almost passed from one type of interpretation to another. This treasure is either all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden, or God is the Word, who appears hidden in the flesh of Christ (Colossians 2), or it is the holy Scriptures, in which the knowledge of the Savior is stored: and when someone finds Him in them, they must disregard all the benefits of this world, in order to possess Him whom they have found." } But what follows: When a man finds him he hides him in 98: for this reason it is said, not that he does this out of envy, but that out of fear of losing him, and unwilling to lose him, he hides him in his heart, whom he preferred to his former abilities.

<h2 id='tocuniq275'>(Vers. 45, 46.)</h2>

(Vers. 45, 46.) Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls. When he found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it. In other words, the good pearls that the merchant seeks are the Law and the prophets. Listen, Marcion; listen, Manichaeus: the good pearls are the Law and the prophets, and the knowledge of the Old Testament. But there is one most precious pearl, the knowledge of the Savior, and the sacrament of his passion, and the mystery of his resurrection. When a merchant, like the apostle Paul, discovers this, he despises all the mysteries of the law and the prophets, and the former observances in which he lived blamelessly, like worthless trash, in order to gain Christ (Philippians III). Not that the discovery of a new pearl condemns the old pearls, but that in comparison to it, every other gem is of lesser value.


<h2 id='tocuniq276'>(Vers. 47 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 47 seqq.) Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea and gathering fish of every kind. When it was full, they pulled it ashore, sat down, and sorted the good into vessels and threw away the bad. So it will be at the end of the age: the angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous, and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. With the fulfillment of Jeremiah’s prophecy, saying: ‘Behold, I am sending many fishermen to you’ (Jeremiah XVI, 16): after hearing this, Peter and Andrew, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, said: ‘Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men’ (Matthew IV, 19). They wove together a net of the teachings of the Evangelists from the Old and New Testaments, and cast it into the sea of this age: which even to this day is spread out in the midst of the waves, catching everything that falls into it, that is, both good and bad men, and the very best and the very worst fish. But when the consummation and end of the world comes, as he explains more clearly below, then the net will be drawn out to the shore: then the true judgment of separating the fish will be shown, and as if in a very calm port, the good will be sent into the vessels of celestial mansions: but the wicked will be received by the flame of hell to be burned and dried up.

<h2 id='tocuniq277'>(Vers. 51.)</h2>

(Verse 51.) Did you understand all these things? They said to him: Yes. He said to them: To the apostles, this is specifically spoken; and to them it is said: Did you understand all these things; For he does not only want to hear them as a people, but to understand them as future teachers.

<h2 id='tocuniq278'>(Vers. 52.)</h2>

(Verse 52.) Therefore every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old. The apostles, scribes, and notaries of the Savior were instructed to record his words and teachings in the tablets of their fleshly hearts, in the sacraments of the heavenly realms, and they had the wealth of the master of the house, bringing out of their treasure what is new and what is old: so that whatever they preached in the Gospel, they could confirm with the words of the law and the prophets. And the bride says in the Song of Songs: I have kept for you, my brother, both the new and the old (Cant. VII, 13).

<h2 id='tocuniq279'>(Vers. 53, 54.)</h2>

(Vers. 53, 54.) And it came to pass, when Jesus finished these parables, he departed from there. And coming to his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were amazed and said, 'After the parables that he spoke to the people, and which only the apostles understand, he goes to his own country to teach more openly there.'

Where does this wisdom and these virtues come from? The folly of the Nazarenes is astonishing: they marvel at where wisdom has its wisdom, and where virtue has its virtues; but the mistake is obvious, that they suspect the son of a carpenter.

<h2 id='tocuniq280'>(Vers. 55, 56.)</h2>

(Verse 55, 56.) Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did he get all these things? And they were offended by him. The error of the Jews is our salvation, and the condemnation of the heretics. For they saw Jesus Christ merely as a man, so that the carpenters thought he was their own son: Isn't this the carpenter's son? Are you surprised if they are mistaken about his brothers, when they are mistaken about his father? This place is more fully explained in the aforementioned book against Helvetius.

<h2 id='tocuniq281'>(Vers. 57.)</h2>

(Verse 57.) But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his own house.” It is almost natural for citizens to always envy fellow citizens. For they do not consider the present works of a man, but they remember the fragile nature of his childhood, as if they themselves did not go through the same stages of age to reach maturity.

<h2 id='tocuniq282'>(Vers. 58.)</h2>

(Verse 58.) And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief. Not that he was unable to do many miracles for them, even though they were unbelievers; but because by doing many miracles, he would condemn the unbelieving citizens. It can also be understood in another way, that Jesus is despised in his own house and country, that is, among the Jewish people. And therefore, he performed few signs there, so that they would not become altogether inexcusable. However, greater signs are performed daily among the Gentiles through the apostles, not so much in the healing of their bodies, but in the salvation of their souls.


<h2 id='tocuniq283'>(Chap. XIV.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 14 - Verses 1, 2.) At that time Herod the Tetrarch heard the news about Jesus and said to his servants, 'This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead; and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.' Some interpreters of the Church seek the reasons why Herod suspected this, that he believed John had risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers were at work in him, as if it were necessary to give us an explanation for an alien error, or to find an opportunity for the doctrine of reincarnation from these words, since at the time when John was beheaded, the Lord was already thirty years old; but the doctrine of reincarnation says that after many cycles of years, souls enter into different bodies.


<h2 id='tocuniq284'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(Vers. 3, 4.) For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. For John had been saying to him, 'It is not lawful for you to have her.' The old story tells that Philip, the son of Herod the Great (under whom the Lord fled to Egypt), married Herodias, the daughter of King Aretas; later on, when grievances arose between Herodias and her former husband, Herod, who was his enemy, her father took her away and married her to his son, thus causing sorrow for her former husband. However, the evangelist Luke provides a fuller account of who this Philip is: In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea; Herod was tetrarch of Galilee; his brother Philip was tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis regions (Luke 3:1). Therefore, John the Baptist, who had come in the spirit and power of Elijah, with the same authority that Elijah had rebuked Ahab and Jezebel (1 Kings 21), rebuked Herod and Herodias for their unlawful marriage and for Herod taking Herodias as his wife while his brother was still alive. John preferred to risk his life by confronting the king rather than to compromise and be forgetful of God's commandments due to flattery.


<h2 id='tocuniq285'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5) And wanting to kill him, he feared the people, because they held him as a prophet. Indeed, he truly feared the sedition of the people because of John, from whom he knew that many crowds had been baptized in the Jordan; but he was overcome by love for his wife, because of her fervor, he had even neglected God's commandments. (Genesis 40)

<h2 id='tocuniq286'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) However, on Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and it pleased Herod. We found no one else who observed his birthday, except Herod and Pharaoh, so their impiety would be on par, and there would be a celebration together.

<h2 id='tocuniq287'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) So when he had promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask of him. But she, being forewarned by her mother, asked for the head of John the Baptist. I do not excuse Herod, because against his will and reluctantly he committed a murder under oath, who perhaps swore this in order to prepare the devices of a future killing. Otherwise, if he says that he did it because of an oath, if he had asked for the death of his father or mother, would he not have done it? Therefore, since he was ready to repudiate ((or had repudiated)) it in himself, he ought to have despised and rejected it in the prophet.


<h2 id='tocuniq288'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) Give me, he said, here on a platter, the head of John the Baptist. Herodias, fearing that Herod might come to his senses someday, or that he might become friendly with his brother Philip and dissolve their unlawful marriage, instructs her daughter to ask for the head of John immediately at the banquet: a fitting reward for the dance, a worthy prize for the blood.

And the king was sad. It is the custom of the Scriptures, as the historian narrates the opinion of many, to tell how it was believed by everyone at that time. Just as Joseph was called the father of Jesus by Mary herself, so now Herod is said to be sad, because they thought this while reclining at the table (Luke 2). For he was a dissembler of his own mind and a skillful murderer, he showed sadness on his face while having joy in his mind.


<h2 id='tocuniq289'>(Vers. 9, 10.)</h2>

(Vers. 9, 10.) However, because of the oath and because of those who were reclining together, he commanded it to be given. And he sent and beheaded John in prison. Crime excuses an oath, so that under the guise of piety, the impious act would be done. But what he added: And because of those who were reclining together, he wants them all to be partners in his crime, so that they would be brought into a luxurious and impure feast of bloody banquets.

<h2 id='tocuniq290'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) And his head was brought in on a platter, and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. We read in Roman history that the Roman leader Flamininus, who was lying next to a prostitute who claimed she had never seen a beheaded man, agreed to be accused of a capital crime and be executed at a banquet. He was expelled from the Senate by the censors because he had mixed the feast with blood and because he had given preference to the delight of another over the death of a guilty man, so that lust and murder were combined. How wicked Herod and Herodias and the girl who danced, demanded the price of the prophet's blood, so that she may have power over the tongue that condemned their unlawful marriage. This was fulfilled literally; but even today we see that the Jews have lost Christ, who is the head of the prophets, in the person of John the Baptist.

And his disciples, coming forward, took his body and buried it. Josephus reports in a certain town of Arabia that John was beheaded. And that which follows: His disciples, coming forward, took the body, both of him, and of the Savior, we can understand.

<h2 id='tocuniq291'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) And they came and told Jesus. When Jesus heard this, He departed from there in a boat to a deserted place by Himself. They announced the death of John the Baptist to the Savior, which, when He heard, He went away into a deserted place. Not, as some suppose, out of fear of death, but sparing His enemies, lest they should join murder to murder. Or perhaps postponing His own death until the day of His Passover, on which the Lamb had to be sacrificed because of the sacrament, and the doorposts of believers had to be sprinkled with blood (Exodus 12). Or perhaps he departed in order to provide us an example of avoiding those who offer themselves unnecessarily to danger: because not all have the same perseverance in torments as they offer themselves to be tormented. For this reason, he also instructs in another place: When they persecute you in this city, flee to another (Matt. X, 23). The evangelist elegantly does not say, flee to a deserted place, but departed, so that he may avoid the persecutors more than fear them. Another: After the Jews and the king of the Jews had cut off the head of the prophets and lost their language and voice among them, Jesus went into the desert, a place which the Church had not previously had a man.

And when the crowds heard, they followed him on foot from the cities. It is possible that, for another reason, upon hearing of the death of John, they withdrew to a deserted place, in order to confirm the faith of the believers. Finally, the crowds followed him on foot, not on mounts, not in various vehicles, but by their own labor of feet, to demonstrate their fervor of mind. If we wish to explain the reasons for each word, we exceed the brevity of the intended work. However, it must be said briefly that after the Lord came into the desert, great crowds followed him. For before he came into the wilderness of the nations, he was worshipped by only one people.

<h2 id='tocuniq292'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) 104 And going out, he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, and he healed their sick. In the Gospel speeches, the letter is always connected to the spirit, and whatever seems cold at first sight, if you touch it, it becomes warm. The Lord was in a deserted place; the crowds followed him, leaving their cities, that is, their former ways of life and the various teachings. But Jesus going out signifies that the crowds had indeed the will to go, but they did not have the power to arrive: therefore the Savior goes out of his place and goes to meet them, just as in another parable he had met the repentant son (Luke 15). Seeing the crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their diseases, so that full faith would immediately receive a reward.

<h2 id='tocuniq293'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15) When evening came, his disciples approached him, saying: This is a deserted place, and the hour has already passed; send the crowds away, so that they may go to the villages and buy themselves food. Everything is filled with mysteries. He left Judea and went to a deserted place; the crowds followed him, leaving their cities; Jesus went out to them, had compassion on the crowds, and healed their sick. He did this not in the morning, not as the day was growing, not at noon, but in the evening, when the sun of righteousness set.


<h2 id='tocuniq294'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16) But Jesus said to them: They do not need to go. They do not need to search for different foods and buy themselves unknown breads, when they have heavenly bread with them.

On that day, He commanded you to eat. He challenged the apostles to the breaking of the bread, so that the greatness of the sign may become more known to them, as they bear witness to it.

<h2 id='tocuniq295'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) They replied to him: We only have here five loaves and two fish. In another Gospel it is written: There is a boy here who has five loaves (John 6:9); this boy seems to signify Moses. As for the two fish, we can understand them as representing both Testaments, or because the number two is often associated with the Law. Therefore, before the passion of the Savior and the shining forth of the Gospel, the apostles had nothing more than five loaves and two little fish, which were found in salty waters and the waves of the sea.


<h2 id='tocuniq296'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18) He said to them: Bring me those here. Listen, Marcion, listen, Manichaee, Jesus commands to have five loaves and two small fish brought to him, so that he may sanctify and multiply them.

<h2 id='tocuniq297'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) And when he had commanded the multitude to sit down on the hay. The clear meaning is this: let us unfold the mysteries of spiritual interpretation. They are commanded to sit down on the hay, and according to another Evangelist (Luke 9), on the ground, in groups of fifty or a hundred, so that after trampling on their flesh and all its pleasures, like hay that has dried up, they may then, through penance represented by the number fifty, ascend to the pinnacle of perfection represented by the number one hundred.


After receiving five loaves of bread and two fish, looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke them, and gave the loaves to the disciples. He looked up to heaven, to teach that our eyes should be directed there. He took the five loaves and two fish in his hands, and broke them, and gave them to the disciples. When the Lord broke them, a great quantity of food was produced. For if they had remained whole and not divided, they could not have fed such a great multitude of crowds, children, and women. Therefore, the law is broken with the prophets, and is torn into pieces, and its mysteries are brought into the open, so that what was whole and enduring in its original state may nourish the multitude of nations when divided into parts.

<h2 id='tocuniq298'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20.) However, the disciples gave to the crowds. And all ate and were satisfied. The crowds received food from the Lord through the apostles.

And they took the remains of twelve baskets full of fragments. Each of the apostles fills his basket with the remains of the Savior, so that he has either to provide food for the nations afterwards, or to teach from the remains that the loaves were truly multiplied afterwards. And at the same time wonder, how in the wilderness and in such a vast solitude loaves are not found, except only five, and two fish, 106 and how easily twelve baskets are found.


<h2 id='tocuniq299'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21.) Now, the number of those who ate was five thousand men, not counting women and children. According to the number of five loaves and the multitude of five thousand men who ate, the number had not yet reached the sevenfold number mentioned in another place, which is four thousand men who eat, close to the number in the Gospels. However, those who ate were five thousand men who had grown into perfect men, and they followed him of whom Zacharias says: Behold the man, his name is the Rising Sun. (Zach. VI, 12.) But women, and children, the weaker sex and the younger age, are unworthy of being counted by number. Therefore, in the book of Numbers, whenever the priests and Levites, and the armies or crowds of fighters are described, slaves and women, and children, and the common people are omitted without number.

<h2 id='tocuniq300'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) And immediately Jesus compelled his disciples to get into a boat and go ahead of him across the sea, until he dismissed the crowds. He commanded the disciples to cross over, and he forced them to get into the boat. This shows, by his words, that they unwillingly separated from the Lord, as they did not want to be separated from him even for a moment, due to their love for their teacher.

<h2 id='tocuniq301'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) And after dismissing the crowd, he went up the mountain alone to pray. And when evening came, he was there alone. If Peter, James, and John, who had seen his glory being transformed, had been with him, perhaps they would have gone up the mountain with him. But the crowd cannot follow to lofty places unless it has been taught by the sea on the shore and nourished in the desert. However, the fact that he went up alone to pray should not be attributed to the one who fed five thousand people with five loaves, excluding children and women; but to the one who, upon hearing of John's death, withdrew into solitude. Not that we should separate the person of the Lord, but that his works are divided between God and man.


<h2 id='tocuniq302'>107 (Vers. 24.)</h2>

107 (V. 24.) But the boat was being tossed in the middle of the sea by the waves: for the wind was contrary. Rightly, as if unwillingly, and the apostles, pulling away, had departed from the Lord, so that they would not suffer shipwreck in his absence. Finally, while the Lord was staying on the mountaintop, immediately a contrary wind arises, and the sea is disturbed, and the apostles are in peril, and the imminent shipwreck persists as long as Jesus does not come.

<h2 id='tocuniq303'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) But in the fourth watch of the night, he came to them, walking on the sea. Military stations and watches are divided into intervals of three hours. Therefore, when he says that the Lord came to them in the fourth watch of the night, he shows that they were in danger throughout the night, and in the last part of the night, and that help will be given to them at the end of the world.

<h2 id='tocuniq304'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26.) And seeing him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying: It is a ghost. If, according to Marcion and Manichaeus, our Lord was not born of the Virgin, but appeared in a phantom, why are the apostles now afraid of seeing a phantom?

And they cried out from fear. The confused noise and uncertain voice are signs of great fear.

<h2 id='tocuniq305'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) Immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying: Have confidence, it is I, do not be afraid. He takes care of what was first involved in the matter, and commands those who fear, saying: Have confidence, do not be afraid. And what follows, I am, does not add who he is, either they could understand from his familiar voice that he was speaking, who was speaking through the darkness of the obscure night, or they were asking if he himself was the one who spoke to Moses, whom they knew had said: This you will say to the children of Israel: He who is, has sent me to you (Exodus 3:14).


<h2 id='tocuniq306'>(Vers. 28, 29.)</h2>

(Verse 28, 29.) But Peter, answering, said: Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water. And he said: Come. In all places Peter is found to have the most ardent faith. When the disciples were asked who they said Jesus, the Son of God, was, he confessed. When he wanted to go to his passion, he was prohibited: and although he may have erred in understanding, he did not err in his affection: not wanting him to die, whom he had just confessed as the Son of God a little while earlier. He is the first to ascend the mountain with the Savior among the first, and he alone follows during the Passion. He immediately washes away the sin of denial, which had descended from sudden fear, with bitter tears. After the Passion, when they were in the lake of Genesareth and fishing, and the Lord was standing on the shore, while others were gradually sailing, he does not tolerate delay, but, girded with his tunic, he immediately plunges into the waves. Therefore, with the same fervor of faith that he always had, even now, while the others are silent, he believes that he can do, through the will of the teacher, what the teacher could do through nature. Command me to come to you on the water. You command, and immediately the waves will be calmed, and the body, which is naturally heavy, will become light.

And Peter, descending from the little boat, walked on the water to come to Jesus. Let those who think that the body of the Lord was not true because he walked on soft and airy waters, explain how Peter also walked, whom they certainly cannot deny was a true human being.

<h2 id='tocuniq307'>(Vers. 30.)</h2>

(Verse 30.) But seeing a strong wind, he was afraid. And when he began to sink, he cried out, saying: Lord, save me. The faith of his soul burned, but human weakness dragged him into the depths. Therefore, a little bit of temptation is left, so that faith may grow and understand that it is not by the ease of his request, but by the power of the Lord that he is saved.

<h2 id='tocuniq308'>(Vers. 31, 32.)</h2>

(Verse 31, 32.) And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him: O you of little faith, why did you doubt? And when he had gotten into the boat, the wind ceased. If to the apostle Peter, of whom we have spoken above concerning the faith and ardor of his mind, who confidently asked the Savior, saying: Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters, because he feared a little, it is said: O you of little faith, why did you doubt? What must we say, who have even a small portion of this little faith?" }


<h2 id='tocuniq309'>(Vers. 33.)</h2>

(Verse 33) But those who were in the boat came and worshipped him, saying, Truly you are the Son of God. At the sight of this one sign, the calm of the sea being restored, which sometimes happens after severe storms by chance, the sailors and passengers truly confess the Son of God, and Arius preaches a creature in the Church.

<h2 id='tocuniq310'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) And when he had crossed over, they came to the land of Genesareth. If we knew what Genesareth would sound like in our language, we would understand how Jesus, through the image of the apostles and the ship, leads the Church liberated from the shipwreck of persecution to the shore, and makes it rest in the most peaceful harbor.

<h2 id='tocuniq311'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Verse 35.) And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent throughout all that region. They knew him by reputation, not by appearance, or certainly not for the magnitude of the signs he was performing among the people; he was also well-known by his face to many. And see how great is the faith of the people in the land of Genesareth, that they are not satisfied with the healing of those who are present, but send to other cities in the surrounding area, so that everyone may come to the doctor.

<h2 id='tocuniq312'>(Vers. 36.)</h2>

(Verse 36.) And all those who were sick brought themselves forward and begged him to touch even the fringe of his garment. And whoever touched it, they were healed. Those who are sick, do not touch the body of Jesus nor his entire garment, but only the edge of the fringe, and whoever touches it will be healed. The fringe of his garment, or rather understand the smallest commandment: whoever transgresses it will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. And through the assumption of the body, by which we come to the Word of God, and afterwards enjoy His majesty.

<h2 id='tocuniq313'>(Chap. XV.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 15, Verse 1) Then the scribes and Pharisees came to him from Jerusalem, saying, 'Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.' How foolish are the Pharisees and scribes, accusing the Son of God of not keeping the traditions and precepts of men.

<h2 id='tocuniq314'>(Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Verse 1, 2.) For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread. Hands, that is, works, not certainly of the body, but of the soul, are to be washed, so that the word of God may be made in them.

<h2 id='tocuniq315'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3) But he answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? He refutes false accusation with a true response. For, he says, you neglect the precepts of the Lord because of human tradition, why do you think my disciples should be accused, because they disregard the orders of the elders, in order to keep the knowledge of God?

<h2 id='tocuniq316'>(Vers. 4 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 4 and following) For God said, 'Honor your father and mother, and whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death.' But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to God,' he need not honor his father.' So you have made void the word of God because of your tradition. You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said: 'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me' (Exodus 20, Leviticus 20). But they worship me without cause, teaching doctrines and commandments of men. And he called the crowds to him and said to them: Hear and understand. Honor in the Scriptures is not only felt in greetings and official deference, but also in acts of charity and offering of gifts (Exod. XX and XXI, and Lev. XX). The Apostle says, 'Honor widows who are truly widows' (I Tim. V, 3); here, honor is understood as a gift. And in another place: Elders should be honored with a double honor, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine of God (Ibid., 17). And by this command we are ordered not to close the mouth of an ox that treads out the corn (Deut. 25). And may the worker be worthy of his wages (Luke 10). The Lord had commanded, taking into consideration the weakness, the age, or the poverty of the parents, that the children should honor their parents even in the necessary things of life. Desiring to overturn this most provident law of God, the scribes and Pharisees, in order to introduce impiety under the name of piety, taught wicked children that if anyone wanted to offer to God those things which should be offered to parents (who is the true Father), the offering of the Lord should take precedence over the gifts to the parents, or certainly the parents themselves, seeing that they were dedicated to God, would avoid incurring the crime of sacrilege and would be consumed by poverty. And so it happened that the offering of the children, under the pretext of the temple of God, would be given to the profits of the priests. This worst tradition of the Pharisees came about on another occasion. Many, having debts to others and not wanting to repay what was owed to them, delegated to the priests so that the money collected would serve the needs of the temple and their own use. This can also be understood briefly. Convert, he says, the sons to say to their parents: whatever gift I was going to offer to God, I consume it on your food, and it benefits you, oh father and mother, that they, fearing to accept what is dedicated to God, prefer to live in need rather than eat from the consecrated things." }


<h2 id='tocuniq317'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11) It is not what enters into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a person. The word, properly spoken, is what defiles, and it is not worn out in everyday speech. The Jewish people, boasting to be a part of God, call common foods those which all people consume. For example, pork, oysters, hares, and similar animals that do not split the hoof, do not chew the cud, and are not scaly in fish. And in the Acts of the Apostles it is written: What God has sanctified, do not call common (Acts 10:15). Therefore, that which is common and is open to other people, and is not from God's side, is called unclean. It is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person, but what proceeds out of the mouth that defiles a person. Let a wise reader object and say: If what enters the mouth does not defile a person, then why do we not eat idol sacrifices? And the Apostle writes: 'You cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons' (I Cor. X, 20). It should be known then that indeed, food itself, and every creature of God, is clean: but the invocation of idols and demons makes it unclean.

<h2 id='tocuniq318'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) Then his disciples approached him and said: Do you know that the Pharisees were scandalized when they heard this word? From one sermon, all the superstition of Jewish observances was abolished; those who believed that their religion was based on the abominable and acceptable foods. And because it is often used in Ecclesiastical Scriptures, let us briefly explain what 'scandal' means. Σκῶλον and scandal, we can say it means offense, or ruin and stumbling block. When, therefore, we read: 'Whoever causes scandal to one of these little ones, it is understood that he has given occasion for ruin to anyone, either by word or by deed.'

<h2 id='tocuniq319'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. Even those things which seem plain in the Scriptures are full of questions. Every plant, he says, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. Therefore that plantation also shall be rooted up, of which the Apostle saith: I have planted, Apollo watered  (1 Corinthians 3:6) . But the question is resolved by what follows: But God gave the increase  (ibid., 9) . He also says: You are God's agriculture, you are God's building (3 John 8). And in another place: We are God's co-workers. If, however, we are co-workers, therefore, God plants and waters with His co-workers (or workers), with Paul planting and Apollo watering. Those who introduce different natures abuse this passage, saying: If the planting that the Father did not plant will be uprooted, therefore, what He did plant cannot be uprooted. But let them hear that of Jeremiah; I have planted you a true vineyard, how have you been turned into the bitterness of an alien vine? (Jer. II, 21) For indeed God has planted, and no one can uproot His planting. But since this planting is in the will of one's own free choice, no one else can uproot it unless it gives its consent.

<h2 id='tocuniq320'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit. This is what the Apostle commanded: Avoid a heretical man, after a first and second admonition, knowing that he is perverted and condemned by himself (Titus 3:10). In this sense, the Savior also commanded that the worst teachers should be left to their own devices, knowing that they are difficult to be brought to the truth and that they are blind, leading a blind people into error.


<h2 id='tocuniq321'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(V. 15, 16.) 114 Peter, answering, said to him: Explain to us this parable. But he said: Are you also still without understanding? What had been openly said and was clear to the hearing, the apostle Peter thinks was said in a parable and seeks a mystical understanding in a matter that is evident. And he is rebuked by the Lord for thinking that what was clearly spoken was said in a parable. From this we observe the flawed nature of the listener, who either wants to understand obscure things clearly or clearly spoken things in an obscure manner.


<h2 id='tocuniq322'>(Vers. 17, 18.)</h2>

(Verse 17, 18.) Do you not understand that everything that enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is expelled into the sewer? But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart and defile a person. All the passages of the Gospels with the heretics and the perverse are full of scandals. And some people slander from this little sentence, that the Lord, ignorant of physiolog And there are many who, due to a weakness of the stomach, constantly endure vomiting, immediately vomiting up what they have ingested after meals and snacks, and yet they are corpulent: because at the first touch, more liquid food and drink are poured through the limbs. But while these types of people want to criticize the incompetence of others, they show their own. For even though the food and drink is thin and liquid, once it has been digested and processed in the veins and limbs, it flows down to the lower parts through the hidden channels of the body, which the Greeks call 'poroi', and passes into the rectum.


<h2 id='tocuniq323'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Vers. 19, 20.) For from the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies: these are the things that defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a person. For from the heart, he says, come evil thoughts. Therefore, the principal part of the soul, not according to Plato in the brain, but according to Christ, is in the heart: and those who believe that evil thoughts are inspired by the devil and not born from one's own will can be argued against with this statement. The Devil can be a helper and instigator of evil thoughts, but he cannot be the author. However, if he is always lying in wait, he may kindle a small spark of our thoughts with his own fuel, and we should not think that he also explores the hidden depths of the heart, but rather we should judge what we are inwardly from the outward appearance and actions of the body. For example, if he sees us frequently gazing at a beautiful woman, he understands that our heart has been wounded by the arrow of love.


<h2 id='tocuniq324'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verse 21, 22.) And Jesus went out from there and withdrew to the regions of Tyre and Sidon. And behold, a Canaanite woman from those borders came out and cried out to Him, saying. You neglect the scribes and Pharisees who accuse you, and you go to the regions of Tyre and Sidon to heal the Tyrians and Sidonians. But the Canaanite woman goes out from her former borders, in order to implore health for her daughter, crying out. Note that in the fifteenth place, the daughter of the Canaanite will be healed.


Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David. For he already knew how to call himself the Son of David, because he had already gone out of his own borders and had forsaken the error of the Tyrians and Sidonians in the exchange of place and faith.

My daughter is tormented by an evil spirit. I believe that the Canaanite people, who were tormented by evil spirits, were ignorant of the Creator and worshipped idols.

<h2 id='tocuniq325'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) He did not respond to him with a word. Not out of Pharisaic pride, nor from the disdain of the Scribes; but so that he himself would not seem to be going against his own command, by which he had ordered: Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into the cities of the Samaritans (above, X, 5). For he did not want to give occasion to the slanderers and reserved the perfect salvation of the Gentiles for the time of his passion and resurrection.

And his disciples approached him, saying: Send her away, for she is crying out after us. At that time, the disciples, still unaware of the mysteries of the Lord, or moved by mercy, were begging for the Canaanite woman, whom another Evangelist calls the Syrophoenician woman (Mark 7), or desiring to be free from her importunity; for she was loudly calling not as a merciful one, but as a harsh physician.

<h2 id='tocuniq326'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Not that he was not sent also to the Gentiles; but that he was sent first to Israel, that, their not receiving the Gospel, the transmigration might be made to the Gentiles. And he said significantly, unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel; that from this place we may also understand one erring sheep out of another parable.

<h2 id='tocuniq327'>(Vers. 25, 26.)</h2>

(Verse 25, 26) But she came and worshipped him, saying: Lord, help me. And he answering, said: It is not good to take the bread of the children, and to cast it to the dogs. The faith, patience, and humility of the woman of Canaan are preached through this character. Faith, by which she believed that her daughter could be healed. Patience, by which she persevered in prayer despite being ignored so many times. Humility, by which she compared herself not to dogs, but to puppies. However, the term "dogs" refers to the ethnic dogs, who are devoted to idolatry and are said to become rabid with the consumption of blood and the flesh of the dead. Note that this Canaanite woman persistently calls first David her son, then the Lord, and finally worships him as God.

<h2 id='tocuniq328'>(Vers. 27, 28.)</h2>

(Vers. 27, 28.) But she said: Yes, Lord. Even the small dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table. Then Jesus answered and said to her: O woman, great is your faith: let it be done to you as you desire. And her daughter was healed from that hour. I know, she says, that I do not deserve the bread of the children, nor can I eat whole meals; nor can I sit at the table with the father; but I am content with the scraps of the puppies; so through the humility of the crumbs, I can receive the greatness of the whole bread." } Oh marvelous change of things! Israel once a son, now we are dogs. Because of the diversity of faith, the order of names is changed. Concerning them it is said afterwards: Many dogs have surrounded me (Ps. XXI, 17). And: Behold the dogs, behold the 117 evil workers, behold the concision (Philippians III). We have heard with the Syrophoenician woman and the woman who had a flow of blood: Your faith is great, let it be done for you as you wish. And: Daughter, your faith has made you well.


<h2 id='tocuniq329'>(Vers. 29, 30.)</h2>

(Verse 29, 30.) And when Jesus had passed from there, he came near the Sea of Galilee: and going up into a mountain, he sat there. And many crowds approached him, having with them mute people, blind people, lame people, weak people, and many others. And they cast them at his feet. In the place where the Latin interpreter translated, weak people, it is written in Greek as κυλλοὺς, which is not a general name for weakness, but the name of a specific weakness: just as someone is called lame who limps with one foot, so κυλλὸς can be called someone who has one weak hand. We do not have the possession of this word. Hence, the evangelist explained the healings of the others in the following narratives, but was silent about theirs. For what follows?

<h2 id='tocuniq330'>(Vers. 31.)</h2>

(Verse 31.) And he healed them, so that the crowds marveled, seeing the mute speaking, the lame walking, the blind seeing: and they magnified the God of Israel. He was silent about the crippled, because he had nothing to say in opposition. This is about one word. But let us consider that the healed daughter of the Canaanite return to Judea, and to the Sea of Galilee, and ascend the mountain: and like a bird provoking its young to fly; there she may sit, and crowds may gather around him, leading or carrying with them variously afflicted individuals: whom he cured, and gave them food; and when this work was accomplished, he got into a boat, and came to the region of Magdala. And he went up the mountain and sat there, and the crowds came to him. Notice that the mute, the lame, and the blind are brought to the mountain to be healed by the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq331'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32.) But Jesus, having summoned his disciples, said: I have compassion on the crowd, because they have persevered with me for three days already, and they do not have anything to eat. And I do not want to send them away fasting, lest they faint on the way. He wants to feed those whom he has healed; first, he takes away their weaknesses, so that later he may offer food to the healthy. He also summons his disciples and speaks to them about what he is about to do, in order to give an example to the teachers, that they should share their plans with the disciples and the younger ones, or that they may understand the greatness of the sign from their conversation, answering that they do not have any bread in the desert. He said, 'I have compassion on the crowd, because they have persevered with me for three days now. Let the crowd be compassionate, because they believed in the number of three days, to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And they have nothing to eat. The crowd is always hungry and in need of food, unless they are satisfied by the Lord. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way. They were hungry after great hardships and patiently expected food in the future. Jesus does not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.' Therefore, he who hastens to reach the desired dwelling without heavenly bread is in danger. Hence, the angel speaks to Elijah: Rise up and eat, for you are about to walk a long way (3 Kings 19:7).

<h2 id='tocuniq332'>(Vers. 33 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 33 et seq.) And his disciples say to him: From where then would we get so many loaves in the wilderness, as to satisfy such a great crowd? And Jesus said to them: How many loaves do you have? And they said: Seven, and a few small fish. And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground. And taking the seven loaves and the fish, and giving thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples: and the disciples gave them to the crowd. And they all ate and were satisfied. And what remained of the fragments, they took up seven baskets full. Now those who had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children. And after dismissing the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan ((Μαγδαλά)). We have already mentioned this sign above, and it is idle to repeat the same: let us only dwell on those things which differ. Above we read: When evening came, the disciples approached him, saying: The place is deserted (Above, XIV, 15), and the rest. Having called together his disciples, the Lord himself speaks: I have compassion on the crowd, because they have persevered with me for three days already. There were five loaves and two fish there; here there are seven loaves and a few small fish. There they recline on the grass; here on the ground. There those who eat are five thousand, according to the number of loaves they eat; here four thousand. There twelve baskets are filled with the remains of the fragments; here seven baskets. Therefore, in the previous sign, those who were close and near to the five senses, the Lord himself does not remember them, but the disciples remember them in the evening of the neighboring night, and with the sun already setting. But the Lord himself remembers and says that he has compassion and explains the reason for his compassion: because they have been persevering with me for three days now (also with him, and with themselves), and he does not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way. Those who are nourished by the seven loaves, that is, in the sacred number and perfect number, are not five thousand, but four thousand: a number that is always praised, and a square stone does not sway, and is not unstable; and for this reason also the Gospels are consecrated in that number.


<h2 id='tocuniq333'>(Chap. XVI.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 16, verses 1 and following.) And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to him, testing him and asking him to show them a sign from heaven. But he answered and said to them, “When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’ And in the morning, ‘It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times. An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, and a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.” This is not found in most manuscripts: it is evident that, from the order and consistency of the elements, both clear and rainy days can be predicted. However, the scribes and Pharisees, who seemed to be the teachers of the law, could not understand the coming of the Savior from the prophecy of the prophets.

<h2 id='tocuniq334'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5) And leaving them, he went away. And when his disciples had come across the sea, they forgot to take bread. He said to them: 'When you have left the scribes and Pharisees, to whom he had said, 'An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet,' he rightly went away across the sea and followed the peoples of the Gentiles. But what the sign of Jonah means for them has already been said above.'

<h2 id='tocuniq335'>(Vers. 6, 7.)</h2>

(Vers. 6, 7.) Look and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. But they were thinking among themselves, saying: Because we have not taken bread. Whoever beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, does not keep the precepts of the Law and the teachings of the letters, neglects the traditions of men, in order to fulfill the commandment of God.

<h2 id='tocuniq336'>(Vers. 8 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 8 seqq.) But Jesus, knowing this, said to them: Why do you think among yourselves, O you of little faith, that you have no bread? Do you not yet understand or remember the five loaves for the five thousand men, and how many baskets you took up? Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand men, and how many baskets you took up? Why do you not understand that I did not speak to you about bread: Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Then they understood that he did not say beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. By occasion of the precept which the Saviour enjoined, saying: 'Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees,' He teaches what the five loaves and the seven signify: the five thousand men, and the four thousand, which were satisfied in the desert; which, though the greatness of the miracles is open, yet also another thing is demonstrated in the spiritual understanding. For if the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees signifies not bodily bread, but perverse traditions and heretical dogmas, why should not the foods, by which the people of God were nourished, signify the true and whole doctrine? Let someone inquire and say: How is it that the loaves they did not have, who immediately filled seven baskets, they got into the boat and came to the region of Magdala: and there they heard from the sailors that they should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees? But Scripture testifies that they forgot to take them with them. This is the leaven that the Apostle is speaking of; A little leaven corrupts the whole mass (1 Corinthians 5:6). Marcion, Valentinus, and all heretics had this kind of leaven, which should be avoided by all means. This fermentation has the power that if it is mixed with flour, which seemed small, it grows larger and draws the whole mixture to its own flavor. Similarly, heretical teaching, if it has thrown even a small spark into your heart, in a short time grows into a huge flame and draws the whole possession of the person to itself. Finally, it follows: Then they understood that he did not say to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

Third Book

<h2 id='tocuniq338'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) 121 But Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi. This Philip is the brother of Herod, of whom we spoke above, a tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis, who built in honor of Tiberius Caesar Caesarea, which is now called Paneas, and in honor of Caesar, and also in honor of himself, he named it Caesarea Philippi, and it is in the province of Phoenicia: imitating his father Herod, who named Caesarea in honor of Augustus Caesar, which was previously called the tower of Strato, and he built it across the Jordan in the name of his daughter Julia. This place (which others call that place) is Caesarea Philippi, where the Jordan River rises at the foot of Mount Lebanon, and it has two springs, one called Jor, and the other Dan, which when mixed together, become the Jordan River.

And he asked his disciples, saying: Whom do men say that the Son of man is? He did not say, whom do men say that I am, but the Son of man: lest he should seem to boast of himself. And note, that wherever it is written in the Old Testament, son of man, in Hebrew it is written, son of Adam. As it is also written, which we read in the psalm: Sons of men, how long will you be of heavy heart (Psalm 4:3), which in Hebrew is said, sons of Adam. But beautifully he asks: Whom do people say that the Son of Man is? For those who speak of the Son of Man are human: but those who understand his divinity are not human, but are called gods.

<h2 id='tocuniq339'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) But they said: Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and others Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. Jesus said to them, I marvel that some interpreters search for the causes of individual errors, and weave a very long discussion about why some believed our Lord Jesus Christ to be John, others Elijah, others Jeremiah, or one of the prophets, when they could have erred in Elijah and Jeremiah just as Herod erred in John, saying, 'I have beheaded John, but he has risen from the dead, and miracles are being performed by him' (Mark 6:16).


<h2 id='tocuniq340'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Verse 15, 16.) But who do you say that I am? Simon Peter answered, 'You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.' Wise reader, pay attention, for from the following words and the context of the discourse, the apostles are not called men, but gods. For when he said, 'Who do men say that the Son of Man is?' he added, 'But who do you say that I am?' They, being men, relying on human opinions; but you, who are gods, what do you think of me being? Peter, in the name of all the apostles, proclaims: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. He calls Him the living God, in distinction from those gods who are thought to be gods, but are dead: Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, Minerva (or Ceres), Bacchus, Hercules, and the like, which are mere prodigies of idols.

<h2 id='tocuniq341'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) But Jesus answered and said to him: Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. The Apostles testify of themselves. Peter had said: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God; a true confession received a reward: Blessed are you, Simon Barjona. Why? because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but the Father revealed it. What flesh and blood could not reveal, was revealed by the grace of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, from confession he obtains the name, because he has a revelation from the Holy Spirit, of whom he is also to be called the son. For Barjona in our language means 'son of a dove', as others simply understand that Simon, that is, Peter, is the son of John, according to the question in another place: 'Simon of Jonas, lovest thou me?' (John 21:15). He answered: 'Lord, thou knowest.' And by an error of the writers, they corrupt it as Bar Joanna, that is, son of John, with one syllable being removed. However, Joanna is interpreted as 'by the grace of the Lord.' Both names can be understood mystically, as both the dove, the Holy Spirit, and the grace of God signify a spiritual gift. Also, what he says, 'For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you,' is compared to the Apostolic narrative where he says, 'I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood' (Galatians 1:16), 'flesh and blood' signifying the Jews, so that here also it may be shown in a different sense that Christ the Son of God was revealed to him not by the teaching of the Pharisees, but by the grace of God.


<h2 id='tocuniq342'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) And I say to you. What is it that he says: And I say to you? Because you told me: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God: and I say to you, not in vain words, and having no effect, but I say to you: that what I have said, I have done.

Because you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church. Just as he himself gave the light to the apostles, so that they were called the light of the world, and they received other names from the Lord: in the same way, he bestowed the name of Peter upon Simon, who believed in Christ the rock. But according to the metaphor of the rock, it is rightly said to him: I will build my Church upon you.

And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I consider the gates of hell to be vices and sins: or certainly the doctrines of heretics, through which deceived men are led to Tartarus. Therefore, let no one think that it is said concerning death, that the apostles were not subject to the condition of death, whose martyrdoms he sees shining.

<h2 id='tocuniq343'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19) And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. The bishops and priests who do not understand this passage assume something for themselves from the Pharisees, either to condemn the innocent or to consider themselves free when they are guilty; for before God, it is not the opinion of the priests but the life of the accused that is sought. In Leviticus (Chapter XIV) we read about leprosy, where they are commanded to show themselves to the priests, and if they have leprosy, then they are made unclean by the priest. Not that the priests make lepers unclean; but so that they have knowledge of who is leprous and who is not, and can discern who is clean and who is unclean. Just as in that case the priest declares the leper clean or unclean, so here the bishop and priest bind or loose, not those who are innocent or guilty; but according to their office, when they have heard the varieties of sins, they know who should be bound and who should be released.


<h2 id='tocuniq344'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20.) Then he commanded his disciples not to tell anyone that he was Jesus Christ. Previously, when he sent the disciples to preach, he had instructed them to proclaim his coming: here he commanded them not to say that he was Jesus Christ. It seems to me that preaching Christ is one thing, and preaching Jesus Christ is another. Christ is a common name of dignity; Jesus is the proper name of the Savior. However, it is possible that before his passion and resurrection, he did not want to be proclaimed for this reason; and after the completion of the sacrament of his blood, he would more appropriately say to the apostles: Go and teach all nations (Matthew 28:19), etc. Lest anyone think that our understanding is only intellectual and not guided by the Gospel, the following reasons explain the prohibition of preaching at that time.

<h2 id='tocuniq345'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) Then Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. And the meaning is: Proclaim me then, when I have suffered these things, for it is not profitable to publicly proclaim Christ and make known his majesty to the people, who will soon witness him being scourged and crucified, and suffering many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes. And now Jesus suffers many things from those who crucify the Son of God again (Heb. VI): and while the elders are thought to be in the Church, and the chief priests, following the simple letter, kill the Son of God, who is fully felt in spirit.

<h2 id='tocuniq346'>(Vers. 22, 23.)</h2>

(Verses 22, 23.) And taking him, Peter began to rebuke him, saying: Far be it from you, Lord, this shall not be to you. But he turned and said to Peter: Go behind me, Satan, you are a stumbling block to me; for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men. We have often said that Peter had excessive zeal and love for the Lord and Savior. Therefore, after his confession, in which he said: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God; and after hearing the Savior's reward: Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven, he suddenly hears from the Lord that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and scribes and chief priests, and be killed, and on the third day rise again, he does not want his confession to be destroyed; nor does he think it possible for the Son of God to be killed; and he takes him into his affection, or leads him aside, so as not to appear to argue with the teacher in the presence of the other disciples, and with the affection of a lover, and desiring, he begins to say: Far be it from you, Lord; or as it is better expressed in Greek, ἵλεώς σοι, Κύριε, οὐ μὴ ἔσται σοι τοῦτο, which means, be propitious to yourself, Lord, this shall not be to you: it cannot happen, and my ears do not accept that the Son of God shall be killed. To whom the Lord turned, He said: Go away from me, Satan, you are a stumbling block to me. Satan is interpreted as adversary or opponent. Because you speak contrary to my will, you must be called an adversary. Many think that it was not Peter who was rebuked, but the spirit of the adversary who suggested these things to the Apostle. But to me, this is an apostolic error, coming from affection for piety, it will never seem like an incentive from the devil: Go away from me, Satan. The devil says: Go away. Peter listens: Go away from me, that is, follow my opinion: because you do not understand the things that are of God, but the things that are of men. It is my will, and the Father's (whose will I came to do (John 6)) to die for the salvation of mankind, while you, considering only your own will, do not want a grain of wheat to fall into the ground, so that it may bear much fruit (John 12). The prudent reader may inquire how, after such great blessings: Blessed are you, Simon Barona; and: You are Peter; and upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it; and: I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and: Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven; now he hears: Go away from me, Satan, you are a stumbling block to me? But what kind of sudden conversion is this, that after so great rewards, he is called Satan? But if he who seeks this considers, he will understand that to Peter that blessing and beatitude, and power, and the edification upon him of the Church, are promised in the future, not given in the present. I will build, says He, my Church upon you, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And: I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. All these things are about the future, which if He had immediately given to him, the mistaken opinion would never have found a place in him.


<h2 id='tocuniq347'>(Vers. 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Verses 24 onward) Then Jesus said to his disciples: If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul? Whoever puts off the old man with his works (Colossians 3), denies himself, saying: I no longer live, but Christ lives in me (Galatians 2:20): and he takes up his cross and is crucified to the world. But to whom the world has been crucified, he follows the crucified Lord.

But what will a man give in exchange for his soul? For Israel, Egypt and Ethiopia are given in exchange, and Syene (Isaiah XLIII, 3, 4): for the human soul, that alone is the retribution, which the Psalmist sings: What shall I render to the Lord for all that he has rendered to me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord (Psalm CXV, 3).

<h2 id='tocuniq348'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each one according to his deeds. Peter, shocked by the preaching of the Lord's death, was rebuked by the Lord's statement: the disciples were provoked to deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow their Master with a mindset of dying. A great terror for those who hear, and if possible, even to instill fear in the chief of the apostles; therefore, joyful things follow the sorrowful, and He says: the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels. Fear death, listen to the glory of the triumphant. You fear the cross, listen to the ministries of the angels. And then, it says, he will render to each one according to his works (Rom. X, 12). There is no distinction between Jew and Gentile, man and woman, poor and rich, where not persons, but works are considered.

<h2 id='tocuniq349'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28) Truly I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom. He desired to heal the terror of the apostles with the hope of promises, saying: The Son of Man is coming in the glory of his Father with his angels. Moreover, with the authority of a judge added: and he will render to each one according to his works. The silent thought of the apostles could endure such a scandal: you say that death and killing will come now, but that you promise to be present in the glory of the Father with the ministries of angels and the power of a judge, this will happen day by day, and will be postponed for a long time. Therefore, foreseeing what the experts of hidden things could object, he offsets present fear with present reward. For what does he say? There are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom; so that the manner in which he will come afterwards is demonstrated to you at the present time because of your disbelief.

<h2 id='tocuniq350'>(Chap. XVII.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 17 - Verse 1) And after six days, Jesus took Peter, and James, and John his brother. Why Peter, and James, and John are separated from the others in some places in the Gospels, or what privilege they have over the other apostles, we have frequently mentioned. Now it is asked how he took them after six days, and led them into a high mountain apart: since the evangelist Luke mentions the number eight (Luke 9). But the answer is easy, because here the middle days are included, the first and the last are added. For it is not said: After eight days Jesus took Peter, and James, and John; but on the eighth day.

He leads them to a high mountain apart. To lead disciples to the mountains is part of the kingdom. They are led apart, because many are called, but few are chosen (Matthew 20:16 and 22:14).

<h2 id='tocuniq351'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Verse 2.) And he was transfigured before them. Just as he will be at the time of judgment, so he appeared to the apostles. Now when it is said: he was transfigured before them, no one can think that he lost or gave up his original form and appearance, or that he lost the reality of his body and assumed a spiritual or airy body; but how he was transformed, the evangelist explains, saying.

And his face shone like the sun, and his garments became white as snow. When the splendor of his face is revealed, and the whiteness of his garments is described, it is not the substance that is taken away, but the glory is changed. His face shone like the sun. Indeed, the Lord was transformed into that glory in which he will come afterwards in his kingdom. The transformation added splendor, it did not take away his face. Even if his body was spiritual, were his garments also changed, which were so white that another evangelist said: 'Such as no fuller on earth can make' (Mark 9:3)." } But what an eclipse can do over the Earth, is corporal, and is subject to touch, and is not spiritual and airy, so that it deceives the eyes, and can only be seen in an illusion.

<h2 id='tocuniq352'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, speaking with him. When the scribes and Pharisees tested him, demanding signs from heaven, he did not want to give them, but refuted their evil request with a wise response. However, to increase the faith of the apostles, he gives a sign from heaven, with Elijah descending from where he had ascended, and with Moses rising from the underworld. This is also commanded to Ahaz through Isaiah, to ask for a sign from the highest or from the depths (Isa. VII and IV Kings II). For what was said: Moses and Elijah appeared to them, speaking with him; and in another Gospel it is reported that he had announced what he would suffer in Jerusalem (Luke 9): The law and the prophets are shown, who proclaimed with frequent words both the Lord's passion and resurrection.

<h2 id='tocuniq353'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) But Peter, responding, said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here. He who had climbed the mountains does not want to descend to earthly things; but instead, to always persevere in the lofty things.

If you wish, let us make here three tabernacles: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. You are mistaken, Peter, as the other evangelist testifies. You do not know what you are saying (Luke 9). Do not seek three tabernacles, for there is one tabernacle of the Gospel, in which the Law and the Prophets are to be recapitulated. But if you seek three tabernacles, do not compare servants with the Lord, but make three tabernacles: indeed, one for the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; so that as they have one divinity, there may be one tabernacle also in your heart.


<h2 id='tocuniq354'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5) While he was still speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear him. Because he had asked foolishly, he does not deserve the Lord's answer, but the Father answers for the Son, so that the word of the Lord may be fulfilled: I do not testify about myself, but the Father who sent me testifies about me (John 5:37, and 8:18). But the cloud appears bright and shadowed, so that those who sought the tabernacle made of branches or tents would be covered by the shade of the bright cloud. 131 A voice also from heaven is heard speaking of the Father, which also bears witness to the Son; and by removing Peter's error, teaches the truth: or rather, by Peter, the other apostles. This is, he says, my beloved Son: to him the tabernacle must be fixed, to him obedience must be given. Here is the son, those servants are: Moses and Elias must also prepare a tabernacle for the Lord in the innermost parts of their heart, along with you.

<h2 id='tocuniq355'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6) And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid. They were terrified for three reasons: either because they knew they had made a mistake, or because a bright cloud had covered them, or because they had heard the voice of God the Father speaking. For human weakness cannot bear the sight of greater glory, and trembling with their whole being, they fall to the ground. The more someone seeks higher things, the more they will collapse into lower things if they are ignorant of their own limits.


<h2 id='tocuniq356'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) And Jesus approached and touched them. Because they were lying down and unable to rise, he kindly approached and touched them, so that fear would depart with his touch and their weakened bodies would be strengthened.

And he said to them: Rise up and do not be afraid. Those whom he had healed with his hand, he heals with his command. Do not be afraid. The first fear is expelled, so that later instruction may be given.

<h2 id='tocuniq357'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) But lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus alone. Reasonably, after they had risen, they saw no one except Jesus alone: so that if Moses and Elijah had continued with the Lord, the uncertain voice of the Father would not be seen, to whom it would give testimony most of all. Therefore, they see Jesus standing, the cloud having been taken away, and Moses and Elijah vanishing: because after the shadow of the Law and the Prophets has departed, which had covered the apostles with its veil, both lights are found in the Gospel.


<h2 id='tocuniq358'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Vers. 9.) And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying: Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man rises from the dead. The anticipation of the future kingdom and the glory of the triumphant were shown on the mountain. Therefore, he does not want this to be preached to the people, so that it would not be considered unbelievable because of the magnitude of the matter, and so that the cross that follows after such glory would not become a stumbling block for simple minds.

<h2 id='tocuniq359'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Ver. 10.) And his disciples asked him, saying: Why then do the scribes say that Elias must first come? Unless we know the reasons why the disciples asked about the name of Elias, their questioning seems foolish and extraordinary. For what does it have to do with those things which are written above, to inquire about the coming of Elias? The tradition of the Pharisees is, according to the prophet Malachi (who is the last of the twelve), that Elias will come before the coming of the Savior and restore the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, and restore all things to their original state (Malachi 4)." } Therefore, the disciples estimate that this transformation of glory, which they see on the mountain, is the one they have been waiting for. And they say: If you have already come in glory, why does your forerunner not appear, especially since they saw Elijah depart. However, when they add: The scribes say that Elijah must come first: By saying 'first', they show that unless Elijah comes, the coming of the Savior according to the Scriptures will not happen.

<h2 id='tocuniq360'>(Vers. 11, 12.)</h2>

(Verse 11, 12) But he answered and said to them: Elijah indeed shall come first and restore all things. But I say to you, that Elijah is already come, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they had a mind. So also the Son of man shall suffer from them. Then the disciples understood that he had spoken to them of John the Baptist.

And they did not recognize him, but they did to him whatever they wanted: That is, they rejected him and beheaded him.

<h2 id='tocuniq361'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) And so the Son of Man is also going to suffer at their hands. Then the disciples understood that he had spoken to them about John the Baptist. However, it is wondered how they can also be said to have crucified Jesus when we read that he was killed by the scribes and Pharisees? And to answer briefly, it is because the faction of the Pharisees consented to the death of John, and Herod joined his will in the killing of the Lord: he sent him back to Pilate to be crucified after mocking and despising him.


<h2 id='tocuniq362'>(Vers. 14, 15.)</h2>

(Verse 14, 15.) Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers greatly; often he falls into fire and often into water. And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him. For this reason, the demon, observing the course of the moon, tries to possess men and defame the Creator through his creatures, as we have said before. But it seems to me, according to the allegory, that the epileptic is someone who is constantly changing his vices from moment to moment, and does not persist in what he starts, but grows and diminishes: now he is thrown into the fire, where the hearts of adulterers are kindled (Hosea 7); now into waters that cannot extinguish love. But when he says, 'I have brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him,' he is secretly accusing the apostles, since the inability to heal is sometimes not due to the weakness of those who heal, but to the faith of those who need healing, as the Lord says, 'It shall be done to you according to your faith' (Mark 5:34 and 10:52).

<h2 id='tocuniq363'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) But Jesus answered and said: O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long will I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me. Not that he has been overcome with weariness, and is gentle and meek, who did not open his mouth as a lamb before the shearer (Isaiah 53), nor did he burst forth in words of fury; but rather, like a physician, if he sees a sick person behaving contrary to his instructions, he may say: How long shall I come to your house, until I lose the skill of my profession, me commanding one thing, and you committing another? But he was not angry with the man, but with the fault; and because of one man, he accused the Jews of unfaithfulness, so he immediately said: Bring him here to me.

<h2 id='tocuniq364'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was healed from that hour. It was not the boy who was suffering, but the demon who deserved to be rebuked. Whether he rebuked the boy and the demon came out of him, because he had been oppressed by the demon due to his sins.

<h2 id='tocuniq365'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) And they said, why were we not able to cast him out? Jesus said to them: Because of your unbelief. Amen, I say to you. This is what he says in another place: Whatever you ask in my name, believing, you shall receive (John 15:2). Therefore, whenever we do not receive, it is not an impossibility on the part of the one who grants, but a fault of those who pray.

<h2 id='tocuniq366'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19) If you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move. And nothing will be impossible for you. Some people think that faith compared to a mustard seed is small because the kingdom of heaven is compared to a mustard seed, but the apostle says, 'And if I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains' (I Cor. XV, 2). Therefore, great is the faith that is equal to a mustard seed. The movement of the mountain does not refer to the one we see with our physical eyes, but to the one who had been transported by the Lord from the lunatic." } For when he says, 'Say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move,' it is understood as referring to the devil. From this, those who argue that the apostles and all believers did not even have a small amount of faith are proven to be foolish, because none of them moved mountains. For the translation of a mountain from one place to another is not so profitable, nor is the seeking of empty signs, as the transfer of this mountain is necessary for the benefit of all, which is said by the prophet to corrupt the whole earth (Zach. IV).


<h2 id='tocuniq367'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) However, this kind is not cast out, except by prayer and fasting. While he teaches how the most wicked demon can be expelled, he instructs everyone to live.

<h2 id='tocuniq368'>(Vers. 21 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 21 and following) While they were conversing in Galilee, Jesus said to them: The Son of Man must be handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and on the third day he will rise again. And they were greatly saddened. He always mixes sadness with prosperity, so that when they come suddenly, they will not terrify the apostles; but rather, let them be carried by premeditated souls: For if they are saddened by his impending death, they should be rejoiced by what is said about his resurrection on the third day. Furthermore, what causes them sadness, and causes them great sadness, does not come from unfaithfulness (otherwise they would have known that Peter was rebuked for not understanding the things of God, but the things of men), but rather because out of love for their teacher, they are willing to hear nothing negative or humiliating about him.

<h2 id='tocuniq369'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Version 24.) And when they came to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma went up to Peter and said, “Does your Teacher not pay the didrachma?” He said, “Yes.” After Augustus Caesar, Judea became subject to taxation, and all were registered. And so Joseph, with Mary his cousin, went up to Bethlehem to be registered. Again, since he was brought up in Nazareth (which is a town in Galilee near the city of Capernaum), they demand the taxes according to custom. And because of the greatness of the signs, those who collected them do not dare to ask Jesus himself, but they approach one of his disciples and maliciously ask whether he will pay the taxes or refuse to comply with Caesar's will, as we read in another place: Is it lawful to pay the tribute to Caesar or not? (Mark 12:14)" }


And when he entered the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying: What thinkest thou, Simon? Of whom do the kings of the earth take tribute or pollage? Of their own children or strangers?

<h2 id='tocuniq370'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) What do you think, Simon? Do the kings of the earth receive tribute or taxes from their own sons or from strangers? And he said, from strangers. Then Jesus said to him: So, the sons are free. Our Lord, both according to the flesh and according to the spirit, was the son of a king, either being born from the lineage of David or the Word of the Almighty Father. Therefore, as a son of a king, he should not pay tribute like the other kings, but he who took on the lowliness of the flesh should fulfill all righteousness. And we, miserable as we are, who are called by the name of Christ, and do nothing worthy of such greatness: he suffered the cross for us, and paid the tribute, we do not pay the tribute for his honor, and we are immune as if we were children of a king.

<h2 id='tocuniq371'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26) But lest we should scandalize them: go to the sea, and cast in a hook, and that fish which shall first come up, take: and when thou hast opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater: take that, and give it to them for me and thee. What I should first admire in this place, I know not, whether his foreknowledge or the greatness of the Savior. Foreknowledge, because he knew that the fish would have a stater in its mouth, and that he himself would be the first to be caught. Greatness and power, if at his word the stater is immediately created in the mouth of the fish, and he by speaking has made what was to come to pass." } But it seems to me, according to mystical understanding, that this is the fish that was first caught, which was in the depths of the sea, and dwelt in salty and bitter depths, in order to be freed through the second Adam from the first Adam. And that which was found in its mouth, that is, in its confession, was rendered for Peter and the Lord. And indeed, the same thing is given a price, but it is divided, because the price was rendered for Peter as if for a sinner: but our Lord had not committed sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth (Isaiah 53). The word 'stater' is used, which means two didrachms, in order to show the likeness of the flesh, while both the servant and the Lord are redeemed for the same price. But it also builds understanding simply for the listener: that the Lord was of such great poverty that He did not have the means to pay taxes for Himself and the apostle. And if someone wants to object: how then did Judas carry money in his purse? We will respond that he considered it wrong to convert the funds of the poor for his own use, and he gave us the same example.


<h2 id='tocuniq372'>(Chap. XVIII.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter XVIII.—Verse 1) At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Who do you think is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? As I have often mentioned, it is worth noting again. The reasons for investigating each of the Lord's words and actions are to be sought. After finding the coin, after paying the taxes, what does the sudden question of the apostles mean? At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Who do you think is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?" } Because they had seen the tribute given to Peter and the Lord, and because of the equality of price, they thought that Peter should be preeminent over all the apostles, who had been compared to the Lord in the giving of the tribute. Therefore, they ask who is greater in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus, seeing their thoughts and understanding the reasons for their error, desires to heal the desire for glory through a competition of humility.

<h2 id='tocuniq373'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Vers. 2.) And calling a little child, he set him in their midst, and said, Truly I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.


<h2 id='tocuniq374'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) Amen, I say to you, unless you are converted and become like little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. The apostles are not commanded to have the age of children, but to have their innocence, and what they possess through the years, let these possess through diligence: so that they may be like little children in malice, not in wisdom.

<h2 id='tocuniq375'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Like this little child, whose example I give to you, he does not persist in anger, does not hold a grudge, does not find delight in seeing a beautiful woman, does not think one thing and speak another; so unless you have such innocence and purity of heart, you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven. Or another way: Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Whoever imitates me and humbles himself as I have humbled myself, taking on the form of a servant, will enter the kingdom of heaven (Philippians 2:8).

<h2 id='tocuniq376'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Version 5.) And whoever welcomes such a little child in my name, welcomes me. Whoever is such, that he imitates the humility and innocence of Christ, in him Christ is welcomed. And wisely, lest when it is brought to the apostles, they think themselves honored, he added that they should be welcomed not because of their own merit, but because of the honor of the master.

<h2 id='tocuniq377'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it is better for him that a millstone be hung around his neck and he be thrown into the sea.

Let him be hanged with a millstone around his neck and thrown into the depths of the sea. Although this general opinion can be applied against all who scandalize someone, it can also be understood, based on the context of the discourse, as being directed against the apostles. They appeared to be competing with each other for dignity when they asked who would be greater in the kingdom of heaven. If they had persisted in this vice, they could have caused those whom they were calling to faith to stumble and perish through their scandal, while witnessing the apostles fighting among themselves for honor. But when he said, 'It is expedient for him that a millstone be hanged about his neck,' he speaks according to the custom of the province, by which those guilty of greater crimes among the ancient Jews were punished by being sunk in the depths with a bound stone. It is expedient for him, because it is much better to receive a brief punishment for guilt than to be preserved in eternal tortures. For the Lord will not judge (or punish) twice for the same thing (Nahum 1).

<h2 id='tocuniq378'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) Woe to the world because of scandals. For it is necessary that scandals come, but woe to that man through whom the scandal comes.

Not because it is necessary for stumbling blocks to come, otherwise those who cause stumbling would be without fault, but because it is necessary for stumbling blocks to occur in this world, each person is exposed to stumbling through their own fault. And at the same time, Judas is struck by a general consensus, as he had prepared his mind for betrayal.

<h2 id='tocuniq379'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Verse 8, 9) But if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire. And if your eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.  It is necessary for scandals to come, but woe to the man by whom the scandal comes. Therefore, every affection is cut off, and every relationship is severed, so that no one among the believers may be exposed to scandal through an opportunity for piety. If, he says, someone is so closely connected to you, like a hand, foot, eye, and is useful and attentive, and sharp in discernment, but causes you scandal and drags you into hell because of a disagreement in morals, it is better for you to be devoid of his closeness and carnal benefits, so that while you desire to profit your relatives and necessary acquaintances, you do not have a cause for ruin. So, neither brother, nor wife, nor sons, nor friends, nor any affection that can exclude us from the kingdom of heaven, should be preferred to the love of the Lord. Each believer knows what harms them or distracts their mind, and is often tempted. It is better to lead a solitary life than to lose eternal life for the sake of the necessities of this present life.

<h2 id='tocuniq380'>(Vers. 10, 11.)</h2>

(Verse 10, 11.) See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I say to you that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven. For the Son of man has come to save that which was lost. He had said before that all close relationships and attachments that could cause scandal should be cut off by hand, foot, or eye: Therefore, he tempers the severity of the sentence with the given command, saying: See that you do not despise one of these little ones. Thus, he said, I command severity so that I may teach mercy to be mingled. However much there is in you, do not despise, but seek their well-being even for the sake of your own salvation. But if you see them persisting in sins and serving vices, it is better for you to be saved alone than to perish with many. For their angels in heaven always see the face of the Father. Great is the dignity of souls, that each one has an angel assigned to guard it from birth. Where we read in the Apocalypse of John: To the angel of the church in Ephesus, Thyatira, and to the angel of Philadelphia, and to the angels of the other four churches, write these things (Apoc. I, 2, 3). The Apostle also instructs women to cover their heads in the churches, because of the angels (I Cor. XI).

<h2 id='tocuniq381'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>

(Verse 12, 13.) What do you think? If someone has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? And if he happens to find it, truly I tell you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. Furthermore, he appeals to compassion, saying: See that you do not despise one of these little ones, and he adds the parable of the ninety-nine sheep left on the mountains and the one that went astray, which the good shepherd, because of its great weakness, could not walk and carried on his shoulders to the rest of the flock. Some think that he, being in the form of God, did not consider robbery to be equal with God; but he emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, becoming obedient to the Father unto death, even death on a cross (Philippians 2:6-8): and for this reason, he descended to the earthly realm to save the one lost sheep, that is, the human race. Others, however, think that the number ninety-nine refers to the righteous sheep; and in the one sheep, the sinner, as he said in another place: I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners: for it is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick (Luke 5:32). This parable is written in the Gospel according to Luke together with two other parables: the parable of the ten drachmas and the parable of the two sons (Luke 15).

<h2 id='tocuniq382'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) Thus it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. He refers to the previous proposition, of which he had said: Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones; and he teaches therefore by means of a parable, that the little ones should not be despised. And in that which he says: It is not the will of your Father that one of these little ones should perish: whenever one of these little ones perishes, it is shown that it is not by the will of the Father.


<h2 id='tocuniq383'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 and following) But if your brother sins against you, go and confront him alone, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others with you, so that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every word may be confirmed. And if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. If our brother sins against us and harms us in any way, we have the power, indeed the requirement, to forgive our debtors just as it is commanded. But if someone sins against God, it is not within our power to judge. For the divine Scripture says: If a man sins against another man, the priest will pray for him. But if someone sins against God, who will pray for him? On the contrary, we are kind in the face of God's injustice and exercise hatred in our insults. However, if a brother needs correction, let him be corrected privately, so that if he has lost his sense of shame and honor, he may not remain in sin. And if indeed he listens, we have gained his soul, and through the salvation of another, our own salvation is also obtained. But if he refuses to listen, let a brother be brought in. And if he does not listen to him, let a third be brought in, either out of a desire to correct or to meet under witnesses. But if he does not want to listen to them either, then he should be spoken to by many, so that they may hold him in contempt, and let him be saved from shame who could not be saved by modesty. However, when it is said, 'Let him be to you as a heathen and a tax collector,' it is shown that he is held in even greater contempt, who carries out the works of unbelievers under the name of the faithful, than those who are openly Gentiles. For publicans, according to metaphor, are those who pursue worldly gains and collect taxes through business dealings and fraud, as well as theft and wicked perjuries.

<h2 id='tocuniq384'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) Truly I tell you: whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. For he had said: But if he does not listen to the Church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector, and this hidden reply could be the contemptuous brother's response, or a tacit thought, if you despise me, I despise you, if you condemn me, you will be condemned by my judgment: he gave the apostles the power to know that those who are condemned by such will have their human judgment confirmed by divine judgment, and whatever is bound on earth will be bound in heaven as well.


<h2 id='tocuniq385'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Verse 19, 20.) Again I say to you: if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them. The above saying has prompted us towards unity. Therefore, a reward is promised, so that we may strive eagerly for peace, since it is said that He will be present among two or three. According to the example of a tyrant, who wanted to prove his two captured friends - when one returned to see his mother and gave his friend as a surety for his return - by holding one, he would release the other. And when he returned on the appointed day, marveling at the faith of both, he asked that they have a third. We can also understand this spiritually, that where the spirit and soul and body agree, and they have not war among themselves of diverse wills (or desires); with the flesh lusting against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, they shall obtain from the Father whatever they ask for. And there is no doubt that the request for good things is when the body wants what the spirit wants.


<h2 id='tocuniq386'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verse 21, 22.) Then Peter came to him and said: Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times? Jesus said to him: I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven. The saying of the Lord stuck in his mind, and it cannot be broken like a triple cord. Above, he had said: See that you do not despise one of these little ones; and he added: If your brother sins against you, go and rebuke him between you and him alone; and he had promised a reward, saying: If two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven; and I will be among them. The Apostle Peter, being provoked, asks how many times he should forgive his brother who sins against him, and when he suggests seven times, Jesus responds: Not seven times, but seventy times seven, meaning four hundred and ninety times, so that he may forgive his sinning brother in a day as many times as he is unable to sin.

<h2 id='tocuniq387'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23.) Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is likened to a human king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. It is common for the Syrians and especially the Palestinians to join parables to every speech: so that what cannot be understood by the listeners through a simple instruction, may be understood through a comparison and examples. So he commanded Peter, using the comparison of a king and master, and servants, who owed ten thousand 143 talents to the master, to ask for forgiveness, and he obtained it; so that he himself would also forgive his fellow servants who had committed lesser sins. That king and lord forgave the servant debtor ten thousand talents so easily, how much more should servants forgive their fellow servants lesser offenses? In order to make it clearer, let us say under this example: If one of us commits adultery, murder, sacrilege, greater crimes of ten thousand talents, they are forgiven when they ask for forgiveness, if they themselves forgive lesser sins. But if, because of an insult, we are unforgiving and, because of a bitter word, we perpetuate discord: do we not seem rightly to be imprisoned? And in the example of our work, should we not act in a way that the pardon for our greater sins is not relaxed?


<h2 id='tocuniq388'>(Vers. 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 24 onwards) And when he began to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. But since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, along with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made. So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.' And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt. But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing him, he began to choke him, saying, 'Pay what you owe.'" } And falling down, his fellow servant begged him, saying: Have patience with me, and I will repay you all. But he would not: but went and threw him into prison, till he paid the debt. Now his fellow servants seeing what was done, were very much grieved, and they came and told their lord all that was done. Then his lord called him: and said to him: You wicked servant, I forgave you all the debt, because you besought me. Did it not behoove you also to have mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you? And his lord being angry, delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all the debt. I know certain ones who owe ten thousand talents, to interpret the devil, whose wife and children they wish to sell, who persist in wickedness, foolishness, and evil thoughts. For just as the wife of the just is called wisdom, so the wife of the unjust and sinner is called folly. But how can the master forgive him ten thousand talents, when he did not forgive us, his fellow servants, a hundred denarii? And it is not in accordance with Ecclesiastical interpretation, nor is it acceptable to wise men.

<h2 id='tocuniq389'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Verse 35) And thus my heavenly Father will do to you, if each one of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts. This is a fearsome sentence, if the sentence of God is turned and changed according to our understanding. If we do not forgive our brothers for small things, great things will not be forgiven to us by God. And because each one can say: I have nothing against him, he himself knows: he has God as judge, I do not care what he wants to do, I have forgiven him; he confirms his sentence, and overturns all pretense of fake peace, saying: If each one of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts.


<h2 id='tocuniq390'>(Chap. XIX.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 19, Verses 1 and following) And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan; and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there. And the Pharisees came unto him, tempting him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? He had come from Galilee to Judea, and therefore the faction of the Pharisees and Scribes questioned him, whether it is lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause, so that they might catch him in a trap with their reasoning, and whatever answer he gives, they can use it against him. If someone were to say that wives should be divorced for any reason and others should be married, he will be seen as preaching against chastity. But if he were to respond that not every cause should lead to divorce, he will be seen as guilty of sacrilege; and he will be judged as going against the teaching of Moses and, through Moses, of God. Therefore, the Lord tempers his response so that their argument is surpassed, bringing forth Holy Scripture as testimony and opposing the natural law, and putting the first sentence of God against the second sentence; which was granted not by the will of God, but by the necessity of sinners.


<h2 id='tocuniq391'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) And he answered and said to them: Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female? This is written in the beginning of Genesis. But in saying male and female, he indicates the necessity of second marriages. For he does not say males and females, which was the subject of the previous divorce question, but male and female, so that the union of one spouse might be established.

<h2 id='tocuniq392'>(Vers. 5, 6.)</h2>

(Vers. 5, 6.) And he said: for this reason a man will leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife: and they will become one flesh. So now they are no longer two, but one flesh. Likewise, he said, they will be joined to their wife, not wives. And they will become one flesh. The reward of marriage is for two to become one flesh. Chastity united with the spirit, the spirit becomes one.

What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate. God has joined them, by making the flesh of man and woman one: this man cannot separate, unless perchance God alone. Man separates, when on account of the desire for a second wife, he dismisses the first. God separates, who also joined together, when by consent on account of the service of God (because the time is narrow) we have wives, as if not having (I Cor. VII).

<h2 id='tocuniq393'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(V. 7) They said to him: So why did Moses command to give a writ of divorce and to dismiss? They laid open the pretext which they had prepared. And certainly the Lord had not put forth His own opinion, but had remembered the history of old and the commandments of God.

<h2 id='tocuniq394'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) He said to them: because Moses allowed you to divorce your wives due to the hardness of your hearts; but from the beginning it was not so. What he is saying is this: Can God be opposed to himself, so that he would command one thing and then change his decision with a new order? It is not to be understood in this way: but when Moses saw that because of the desire for second wives, who were either wealthier, younger, or more attractive, the first wives were being killed or living a bad life, he chose to tolerate discord rather than perpetuate hatred and murder (Deut. XXIV). At the same time, consider that God did not allow it to you because of the hardness of your heart, but Moses, so that, according to the Apostle Paul's advice (I Cor. VII), it might be the counsel of man, not the commandment of God.

<h2 id='tocuniq395'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery. And whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery. Only sexual immorality is what overcomes the affection of a wife: indeed, when she has divided one flesh into another, and has separated herself from her husband by fornication, she ought not to be held bound; lest she also make the man under a curse, with the Scriptures saying: Whoever holds on to an adulteress, he is foolish and wicked. Therefore, wherever there is fornication, or even suspicion of fornication, a wife is freely divorced. And because it could happen that someone accuses an innocent person and falsely attributes an old crime to the second marriage, the first wife is commanded to be divorced so that, while the first wife is still alive, the husband does not have a second wife. For what He says is as follows: If you divorce your wife not because of lust but because of injury, why do you expose yourself to the danger of unhappy previous marriages and enter into new ones? Moreover, because it was possible for the wife to also divorce her husband according to the same law, the same caution is prescribed so that she does not take another husband. And because a prostitute, and one who had once been an adulteress, did not fear disgrace, a similar instruction is given to the husband, that if he marries such a woman, he is to be held guilty of adultery.

<h2 id='tocuniq396'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) His disciples said to him: If such is the case with a man and his wife, it is not expedient to marry. It is a heavy burden for wives, for apart from the cause of fornication, they cannot be divorced. For what if she is drunken, if she is wrathful, if she has bad habits, if she is luxurious, if she is gluttonous, if she is fickle, if she is quarrelsome, if she is abusive, she must be tolerated. We want it, we don't want it, she must be endured. For when we were free, we voluntarily subjected ourselves to servitude. Therefore, seeing the heavy burden of wives, the apostles express the sentiment of their minds and say: if this is the cause, it is not expedient for a man to marry.

<h2 id='tocuniq397'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11) He said to them: Not all can accept this word, but only those to whom it is given. Let no one think that under this word, or fate, or fortune is introduced: these are the virgins to whom it has been given by God, or whom some chance has led to this, but it is given to those who have asked, who have desired, who have worked to receive it. For to everyone who asks, it will be given, and the one who seeks will find, and to the one who knocks, it will be opened (Matthew 7:8 and Luke 11:10)." }


<h2 id='tocuniq398'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) For there are eunuchs who were born so from their mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who were made so by men; and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let him who is able to receive it, receive it. There are three kinds of eunuchs: those who are born of the flesh of their mother, and those who are made by human agency, and those who castrated themselves for the sake of the kingdom of heaven; and those who, though they are capable of being men, become eunuchs for the sake of Christ." } These are promised a reward: however, to those previous ones for whom the necessity of chastity is not a matter of will, nothing at all is owed. We can also say differently. There are eunuchs who are born from their mother's womb, who are of a colder nature and have no desire for pleasure. And there are others who are made by men: whom either philosophers create, or for the sake of idol worship are softened into women: either they simulate chastity due to heretical persuasion, in order to lie about the truth of religion. But none of them attain the kingdom of heaven, except those who have castrated themselves for the sake of Christ. Hence he infers: He who can receive it, let him receive it; in order that each one may consider his own strength, whether he can fulfill the precepts of virginity and chastity. For chastity is alluring in itself, attracting everyone to it. But one's strength must be considered, so that he who can receive it, may receive it. It is as if the voice of the Lord were exhorting, and inciting his soldiers to the reward of chastity. Whoever can understand, let them understand; whoever can fight, let them fight, conquer and triumph.

<h2 id='tocuniq399'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Vers. 13, 14.) Then little children were brought to him, that he might lay his hands on them and pray. But the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said to them, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.'

<h2 id='tocuniq400'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven. And when he had laid his hands on them, he went away from there. He said significantly, to such, not to those: to show that it is not age that rules but character; and to those who have similar innocence and simplicity, a reward is promised. The apostle also agrees with this sentiment: Brothers, do not be children in your thinking, but be infants in evil, and mature in your thinking (I Cor. XIV, 20).


<h2 id='tocuniq401'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16) And behold, one came and said to him: Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life? He said to him. This man who asks how to obtain eternal life is young, wealthy, and proud; and according to another evangelist, he asks not out of a desire to learn, but out of a desire to test (Mark 10).

<h2 id='tocuniq402'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) Why are you asking me about goodness? There is only one good God. Because he had called the teacher good and had not confessed him to be God, or the Son of God, he learns that even though a holy man is not good in comparison to God, of whom it is said: Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good (Ps. CXVII, 1). But lest anyone think that the goodness of the Son of God is excluded in that he is called a good God, we read in another place: The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep (John X). And in the Prophet, a good spirit and a good land. Therefore, the Savior did not reject the testimony of goodness. But he excluded the error of teachers without God.

<h2 id='tocuniq403'>(Vers. 18, 19.)</h2>

(Verse 18, 19.) But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments. He said to Him: Which ones? Jesus said: You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness. Honor your father and mother: and you shall love your neighbor as yourself. This young man is a tempter, and from this we can prove that when the Lord said to him, If you want to enter into life, keep the commandments, he deceitfully asks what those commandments are: as if he himself has not read them, or as if the Lord could command things contrary to God.


<h2 id='tocuniq404'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20.) The young man said to him: All these things I have kept from my youth, what do I still lack? Jesus said to him: The young man is lying. For if he had fulfilled the commandment that is written: You shall love your neighbor as yourself, how then, upon hearing, Go, sell what you have, and give to the poor, did he depart sorrowful, because he had many possessions?

<h2 id='tocuniq405'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. It is in our power to choose whether we want to be perfect. However, whoever wants to be perfect must sell what they have, and not sell just a part, as Ananias and Sapphira did (Acts 5); but sell everything and give it all to the poor, and thus prepare for themselves treasure in the kingdom of heaven. 149 And this is not enough for perfection, unless after despising riches he follows the Savior, that is, having left behind evil, he does good. For it is easier to despise a bag than pleasure. Many, leaving behind riches, do not follow the Lord. But he who imitates Him follows the Lord and walks in His footsteps. For whoever says that he believes in Christ should walk just as He walked (1 John 2:6).


<h2 id='tocuniq406'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) He went away sad, for he had many possessions. This is the sadness that leads to death. And the reason for the sadness is given, that he had many possessions, that is, thorns and thistles, which choked the Lord's seed.

<h2 id='tocuniq407'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) Jesus said to his disciples: Truly I say to you, it is difficult for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven. And how did Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were rich, enter the kingdom of heaven (Genesis 13 and 36), and in the Gospel of Matthew and Zacchaeus, they are proclaimed by the testimony of the Lord, leaving their riches behind? But it should be considered that at the time they entered, they ceased to be rich. Therefore, they will not enter as long as they are rich. And yet because riches are difficult to despise, he did not say: It is impossible for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven, but difficult. Where difficult is placed, not impossibility is suggested; but rarity is demonstrated.

<h2 id='tocuniq408'>(Vers. 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 24 seqq.) And again I say to you: It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. When His disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying: Who then can be saved? But Jesus looked at them and said: With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible. This statement shows that it is not difficult, but impossible. For just as a camel cannot enter through the eye of a needle, so a rich man cannot enter the kingdom of heaven; no rich man will be saved. But if we read Isaiah, how the camels of Midian and Ephah come to Jerusalem with gifts and offerings (Isa. 60): and those who were previously bent and twisted by the corruption of vices enter the gates of Jerusalem, we will see how even these camels, to whom the rich are compared, can enter through the narrow gate and the narrow path that leads to life (Above, 7). But when the disciples questioned and marveled at the severity of his words, He tempered the severity of his sentence with his mercy, saying: What is impossible for men is possible for God.

<h2 id='tocuniq409'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) Then Peter answered and said to Him, 'See, we have left everything and followed You. What then will we have?' Great confidence: Peter was a fisherman, not wealthy, he sought food by hand and skill, and yet he speaks confidently, 'We have left everything.' And because it is not enough to just leave, he adds what is perfect: 'and followed You.' We have done what You commanded, so what reward will You give us?

<h2 id='tocuniq410'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28) But Jesus said to them: Amen I say to you, that you who have followed me, in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the seat of his majesty, you also shall sit on twelve seats, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. He did not say: those who have left everything, for even Crates the philosopher did this, and many others despised riches; but those who have followed me: this belongs specifically to the apostles and believers. In regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his majesty, you also shall sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel: because they believed not when you believed.

<h2 id='tocuniq411'>(Vers. 29, 30.)</h2>

(Verse 29, 30.) And everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and possess eternal life. But many who are first shall be last, and the last shall be first. This passage is consistent with that statement in which the Savior speaks: I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man's enemies will be those of his own household (Matthew 10:34). Therefore, because of the faith of Christ and the preaching of the Gospel, those who have disregarded all affections and the riches and pleasures of the world: these will receive a hundredfold and will possess eternal life. From the occasion of this saying, some introduce a thousand years after the resurrection, saying that then a hundredfold of all the things we have given up will be returned to us, and eternal life will be given: not understanding that if in other matters a worthy promise is made, in the matter of wives an indecency appears; so that he who has forsaken one for the Lord may receive a hundred in the future. Therefore, this is the meaning: Whoever forsakes carnal things for the sake of the Savior will receive spiritual things, which will be appropriate and deserved by comparison, as if a hundred is compared to a small number. Hence, the Apostle says, he who has forsaken only one house and small fields of one province: Having nothing, yet possessing everything (II Cor. VI, 10).

<h2 id='tocuniq412'>(Chap. XX.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 20 — Verses 1 onwards) The kingdom of heaven is like a master of a household who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace, and he said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.' So they went. Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour and did the same. But around the eleventh hour, he went out and found others standing, and he said to them, 'Why are you standing here idle all day?' They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard.' And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last up to the first.' So when those who had come at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius. But when the first came, they thought that they would receive more; and they also received each a denarius. And when they had received it, they grumbled against the householder, saying: These last have worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat? But he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius? Take what belongs to you and go; I choose to give to this last as I give to you.' Are you envious because I am generous?' So the last will be first, and the first last.' For it is written before her: Many will be the first last, and the last first. Not deferring to time, but to faith. And he said to the head of the household to go out early in the morning, to hire workers for his vineyard, and to establish the wage for the work as a denarius. Then, going out around the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace: and to them, he promised what is just, not a denarius. He also did the same at the sixth and ninth hour. But at the eleventh hour, he found others standing idle all day, and he sent them into his vineyard. And when evening came, he instructed his steward to begin paying the last workers first, from the eleventh hour workers to the first hour workers; and all equally, against those who were hired last, he accused the master of unfairness. Not because they received less than what was agreed upon, but because they wanted to receive more than what the mercy of the employer had poured out upon them. It seems to me that the first hour belongs to the workers Samuel, Jeremiah, and John the Baptist, who can say with the Psalmist: From the womb of my mother you are my God (Psalm 22:10). The third hour belongs to those who have begun to serve God from puberty. The sixth hour belongs to those who have taken on the yoke of Christ in mature age. The ninth hour belongs to those who are already declining towards old age. And the eleventh hour belongs to those in their final old age. Yet all of them receive the same reward, although their labor is different. There are those who explain this parable differently. The first hour represents the time from Adam and the other patriarchs until Noah; the third hour represents the time from Noah until Abraham and the giving of circumcision to him; the sixth hour represents the time from Abraham until Moses when the Law was given; the ninth hour represents Moses and the prophets; the eleventh hour represents the apostles and the Gentile people, who are envied by all. Therefore, understanding this, after the eleventh hour has already passed, when it was near sunset and evening, John the Evangelist says: My little children, it is the last hour (1 John 2:13). And at the same time consider, that the injustice of the father of the family, which all equally accuse in the eleventh hour workers, they do not understand in themselves. For if the father of the family is unjust, he is not unjust in one, but in all: because the worker of the third hour did not work as much as the one who was sent to the vineyard from the first hour. Similarly, the worker of the sixth hour worked less than the worker of the third hour; and the worker of the ninth hour, less than the worker of the sixth hour. Therefore, every backward calling envies the nations, and is twisted in the grace of the Gospel. Hence, the Savior concludes the parable: The first will be last, and the last will be first. That is, the Jews will be turned from head to tail, and we will be changed from tail to head.

<h2 id='tocuniq413'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) Friend, I am not harming you. I read in a certain book that this friend who is reprimanded by the head of the household is understood as the first hour worker, the first created being, and those who believed at that time.

Did you not come with me from the denarius? The denarius has the image of the king. So you received the reward which I promised you, that is, my image and likeness. What more do you seek? And it is not so much that you yourself desire to receive more, but rather that you desire that no one else receive anything, as if the merit of the reward is diminished by the companionship of another.

<h2 id='tocuniq414'>(Vers. 14, 15.)</h2>

(Ver. 14, 15.) Take what is yours and go. But I want to give to this last one as well as to you: Or am I not allowed to do what I want? A Jew is not saved by grace, but by works of the law. For whoever does them, will live by them. Hence it is said to him:

<h2 id='tocuniq415'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) Is your eye evil because I am good? So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many are called, but few chosen. This also sounds the parable of Luke, where the elder son envies the younger, and does not want him to be received back when he repents, and accuses the father of injustice. And so that we know that this is the meaning we have said, the title of this parable and its ending agree. So the last shall be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.

<h2 id='tocuniq416'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 17 and following) And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took aside his twelve disciples privately, and said to them: Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and they will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify, and on the third day he will rise again. He had often told this to his disciples, but because there were many disputes among them, they could easily forget what they had heard. He was going to Jerusalem, and he was going to bring the apostles with him, preparing them for the temptation: so that when persecution and the ignominy of the cross come, they will not be scandalized.


<h2 id='tocuniq417'>(Vers. 20, 21.)</h2>

(Verse 20, 21.) Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached him with her sons, worshiping and asking something from him. He said to her: What do you want? She said to him: Declare that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom. From where does the mother of the sons of Zebedee have the expectation of a kingdom, so that when the Lord says: The son of man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death, and they will deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified; and when he announces the disgrace of the passion to the disciples who fear, she asks for the glory of triumphing? This, I believe, was the reason why, after saying all these things, the Lord thought that the woman believed that he would immediately reign after the resurrection; and she desired the fulfillment of what is promised in the second coming to happen in the first, and in her feminine eagerness, she desired his presence, forgetting about the future. But when the Lord asked and she requested, it was not out of ignorance; rather, it was said from his perspective, as the one who was to be scourged and crucified, just like with the woman with the issue of blood: 'Who touched me?' (Luke 8:45). And concerning Lazarus: Where have you placed him (John 11:34)? In the Old Testament as well: Adam, where are you (Genesis 3:9)? And: I will go down and see whether they have done according to the cry that has come up to Me; and if not, I will know (Genesis 18:21). But the mother of the sons of Zebedee asks with a mistaken feminine eagerness and a desire for piety, not knowing what she was asking for. And it is not surprising if this is chided as ignorance; for when it is said about Peter, how he wanted to make three tabernacles, not knowing what he was saying (Mark 9).


<h2 id='tocuniq418'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) But Jesus, answering, said: You do not know what you are asking. The mother requests, and the Lord speaks to the disciples, understanding her prayers to come from the will of her sons.

Can you drink the cup that I am about to drink? They said to him: We can. In the divine Scriptures, we understand the cup to signify suffering, according to the saying: Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me (Matt. XXVI, 39). And in the psalm: What shall I render to the Lord for all the things that He hath rendered to me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord (Ps. CXV, 3 et seqq.); and immediately it is explained what this cup is: Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.


<h2 id='tocuniq419'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) He said to them: 'You will indeed drink my chalice; but to sit on my right or left hand is not mine to give to you, but to those for whom it is prepared by my Father.' It is asked how James and John, the sons of Zebedee, drank the chalice of martyrdom, when Scripture records that only James, an Apostle, was beheaded by Herod (Acts 12), while John ended his life by his own death. But if we read the ecclesiastical histories, in which it is reported that he himself was sent for martyrdom into a vat of boiling oil, and from there went forth as an athlete to receive the crown of Christ, and was immediately banished to the island of Patmos, we will see that his spirit was not lacking in martyrdom, and that John drank the chalice of confession, which the three young men also drank in the fiery furnace (Dan. 3), although the persecutor did not shed their blood. But what he said, 'Sit at my right hand and left hand,' is not for me to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father. It is to be understood in this way: the kingdom of heaven is not for someone who gives, but for someone who receives. For there is no favoritism with God (Acts 10:34). But whoever presents themselves in such a way as to become worthy of the kingdom of heaven, they will receive what is prepared not for their person, but for their life. Therefore, if you are such people who will inherit the kingdom of heaven, which my Father has prepared for the triumphant and victorious, you will also receive it. Others want to say about Moses and Elijah: they were speaking with him on the mountain a little while before, but it does not seem to me in any way. For this reason, the words of those seated in the kingdom of heaven are not mentioned, so that if only a few were named, the others would be considered excluded.

<h2 id='tocuniq420'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24.) And when the ten heard this, they were indignant at the two brothers. The ten apostles were not indignant at the mother of the sons of Zebedee, nor did they attribute her audacity to the brothers; but they attributed it to the fact that, being unaware of their own limits, they were inflamed by excessive desire, to whom the Lord also said: You do not know what you are asking for. It is understood, however, either from the response of the Lord or from the indignation of the apostles, that the sons sent their mother to make great demands.


<h2 id='tocuniq421'>(Vers. 25 seqq.)</h2>

(Verses 25 and following) But Jesus called them to himself and said: You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant. And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave. The humble teacher and gentle, he does not reproach those who seek excessive greed; nor does he rebuke the remaining ten with anger and envy, but he presents such an example to teach that the one who is the least will become the greatest, and the one who serves all will become their master. Therefore, it is in vain that either those people have sought excessive things, or these people grieve over the longing for their ancestors, since the pinnacle of virtues is reached not through power, but through humility. Finally, he presents his own example, so that if his words were considered insignificant, they would be ashamed of their actions, and he says:

<h2 id='tocuniq422'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28.) Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve. Note that we have frequently said that he who serves is called the Son of Man.

And to give his life as redemption for many. When he assumed the form of a servant, in order to shed his blood for the world (Philippians II). He did not say to give his life as redemption for all, but for many, that is, for those who would believe.

<h2 id='tocuniq423'>(Vers. 19 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 19 and following) And as they were leaving Jericho, a great crowd followed him. And behold, two blind men sitting by the roadside, heard that Jesus was passing by, and they cried out, saying: Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David. But the crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent. But they cried out all the more, saying: Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David. There were many robbers in Jericho, who used to attack and harm those who were coming in and going out of Jerusalem: therefore, the Lord came to Jericho with his disciples, to heal the wounded and to gather a large crowd with him." } Finally, after they wanted to leave from Jericho, a large crowd followed him. If he had stayed in Jerusalem and never descended to lowly places, the crowd would still be sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death to this day. However, there were also two blind men beside the road. He calls the blind men those who were not yet able to speak: In your light we will see light (Ps. XXXV, 10). Along the road, they seemed to have knowledge of the Law, but they were ignorant of the way which is Christ: whom most people understand as the Pharisees and Sadducees, and others as both the people of the old Testament and the new: one of them, following the written Law, was blind without Christ, while the other followed natural law. Because they were unable to see by themselves, they heard the proclamations of the Savior, and confessed him as the son of David. But if both blind men are referred to the Jewish people, what follows, "The crowd rebuked them," is to be understood in reference to the Gentiles, whom the Apostle warns not to boast and be arrogant against their own root (Rom. XI); but since they themselves were grafted into the good olive tree from the wild olive tree through the error of the previous people, they should by no means envy the salvation of the previous people. Have mercy on us, O son of David. They are being rebuked by the crowds, and yet they do not remain silent: but rather they repeat the same thing more frequently, so that they may reveal the full desire for true light.

<h2 id='tocuniq424'>(Vers. 32, 33.)</h2>

(Verse 32, 33.) And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, 'What do you want me to do for you?' They said to him, 'Lord, let our eyes be opened.' They were blind, they did not know where to go, and they could not follow the Savior. There were many pits in Jericho, many rocks and cliffs plunging into the depths: therefore the Lord stands, so that they can come and be called, lest the crowds hinder them: and he asks as if not knowing what they want, so that from the response of the blind, their weakness may be made clear, and their power may be known from the remedy.


<h2 id='tocuniq425'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34) But Jesus, having compassion on them, touched their eyes; and immediately they saw, and followed him. He touches their eyes and the artist gives what nature did not give. Or certainly what weakness had taken away, mercy gives. And immediately they saw, and followed him. Those who were sitting before in Jericho, blind and begging, knew only how to cry out. But afterwards they followed Jesus, not so much with their feet as with their virtues.

<h2 id='tocuniq426'>(Chap. XXI.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 21 - Verses 1 onward) And when he drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them: 'Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, The Lord needs them, and he will send them at once.' He went out from Jericho, with a multitude following him, and receiving sight, he drew near to Jerusalem, greatly enriched with merchandise. The health of believers being restored, he desires to enter the city of peace, and the place of God's vision, and the stronghold of the watchtower. And when he was approaching to Jerusalem, and had come to Bethphage, to the house of the jaws (which was a village of the priests, and bore the semblance of confession; and it was situated on the mount of Olives, where the light of knowledge, where the rest of labors and sorrows), he sent two of his disciples, the contemplative and the active, that is, knowledge and labor, to enter the fortress. And he said to them: Go into the fortress that is opposite you. For it was against the apostles, and he did not want to accept the yoke of teachings. And immediately, he said, you will find a tied donkey and its foal with her: untie them and bring them to me. The donkey was bound by many sins. The foal, too, was unruly and impatient with the reins, according to the Gospel of Luke (Chapter 19), it had many owners, not subject to one error and doctrine: and yet many owners who claimed illicit power for themselves, seeing the true Lord and his servants who had come to set them free, did not dare to resist. We will say what a female donkey, and a foal of a donkey, are in the following lines.

<h2 id='tocuniq427'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

(Vers. 4, 5.) However, this happened so that what was said by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: "Tell the daughter of Zion, Look, your king comes to you, meek, sitting on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a pack animal." This is written in the prophet Zechariah: of whom, if there is enough time in life, it will be spoken in its proper place. Now, briefly to be noted, that according to the literal sense, he was not able to sit on both animals in the small distance of the journey. For either the donkey sat, and the foal was without a rider; or if the foal, which is more fitting, it was used for sitting, the donkey was led free. Therefore, when the story has either impossibility or disgrace, we are led to deeper things: so that that donkey which was submissive, and tamed, and had taken on the yoke of the law, may be understood as the Synagogue; the foal of the donkey, wanton and free, may be understood as the people of the Gentiles, whom Jesus sat upon, and sending his two disciples to them, one to the Circumcision, and the other to the Gentiles.


<h2 id='tocuniq428'>(Vers. 6, 7.)</h2>

(Verse 6, 7) However, the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them. They brought the donkey and the colt, and put their clothes on them, and he sat on them. These colt and donkey, on which the apostles spread their clothes for Jesus to sit more comfortably, were naked before the coming of the Savior, and they suffered from those who claimed dominion over them without any covering. But after they received the apostolic garments, they became more beautiful and had the Lord as their rider. Apostolic clothing can be understood as either the teaching of virtues or the exposition of Scriptures, or the various doctrines of the Church: unless the soul is instructed and adorned by these, it does not deserve to have the Lord as its guest.

<h2 id='tocuniq429'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) However, many people spread their clothes on the road. Notice the difference in each person. The apostles put their clothes on the donkey, while the crowd that is less important, lays them on the donkey's feet; so that it does not stumble on a stone, step on a thorn, or fall into a pit.

But others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road. From the fruit-bearing trees, with which the Mount of Olives is planted, they were cutting branches and spreading them on the road in order to make the rough ways smooth and the uneven paths level, so that Christ, the conqueror of demons and vices, could walk more rightly and securely in the hearts of believers.

<h2 id='tocuniq430'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) But the crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed were shouting, 'Hosanna to the Son of David!' 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!' 'Hosanna in the highest heaven!' For the story is clear, let us follow the spiritual order of discourse. The crowds that had come out of Jericho and had followed the Savior and his disciples, when they saw the colt of a donkey untied (which had been tied up before) and adorned with the apostles' robes, and the Lord Jesus sitting on it, they put their garments on the colt and spread branches of trees on the road. And when they had done all things, they also give testimony of the voice: and preceding and following not with a brief and silent confession, but with the fullest shout: Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is He Who comes in the name of the Lord. But what He says: The crowds that went before Him and that followed cried out, shows both the Jewish people who believed before the Gospel and those who believed after the Gospel praising Jesus with the same confession of faith: and according to the example of the parable of the workers in the vineyard, receiving the same reward for their faith. Furthermore, regarding what follows: "Hosanna to the Son of David," I remember having said many years ago in a short letter to Damasus, the bishop of the city of Rome at that time; and now I will explain briefly. In the 117th Psalm, which is clearly written about the coming of the Savior, among other things we also read this: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.' This is the Lord's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it. Immediately follows: O Lord, save me; O Lord, grant success. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord; we bless you from the house of the Lord, etc. (Psalm 118:22 ff). Because it is found in the Septuagint interpreters; ὦ Κύριε, σῶσον δὴ, that is, O Lord, save; in Hebrew we read: Anna Adonai Osianna (), which is more clearly interpreted by Symmachus saying: I beseech you, Lord, save, I beseech. Therefore, no one should think that the phrase is composed of two words, namely Greek and Hebrew, but it is entirely Hebrew and signifies that the coming of Christ is the salvation of the world. Hence it follows: Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. This is also confirmed by the Savior himself in the Gospel: I came in my Father's name, and you did not receive me. Another will come in his own name, and you will receive him (John 5:43). Likewise, it is clearly shown by the joining of 'Hosanna,' that is, salvation in the highest, that the coming of Christ is not only the salvation of humanity, but of the whole world, joining the earthly with the heavenly: that every knee should bow, of those in heaven, on earth, and under the earth (Philippians 2:10).


<h2 id='tocuniq431'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Version 10.) And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, Who is this? And the people said, When Jesus entered with the whole crowd, the city of Jerusalem was stirred up, marveling at the large number of people, not knowing the truth, and saying, Who is this? Which indeed we read elsewhere the angels saying, Who is this king of glory? (Psalm 24:8) But to others, who were either confused or questioning, the common people confess, starting from the least, in order to arrive at the greater, and they say:

163 This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee. The prophet whom Moses had said would come, who is also called The Messiah in Greek. From Nazareth in Galilee, because he was raised there: like a flower of the field, nurtured in the bloom of virtues.

<h2 id='tocuniq432'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>

(Vers. 12, 13.) And Jesus entered into the temple of God and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves. And He said to them: It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves. Jesus, accompanied by a crowd of believers who had spread their garments so that a young colt could walk on them without being harmed, entered the temple and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple. He overturned the tables of the money changers and scattered the seats of those selling doves. And He said to them, quoting from the Holy Scriptures (Isaiah 56) and (Jeremiah 7), that the house of His Father should be a house of prayer, not a den of thieves or a house of commerce, as it is written in another Gospel (John 2). From this it must first be known, that according to the commands of the most august Law, in the whole temple of the Lord, and from almost all the regions of Judea, people were flocking there, countless victims were sacrificed, chiefly on feast days, of bulls, rams, goats; in order that the poor might not be without offerings, those who offered young pigeons and turtledoves: it frequently happened, therefore, that those who had come from afar did not have victims. Accordingly, the priests devised a way to make profit from the people, and they sold all the animals which were needed for the sacrifices, so that they might both sell to those who did not have them, and buy again for themselves. He dissipated this obstacle by the frequent funding of those who were in need, and not only did they not have 164 victims, but they did not even have birds and cheap gifts to buy them. Therefore, they also appointed moneylenders who would lend money under guarantee. But because it was commanded by the Law (Leviticus 25 and Deuteronomy 23) that no interest should be taken, and borrowed money could not be profitable, as it had no advantage and sometimes lost its fortune, they devised another technique: to make collybistas instead of moneylenders, whose term is not expressed in the Latin language. They are called collybae, what we call tragemata, or cheap gifts. For example, roasted chickpeas, dried grapes, and various types of fruits. Therefore, because the collybistae, who were moneylenders, could not collect interest, they received various goods as interest, so that they could demand what was not allowed in money, in those things that are purchased with money. As if Ezekiel himself did not preach this, saying: You shall not take interest and increase (Ezekiel 22:12). Seeing this kind of Lord observing the business or robbery in the Father's house, spurred on by the zeal of the Spirit (according to what is written in Psalm 68:10: The zeal of your house consumes me), he made for himself a whip out of cords, and drove out such a great crowd of people from the temple, saying: It is written: My house shall be called a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves. For he is a thief, and he turns the temple of God into a den of thieves, pursuing profits from religion, and his worship is not so much the worship of God as an opportunity for business. According to history, however, according to mystical understanding, Jesus enters the temple of the Father every day and casts out all, both bishops, and priests, and deacons, as well as laypeople, and the whole crowd from His Church, and He accuses them of the same sin as both sellers and buyers. For it is written: You received without payment; give without payment. He also overturns the tables of the money changers. Observe, because of the greed of the priests, the altars of God are called the tables of money changers. And he overturned the tables of those who were selling doves, who were selling the grace of the Holy Spirit, and they do everything to devour the subject people, of whom it says (As it is said): Those who devour my people like bread (Psalm 14:4). According to simple understanding, doves were not in chairs but in cages, unless perhaps the sellers of the doves were sitting in chairs. But this is completely absurd, because in chairs, the dignity of teachers is indicated, which is reduced to nothing when it is mixed with profits. As for what we have said about the churches, let each one understand it regarding themselves. For the Apostle says: 'You are the temple of God, and the Holy Spirit dwells in you' (1 Corinthians 6:19, 2 Corinthians 3:16). Let there be no dealing in the house of our heart, no buying and selling, no desire for material possessions, so that Jesus may not enter angry and stern, and so that He may not cleanse His temple in any other way than by using a whip, just as He made a house of prayer out of the den of thieves and the house of trade." }


<h2 id='tocuniq433'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. Unless he had overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves, the blind and the lame would not have received their former sight and their restored ability to walk.

<h2 id='tocuniq434'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15) But when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonders He had performed, and the children crying out in the temple, saying, 'Hosanna to the Son of David,' they were indignant and said to Him, 'Do You hear what these children are saying?' Many people believe that the raising of Lazarus (John 11), the blind man receiving sight from birth (John 9), the voice heard at the Jordan saying, 'This is my beloved Son' (John 3), and the transfiguration on the mountain revealing His triumphant glory (Matthew 17) are the greatest signs. Among all the signs that Jesus performed, what seems to be more amazing to me is that one man, and at that time despised and so lowly that he would later be crucified, was able to drive out such a large crowd with the scourge of one whip, overturn tables, break chairs, and do other things that not even an infinite number of armies could have done. For there was something fiery and celestial radiating from his eyes, and the majesty of divinity was shining on his face. And although the priests did not dare to lay hands on him, they still accused him of deceit, and they turned the testimony of the people and children who were shouting, 'Hosanna to the Son of David,' into an accusation; for they knew that this could only be said of the Son of God alone. Therefore, let the bishops and any holy men see with what danger they allow these things to be said of themselves, if the one to whom it was truly said, because the faith of the believers was not yet solid, is being blamed for a crime.


<h2 id='tocuniq435'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16) But Jesus said to them, 'Surely you have never read, "Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise for yourself?"' How moderately he tempers his statement, and his response inclines both ways, and he does not tolerate slander. He did not say what the Scribes desired to hear, that the children are doing good and giving witness to me, nor again, they are wrong: they are children, you should forgive their age. But he presents an example from the eighth psalm, in order to confirm the testimony of the Scriptures through the words of children in the silence of the Lord.


<h2 id='tocuniq436'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) And leaving them, he went out outside the city to Bethany, and stayed there. He left the unbelievers and, leaving the city of contradictors, he went to Bethany, which means the house of obedience, foreshadowing the calling of the gentiles, and stayed there, because he could not remain in Israel. This is also to be understood, that he was of such great poverty, and was not flattered by anyone, so that in the great city he found no guest, no dwelling, but stayed in a small field at Lazarus' and his sisters' house: for their village is Bethany.


<h2 id='tocuniq437'>(Vers. 18, seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 18 and following) But in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry. And seeing a fig tree by the side of the road, he came to it and found nothing on it but leaves only. And he said to it, 'May no fruit ever come from you again!' And immediately the fig tree withered away. And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, 'How did the fig tree wither at once?' Dispersing the darkness of the night, with the morning light shining and nearing midday, in which the Lord was to enlighten the world through his passion, when he returned to the city, he was hungry, either showing the truth of his human flesh or hungering for the salvation of believers and burning with indignation toward the unbelief of the people of Israel. And when he saw one tree (which we understand to be the Synagogue and assembly of the Jews) by the road: for it had the Law, and therefore it was by the road, because it did not believe in the way, he came to it, standing namely and immobile, and not having the feet of the Gospel: and he found nothing in it, except leaves only, the noise of promises, Pharisaic traditions, and the boasting of the Law, and the ornaments of words without any fruits of truth. And another evangelist says, For it was not yet time (Mark 10:13); either because the time of Israel's salvation had not yet come, since the population of the Gentiles had not yet entered, or because the time of faith had passed, because coming to Him first and being rejected, it passed on to the nations. And He said to him, May fruit never be born from you, either in eternity or in this age; for the Greek word αἰὼν (Al. αἰῶνα) signifies both. And the basket was emptied, which had the food that the hungry Lord desired. But just as the leaves withered, so that only the trunk remained, and with the branches broken, the root flourished. If it wishes to believe in the last times, may the faith sprout like branches, and may the Scripture be fulfilled, saying: 'There is hope for a tree.' But according to the literal sense, the Lord, about to suffer among the people and to carry the scandal of the cross, ought to strengthen the minds of the disciples with the anticipation of the sign. And the disciples also marveled, saying: How did it immediately wither? 168 Therefore, by the power of his Savior, he could also dry up his enemies, unless he had awaited their salvation through repentance.

<h2 id='tocuniq438'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verse 21, 22.) But Jesus, answering, said to them: Amen I say to you, if you have faith and do not hesitate, not only will you do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Take up and throw yourself into the sea,' it will be done. And whatever you ask for in prayer, believing, you will receive. Gentile dogs bark against us in their books, which they have left as a memorial of their own impiety, asserting that the apostles did not have faith because they were unable to move mountains. To whom shall we respond that many signs have been done by the Lord, according to the testimony of John the Evangelist, which could not be written down because the world could not contain them (John 21:25). Not that the world could not contain the volumes, which it can, even though they are numerous, in one small box or in one bookshelf, but because the magnitude of the signs could not be borne by miracles and disbelief. Therefore, we believe that the apostles also did these things, but they were not written down so that unbelievers would not have more occasion to contradict. Furthermore, let us ask them whether they believe in these signs which are told in the scriptures or not. And when we see them to be unbelievers, we will consequently prove that those who did not believe in the lesser signs will not believe in the greater ones. This is against them. However, as we have already said, let us understand the proud devil as a mountain, and boasting against his Creator, who is called by the prophet a corrupted mountain. And when he possesses the soul of a man, and is rooted in it, he can be transferred by the apostles and those who are similar to the apostles into the sea, that is, into salty, rough, and bitter places that have no sweetness of God. And in the Psalms it is read: We shall not fear when the earth is troubled, and the mountains are carried into the heart of the sea (Ps. 46:2).

<h2 id='tocuniq439'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23.) And when He had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching, and said, 'By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority?' In different words, they construct the same accusation as before, when they said, 'He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons, Beelzebub.' For when they say, 'By what authority are You doing these things?' they doubt the authority of God, and they want it to be understood that it is the devil who is doing these things. Moreover, they ask, 'Who gave you this authority?' They clearly deny the Son of God, whom they think is not able to perform miracles by his own power, but by the power of others.

<h2 id='tocuniq440'>(Vers. 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 24 and following) But Jesus answered and said to them: I also will ask you one question, which if you tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things. The baptism of John, where was it from: from heaven or from men? And they thought within themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven; he will say to us: Why then did you not believe him? But if we say, From men, we fear the people. For all held John as a prophet. And answering, they said: We do not know. This is what is commonly said: A bad knot of a tree, a bad nail or wedge must be driven in. The Lord could refute the calumny of the tempters with an open response, but He wisely asks, so that they themselves, either by their silence or by their opinion, may be condemned. For if they had answered that the baptism of John is from heaven (as they, wise in evil, have considered), the consequent answer would be: Why then were you not baptized by John? If they wanted to say that it was a human invention and had nothing divine, they feared the revolt of the people. For all the crowds had received John's baptism in groups, and they regarded him as a prophet. Therefore, the most wicked faction responded and used the word of humility, by which they claimed not to know, to lay traps.

<h2 id='tocuniq441'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) He also said to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. They answered Him, therefore: We do not know. He replied then, saying likewise: Neither do I tell you. But Truth cannot lie, and He said: Neither do I tell you. From this, He showed that they knew but did not want to answer, and that He knew and therefore did not speak, because they were silent about what they knew. And immediately He gave a parable, which both condemned their impiousness and taught that the kingdom of God should be transferred to the nations.


<h2 id='tocuniq442'>(Vers. 28 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 28 onwards) 170 What do you think? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said: Son, go work today in my vineyard. And he answering, said: I will not. But afterward, being moved with repentance, he went. And coming to the other, he said in like manner. And he answering, said: I go, sir; and he went not. Which of the two did the will of the father? They say to him: The first. Jesus said to them (Luke 15). There are two sons, who are described in the parable of Luke, the frugal and the prodigal, and of whom the prophet Zacharias speaks: I took two rods for myself, one I called Beauty, and the other I called Cord, and I fed the flock (Zach. XI, 7). First, it is said to the Gentile people through the knowledge of natural law: Go and work in my vineyard: that is, what you do not want done to you, do not do to others (Tob. IV). He proudly replied: I do not want to. Afterwards, in the arrival of the Savior, there was an act of repentance and the working in the vineyard of God, and he corrected the obstinacy of his speech through labor. However, the second son, the people of the Jews, responded to Moses, 'We will do everything that the Lord has said' (Exod. XXIV), but he did not go into the vineyard because he thought he would be the heir after killing the son of the household. Others, however, do not consider it a parable of the Gentiles and the Jews, but simply of sinners and the righteous, with the Lord himself explaining his parable later.


Truly I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him; and even when you saw it, you did not afterward repent and believe him.

<h2 id='tocuniq443'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32) Indeed, John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and prostitutes believed him; and even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him. Therefore, which of the two sons did the will of his father? And they said, The last. It is to be noted that in the true manuscripts, the word 'last' is not present, but rather 'first,' so that they may be condemned by their own judgment. However, if we wish to read 'last,' the interpretation is clear: that we may say the Jews understood the truth, but twisted it and refused to say what they thought, just as they also refused to acknowledge that John's baptism was from heaven.


<h2 id='tocuniq444'>(Vers. 33.)</h2>

(Verse 33) Listen to another parable: A man was a master of a household, who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower, and he leased it to farmers and went on a journey. This is what the Lord illustrated from a proverb: It is hard to kick against the pricks (Acts 9:5). The chief priests and the elders of the people, who questioned the Lord, asked Him, 'By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?' And they desired to grasp wisdom in word, they are overcome by their own craft; and they hear in parables, what they did not deserve to hear with open face. This man, the father of a family, is the one who had two sons; and in another parable, he hired workers in his vineyard; he planted a vineyard, of which Isaiah speaks fully through the Song, bringing it to the end: The vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel (Isaiah 5:7). And in the Psalm: You brought a vine out of Egypt, it says, you cast out the nations, and planted it (Psalm 80:9). And he surrounded her with a hedge, either with walls or with the help of angels: and he dug a winepress, or an altar, or those winepresses, of which three Psalms are designated by title: the eighty-eighth, and the eighty-third. And he built a tower: undoubtedly a temple, of which it is said through Michaeas: And thou, tower of mist, daughter of Zion (Mic. IV, 8). And he placed it among the farmers, whom elsewhere he called the workers of the vineyard: who were hired at the first, third, sixth, ninth, and eleventh hour (Matt. X). And he journeyed abroad: abroad, not by a change of place; for where can God be absent, when all things are filled with Him? And he who says through Jeremiah: I am a God who is near and not far away, says the Lord (Jeremiah 23:23). But he seems to depart from the vineyard, so as to leave the vinedressers free will to work.

<h2 id='tocuniq445'>(Vers. 34 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 34 seqq.) But when the time of the fruits approached, he sent his servants to the farmers to receive his fruits. And the farmers, seizing his servants, some they beat, some they killed, and some they stoned. Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did the same to them. He had given them the Law, and in this he had ordered them to work in his vineyard, so that they would produce the fruit of the Law in their deeds. Afterwards he sent to them servants whom they had seized or killed, like Jeremiah, or killed, like Isaiah, or stoned, like Naboth (3 Kings 21), and Zachariah, whom they killed between the temple and the altar (2 Chronicles 24)." } Let us read the letter of Paul to the Hebrews (Heb. XI); and from it, we will fully learn how much the servants of the Lord have suffered.

<h2 id='tocuniq446'>(Vers. 37, 38.)</h2>

(Verse 37, 38.) But lastly, he sent his son to them, saying: They will respect my son. But the vine-dressers, seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and we shall have his inheritance. In what we read above: Again he sent other servants more than the first, and they did the same to them, the patience of the master of the household is shown, that he sent them more frequently, in order to provoke the wicked tenants to repentance: but they treasured up anger for themselves on the day of anger (Romans 2). Furthermore, that which is joined: They will fear my son, not out of ignorance. For what does the father of the family not know, who in this place is understood as God the Father? But God is always said to be in doubt, so that free will may be reserved for man. Let us question Arius and Eunomius. Look, the father is said to be ignorant, and he tempers his judgment, and as much as is in you, it is proven that he has lied. Whatever they may answer on behalf of the Father, may they understand it to be on behalf of the Son, who says that he does not know the day of consummation.


<h2 id='tocuniq447'>(Vers. 39.)</h2>

(Verse 39.) And they seized him, cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. And the Apostle speaks, that Jesus was crucified outside the gate (Heb. XIII). We can also understand it differently; that he was cast out of the vineyard and killed there: so that when the gentiles received him, the vineyard would be given to others.

<h2 id='tocuniq448'>(Vers. 40, 41.)</h2>

(Verse 40, 41.) So when the Lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-dressers? They said to him: He will destroy those evil ones, and he will give his vineyard to other vine-dressers who will give him the fruit in its proper season. The Lord questioned them not because he did not know what they would respond, but so that by their own response they would be condemned. A vineyard has been leased to us, and it has been leased to us with the condition that we give the Lord the fruit in its proper season, and that we know at each time what we ought to speak or to do.


<h2 id='tocuniq449'>(Vers. 42.)</h2>

(Verse 42.) Jesus said to them: Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This was the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes' (Psalm 118:22, 23). Various parables and different teachings are woven together in this matter. For those whom Jesus had previously called workers, vineyard keepers, and farmers, he now calls builders, that is, masons. Where the Apostle says: You are God's field, God's building (1 Corinthians 3:9). These masons, therefore, just as vine-dressers receive a vine, so have received a stone, which they should place either in the foundations, according to the architect Paul (ibid.), or in the corner, so that it joins together two walls, that is, both peoples (Ephesians 2), who, rejected by them, have become the head cornerstone. And this was done by the Lord, not by human strength, but by the power of God. Peter also confidently speaks about this stone of help: This stone, which was rejected by you builders, has become the cornerstone (1 Peter 2:7). And Isaiah says: Behold, I will lay in Zion a chosen, precious, cornerstone; and whoever believes in Him will not be put to shame (Isaiah 28:16).

<h2 id='tocuniq450'>(Vers. 43.)</h2>

(Verse 43.) Therefore, I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation producing its fruits. I have said many times that the kingdom of God is to be understood in the Holy Scriptures, which the Lord took away from the Jews and handed over to us, so that we may produce its fruits. This is the vineyard that is entrusted to farmers and vine-growers, and those who have not worked in it, only having the name of the Scriptures, will lose the fruits of the vineyard.

<h2 id='tocuniq451'>(Vers. 44.)</h2>

(Verse 44.) And whoever falls on this stone will be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. It is one thing to offend Christ through evil deeds, and another to deny Him. The sinner, even though he believes in Him, falls indeed upon the stone and is broken, but not completely destroyed; he is saved through repentance. But on whomsoever that stone shall fall, that is, on him who the stone itself falls upon, and who completely denies Christ, it will grind him to powder, so that not even a shard will remain in which a little water may be poured.


<h2 id='tocuniq452'>(Vers. 45, 46.)</h2>

(V. 45, 46.) And when the chief priests and Pharisees heard his parables, they understood that he was talking about them. And wanting to arrest him, they feared the crowds, because they considered him a prophet. Although they had hard hearts and were dull in their belief and wickedness toward the Son of God, they could not deny the clear statements, and they knew that all of the Lord's judgments were directed against them. Indeed, they wanted to kill him, but they were afraid of the crowds because they regarded him as a prophet. The crowd is always fickle, not remaining steadfast in their purpose, and like the sway of waves, they are dragged here and there by the force of different winds. Now they revere and honor him as if he were a prophet, but later they cry out against him, saying, 'Crucify him, crucify such a person.' (John 19:6).

<h2 id='tocuniq453'>(Chap. XXII.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

Chapter XXII - Verse 1, 2. Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying: The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son. The Pharisees, understanding that the parables were about them, sought to hold him and kill him. Knowing their intention, the Lord reproached them, undeterred by fear, in order to convict the sinners. This king who prepared a wedding feast for his son is almighty God. He establishes the marriage between our Lord Jesus Christ and the Church, which is gathered from both Jews and Gentiles.

<h2 id='tocuniq454'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) And he sent his servant to call the invited ones to the wedding, but they did not want to come. Without a doubt, Moses, through whom the Law was given to the invited ones. But if we read the servants, as most examples have, it must be referred to the prophets that the invited ones disdained to come through them.

<h2 id='tocuniq455'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

(Verse 4, 5.) Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the wedding. But they paid no attention. The servants who were sent a second time are better understood as prophets than as apostles, though if in the previous verse the word 'servant' is written, the same servants are meant. But if you read 'servants' there, these second servants are to be understood as apostles. The prepared dinner and the killed oxen and fatlings either describe the wealth of the king by metaphor, so that spiritual things are understood from carnal ones, or certainly the greatness of teachings and the doctrine of God's fullest law can be understood.


<h2 id='tocuniq456'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6) And they went away, one to his own village, and another to his business. But the rest seized his servants and, treating them with contempt, killed them. Among those who do not accept the truth of the Gospel, there is much diversity. Those who refused to come, being occupied with other matters, are guilty of a lesser crime than those who, disregarding the affection of the inviter, turned humanity into cruelty and either mistreated or killed the king's servants. In this parable, the silent killing of the groom is depicted: and through the deaths of the servants, the contempt of the wedding is shown.

<h2 id='tocuniq457'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) But when the king heard this, he was angry. This is similar to what was said above: The kingdom of heaven is like a king who invited people to a wedding feast and showed kindness to them. The king is referred to as a man. But now, when it comes to vengeance, the man is silent and only the king is mentioned.

And having sent his armies, he destroyed those murderers and burned their city. The armies, or rather avenging angels, of whom it is written in the Psalms: He sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation, and wrath, and trouble, which he sent by evil angels. (Psalm 77:49); or we may understand the Romans, under the leadership of Vespasian and Titus, who, having killed the people of Judea, burned the rebellious city.

<h2 id='tocuniq458'>(Vers. 8 seqq.)</h2>

Then he said to his servants: The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. Therefore go to the exits of the highways, and whoever you find, invite them to the wedding. And his servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. There were no Gentiles on the highways, but at the exits of the highways. However, it is questioned how some of the bad ones found among those who were outside, and there were some good ones. The Apostle to the Romans discusses this matter more fully (also adding) (Rom. II, 14): that the Gentiles, who naturally do the things that are of the law, condemn the Jews who have not made the written law. Among the Gentiles themselves, there is also infinite diversity; for we know that some are inclined to vices and rush towards evil, while others are devoted to the virtues of a noble character.

<h2 id='tocuniq459'>(Vers. 11, 12.)</h2>

(Verse 11, 12.) However, the king came in to see the guests, and he saw there a man who was not wearing a wedding garment, and he said to him: Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment? But he was silent. Those who had been invited to the wedding feast had filled it from hedges and corners and streets and various places. But afterwards, when the king came in to see the guests at his banquet (that is, those who were resting in his supposed faith, so that on the day of judgment he might visit the guests and judge the merits of each one), he found one who was not dressed in a wedding garment. This one, all those who are associated with wickedness are understood. But the wedding garment, the commands of the Lord, and the works that are accomplished according to the law and the Gospel, make up the clothing of the new man. Therefore, if anyone is found at the time of judgment not having the wedding garment, that is, the clothing of the heavenly man; but rather a polluted garment, that is, the remnants of the old man, he is immediately seized and it is said to him: Friend, how did you come in here? He calls a friend, because he was invited to a wedding: it accuses him of impudence, because he has soiled the wedding festivities with his dirty clothes. But he fell silent. For in that moment there will be no place for repentance, nor the opportunity to deny, since all the angels and the world itself are witnesses of sins.

<h2 id='tocuniq460'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) Then the king said to the servants: Bind his feet and hands, and send him into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The bound hands and feet, the weeping of the eyes, and the gnashing of teeth, signify the truth of resurrection. Or certainly, the hands and feet are bound in order to prevent doing evil and running to shed blood. In the weeping of the eyes and the gnashing of teeth, through the metaphor of bodily members, the severity of the torments is shown.


<h2 id='tocuniq461'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) Many are called, but few are chosen. The short sentence 177 encompasses all the parables: that both in the work of the vineyard, and in the building of the house, and in the wedding banquet, the end is sought after, not the beginning.

<h2 id='tocuniq462'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might trap him in his words. And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, 'Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You defer to no one, for you do not show partiality. Therefore, tell us what you think: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?' But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, 'You hypocrites, why are you testing me? Show me the coin used for tax payment.' So they brought him a denarius. And Jesus said to them, 'Whose image and inscription is this?' They said to him, 'Caesar's.' Then he said to them, 'Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.' When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. Caesar Augustus had appointed Herod, the son of Antipater from Antipatris, as a foreigner and a proselyte, as the king of the Jews, who would be in charge of collecting taxes and would obey the Roman empire. Therefore, the Pharisees send their disciples with the Herodians, that is, with Herod's soldiers, or those whom the Pharisees called Herodians because they paid taxes to the Romans and were not devoted to divine worship. Some Latin speakers ridiculously believe that the Herodians were those who believed that Herod was the Messiah, which we never read anywhere at all.


<h2 id='tocuniq463'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and you teach the way of God in truth, and you are not concerned about anyone's opinion. For you do not show partiality to people. So tell us, what do you think: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? This is a cunning and deceitful question, aiming to trap the speaker into saying something that would make him fear God more than Caesar, and declare that taxes should not be paid, so that immediately the Herodians, who are listening, may accuse him of sedition against the Roman ruler.


<h2 id='tocuniq464'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Ver. 18.) But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said: Why do you test me, hypocrites? The first virtue of the one who responds is to understand the minds of those who ask, and to call not the disciples, but the tempters. Therefore, a hypocrite is called someone who is one thing and pretends to be another, that is, who acts differently in action and in speech.

<h2 id='tocuniq465'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) Show me the coin of the census. And they presented him with a denarius. Wisdom always acts wisely, so that its opponents are refuted mainly by their own words. 'Show me,' he said, 'the denarius, that is, the type of coin that was counted as ten coins and had the image of Caesar.'

<h2 id='tocuniq466'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) 179 And Jesus said to them: Whose image and inscription is this? Those who think that Jesus' question shows ignorance, and not just a way of teaching, should learn from this passage that Jesus certainly could have known whose image was on the coin; but he asks in order to respond appropriately to their conversation.

<h2 id='tocuniq467'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) They said to him: Caesar's. Then he said to them: Render therefore what belongs to Caesar to Caesar; and what belongs to God to God. We cannot consider Augustus as Caesar, but Tiberius is understood to be his stepson, who succeeded him and under whom the Lord suffered. However, all the Roman emperors from the first Caesar, who seized power, have been called Caesars. Furthermore, what he said: Render what belongs to Caesar to Caesar, that is, the tribute money and the currency; and what belongs to God to God, let us offer tithes, first fruits, and sacrifices: just as he himself paid tribute for himself and Peter; and he rendered to God what belongs to God, doing the Father's will." }


<h2 id='tocuniq468'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) And upon hearing, they marveled. Those who should have believed in such wisdom marveled that their cunning for plotting had found no place.

And leaving him, they went away, reporting the infidelity along with the miracle.

<h2 id='tocuniq469'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23.) On that day, the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, approached him. There were two sects among the Jews: the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The Pharisees emphasized the importance of traditions and observances, which they call 'deuterosis,' over righteousness. Therefore, they were divided from the people. However, the Sadducees, who are called 'just,' claimed for themselves what they were not. While the Pharisees believed in the resurrection of both the body and the soul, and confessed angels and the spirit, the Sadducees denied all of these (according to the Acts of the Apostles)." } These are two houses, about which Isaiah clearly teaches that they are stumbling blocks (Isaiah 8).

<h2 id='tocuniq470'>(Vers. 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 24 and following) And they asked him, saying: Master, Moses said: If any man die, having a wife, and leave his wife without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother. Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, died; and not having issue, left his wife to his brother. Likewise the second, and the third, unto the seventh. And last of all the woman also died. Those who did not believe in the resurrection of the body, and thought that the soul perished with the body, rightly invent such a fable, which proves their delusion, asserting the resurrection of the dead. However, it is possible that this may actually happen among their people at some point.

<h2 id='tocuniq471'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28) Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For they all had her. They oppose the absurdity of the story, in order to deny the truth of the resurrection.

<h2 id='tocuniq472'>(Vers. 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29) But Jesus answered and said to them: You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God. Therefore, they are mistaken because they do not know the Scriptures, and because they are ignorant of the Scriptures, they consequently do not know the power of God, that is, Christ, who is the power of God and the wisdom of God (1 Corinthians 1).

<h2 id='tocuniq473'>(Vers. 30.)</h2>

(Verse 30.) For in the resurrection neither do they marry, nor are they given in marriage; but are as the angels of God in heaven. The Latin practice does not correspond to the Greek idiom. For to marry properly refers to women, and to take wives refers to men; but let us understand simply what is said, that to marry is written about men, and to be given in marriage about wives. If in the resurrection they do not marry, nor are given in marriage, then the bodies which can marry and be given in marriage will rise. For no one says about a stone and a tree, and about those things which do not have genital members, that they do not marry, or are not married; but about those things which can marry, nevertheless they do not marry in the same way. But what is brought forth: But they are like the angels of God in heaven. A spiritual conversation is promised." }

<h2 id='tocuniq474'>(Vers. 31 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 31 and following) But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God said to you, saying: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob: God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. And when the crowds heard this, they marveled at his teaching. In order to prove the truth of the resurrection, he could have used many other more obvious examples, one of which is: The dead will be raised, and those in the tombs will rise again (Isaiah 26:19). And in another place: Many who sleep in the dust of the earth will awaken: some to everlasting life, and others to shame and everlasting contempt (Dan. 12:2). Therefore, it is questioned what the Lord meant by preferring this testimony, which seems ambiguous or not sufficiently related to the truth of the resurrection: I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and as if, by saying this, he proved what he wanted, immediately added: He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Those who were also present at this tumult, knowing the mystery, were astonished at his teaching and answers. We have already said about the Sadducees, who denied the existence of angels, spirits, and the resurrection of the body, also proclaiming the destruction of souls. These people only accepted the five books of Moses, rejecting the prophecies of the prophets. Therefore, it was foolish to bring forth testimonies whose authority they did not follow. Moreover, he presents the example of Moses for proving the eternity of souls: 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' (Exodus III, 6). And immediately he infers: 'God is not the God of the dead, but of the living;' so that when he has proven that souls continue after death (for it could not be that he would be their God, who no longer exist), the resurrection of the bodies, which have done good or evil with the souls, would consequently be introduced. Paul the apostle further explores this topic in more detail in the final part of the first Epistle to the Corinthians (I Cor. XV).

<h2 id='tocuniq475'>(Vers. 34 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 34 seqq.) 182 The Pharisees, however, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together.  And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. 'Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?' And he said to him, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' In his two statements, the whole law hangs and the prophets. What we read about Herod and Pontius Pilate, that they made an agreement in the death of the Lord, we also now see about the Pharisees and the Sadducees, who are opposed to each other, but consent with equal minds to test Jesus. Therefore, those who were previously confounded in the display of the coin, and had seen the faction of the opposing party undermined, should have been warned by example not to plot further ambushes: but malice and envy nourish impudence. One of the legal experts asked, not desiring to not know, but attempting, if the one being questioned knew what was being asked, what is the greater commandment: not asking about the commandments, but what is the first and greatest commandment; so that when all that God has commanded is great: whatever he responds, he has the opportunity to accuse, asserting that something else is great among many. Therefore, whoever knows and asks not with the desire to learn, but with the desire to understand, if the one who is going to respond knows, approaches in the likeness of the Pharisees, not as a disciple, but as a tempter.

<h2 id='tocuniq477'>(Vers. 41 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 41 onwards) 183 Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them, saying: What do you think about the Christ, whose son is he? They said to him: David. He said to them: How then does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool? If therefore David calls him Lord, how is he his son? Those who were gathered to test Jesus, attempting to catch him in deceitful questioning, provided an opportunity for their own confutation. And they ask (or, And He is asked) about Christ, whose son He is. The questioning of Jesus is beneficial to us even until today against the Jews. And those who confess that Christ is to come assert that He is a simple man and a holy man from the lineage of David. Let us therefore, being taught by the Lord, question them: if He is a simple man, and only the son of David, how does David call Him his Lord? Not by uncertain error, nor by his own will, but in the Holy Spirit (or, But in the Holy Spirit He is silent). However, the testimony that he has set forth is taken from the 109th Psalm. Therefore, the Lord is called David, not according to what he was born, but according to what he always was born from the Father, surpassing the Father of his own flesh. The Jews fabricate many frivolous things to deceive the truth of the question, asserting that Abraham's native language was Damascus, of which Eliezer was his son. And from the person of Abraham himself, the psalm is written, that after the killing of five kings, the Lord God said to his Lord Abraham, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.' (Gen. XIV) Whom shall we ask? How did God say to Abraham the following: With you is the beginning on the day of your power, in the brightness of the saints, I have begotten you from the womb before the morning star; and: The Lord has sworn and will not repent; you are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek? And let us try to answer how Abraham was born before the morning star, and how he was a priest according to the order of Melchizedek: for whom Melchizedek offered bread and wine, and from whom he received tithes of the spoils.


<h2 id='tocuniq478'>(Vers. 46.)</h2>

(Verse 46.) And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask him any more questions. The Pharisees and Sadducees, seeking an opportunity for slander, and hoping to find some word by which they could trap him, since they had been refuted in their arguments, no longer asked him questions, but handed him over directly to Roman authority. From this we understand that the poison of envy can indeed be overcome, but it is difficult to find peace.


<h2 id='tocuniq479'>(Chap. XXIII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 23, Verses 1 onwards) Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples, saying: The scribes and Pharisees have seated themselves on Moses' chair; therefore, whatever they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds; for they say things and do not do them. How gentle and kind is the Lord? He is tempted by the Pharisees, their traps are broken, and according to the Psalmist: The arrows of the little ones have become their wounds (Psalm 63:8). Nevertheless, due to the dignity of the priesthood and their position, he urges the people to submit to them, considering not their actions but their teachings. But when he says, 'The scribes and Pharisees sit on the chair of Moses', he points out the teaching of the Law by means of the chair. Therefore, we must understand the teaching also in what is said in the Psalm, 'He did not sit on the seat of pestilence' (Ps. 1:1). And: 'He overturned the chairs of those selling doves' (Mt. 21; Mk. 11).

<h2 id='tocuniq480'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) However, they bind heavy and burdensome loads and impose them on people's shoulders; but they themselves are unwilling to move them with their finger. This applies generally to all teachers who command heavy things but do not do the smaller things. However, it should be noted that both shoulders, finger, loads, and chains by which the loads are bound should be understood spiritually.

<h2 id='tocuniq481'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) They do all their deeds to be seen by others. So whenever you do whatever you do, do it to be seen by others, you are a scribe and a Pharisee.

<h2 id='tocuniq482'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6) For they enlarge their phylacteries and make their fringes long. They love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi by others. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves. When the Lord gave the commandments of the Law through Moses, He finally added: Bind them on your hand, and they shall be immovable before your eyes (Deuteronomy 6:8). And the meaning is: Let my commandments be in your hand, so that they may be fulfilled in action; let them be before your eyes, so that you may meditate on them day and night. The Pharisees, misinterpreting this, wrote the Ten Commandments of Moses on parchment, complicating them, and tying them on their foreheads, making it like a crown on their heads, so that they would always be in front of their eyes: which the Indians, Persians, and Babylonians still do today: and anyone who has this is considered religious among the peoples. Moses had also commanded (Num. 15) that fringes of hyacinth color should be made on the four corners of their garments, to distinguish the people of Israel, so that just as circumcision gave a sign of the Jewish people on their bodies, their clothing would also have some difference. Superstitious teachers, seeking public attention and pursuing profits from women, made large tassels and bound very sharp thorns in them, so that, walking and sitting, they would sometimes be pricked, and as if by this reminder, they would be drawn back to the works of the Lord and the duties of His service. Therefore, because the Lord had said, 'They do all their works to be seen by men,' which He accused in general terms, now He divides it into specific parts. Those little pictures of the Ten Commandments were called phylacteries, because whoever had them would have them as a kind of protection and reminder of themselves. The Pharisees did not understand that these things should be carried in the heart, not on the body. Otherwise, even cabinets and chests have books and knowledge of God. Among us, these superstitious women still do these things today, in little Gospels, and on the wood of the cross, and in similar things (which indeed have zeal for God, but not according to knowledge) (Rom. X), straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel (below, in the same book). Such was the fringe, small and short, commanded by the Law, which the woman who was flowing with blood touched in the cloak of the Lord (Luke 8:44): but she is not pierced by the superstitious thorns of the Pharisees; rather, she is healed by his touch. And while they unnecessarily enlarge their phylacteries, and make large fringes, seeking glory from men, they are accused in the rest of why they seek the first places at dinners, and the first seats in synagogues; and in public they follow their appetite and glory: and they are called Rabbi by men, which in the Latin language means teacher. Denique sequitur:

<h2 id='tocuniq483'>(Vers. 8 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 8 onwards) But you are not to be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth your father, for One is your Father, who is in heaven. Nor are you to be called teachers, for One is your Teacher, the Christ. The greatest among you shall be your servant. And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. And do not call anyone on earth your father, for One is your Father, who is in heaven, and there is no other teacher, except God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Father, because all things are from Him. Teacher, because all things are through Him: or because through the dispensation of His flesh, we are all reconciled to God. It is asked why the Apostle, teacher of the gentiles, declared himself to be against this precept (2 Corinthians 5; Colossians 1); or how, with the common language, especially in the monasteries of Palestine and Egypt, they call each other Fathers. This is resolved as follows: Being a father or a teacher by nature is different from being one through indulgence. If we call someone a father, we show honor to their age, not reveal the source of our life. Likewise, a teacher is called from the company of a true teacher. And without going into endless repetition, just as one God by nature and one Son do not prejudice the others from being called gods (or gods) by adoption, and sons, so one both father and teacher do not prejudice others, so that they are called fathers and teachers in an abusive manner.

<h2 id='tocuniq484'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verse 13, 14) But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither go in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation. The scribes and Pharisees have knowledge of the Law and the Prophets, and they know that Christ is the Son of God. They are not ignorant of his birth from a virgin. But while they desire to prey upon the subject people, they themselves do not enter the kingdom of heaven, nor do they allow those who are able to enter. This is what the prophet Hosea accuses: The priests have hidden the way, they have killed Sicimam (Hosea 6:9). And again: The priests have not said, where is the Lord? (Hosea 4). Or certainly every teacher who scandalizes his disciples with evil deeds, shuts the kingdom of heaven before them.

<h2 id='tocuniq485'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. We do not serve with the same intent with which we seek. Scribes and Pharisees, while traversing the whole world for the sake of business or different gains, were eager to make a proselyte from the Gentiles, that is, a stranger and uncircumcised person, to mix with the people of God. But he who before, while he was a pagan, simply wandered, and was once a son of hell, seeing the vices of the magistrates, and understanding to destroy them by his work, which they taught with words, returns to his vomit: and becoming a pagan, as a transgressor, he will be worthy of greater punishment. But the son is called hell, just as the son of perdition, and the son of this age. For each one is called the son of whomever's works he does.


<h2 id='tocuniq486'>(Vers. 16 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 16 and following) Woe to you, blind leaders, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.' Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold? And whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obligated. Blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift? Therefore, whoever swears on the altar, swears on it and on all things that are above it. And whoever swears in the temple, swears in it and in the one who dwells in it. And whoever swears in heaven, swears on the throne of God and on the one who sits upon it. Above, as it seemed to us, we have explained what the tradition of the Pharisees signified, saying: Whatever gift is from me, will benefit you: now the double tradition, drawing towards one opportunity for greed, is condemned, so that they may be accused of doing everything for profit and not for fear of God. For just as in the phylacteries and in the fringes the desire for holiness sought glory, and sought gains through an opportunity for glory, so another invention of tradition accuses the teachers of impiety. If anyone, in a dispute or in some argument, or in a doubtful cause, swore an oath in the temple, and afterwards was convicted of falsehood, he was not considered guilty of the crime. But if he swore on gold and money, which was offered to the priests in the temple, immediately he was compelled to fulfill what he had sworn. Again: If anyone were to swear on the altar, no one held him guilty of perjury; but if he were to perjure himself in a gift, or in oblations, that is, in sacrifices, and in meal offerings, and other things that are offered to God upon the altar, these were most eagerly sought after. Therefore, the Lord accused them both of folly and deceit, because the temple is much greater than the gold which is sanctified by the temple, and the altar is greater than the sacrifices, which are sanctified by the altar. However, they did it not out of fear of God, but out of greed for wealth.

<h2 id='tocuniq487'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23.) Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you tithe mint and dill and cumin, but have neglected the weightier matters of the law, such as justice, mercy, and faith. It was necessary to do these things and not neglect the others. Many precepts are given in the Law that foreshadow future events. But others are clear, as the Psalmist says: The commandment of the Lord is clear, enlightening the eyes (Psalm 19:9), which they immediately desire to follow. For example: You shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness, etc. But the Pharisees, because the Lord had commanded (let us leave aside mystical interpretations for now) that tithes of all things be offered in the temple for the support of the priests and Levites, of whom the Lord was a part, their only concern was to comply with the commanded observances; they disregarded other matters which were more important, whether they should be done or not. And from this chapter, it accuses them of greed because they eagerly demand tithes even on inexpensive vegetables, and they neglect justice in the resolution of business disputes, and compassion for the poor, the orphans, and widows, and faith in God, which are great.

<h2 id='tocuniq488'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) Blind leaders, straining out a gnat but swallowing a camel. I think the camel, according to the meaning of this passage, represents the magnitude of the commandments, judgement, and mercy, and faith. The gnat, on the other hand, represents tithing mint, dill, cumin, and other cheap herbs. We devour and neglect these things that are against God's commandments, which are great, and we show diligence in matters of religion that bring profit but are small.


<h2 id='tocuniq489'>(Vers. 25, 26.)</h2>

(Verse 25, 26.) Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean. In different words but with the same meaning as above, he accuses the Pharisees of hypocrisy and deceit because they present one thing to people outwardly and do another thing at home. Not because their superstition resided in the cup and the dish; but because they displayed outwardly sanctity to men, in their dress, in their speech, in their phylacteries, in the fringes, in the length of their prayers, and such like; while inwardly they were full of the filthiness of vices.

<h2 id='tocuniq490'>(Vers. 27, 28.)</h2>

(Verse 27, 28.) Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you are like whitewashed tombs, which appear beautiful on the outside, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. What he had demonstrated with the cup and platter, that they were clean on the outside, but filthy inside, he now repeats by the example of the tombs: how outside the tombs were adorned with lime, and decorated with marble and gold and various colors, but inside were full of dead men's bones. Similarly, the perverse teachers, who teach one thing and do another, demonstrate cleanliness through the appearance of their clothing and humility of their words, but inside they are full of all uncleanness and desire." } Finally, this expresses more clearly the same thing, saying: Thus you appear righteous to outward people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

<h2 id='tocuniq491'>(Vers. 29 seqq.)</h2>

(V. 29 seqq.) Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous, and you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' Therefore, you testify against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. By a very wise syllogism, they are convicted of being the offspring of murderers, while they, by their opinion of goodness and glory to the people, build tombs for the prophets whom their ancestors killed, and they say, 'If we had lived in that time, we would not have done what our fathers did.' However, even if they do not say it in words, they speak through their actions, in that they ambitiously and magnificently build memorials for the slain, whom they do not deny were murdered by their ancestors.

And you fill up the measure of your fathers. As he had approved of the former words, that they were the sons of murderers, and of those who had killed the prophets, now he concludes what he had intended, and he sets forth, as it were, the last part of the syllogism. And you fill up the measure of your fathers. What was lacking to them, you supply. They killed the servants: you crucify the Lord. They killed the prophets: you kill him who was foretold by the prophets.

<h2 id='tocuniq492'>(Vers. 33.)</h2>

(Verse 33.) Serpents, (It is added also) offspring of vipers, how will you escape the judgment of Gehenna? This very thing John the Baptist had said (Luke III). As therefore from vipers vipers are born: so from murderer fathers, you, he says, are born murderers.

<h2 id='tocuniq493'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes. And some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town. So that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation. At the same time, observe the Apostle writing to the Corinthians (I Cor. VII), that there are various gifts of the disciples of Christ: some are prophets, who preach future events; some are wise, who know when they should speak; some are scribes, most learned in the Law, among whom Stephen was stoned, Paul killed, Peter crucified, and the disciples in the Acts of the Apostles were beaten; and they were persecuted from city to city, expelled from Judea, so that they would migrate to the people of the Gentiles.


<h2 id='tocuniq494'>(Vers. 35, 36.)</h2>

(Verse 35, 36) So that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. Amen I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation. There is no doubt about Abel, that he is the one whom his brother Cain killed. But the righteousness of Abel is not only confirmed by the present judgment of the Lord, but also by the testimony of Genesis (Gen. 4), where the gifts offered by him to God are narrated. We seek to know who this Zacharias, son of Barachiah, is, because we have read about many Zachariases. And so that the opportunity for error is not given to us, it is added: whom you have killed between the temple and the altar. Different things are read in different sources, and I must present the opinions of each individual. Some say that Zacharias, son of Barachiah, is the one who is the eleventh among the twelve prophets, and his father's name agrees with him; but the Scripture does not speak about where he was killed between the temple and the altar, especially since at the time of his death there were hardly any ruins of the temple. Some believe that Zacharias, the father of John, is understood from certain apocryphal dreams, approving that he was killed because he proclaimed the advent of the Savior. Because this does not have authority from the Scriptures, it is easily dismissed as it is proven. Others believe that this Zacharias is the one who was killed by King Joas of Judah between the temple and the altar, as the history of the Kings narrates. But it should be noted that this Zacharias is not the son of Barachias, but the son of Joiada the priest. And the Scripture also records: ‘He did not remember the kindness that Joash’s father Jehoiada had done to him’ (2 Chronicles 24:22). So if we accept the identification of Zechariah and the place of his killing, we ask why he is called the son of Barachiah and not Jehoiada. In our language, Barachiah means ‘blessed by the Lord,’ and Jehoiada is shown to mean ‘the righteousness of the priest’ in Hebrew. In the Gospel used by the Nazarenes, we find it written that he is the son of Jehoiada, not Barachiah (191). The simpler brothers, among the ruins of the temple and altar, or at the exits of the gates that lead to Siloam, pointing to the red stones, think they are polluted with the blood of Zechariah. We do not condemn the error, which arises from hatred of the Jews and devotion to faith. Let us briefly explain why the blood of the just Abel is sought, up to Zechariah son of Barachiah from that generation, when neither of them killed him. The rule of the Scriptures is to present two generations, of the good or the evil, that is, one for each individual. Let us take examples from good things: Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord? or who shall stand in His holy place? (Psalm 24:3) And when he had described several people of different ages who were going to ascend to the mountain of the Lord, he then adds: This is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek the face of the God of Jacob. And in another place concerning all the saints: The generation of the righteous shall be blessed. (Psalm 112:2) But concerning the wicked, as in the present passage: The generation of vipers. And all things shall be required of this generation. And in Ezekiel, when he had described the sins of the land, the prophetic word added: If Noah and Job and Daniel were there, I will not let go of the sins of that land (Ezek. XIV, 14): all the righteous who would be similar in virtues to them are understood to be represented by Noah and Job and Daniel. Therefore, those who have acted similarly to Cain and Joas against the apostles are referred to as being from the same generation.


<h2 id='tocuniq495'>(Vers. 37.)</h2>

(Verse 37.) Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you: how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling! Jerusalem, it is not the stones and buildings of the city that he calls, but the inhabitants, whom he mourns with a father's affection, as we read in another place that he wept when he saw her (Luke 19). And in saying, 'how often I have longed to gather your children together,' he testifies that all the prophets sent by him were rejected. We also read in the song of Deuteronomy the likeness of a hen gathering her chicks under her wings: As an eagle protects its nest, and desires its young, spreading out its wings, receiving them, and carrying them on its feathers (Deut. XXXII, 11).

<h2 id='tocuniq496'>192 (Vers. 38.)</h2>

192 (Version 38.) Behold, your house shall be left desolate. This very thing Jeremiah had already said in the person of Jeremiah: I have forsaken my house, I have left my inheritance: my inheritance is become unto me as a lion's den (Jer. XII, 7, 8). We see with our own eyes the desolate house of the Jews, that temple which shone more brightly: for it lost its inhabitant Christ, and desiring to seize his inheritance, killed the heir.


<h2 id='tocuniq497'>(Vers. 39.)</h2>

(Verse 39.) For I say unto you: you shall not see me henceforth, until you say: Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. He speaks to Jerusalem, and to the people of Judaea. But this verse, in which even infants and sucklings used at the entrance of the Lord's Savior in Jerusalem, when they said: Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, hosanna in the highest, is taken from the 117th psalm, which is clearly written about the coming of the Lord. And what He says, He wants to be understood as this: Unless you do penance (Luke XIII), and confess that I am the one about whom the Prophets have sung, the Son of the Almighty Father, you will not see my face. The Jews have been given a time for penance: let them confess the blessed one who comes in the name of the Lord, and let them gaze upon the face of Christ.

<h2 id='tocuniq498'>(Chap. XXIV.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

Chapter XXIV - Verses 1, 2: And Jesus went out from the temple and was going away. And His disciples came up to point out the buildings of the temple to Him. But He answered and said to them, 'Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, not one stone here will be left upon another, which will not be torn down.' According to the story, the meaning is clear. As the Lord left the temple, all the buildings of the law and the composition of the commandments were destroyed in such a way that nothing can be fulfilled by the Jews. And with the head removed, all the members fight among themselves.


<h2 id='tocuniq499'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(vv. 3, 4.) But while he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying: “Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” And Jesus answered them, saying: “See that no one deceives you.” He sits on the Mount of Olives, where the true light of knowledge was being born, and the disciples secretly approach him, who desired to know the mysteries and revelations of the future, and they ask three things: At what time will Jerusalem be destroyed? When will Christ come? When will the end of the age come?


<h2 id='tocuniq500'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Version 5.) For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will deceive many. One of whom is Simon the Samaritan, whom we read about in the Acts of the Apostles, who claimed to be a great power of God (Acts 8). He also left behind these writings among others in his own volumes, saying: 'I am the word of God, I am beautiful, I am the paraclete, I am omnipotent, I am all things of God.' But even John the Apostle speaks in his epistle: 'You have heard that the Antichrist is coming, now many antichrists have come' (1 John 2:18). I think all heresiarchs are Antichrists and teach under the name of Christ things that are contrary to Christ. It is not surprising if we see some being deceived by them, since the Lord said: And many will be led astray.

<h2 id='tocuniq501'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Ver. 6.) For you are about to hear of battles and opinions about battles; see that you are not troubled. For these things must happen, but the end is not yet. So when we see these things happening, let us not think that the day of judgment is at hand, but that it is reserved for that time, the sign of which is clearly set forth in what follows.

<h2 id='tocuniq502'>(Vers. 7, 8.)</h2>

(Ver. 7, 8.) For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be pestilences and famines, and earthquakes in various places. But all these things are the beginning of sorrows. I do not doubt that these things, indeed, will happen according to the literal meaning of what has been written: but it seems to me that the kingdom against kingdom, and their pestilence, whose speech spreads like cancer (II Tim. II), and the famine of hearing the word of God, and the shaking of the whole earth, and the separation from true faith, are more intelligibly understood among heretics, who, fighting against each other, make victory for the Church." } But what he said: These however are all beginnings of sorrow, is better translated as beginnings of birth pains: so that as if some kind of conception the coming of Antichrist, not birth, may be understood.

<h2 id='tocuniq503'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. The term 'apostle' refers to anyone who believes, not to the specific individuals who were apostles during that time.

<h2 id='tocuniq504'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>

(Verse 12, 13.) And since iniquity will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who perseveres to the end, he will be saved. He did not deny the faith of all, but of many. For many are called, but few are chosen. For in the apostles and their successors, charity will remain, of which it is written: 'Many waters cannot quench love' (Song of Songs 8:7). And even Paul himself: Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? tribulation, or distress, or famine (Rom. 8:35)? and the rest.

<h2 id='tocuniq505'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) And this Gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world, as a testimony to all nations; and then the end will come. The sign of the Lord's coming is the preaching of the Gospel throughout the whole world, so that no one is without excuse; which has either already been fulfilled, or will be fulfilled very soon. For I do not think that any nation remains which does not know the name of Christ. And although they may not have had preachers, they cannot ignore the reputation of the faith from neighboring nations.


<h2 id='tocuniq506'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) So when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Whoever is on the housetop must not come down to take what is in his house. And whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak. But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will be. And if those days had not been shortened, no flesh would be saved; but because of the elect, those days will be shortened. Of this also the apostle speaks (II Thess. II): that the man of sin and the adversary is to be exalted against everything that is called God and is worshipped, so that he dares to stand in the temple of God and show himself as God, whose coming according to the work of Satan destroys them and reduces them to the solitude of God, those who have received him. It can be understood either simply of the Antichrist or of the image of Caesar, which Pilate placed in the temple, or of the equestrian statue of Hadrian, which stood in the very place of the holy of holies until the present day. Abomination, according to the ancient Scripture, is also called an idol; and for this reason, it is added, of desolation; because it is placed in a desolate and destroyed temple.

<h2 id='tocuniq507'>(Vers. 16 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 16 onwards) Then those who are in Judea should flee to the mountains; and those who are on the housetop should not go down to take anything from their house; and those who are in the field should not turn back to get their cloak. The abomination of desolation can be understood as any perverse teaching; when we see it standing in the holy place, that is, in the Church, and proclaiming itself to be God, we must flee from Judea to the mountains, that is, leaving behind worldly desires and Jewish wickedness, and drawing closer to the eternal mountains, from which God wonderfully enlightens us (Psalm 75); and be on the rooftop and in the chamber, where the fiery darts of the devil cannot reach us; not descending to take anything from our former way of life; not looking backwards, but instead sowing in the field of spiritual Scriptures, so that we may reap fruits from it. Neither is it allowed to wear another tunic, which the apostles are prohibited from having. Regarding this place, that is, the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of by the prophet Daniel, Porphyry blasphemed against us in his thirteenth volume of his work, while standing in a holy place, to whom Eusebius of Caesarea, the bishop, responded in three volumes: the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth. Apollinaris (also known as Apollinarius) also wrote extensively on this matter, and attempted, unnecessarily, to discuss it in one chapter, which has been debated over with numerous lines of verse.


<h2 id='tocuniq508'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) But woe to those who are pregnant and nursing in those days. Woe to those souls who have not led their offspring to a perfect man, but have the beginnings of faith, so that they need the nourishment of teachers. This can also be said, that during the persecution of Antichrist, or the Roman captivity, pregnant and nursing women, burdened by the weight of their wombs and children, were unable to make a hasty escape.

<h2 id='tocuniq509'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20.) But pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath. If we desire to escape the captivity of Jerusalem, when it was captured by Titus and Vespasian, they must pray that their flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath; because in winter the severity of the cold prevents them from going into the wilderness and hiding in the mountains and deserts; in the Sabbath, it is either a violation of the Law if they want to flee, or impending death if they remain. But if the end of the world is understood, it commands this, that our faith not grow cold and our love for Christ not diminish, and that we not become lazy in the work of God on the Sabbath of virtues.

<h2 id='tocuniq510'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened. The shortened days, not according to the foolishness of some (who believe that the moments of time can be changed and do not remember that scripture: According to your ordinance, the days remain (Psalm 118:91)), but according to the quality of time we should understand, that is, the days are shortened not in measurement but in number; just as it is said in the blessing: I will fill him with length of days (Psalm 90); so now the shortened days should be understood: so that the faith of the believers is not shaken by the delay of time.


<h2 id='tocuniq511'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) Then if anyone says to you: behold, here is the Christ, or there; do not believe. Many leaders arose during the time of the Jewish captivity who claimed to be the Christ, to the extent that, during the Roman siege, there were three factions inside. But a better understanding of the end of the world is understood.

<h2 id='tocuniq512'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24.) For false Christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. There are three ways, as I have already said, in which this place should be interpreted; either concerning the time of the Roman siege, or concerning the end of the world, or concerning the battle of the heretics against the Church, and such antichrists who, under the guise of false knowledge, fight against Christ.


<h2 id='tocuniq513'>(Vers. 25, 26.)</h2>

(Verses 25, 26.) Therefore, if they say to you, ‘Look, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out; ‘Look, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. If someone promises you that Christ is dwelling in the wilderness of the Gentiles and philosophers, or in the inner rooms of heretics who promise the secrets of God, do not go out, do not believe it; or (because in times of persecution and distress false prophets always find an opportunity to deceive) if someone wants to boast under the name of Christ, do not immediately give your faith.


<h2 id='tocuniq514'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Do not go out, do not believe that the Son of Man is in the desert of the Gentiles or in the secret places of heretics, but that his faith shines from east to west in the Catholic Church. It should also be said that the second coming of the Savior will not be in humility as before, but in glory to be shown. It is foolish therefore to seek him in a small or hidden place, who is the light of the whole world.

<h2 id='tocuniq515'>(Vers. 28.)</h2>

(Verse 28) Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together. From the natural example that we witness daily, we are instructed by the sacrament of Christ. Eagles and vultures are also said to sense corpses across the seas and gather for food of this kind. Therefore, if irrational birds, separated by such large stretches of land and the waves of the sea, sense a small corpse wherever it may lie by natural instinct, how much more should we and the entire multitude of believers hasten to Him, whose lightning comes from the East and shines to the West! But we can understand the body, that is, the πτῶμα, which is more significantly called cadaver in Latin, as the passion of Christ, by which we are provoked; so that wherever it is read in the Scriptures, we may gather together, and through it, we may come to the Word of God, as it is written: They have pierced my hands and my feet (Ps. 22:16) . And in Isaiah: Like a sheep led to the slaughter (Isa. 53:7) ; and similar things to these. But the saints are called eagles, because the youth is renewed like the eagles; and those who are feathered according to Isaiah, and they take up their wings, so that they may come to Christ's passion (Isaiah 46).

<h2 id='tocuniq516'>(Vers. 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29.) But immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. The sun and moon will be darkened, and will not give their light; and the other stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken, not by a diminution of light (otherwise we read that the sun will have sevenfold light), but because in comparison to true light, all things will be dark to the sight. So, if that sun, which now shines throughout the whole world, and the moon, which is the second luminary, and the stars, which are lit as a solace of the night, and all the powers (which we understand to be the multitudes of angels), will be accounted as darkness in the coming of Christ: let the brows of those who, considering themselves holy, do not fear the presence of judgments, be shaken.

<h2 id='tocuniq517'>(Vers. 30.)</h2>

(Verse 30.) And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven. By this sign, we may understand either the Cross, as the Jews saw (according to Zechariah 12 and John 19) the one they fashioned; or the banner of triumphant victory.

And then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with great power and majesty. Those who have not believed in heaven will mourn, but they are written in the earth.

<h2 id='tocuniq518'>(Vers. 31.)</h2>

(Verse 31.) And He will send His angels with a trumpet and a loud voice; and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from the highest heavens to their ends. The Apostle speaks of this trumpet (I Cor. XV; I Thess. IV): and in the Apocalypse of John we read (Apoc. VIII): and in the Old Testament (Num. X), it is commanded that trumpets be made of flexible gold, silver, and bronze, so that they may sound forth the lofty mysteries of doctrine.


<h2 id='tocuniq519'>(Vers. 32, 33.)</h2>

(Verse 32, 33.) But learn a lesson from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. In the same way, when you see all these things, know that it is near, right at the doorstep. Under the example of the tree, he taught about the coming of the end. He said, "Just as when the branches of the fig tree become tender and it puts forth buds and leaves, you understand that summer is coming and the entrance of the west wind and spring: in the same way, when you see all these things that are written, do not think that the end of the world is already here, but rather that certain prologues and forerunners are coming to show that it is near and right at the doorstep.


<h2 id='tocuniq520'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34) Amen, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen. Above, we spoke of the generations of the good, and on the contrary, of the evil as being separate. Therefore, it either signifies all kinds of people, or specifically the Jews.

<h2 id='tocuniq521'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Verse 35.) Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. Heaven and earth will pass away by transformation, not by their destruction: otherwise, how will the sun be darkened, and the moon not give its light, and the stars fall, if the heaven in which these things exist, and the earth, do not exist?

<h2 id='tocuniq522'>(Vers. 36.)</h2>

(Verse 36.) But no one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. In some Latin manuscripts, it is added that not even the Son knows, while in the Greek manuscripts, especially in the copies of Adamantius and Pierius, this is not found written. But because it is read in some manuscripts, it seems worth discussing. Arius and Eunomius rejoice, as if the ignorance of the teacher is the glory of the disciples, and they say: He who knows and he who is ignorant cannot be equal. Against whom these things are to be briefly said: When Jesus has made all times, that is, the Word of God: For all things are made by him, and without him nothing is made (John 1:3), in all times, even the day of judgment: with what consequence can he ignore a part whose whole he knows? This also must be said: What is greater, the knowledge of the Father, or of judgment? If he knows the greater, how does he not know the lesser? We have read the Scripture. All things that belong to the Father have been handed over to me (Luke 10:22). If all things belong to the Father and the Son, how is it that the Son reserved for Himself the knowledge of one day and did not want to share it with the Son? But it must also be inferred: If He does not know the last day of times, He also does not know the nearly last day, and backwards all of them. For it is not possible for one who first does not know to know what comes second. Therefore, since we have proven that the Son does not ignore the day of judgment (God is added by some), a reason must be given why He is said to not know. The apostle writes about the Savior: In whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge (Colossians 2:3). Therefore, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are in Christ, but they are hidden. Why are they hidden? After the resurrection, when questioned by the apostles, he answered more clearly about the day: It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has set by his own authority (Acts 1:7). When he says, 'It is not for you to know,' he shows that he himself knows, but it is not expedient for the apostles to know, so that they may always live uncertain about the coming of the judge, as if every day were the 200th day of judgment." } Finally, the subsequent discourse of the Gospel compels us to understand the same, saying that only the Father knows: in the Father, He includes the Son. For every Father, the name of the Son is.

<h2 id='tocuniq523'>(Vers. 37 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 37 and following) Just as in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For as they were in the days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and they did not know until the flood came and took them all away; so will the coming of the Son of Man be. It is asked how it is written above: For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, and plagues, and earthquakes; and now they should remember those things that are signs of peace. But it is to be considered, according to the Apostle, that after wars, and dissensions, and pestilences, and famines, and earthquakes, and other things by which the human race is devastated, peace will quickly follow, which promises quietness for all, so that the faith of the believers may be confirmed, whether after the evils have occurred, they hope for the judgment to come. For this is what we read in Paul: when they say, peace and security, then sudden destruction will come upon them, like the pain of a woman in labor, and they will not escape (I Thess. V, 3).


<h2 id='tocuniq524'>(Vers. 40, 41.)</h2>

(Verse 40, 41) Then there will be two in the field: one will be taken and one will be left. Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and one will be left. Then, he said, there will be two in the field, when, at the time of the consummation and judgment, two will be found in the field having the same labor and almost the same sowing, but not receiving the fruits of labor equally. Two women will also be grinding together: one will be taken and one will be left." } In the two who dwell in the field, and in the two who grind together, understand either the Synagogue, and (or) the Church, which seem to grind together in the Law, and to grind the flour of the commandments of God from the same Scriptures: or the other heresies, which seem to grind the flour of their teachings from both the Old and New Testaments, or from one of them: and although they have the same Christian name and purpose, they will not receive the same reward: some being chosen and others left behind.


<h2 id='tocuniq525'>(Vers. 42, 43.)</h2>

(Verses 42, 43) Watch therefore, for you do not know at what hour your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into. Clearly He shows why He said above: But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but the Father alone: which it is not expedient for the apostles to know, so that they may always believe Him to be coming in uncertain expectation, whom they do not know when He is coming. And he did not say, 'We do not know at what hour the Lord will come,' but you do not know. And with the example of the father of the family being sent forth, why he keeps silent about the day of the consummation, he teaches more clearly, saying:

Therefore, you also must be ready, for you do not know the hour when the Son of Man is coming. Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them food at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. He further emphasizes and repeats why he did not predict the day and hour of the consummation, neither the angels nor himself, but only the Father, because it is not expedient for the apostles to know; and he inserts an example of the head of a household, that is, his own and the faithful servants, that is, the apostles, to encourage the anxious mind, so that they may provide nourishment of teachings to their fellow servants at the proper time.


<h2 id='tocuniq526'>(Vers. 48, 49.)</h2>

(Vers. 48, 49.) But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; the servant who is anxious and always waiting for the master's coming, gives food to the servants in due time, and afterwards is set over all the goods of the householder: so, on the contrary, he who said according to Ezekiel: This will happen in long times (Ezek. XII, 22), and does not think that the Lord will come quickly; becoming more secure, indulges in feasts and luxury: and he will perceive not a lenient householder, but a most stern judge.


<h2 id='tocuniq527'>(Vers. 50, 51.)</h2>

(Verse 50, 51) The lord will come to his servants on a day they do not expect and at an hour they do not know. And he will divide them and place a portion with the hypocrites. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. This teaches them that when the master is not expected, then he will come, and it admonishes the stewards of vigilance and solicitude. Furthermore, when it says he will divide them, it does not mean he will cut them with a sword, but that he will separate them from the company of the saints and place a portion with the hypocrites, namely with those who were in the field and grinding, and yet were abandoned. We often said that a hypocrite is one thing, and to show something else: just as it seemed to do the same thing in the field and in the mill, which a religious man did, but the outcome of their intentions was different.

<h2 id='tocuniq528'>(Chap. XXV.—Vers. 1 seq.)</h2>

(Chapter 25, verses 1 onwards) Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. The foolish ones, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them. But the wise ones took oil in their vessels along with their lamps. Some people simply interpret this parable, that is, the likeness of the ten virgins, in a straightforward manner: some, according to the Apostle, are virgins both in body and mind; others only preserving the virginity of their bodies, either not performing works similar to their aim, or being reserved for the care of their parents, nevertheless being married in mind (1 Corinthians 7). But it seems to me that a different meaning is being referred to in what is said, and that it pertains not to virginal bodies, but to the whole human race. For just as two women in the field and two women grinding at the mill signify two peoples, Christians and Jews, or saints and sinners, who are seemingly themselves plowing and grinding in the Church, yet they do everything in hypocrisy: so now all ten virgins embrace all people, who seem to believe in God and praise themselves in the Holy Scriptures, whether they be from the church, Jews, or heretics. Therefore, all virgins are called, because they boast in the knowledge of one God, and their minds are not defiled by the crowd of idolatry. Virgins have oil, who are adorned by faith and works. Those who appear to confess the Lord with similar faith do not have oil, but they neglect the works of virtue. We can interpret the five virgins, wise and foolish, as the five senses: some hasten to heavenly things and desire things above; others, gaping at earthly dregs, do not have the remedies of truth to illuminate their hearts. It is spiritually said by sight, hearing, and touch: What we have seen, what we have heard, what we have looked upon with our eyes, and what our hands have touched (1 John 1:1). By taste: Taste and see that the Lord is sweet (Psalm 34:9). By smell: We run after the fragrance of your ointments (Song of Songs 1:3). And: We are the sweet fragrance of Christ (2 Corinthians 2:15).

<h2 id='tocuniq529'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5) But while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. For not a little time passes between the first and second coming of the Lord. They all slumbered, that is, they died: for the death of the saints is called sleep. Afterwards it is said, they slept: because they will be awakened later.

<h2 id='tocuniq530'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) But in the middle of the night, a cry was made, behold the bridegroom is coming, go out to meet him. Suddenly, like in the darkest night, and when everyone is fast asleep, through the cry of angels and the trumpets of preceding powers, the coming of Christ will resound. Let us say something that may be useful to the reader. The tradition of the Jews is that Christ will come in the middle of the night in a similar way to the time of the Egyptians, when the Passover was celebrated, and the destroyer came, and the Lord passed over the dwellings, and the doorposts of our homes were consecrated with the blood of the lamb (Exodus 12). Hence, I believe that the apostolic tradition has persevered, so that on the eve of Easter, it is not allowed to dismiss the people until half of the night, waiting for the coming of Christ. And after that time has passed, with presumed security, everyone celebrates the feast day. From this, the psalmist said: At midnight, I arose to give thanks to you for your righteous judgments (Psalm 119:62).

<h2 id='tocuniq531'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) Then all those maidens arose, and adorned their lamps. All 204 maidens arose, and each adorned their lamps, that is, the senses, in which they received the oil of knowledge, so that they would have the works of virtue, which would shine before the true judge.

<h2 id='tocuniq532'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) But the foolish said to the wise: 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' They who complain that their lamps are going out, show that they shine only in part; and yet they do not have an unfailing light, nor perpetual works. Therefore, if anyone has a virgin soul, and is a lover of purity, they should not be content with mediocre things that quickly fade away and wither when the heat rises; but they should strive for perfect virtues, so that they may have everlasting light.


<h2 id='tocuniq533'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) The wise responded, saying: Lest perhaps it may not be enough for us and for you. They respond to this, not out of greed, but out of fear. For each person will receive a reward according to their works, and the virtues of some cannot lift up the vices of others on the day of judgment. And just as during the Babylonian captivity, Jeremiah could not help the sinners, and it is said to him: Do not pray for this people (Jeremiah 7:16): so fearful will be that day, when each person will be anxious for themselves alone.


Go instead to the sellers and buy for yourselves. This oil is sold, and it is bought at a high price, and it is obtained with difficult labor, which we understand in almsgivings and in all virtues and counsels of the magistrates.

<h2 id='tocuniq534'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) But while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came. They indeed give a wise counsel, that they should not meet the bridegroom without oil for their lamps: but because the time for buying had already passed, and with the coming of the day of judgment, there was no place for repentance, as the Psalmist says: In hell, who shall confess to you? (Psalm 6:6) They are compelled not to commit new works, but to settle the account of past deeds.

And those who were invited entered with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut. After the day of judgment, the opportunity for good works and justice will not be left.

<h2 id='tocuniq535'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) But at last the other virgins also came, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us. The excellent confession indeed in calling upon the Lord, and the same repetition, is an indication of faith. But what profit is there in invoking with words, when you deny him with your actions?

<h2 id='tocuniq536'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) But he answered and said: Amen I say to you, I do not know you. The Lord knows those who are his, and whoever does not know, will not be known (2 Timothy 2:19). The Lord does not know the workers of iniquity: and although they may be virgins, and may boast in both the purity of their bodies and the confession of true faith (1 Corinthians 14:38); yet because they do not have the oil of knowledge, it is enough punishment for them to be unknown by the bridegroom.


<h2 id='tocuniq537'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) Therefore, watch, for you do not know the day nor the hour. I always advise the prudent reader not to acquiesce in superstitious interpretations, and not to consider things that are said by the will of those who invent them, but to consider what is said before, in the middle, and afterwards, and to connect everything that has been written. Therefore, from this it follows: Watch, for you do not know the day nor the hour. This includes everything that was said, that is, about the two people in the field, and the two grinding at the mill, and the master of the house who entrusts his possessions to his servant, and the ten virgins. Therefore, these parables were presented so that, because we all are ignorant of the day of judgment, we may diligently prepare the light of good works, so that, while we are ignorant, the judge may come.


<h2 id='tocuniq538'>(Vers. 14, 15.)</h2>

(Verse 14, 15.) For as a man going into a far country, called his servants, and delivered to them his goods. And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to every one according to his proper ability: and immediately he took his journey. This man, without doubt, is Christ, who after his resurrection, ascending as a conqueror to the Father, called his apostles and delivered to them the doctrine of the Gospel, not giving more to one and less to another based on generosity or stinginess, but according to the abilities of the recipients: just as the Apostle says that he fed those who could not take solid food with milk (1 Cor. 4). Finally, he who had made ten talents from five, and he who had made four from two, received the same joy; not considering the magnitude of profit, but the willingness of effort. In five, two, and one talent, let us understand different gifts that have been given to each person. Or in the first, all senses examined: In the second, intelligence and works: In the third, reason, by which we are separated from animals.


<h2 id='tocuniq539'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16) But the one who had received the five talents went and worked with them, and he gained another five talents. Having received earthly senses, he doubled his knowledge of heavenly things: understanding the Creator through His creation, the incorporeal through the corporeal, the invisible through the visible, the temporary through the eternal.

<h2 id='tocuniq540'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) Likewise, the one who had received two also gained two more. And this person, according to his abilities, doubled whatever he had learned in the Law in the Gospel: whether he understood knowledge and good deeds of present life, or the patterns of future blessedness.

<h2 id='tocuniq541'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) But he who had received one went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. The wicked servant, occupied with earthly works and worldly pleasures, neglected and defiled the commandments of God. Although it is written elsewhere by another evangelist that he bound it in a cloth (Luke 19), that is, he weakened the doctrine of the master of the house by living softly and delicately.

<h2 id='tocuniq542'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Verse 19, 20.) After a long time, the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have made five talents more.' It is a great time between the Ascension of the Savior and his second coming. But if the apostles are to give an account and be resurrected in fear of the judge, what ought we to do?


<h2 id='tocuniq543'>(Vers. 21-23.)</h2>

(Verse 21-23.) His master said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, I have made two talents more.' His master said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. I keep on telling both, as I said before, and he who had made ten talents out of five, and he who had made four out of two, the same speech flatters the same master of the house. And it should be noted that all the things we have at present, however great and numerous they may seem, are small and few compared to future things. 'Enter,' he says, 'into the joy of your master, and receive what no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor has entered into the heart of man' (I Cor. II). But what can be given greater to a faithful servant than to be with the Lord, and to see the joy of his Lord?

<h2 id='tocuniq544'>(Vers. 24, 25.)</h2>

(Verse 24, 25) But he who had received one talent also approached and said: Lord, I know that you are a hard man; you reap where you did not sow, and gather where you did not scatter. And fearing, I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours. Truly, what is written has been fulfilled: 'To excuse excuses in sins' (Psalm 140:4). It happened even to this servant, that to laziness and negligence, the crime of pride also joined. For whoever should straightforwardly confess his inaction and beg the head of the household, on the contrary he accuses falsely and says that he acted wisely, in order that while he seeks the gains of money, he may not even risk his own fate.

<h2 id='tocuniq545'>(Vers. 26-28.)</h2>

(Vers. 26-28.) But his lord answering, said to him: Wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sow not, and gather where I have not strewed. Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received my own with usury. Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents. For to everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away. The lazy person, because he did not want to double the talent, is condemned in the one case for pride, in the other for negligence. 'If,' he says, 'you knew me to be harsh and cruel, and that I pursue other people's things, and there reap where I have not sown, why did not such a thought of fear impress you, so that you would know that I would seek my own more diligently, and give my money, or silver, to the money-changers? For both words mean 'silver' in Greek. 'The words of the Lord are pure words, like silver tested by fire, proved on earth, purified seven times' (Ps. 11:7). Therefore, money and silver is the proclamation of the Gospel, and a divine discourse, which should have been given to money-changers and bankers, that is, to other teachers (which the apostles did, ordaining elders and bishops in each province), or to all believers, who can double the money and return it with interest, so that they may fulfill in practice whatever they have learned in words. However, the talent is taken away and given to the one who made ten talents, so that we may understand that, although in both labors there is an equal joy of the master, that is, of the one who doubled five into ten and of the one who doubled two into four, a greater reward is owed to the one who worked more with the master's money. Where the Apostle says: Honour the presbyters, who are truly presbyters, especially those who labour in the word of God (I Tim. 5:17) . From the fact that the wicked servant dared to say: I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter, we understand that even the good life of the Gentiles and philosophers is acceptable to the Lord, and that those who act justly are different from those who act unjustly, and that those who neglect the written law are condemned in comparison to those who serve the natural law.


<h2 id='tocuniq546'>(Vers. 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29.) For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. Many, even though they may naturally be wise and have sharp intellect, if they are negligent and laziness corrupts the goodness of their nature, compared to someone who may be a little slower but has compensated for what they lacked through hard work and diligence, they lose the goodness of their nature and the reward that had been promised to them is seen passing on to others. It can also be understood this way: to him who truly believes and has good will in the Lord, even if he may lack something in his works as a human, it will be given by the good judge. But he who does not have faith, even the other virtues which he seemingly naturally possessed, will be lost. And elegantly even, it is said, that which he seems to have will be taken away from him. For whatever is without the faith of Christ should not be attributed to him who has wrongly misused it, but to him who has also assigned good to even the servant of nature.


<h2 id='tocuniq547'>(Vers. 30)</h2>

(Verse 30) And throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The Lord is light; whoever is sent out from Him is truly without light. But as for the weeping and gnashing of teeth, we have already explained it above.

<h2 id='tocuniq548'>(Vers. 31 seq.)</h2>

(Vers. 31 seq.) But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will place the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then the king will say to those on his right hand, 'After two days I will celebrate the Passover and be handed over to be crucified and mocked by men; and I will be given vinegar and gall to drink; and in this way, he rightly precedes the glory of the triumphant, so that, following scandals, he may compensate with the reward of his promise.' And it is to be noted that the one who is to be seen in majesty is the Son of Man. And what follows: He shall set the sheep indeed on his right hand, but the goats on the left, understand according to that which you read elsewhere: The heart of the wise is in his right hand, and the heart of the fool is in his left (Eccl. X, 2). And above in this same Gospel: Let not your left hand know what your right hand doeth (Matt. VI, 3). The sheep are commanded to stand on the right hand, that is, the righteous, but the goats, that is, the sinners, on the left, who are always offered for sin in the Law (Exod. XII). And he did not mention the goats, which can have offspring, and when they are shorn they come out of the bath, all with twin offspring, and no sterile one among them (Can. IV); but he mentioned the kids, an amorous and playful animal, always eager for mating.

<h2 id='tocuniq549'>(Vers. 34 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 34 onwards) Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you welcomed me. I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me. Then the righteous will answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? But when did we see you as a guest and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?' And the king will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.'

<h2 id='tocuniq550'>(Vers. 40, 41.)</h2>

(Verse 40, 41.) Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these least brothers of mine, you did it to me. Then He will say to those on His left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.' Then they will answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to you? Then he will answer them, saying: Amen I say to you, as long as you did not do it to one of these least ones, neither did you do it to me. It was a liberating insight for us that Christ, hungry, would be fed in every poor person, thirsty would be given drink, a stranger would be brought into shelter, naked would be clothed, the sick would be visited, and the imprisoned would find solace in speaking with him. But from this that follows: Whatever you did to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me, it does not seem to me that he was speaking generally about the poor, but about those who are poor in spirit, to whom he is reaching out a hand, he had said: These are my brothers and my mother, who do the will of my Father (Mark 3:34-35; Luke 8:21).

<h2 id='tocuniq551'>(Vers. 46.)</h2>

(Verse 46.) And these will go into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. Wise reader, take note that both eternal punishments and perpetual life have no fear of ruin thereafter.

<h2 id='tocuniq552'>(Chap. XXVI.—Vers. 1 seq.)</h2>

(Chapter XXVI.—Verses 1ff) And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples: You know that after two days the Passover will be here, and the Son of Man will be betrayed and crucified. Let those who think that the Savior feared death be ashamed, for out of fear of suffering he said: Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me (Luke 22:42). He knew that he would be betrayed and crucified after two days, yet he does not avoid danger, nor does he flee in fear. He is so courageous that even when others refuse to go, he goes resolutely, as Thomas says: Let us also go, that we may die with him (John 11:16). And desiring to put an end to the carnal festivities, and to restore the truth of Easter by passing over to the shadow, he said: With desire have I desired to eat this pasch with you, before I suffer (Luke 22:15). For even Christ our pasch is sacrificed (1 Corinthians 5:7), if we eat it not in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Moreover, when he says: After two days shall be the pasch (Mark 14:1), let us seek after that which is sacred, leaving aside any simple understanding. After two days of bright light, the true Passover for the world is celebrated, which is called in Hebrew Phase, not from the passion as most believe, but from the crossing over: because the exterminator, seeing the blood, passed through the doors of the Israelites and did not strike them. Or rather, the Lord Himself, providing assistance, walked above His people. Read the book of Exodus (Ch. XI, XII), about which we will discuss more fully if life permits. But our crossing, that is, the Passover, is celebrated in this way: if leaving behind earthly things and Egypt, we hasten towards heavenly things.

<h2 id='tocuniq553'>(Vers. 3 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 3 and following) Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, and they plotted to arrest Jesus by deceit and kill him. But they said, 'Not during the festival, or there may be a riot among the people.' Those who were supposed to prepare the victims for the upcoming Passover, polish the walls of the temple, sweep the floors, clean the vessels, and purify themselves according to the law in order to be worthy of eating the lamb, are gathered together to devise a plan to kill the Lord, not fearing rebellion, as the simple speech shows; but fearing that the people might take matters into their own hands to help him.


<h2 id='tocuniq554'>(Vers. 6)</h2>

(Verse 6) But when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, about to suffer for the whole world and redeem all nations with his blood, he stayed in Bethany, the house of obedience, which was formerly the house of Simon the leper. Not that Simon was still a leper at that time, but he who was formerly a leper had been cleansed by the Savior, with his original name remaining, so that the power of the healer may be evident. For in the catalog of the apostles, with his previous vice and profession, Matthew is called a tax collector, who had certainly ceased to be a tax collector."  } A certain leprous person represents the 212th part of the people, which believed in the Lord and was cured by Him. Simon himself is also said to be obedient, who can be interpreted in another sense as the world, in whose house the Church is cured.

<h2 id='tocuniq555'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(V. 7.) A woman came to him with an alabaster jar of expensive perfume and poured it on his head as he reclined. No one should think that she is the same woman who poured the perfume on his head and on his feet. For she washes with tears, wipes with her hair, and is clearly called a prostitute. But nothing like this is written about her. For the prostitute could not immediately become worthy of the Lord's head. Another evangelist placed the alabaster jar of expensive perfume (which is a type of marble) and placed pure and sincere nard (John 12), in order to demonstrate the faith of the Church and the Gentiles.


<h2 id='tocuniq556'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Verse 8, 9.) But when the disciples saw this, they were indignant and said, 'Why this waste? This could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.' I know that some criticize this passage, questioning why only Judas is mentioned as being upset, when it is clear that all the apostles were ignorant of the symbolic meaning known as 'synecdoche,' where one is used to represent many or many are used to represent one. For even Paul in his Epistle which is written to the Hebrews (although many Latin writers doubt it), when he described the sufferings and merits of the saints, he added: They were stoned, they were tempted, they were sawn asunder, they were slain with the sword (Heb. 11:37), as if the Jews think that only Isaiah the Prophet was sawn asunder. We can also say that the apostles were truly indignant on account of the poor: but Judas on account of his gains. And his muttering is also condemned, for he did not care for the poor, but rather wanted to cater to his own thievery.

<h2 id='tocuniq557'>(Vers. 10, 11.)</h2>

(Ver. 10, 11.) But Jesus, knowing this, said to them: Why do you trouble this woman? For she has done a good work for me. For you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. Another question arises, why did the Lord say to the disciples after the resurrection: Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age; and now he speaks, but you will not always have me. But it seems to me in this place he is speaking of his physical presence, which will not be with them in the same way after the resurrection, as it is now in every gathering and familiarity. The Apostle, mindful of this thing, says: 'So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.' (2 Corinthians 5:16)

<h2 id='tocuniq558'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12) For she has poured this ointment on my body, to prepare me for burial. What you think is a waste of ointment is actually a burial custom. It is not surprising that she has given me the pleasant smell of her faith, since I am going to shed my blood for her.

<h2 id='tocuniq559'>(Vers. 12-14.)</h2>

(Verses 12-14.) Amen I say to you, wherever this Gospel is preached throughout the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her. Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests. In the whole world, not so much this woman as the Church is proclaimed, for having buried the Savior and anointed His head. And take note of future events, that He will suffer and die after two days, and that His Gospel will be celebrated throughout the whole world.


<h2 id='tocuniq560'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) And he said to them, 'What are you willing to give me, and I will hand him over to you?' Unfortunate Judas, he thought he could compensate for the loss he had made by the shedding of the ointment with the price of the teacher. Yet he does not demand a specific amount, so that at least the betrayal might seem profitable, but he put in the power of the buyers the amount they wanted to give, as if it were a cheap slave.

<h2 id='tocuniq561'>214 (Vers. 16.)</h2>

214 (Verse 16.) But they agreed to give him thirty silver coins. And from then on he sought an opportunity to betray him. Joseph, contrary to what many think according to the Septuagint interpreters, was sold for twenty gold coins, but according to the Hebrew Truth, for twenty silver coins; for a servant could not be more valuable than the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq562'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, 'Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?' The first day of Unleavened Bread is on the fourteenth day of the first month, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed. It is also the day when the moon is full and the leaven is removed. Among the disciples who came to Jesus, they were asking, 'Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?' And I suspect that Judas was the betrayer.

<h2 id='tocuniq563'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) And Jesus said: Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him: The Teacher says, My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples. The new Scripture preserves the custom of the old Testament. We often read: He said to him, and in that place and that place; which in Hebrew is called Pheloni Elmoni (), and yet the names of persons and places are not given. And you will find there a man carrying a jar of water. For this reason, these words have been omitted, so that an opportunity for free celebration would be given to all who are going to celebrate Easter.

<h2 id='tocuniq564'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them, and prepared the Passover. In another Gospel it is written (Luke 22) that they found a large upper room furnished and prepared there. But it seems to me that the upper room signifies the spiritual law, which, going out from the constraints of the letter, receives the Savior in a lofty place, as Paul himself says (Philippians 3), that he has considered the things that he once regarded as gain as garbage and filth, in order to prepare a worthy dwelling for the Lord.


<h2 id='tocuniq565'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20.) And when evening came, he reclined at table with the twelve disciples. Judas acts in such a way that suspicion of being a betrayer is removed.

<h2 id='tocuniq566'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) And as they were eating, he said: Amen I say to you, that one of you is about to betray me. He who had predicted the Passion also predicts the betrayer, giving an opportunity for repentance, so that when he understood his thoughts and secret plans were known, he would repent of his deed. And yet he does not specifically point him out, so that he would not be openly accused and become more shameless. He casts the accusation in the plural, so that the guilty one may feel remorse.


<h2 id='tocuniq567'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22) And they were greatly saddened, and one by one they began to say: Is it I, Lord? And certainly the eleven apostles knew that they had not thought anything of the sort against the Lord: but they believed more in the teacher than in themselves, fearing their own weakness, they sadly asked about the sin of which they were not aware of.

<h2 id='tocuniq568'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23.) But He answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. Oh, the wonderful patience of the Lord! First He had said: one of you shall betray me. The traitor persists in evil, he reveals himself more clearly, yet he does not explicitly name himself. With the others saddened and pulling back their hands, and denying food to his own mouth, Judas, with audacity and impudence, by which he was to betray, even puts his hand with the Master into the dish, so as to deceitfully pretend to have a good conscience.


<h2 id='tocuniq569'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24.) Woe, however, to that man by whom the Son of man will be betrayed. Neither at first, nor at second, does he retract his steps from the act of betrayal, but by the patience of the Lord he nourishes his impudence, and he stores up for himself wrath on the day of wrath (Rom. II). Punishment is foretold, so that the announced punishments may correct the one whom shame did not conquer. But what follows:

It would have been good for him if that man had not been born: Not because he is considered to have existed before he was born, because no one can be well off unless he has existed: but it is simply said, it is much better not to exist, than to exist in a bad way.

<h2 id='tocuniq570'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Ver. 25.) But Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said: Is it I, Lord? Lest he should seem to betray himself by keeping silent, he also asks, being pricked by his conscience, who it was that had confidently sent his hand into the dish.

Am I, Rabbi? He said to him: You said it. And he unites a gesture of flattery, or a sign of disbelief. For the others who were not going to betray, they say: Am I, Lord? This one who was going to betray, does not call him Lord, but teacher, as if he had an excuse, if he denied the Lord, at least he would betray the teacher. And he said to him: You said it. The betrayer is refuted with the same response, with which Pilate will answer later.


<h2 id='tocuniq571'>(Vers. 26 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 26 seqq.) And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. After the paschal lamb had been fulfilled in its prefiguration, and he had eaten the flesh of the lamb with his apostles, he takes bread, which strengthens the heart of man, and passes on to the true sacrament of the Passover, so that just as Melchizedek, the high priest of the Most High God, had offered bread and wine in his prefiguration (Gen. XIV), he himself would also represent in truth his own body and blood. In Luke we read about two cups that Jesus offered to the disciples (Luke 22). One in the first month, and the other in the second, so that whoever could not eat the lamb among the holy ones in the first month, let him eat the goat among the penitents in the second month.

<h2 id='tocuniq572'>(Vers. 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29.) But I say to you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. He transitions from worldly things to spiritual things, as the vineyard was transplanted from Egypt to the people of Israel, of whom the Lord speaks through Jeremiah: 'I have planted you as a true vine, but you have turned into a bitter fruit of a foreign vine.' (Jeremiah 2:21) And the prophet Isaiah sings in a song about his beloved, and the entire Scripture testifies in various places. He says, therefore, that he will not drink of this vine, except in the kingdom of his Father. The kingdom of the Father, I think, is the faith of the believers, confirmed also by the Apostle himself: The kingdom of God is among you (Luke 17:21). Therefore, when the Jews receive the kingdom of the Father (pay attention to what he says, the Father, not God), every Father is the name of the Son. When, I say, they believe in God the Father, and the Father brings them to the Son, then the Lord will drink of their wine, and, like Joseph reigning in Egypt, he will be intoxicated with his brothers.


<h2 id='tocuniq573'>(Vers. 30.)</h2>

(Verse 30.) And having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. This is what we read in a certain psalm: All the fat of the earth have eaten and have worshipped (Ps. XXI, 30). According to this example, whoever has been satisfied with the Savior's bread and intoxicated with the cup, can praise the Lord and ascend to the Mount of Olives, where there is refreshment from labors, solace from sorrow, and knowledge of true light.

<h2 id='tocuniq574'>(Vers. 31.)</h2>

(Verse 31.) Then Jesus said to them: All of you will be scandalized in me this night. He predicts that they will suffer, so that, when they have suffered, they will not despair of salvation, but by repenting, they will be freed. And he specifically added, in this night you will be scandalized; for just as those who are drunk are drunk at night: so too, those who suffer scandal endure in the night and in darkness (I Thess. 5). But we declare: The night is passed, and the day has drawn near (Rom. 13:12).


<h2 id='tocuniq575'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32.) For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. But after I have been raised up, I will go ahead of you into Galilee. This is also written in different words in the book of the prophet Zechariah; and (if I am not mistaken) it is said from the perspective of the prophet to God: Strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered (Zech. 13:7). It is also fitting to this meaning in the sixty-eighth psalm, which is entirely sung by the Lord: For those whom you have struck, they have pursued. However, the good shepherd is struck so that he may lay down his life for his sheep, and out of many flocks of errors, one flock is made, and one shepherd (John 10). This testimony is more fully explained in the book, which we have written on the Best Method of Interpretation.

<h2 id='tocuniq576'>(Vers. 33.)</h2>

(V.33) But Peter answering, said to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized. It is not rashness, nor deceit; but the faith of the Apostle Peter, and his burning love for the Lord and Savior, of whom we have spoken above.

<h2 id='tocuniq577'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) Jesus said to him: Truly I say to you, that in this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times. And Peter, with a fervor of faith, promised, and the Savior, as if God, knew the future. And take note that Peter will deny in the night, and deny a third time. But after the rooster crowed, and as the darkness diminished, the approaching light was announced, Peter turned and wept bitterly, washing away the stains of denial with tears of repentance.

<h2 id='tocuniq578'>(Vers. 36.)</h2>

(Verse 36.) Then Jesus came with them to a village called Gethsemane and said to His disciples, 'Sit here while I go over there and pray.' Gethsemane means 'very fertile valley' in which He commanded the disciples to sit for a while and wait for Him to return while the Lord prayed for everyone alone.

<h2 id='tocuniq579'>(Vers. 37.)</h2>

(Verse 37) And taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. What we have said above about passion and pre-passion is also shown in this chapter, that the Lord, in order to prove the truth of assuming human nature, did indeed become sorrowful, but in order to prevent passion from dominating his soul, he began to be sorrowful in advance. For it is one thing to be sorrowful, and another to begin to be sorrowful. However, he was saddened not by the fear of suffering, since he had come for this purpose, to suffer, and he had accused Peter of cowardice. But it was because of the most unfortunate Judas, and the scandal of all the apostles, and the rejection of the Jewish people, and the destruction of miserable Jerusalem. Hence, Jonah was also saddened by the withering of the gourd or the ivy, not wanting his temporary dwelling to perish. But if they interpret the sadness of the soul as not the Savior's compassion for those who will perish, but as the passion of a heretic, let them respond: how do they explain that which is said in the person of God through Ezekiel: And in all these things you saddened me?


<h2 id='tocuniq580'>(Vers. 38.)</h2>

(Verse 38) Then he said to them, 'My soul is sorrowful even to death. Stay here and keep watch with me.' The soul is saddened, not for death itself, but saddened until it is freed from suffering by the apostles' own passion. And when he commanded them to stay here and keep watch with him, he was not prohibiting sleep, the time of which was not approaching danger, but rather prohibiting the sleep of unbelief and the torpor of the mind. Therefore let those who suspect that Jesus took on an irrational soul, say how He could be saddened and know the time of sadness. For although even brute animals mourn, they nevertheless do not know neither the causes nor the time until which they should be saddened.

<h2 id='tocuniq581'>(Vers. 39.)</h2>

(Verse 39) And going on a little, he fell on his face, praying and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will. Having given the apostles the command to endure and keep watch with the Lord, he went a little further and fell on his face, showing the humility of his mind in the form of flesh, and he speaks with endearment: My Father, and he requests that, if possible, the cup of suffering pass from him, of which we have spoken before. But he requests not to suffer out of fear, but out of the mercy for the former people, lest he drink the cup offered by them. Wherefore, he expressly did not say, let this cup pass from me, but let this cup, that is, the cup of the Jewish people, which cannot have the excuse of ignorance, if they kill me, having the Law and the prophets, who prophesy about me daily. However, turning towards himself, what he had scrupulously refused from the perspective of a man, he confirms from the perspective of God and the Son. However, not as I want, but as you. No, he says, let it not be done according to the human affection that I speak; but because of which I descended to your lands by your will.

<h2 id='tocuniq582'>(Vers. 40.)</h2>

(Verse 40) And he came to his disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter: So you could not watch with me one hour? He who had said before: Even if all are scandalized in you, I will never be scandalized, now cannot overcome sleep due to the magnitude of sadness.

<h2 id='tocuniq583'>(Vers. 41.)</h2>

(Verse 41.) Watch and pray, so that you may not enter into temptation. It is impossible for the human soul not to be tempted. Therefore, in the Lord's Prayer, we say: Lead us not into temptation, which we cannot bear. (Matthew 6:13; Luke 11:4). We are not completely rejecting temptation, but rather, praying for the strength to withstand it. Therefore, at present, it does not say: Watch and pray, lest you be tempted; but rather, so that you do not enter into temptation, meaning, so that temptation does not overcome and conquer you, and hold you within its snares." } For example: A martyr, who sheds his blood for the confession of the Lord, is indeed tempted; but he is not bound by the snares of temptations. However, whoever denies, falls into the wounds of temptation.

The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. This is against the reckless, who think that they can achieve whatever they believe. Therefore, as much as we trust in the ardor of the mind, so much do we fear the fragility of the flesh. But nevertheless, according to the Apostle, the works of the flesh are mortified in the spirit (1 Peter 3).

<h2 id='tocuniq584'>(Vers. 42.)</h2>

(Verse 42) Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, saying: My Father, if this chalice cannot pass away, unless I drink it, may your will be done. He prays a second time, that if Nineveh cannot be saved in any other way, unless the gourd withers, may the will of the Father be done, which is not contrary to the will of the Son, as he himself says through the prophet: To do your will, O God, I desired (Ps. 39:9).

<h2 id='tocuniq585'>(Vers. 43, 44.)</h2>

(Verse 43, 44.) And he came again and found them sleeping. For their eyes were heavy. And leaving them, he went away again and prayed for the third time, saying the same words. He alone prays for all, just as he alone suffers for everyone. But the eyes of the apostles grew weak and burdened with imminent denial.

<h2 id='tocuniq586'>(Vers. 45.)</h2>

(Verse 45) Then He came to His disciples and said to them, 'Sleep now, and rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of sinners' (Matthew 26:45 and 2 Corinthians 13). After He had prayed a third time, asking that every word be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses, and having obtained through subsequent repentance that the fear of the apostles would be corrected, He goes confidently towards His persecutors and willingly offers Himself to be killed. And He said to His disciples:

<h2 id='tocuniq587'>(Vers. 46, 47.)</h2>

(Verse 46, 47.) Arise, let us go, behold, the one who will betray me is approaching. While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people. Let us not be found like those who fear and retreat, let us willingly go towards death, so that they may see our confidence and joy in suffering.

<h2 id='tocuniq588'>(Vers. 48.)</h2>

(Verse 48.) But he who betrayed him, gave them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he, hold him fast. Miserable Judas, and yet not pitiable, with the same unfaithfulness with which he betrayed his master and Lord, he believed that the signs, which he saw the Savior performing, were not done by divine power, but by magic arts. And because he had perhaps heard of him being transfigured on the mountain, he feared that he might escape from the hands of the ministers in a similar transformation. Therefore, give a sign, so that they may know that it is him whom you would show with a kiss.

<h2 id='tocuniq589'>(Vers. 49.)</h2>

(Verse 49.) And immediately approaching Jesus, he said: Hail, Rabbi. And he kissed him. Indeed, with shameless and wicked confidence, calling the teacher and kissing him, whom he was betraying. Yet the disciple still has some sense of shame, as he does not hand him over to his persecutors openly, but through the sign of a kiss. This is the sign that God placed on Cain, so that whoever found him would kill him (Genesis IV).

<h2 id='tocuniq590'>(Vers. 50.)</h2>

(Verse 50) And Jesus said to him: Friend, why have you come? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and arrested Him. The word, Friend, is to be understood either as a response, or certainly according to what we read above: Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment (Matt. XXII, 12)?

<h2 id='tocuniq591'>(Vers. 51.)</h2>

(Verse 51) And behold, one of those who were with Jesus, extending his hand, drew out his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. In another gospel it is written that Peter did this, with the same fervor of mind as with everything else. The servant of the high priest is also called Malchus: the ear that was cut off is the right one. It must be briefly said that Malchus, that is, formerly the king of the Jewish people, became a servant of impiety and the greed of the priests. And he has lost his right ear so that he hears all the cheapness of the letter in his left: but the Lord has given the right ear back to those who wanted to believe from the Jews, and has made them a royal and priestly race.

<h2 id='tocuniq592'>(Vers. 52.)</h2>

(Verse 52.) Then Jesus said to him: Put your sword back in its place. For all who draw the sword will die by the sword. And if one does not carry the sword in vain, who is appointed as the avenger of the Lord's wrath against those who do evil: yet whoever takes up the sword will die by the sword. Which sword? The one that is turned into a fiery one before paradise (Genesis 3): and the sword of the spirit, which is described as the armor of God (Ephesians 6).


<h2 id='tocuniq593'>(Vers. 53, 54.)</h2>

(Verse 53, 54.) Do you think that I cannot ask my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way? I do not need the help of twelve apostles, even if they all defended me. I can have twelve legions of angelic armies. One legion among the ancient people was composed of six thousand men. For the sake of brevity, we will not explain the number of troops at this time, but it is enough to say that seventy-two thousand angels, divided into as many nations as there are human languages, would make up twelve legions. The following sentence shows a ready mind to suffer, that the prophets would have sung in vain unless the Lord had truly affirmed their words by his suffering.

<h2 id='tocuniq594'>(Vers. 55.)</h2>

(Verse 55.) In that hour Jesus said to the crowds: Are you coming out with swords and clubs to capture me, as if I were a robber? Every day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. It is foolish, he said, to seek with swords and clubs the one who willingly surrenders himself into your hands, and to search for him as if he were hiding in the darkness and avoiding your eyes, when he teaches daily in the temple. But you gather against me in the darkness because your power is in the darkness.

<h2 id='tocuniq595'>(Vers. 56.)</h2>

(Verse 56) But all this has happened so that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples, leaving him, fled. What are the scriptures of the prophets? They have pierced my hands and my feet (Ps. 22:17); and elsewhere: He was led like a sheep to the slaughter (Isaiah 53:7). And in another place: He was led to death because of the iniquities of my people (Ibid., sec. 70).

<h2 id='tocuniq596'>(Vers. 57.)</h2>

(Verse 57.) And they that held Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. Moses, at God's command, had decreed that the priesthood should descend from father to son, and that the succession of priests should be maintained in the generations (Exodus 29). Josephus reports that Caiaphas bought the high priest's office from Herod for a year only. Therefore, it is not surprising that this wicked high priest judges unjustly.


<h2 id='tocuniq597'>(Vers. 58.)</h2>

(Verse 58.) But Peter followed him from afar to the courtyard of the high priest. He followed from afar, who was going to deny the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq598'>(Vers. 59, 60.)</h2>

(Verse 59, 60.) And going inside, he sat with the officers, to see the end. But the chief priests and the whole council were seeking false testimony against Jesus, that they might put him to death. And they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Either out of love for the disciples, or out of human curiosity, the high priest wanted to know what judgment he should render concerning the Lord: whether he should condemn him to death or release him after flogging. And in this matter there was a difference among the ten apostles and Peter. Those people flee, that one, although far away, still follows the Savior.

<h2 id='tocuniq599'>(Vers. 61.)</h2>

(Verse 61) However, two false witnesses came forward and said, 'He said, 'I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'' How are they false witnesses if they are saying what we read the Lord said? But a false witness is one who does not understand the words in the same sense as they are spoken. For the Lord had spoken about the temple of his body. But even in their own words, they are slandering and by adding or changing a few, they make an unjust accusation. The Savior said, 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.' They responded, 'It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?' But He was speaking of the temple of His body. Therefore, when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.


<h2 id='tocuniq600'>(Vers. 62.)</h2>

(Verse 62.) And the high priest, standing up, said to him: Do you not answer anything to what these witness against you? But Jesus kept silent. The high priest, with a sudden outburst of anger and impatience, not finding a place for calumny, shook the pontiff from his throne, in order to show the madness of his mind through the motion of his body. The more Jesus remained silent in response to unworthy men, false witnesses, and impious priests, the more the pontiff, overcome with rage, challenged him to respond, so that he could find an opportunity to accuse him from any occasion of conversation. Nevertheless, Jesus remained silent. For he knew, as if God, that whatever he responded would be twisted into an accusation.

<h2 id='tocuniq601'>(Vers. 63.)</h2>

(Verse 63) And the high priest said to him: I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God? Why do you adjure, most impious high priest, to accuse or to believe? If to accuse, others argue: condemn the silent one. If to believe, why did you not want to believe the one confessing?

<h2 id='tocuniq602'>(Vers. 64.)</h2>

(Verse 64) Jesus said to him: You have said it. Nevertheless, I say to you: from now on you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the power of God and coming in the clouds of heaven. And a similar response against Pilate and against Caiaphas, so that they may condemn themselves by their own verdict.

<h2 id='tocuniq603'>(Vers. 65, 66.)</h2>

(Vers. 65, 66.) Then the high priest tore his garments, saying: He has blasphemed. What more need do we have for witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. What do you think? And they answered, saying: He is worthy of death. The same fury that had driven him from the priestly throne now incites him to tear his garments. He tore his garments in order to show that the Jews had lost the glory of the priesthood and that the pontiffs held an empty seat. But it is also a Jewish custom, when they hear something blasphemous and seemingly against God, to tear their garments. We read that Paul and Barnabas did this when they were honored with divine worship in Lycaonia. However, Herod, because he did not give honor to God but acquiesced to the excessive favor of the people, was immediately struck by an angel.

<h2 id='tocuniq604'>(Vers. 67.)</h2>

(Verse 67.) Then they spat in his face, and struck him with their fists. Thus was fulfilled what was spoken: I gave my cheeks to those who struck me, and my face I did not hide from disgrace and spitting (Lamentations 3:30).

<h2 id='tocuniq605'>(Vers. 68.)</h2>

(Verse 68) But others struck Him on the face, saying: Prophesy to us, Christ, who is it that struck you? It would have been foolish to respond to those who were beating Him and to prophesy the one who was about to strike Him, when it clearly appeared to be the act of a madman. But just as He did not prophesy this to you, He very clearly predicted that Jerusalem would be surrounded by an army and not one stone would be left upon another in the temple.

<h2 id='tocuniq606'>(Vers. 69.)</h2>

(Verse 69.) But Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. He was sitting outside so that he could see the outcome of the matter. And he did not approach Jesus, so that no suspicion would arise among the officials.

<h2 id='tocuniq607'>(Vers. 72.)</h2>

(Verse 72) And again he denied with an oath, 'I do not know the man.' And after a little while those who stood by came up and said to Peter, 'Surely you are one of them, for your accent betrays you.' Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, 'I do not know the man.' And immediately the rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, 'Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.' And he went out and wept bitterly. For if he did not deny, then the Lord has lied, who said: Truly I say to you, that tonight, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times. See what he says, you will deny me, not a man.

<h2 id='tocuniq608'>(Vers. 73.)</h2>

(Verse 73.) Truly, you are also one of them: for even your speech betrays you. Not that Peter had a different language or was from a foreign nation. For all were Hebrews, both those who accused and those who were accused. But each province and region has its own peculiarities, and it cannot avoid the sound of the native language. Therefore, the people of Ephraim in the Book of Judges (chapter 12) cannot pronounce the word σύνθημα.


<h2 id='tocuniq609'>(Vers. 74, 75.)</h2>

(Verses 74, 75.) Then he began to curse and swear, saying that he did not know the man. And immediately the rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, that he had said: Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times. In another Gospel we read: that after Peter's denial and the rooster's crowing, the Savior looked at Peter and, with his gaze, provoked him to bitter tears. It was not possible for him to remain in the darkness of denial, whom the light of the world had looked upon.


And going out, he wept bitterly. Sitting in the courtyard of Caiaphas, he could not repent. He goes out from the assembly of the wicked, to wash the defiled denials with bitter tears of remorse.

<h2 id='tocuniq610'>(Chap. XXVII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 27 - Verses 1 and following) When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor. Not only to Pilate, but also to Herod he was brought, so that both of them could mock the Lord. And see the eagerness of the priests for evil. They stayed awake all night to commit murder. And they handed him over to Pilate, bound. For they had this custom, that whoever they had sentenced to death, they would hand over bound to the judge.

Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, deeply remorseful, returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and elders, saying: 'I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.' He cast out the weight of his avarice, the magnitude of his impiety. Seeing the Lord condemned to death, Judas returned the price to the priests, as if he had the power to change the sentence of his persecutors. Therefore, although he changed his will, he did not change the outcome of his initial intention. But if he who delivered up the just blood sinned, how much more did the Jews sin, who bought the just blood, and, by offering a price, provoked the disciple to betray his master? Let those who attempt to introduce different natures, and claim that Judas, as a traitor, was of a bad nature and could not have been saved by choice and apostleship, respond as to how a bad nature could have repented.

<h2 id='tocuniq611'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Vers. 5.) But they said: What is that to us? You see. And throwing the silver coins into the temple, he departed: and going away, he hanged himself. It was useless to have repented, by which he could not correct his crime. If a brother sins against a brother in such a way that he is able to correct what he has sinned, it can be forgiven. But if the works persist, repentance is assumed in vain. This is what is said in the psalm about the same most unfortunate Judas: And let his prayer be turned to sin (Psalm 108:7); so that not only could he not correct the crime of betrayal, but he also added to his previous crime the guilt of his own murder." } And this is what the Apostle says in his second letter to the Corinthians: 'So that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow.' (2 Corinthians 2:7)

<h2 id='tocuniq612'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) But the chief priests, taking the silver, said: It is not lawful to put them into the corbona (another spelling: corbona), because it is the price of blood. Truly, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel. For if they do not put money into the corbona, that is, into the treasury and the gifts of God, because it is the price of blood, why is blood itself being shed?

<h2 id='tocuniq613'>(Vers. 7, 8.)</h2>

(Verses 7, 8.) But after consulting, they bought a field from the potter, for the burial of strangers; therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood until this day. They indeed acted with a different intention, so that they would leave a lasting monument to their impiety from the purchase of the field. However, we, who were strangers to the Law and the prophets, have embraced their wicked pursuits for salvation; and we find rest in the price of his blood. But the field is called 'figulus' because our potter is Christ.

<h2 id='tocuniq614'>(Vers. 9, 10.)</h2>

(Vers. 9, 10.) Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, 'And they took the thirty silver coins, the price of Him who was priced, whom they of the children of Israel priced, and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.' This quotation is not found in Jeremiah. However, in Zechariah, who is almost the last of the twelve prophets, a similar passage is quoted (Zech. XI): and although the meaning does not differ much, yet the order and the wording are different. I recently read in a certain Hebrew volume, which a Hebrew from the Nazarene sect offered to me, an apocryphal book of Jeremiah, in which I found the following written word for word. However, it seems to me more like a reference to Zechariah: in the manner commonly used by the Evangelists and Apostles, who, without adhering to the exact order of words, present only the meaning from the Old Testament as an example.

<h2 id='tocuniq615'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11) But Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked Him, saying: Are You the King of the Jews? When Pilate asked nothing else of Him, except whether He is the King of the Jews, the Jews are accused of impiety, because they were not even able to falsely find something to accuse the Savior of.

Jesus said to him: You say so. Thus he answered in order to speak the truth and not reveal the accusation. And note that although Pilate, who was unwilling to pronounce judgment, answered in part: He did not want to respond to the priests and leaders, deeming them unworthy of his words.

<h2 id='tocuniq616'>(Vers. 13 seqq.)</h2>

(Ver. 13 seqq.) Then Pilate said to him: Do you not hear how many testimonies they bring against you? And he did not respond to him with a word, so that the governor marveled greatly. Now at the feast, the governor was accustomed to releasing one prisoner to the crowd, whomever they desired. It is a Gentile who accuses Jesus, but he refers the matter to the Jewish people. Do you not hear how many testimonies they bring against you? But Jesus, on the other hand, did not want to respond at all, so that the accusation would not be cleared by the governor and the benefit of the cross would be delayed.

<h2 id='tocuniq617'>(Vers. 16 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 16 onwards) At that time, they had a notable prisoner named Barrabbas. So when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them: Whom do you want me to release to you, Barrabbas or Jesus who is called Christ? For he knew that they had handed Him over because of envy. Now in the Gospel that is written according to the Hebrews, the son of their teacher is interpreted, who had been condemned for sedition and murder. But Pilate offered them the option to release whomever they wanted, either a robber or Jesus; not hesitating, he chose Jesus, knowing that He had been handed over because of envy. Therefore, the clear cause of the cross is envy.

<h2 id='tocuniq618'>(Vers. 19 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 19 and following) But while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. And the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people that they should ask Barabbas and destroy Jesus. But the governor answering, said to them: Whether will you of the two to be released unto you? But they said: Barabbas. Note that often to the Gentiles dreams are revealed by God; and that the testimony of the people regarding Pilate and his wife confessing the just Lord is noteworthy." }


<h2 id='tocuniq619'>(Vers. 22, 23.)</h2>

(Verse 22, 23.) Pilate said to them: What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ? They all said: Crucify him. The governor said to them: For what evil has he done? But they shouted even more, saying: Crucify him. Pilate gave many opportunities to release the Savior. First, he compared him to a just thief. Then he asked: What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ? That is, your king. And when they answered, Crucify him, he did not immediately agree; but according to the suggestion of his wife, who had said: Have thou nothing to do with that just man, he also answered: For what evil has he done? By saying this, Pilate acquitted Jesus. But they shouted even more, saying: Crucify him. So that what was said in the twenty-first psalm would be fulfilled: Many dogs have surrounded me, and a band of evildoers has encircled me (Psalm 22:12). And also what Jeremiah said: My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest; they have raised their voice against me (Jeremiah 12:8). And likewise Isaiah in this fitting statement: I waited for them to bring justice, but they did evil instead of righteousness, and made an outcry (Isaiah 5:7).


<h2 id='tocuniq620'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) But seeing that Pilate was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was occurring, he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just person: you shall see. Pilate took water, according to that prophecy: I will wash my hands amongst the innocent (Ps. 25:6); so that by the washing of his hands the works of the Gentiles would be cleansed, and he would make us strangers to the impiety of the Jews, who shouted, crucify him, in a way testifying to this and saying: Indeed, I wanted to set the innocent free; but since sedition arises and a charge of treason against Caesar is brought against me: I am innocent of the blood of this just person. The judge who is forced to pass sentence against Christ does not condemn the accused; but he reproaches those who offer him, pronouncing that he who is to be crucified is just. 'You,' he says, 'will see. I am the servant of the law: your voice spills blood.'

<h2 id='tocuniq621'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) And all the people answered, saying: His blood be upon us and upon our children. This curse persists against the Jews even to this day, and the blood of the Lord is not removed from them. Hence, through Isaiah it is spoken: If you stretch out your hands to me, I will not hear you. For your hands are full of blood (Isaiah 1:15). The Jews leave the best inheritance to their children, saying: His blood be upon us and upon our children.


<h2 id='tocuniq622'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26) Then he released Barabbas to them, but he had Jesus flogged and handed him over to be crucified. Barabbas, a robber who incited riots in the crowds and was a murderer, was released to the Jewish people, that is, the devil, who still reigns in them today, and therefore they cannot have peace. Jesus, on the other hand, being handed over by the Jews, is acquitted by Pilate's wife, and is called just by the governor himself. And the centurion confesses that he truly is the Son of God. Inquire, learned reader, how it was fitting for Pilate to wash his hands and say: I am innocent of the blood of this just person, and afterwards to deliver Jesus to be crucified, having been scourged? But it is to be known that he served the Roman laws by which it was sanctioned that one who is to be crucified should first be beaten with scourges. Therefore, Jesus was handed over to be beaten by the soldiers, and they cut those most sacred limbs, the chest capable of containing God, with scourges. But this was done so that, because it was written: 'Many are the scourges of sinners' (Psalm 31:10), by that scourging, we might be freed from scourges, with Scripture saying to the just man: 'The scourge will not come near your dwelling' (Psalm 90:10).

<h2 id='tocuniq623'>(Vers. 27 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 27 onwards) Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around Him. They stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him. And they twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and put a reed in His right hand. And they knelt down before Him and mocked Him, saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!' The soldiers, because He had been called the King of the Jews, and the scribes and the priests accused Him of claiming to be the ruler of Israel, mocked Him in this way, to degrade Him from His former garments and dress Him in a scarlet robe as a mock royal garment, which ancient kings used. And they placed a crown of thorns on His head instead of a crown, and gave Him a reed as a scepter, and mocked Him as if He were a king. But we understand all these things mystically. For just as Caiaphas said: It is necessary for one man to die for the sake of all (John 11:50), not knowing what he was saying, so also, whatever they did, even though they may have had other intentions, they nevertheless bestowed sacraments upon us who believe. In the scarlet cloak, he sustains the bloody works of the nations; in the crown of thorns, he unravels the ancient curse; in the pen, he kills venomous creatures. Whether he held a pen in his hand to write sacrilege against the Jews.


<h2 id='tocuniq624'>(Vers. 30.)</h2>

(Verse 30) And spitting on him, they took a reed and struck his head. At that moment it was fulfilled; I did not turn my face away from the shame of spitting (Isaiah 50:6), and yet even when they strike his head with a reed, he patiently endures all, in order to fulfill the true prophecy of Isaiah, which says: He will not break a bruised reed (Isaiah 42:3).

<h2 id='tocuniq625'>(Vers. 31.)</h2>

(Verse 31) And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him. When Jesus is whipped, spat upon, and mocked, he does not have his own clothes, but those which he had taken on for our sins. But when he is crucified, and the show of illusion and mockery has passed, then he receives back his original clothes and puts on his own attire; and immediately the elements are disturbed, and the creature gives witness to the Creator.


<h2 id='tocuniq626'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32.) But as they were going out, they found a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry his cross. Lest anyone think that this account is contrary to that of John the Evangelist. For he said that the Lord, as he went out of the praetorium, carried his own cross; but Matthew reports that they found a man from Cyrene, named Simon, whom they compelled to carry Jesus' cross. But this is to be understood that Jesus, as he went out of the praetorium, himself carried his own cross: afterwards they encountered Simon, whom they imposed the task of carrying the cross. But according to anagogical interpretation, the nations embrace the cross of Jesus, and the obedient stranger bears the ignominy of the Savior.

<h2 id='tocuniq627'>(Vers. 33.)</h2>

(Verse 33.) And they came to a place called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary. I have heard someone explain that Calvary is the place where Adam was buried, and it is thus named because the head of the ancient man is buried there, and this is what the Apostle says: Arise, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will enlighten you. A favorable interpretation that soothes the ears of the people, but not true. For outside the city and beyond the gate, there are places where the heads of the condemned are cut off, and Calvary, that is, the beheaded ones, have taken their name. Therefore, the Lord was crucified there, so that where there had been a site of condemnation, there the standards of martyrdom might be raised. And just as he was made a curse for us, and was whipped, and was crucified, so that he might be crucified as guilty among the guilty for the salvation of all. But if someone should wish to argue, why was the Lord crucified there, so that his blood might drip upon Adam's tomb, let us question him, why were other criminals also crucified in the same place? From which it is evident that Calvary does not signify the tomb of the first man, but rather the place of beheading, as where sin abounded, grace superabounded (Rom 5). But we read that Adam was buried near Hebron and Arba, in the volume of Jesus son of Nun (Josh 14).

<h2 id='tocuniq628'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34) And they gave him vinegar to drink with gall mixed in, and when he had tasted it, he did not want to drink. God speaks to Jerusalem: I planted you as a true vine, how then have you become bitter as a foreign vine? (Jeremiah II, 21) The bitter vine makes bitter wine, which the Lord Jesus drank, so that what is written may be fulfilled: They gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink (Psalm LXVIII, 22). But when it is said, 'And when he had tasted, he would not drink,' this indicates that he did indeed taste the bitterness of death for us, but on the third day he rose again.

<h2 id='tocuniq629'>(Vers. 35.)</h2>

(Verse 35) After they crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots, so that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots. And this was prophesied in the same psalm: They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots (Psalm 22:18).

<h2 id='tocuniq630'>(Vers. 36.)</h2>

(Verse 36.) And they were sitting and watching over him. The diligence of the soldiers and priests benefits us, so that the greater and more evident power of his resurrection may appear.

<h2 id='tocuniq631'>(Vers. 37.)</h2>

(Verse 37.) And they placed upon his head his accusation written, This is Jesus, the king of the Jews. I cannot sufficiently admire, considering the greatness of the matter, that they, in order to deceive the redeemed by a false price and to incite an unfortunate people to sedition and clamor, found no other cause for his execution than that he was the king of the Jews. And perhaps they did this mockingly and laughing. However, Pilate also responded to those who did not want it: What I have written, I have written. Whether you want it or not, the Jews, the entire multitude of the nations, answer to you: Jesus is the king of the Jews, that is, the ruler of believers and confessors.

<h2 id='tocuniq632'>(Vers. 38.)</h2>

(Verse 38.) Then they crucified two thieves with him, one on the right and one on the left. If Golgotha is the burial place of Adam, and not a place of the condemned, and therefore the Lord is crucified there to raise up Adam, why are the two thieves crucified in the same place?

<h2 id='tocuniq633'>(Vers. 39 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 39 onwards) And those passing by blasphemed him, shaking their heads and saying, 'Ah! You who destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.' Similarly, the chief priests, along with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, 'He blasphemes, because he goes off the path and refuses to walk in the true way of the Scriptures. They shook their heads because they had already moved their feet before, and they did not stand on solid ground. But he, mocking, says that the foolish people believed false witnesses.

<h2 id='tocuniq634'>(Vers. 42.)</h2>

(Verse 42.) He saved others, but he cannot save himself. Even unwillingly, the scribes and Pharisees confess that he saved others. Therefore, your own verdict condemns you. For the one who saved others, surely if he wanted to, he could save himself.

<h2 id='tocuniq635'>(Vers. 43.)</h2>

(Verse 43.) If he is the king of Israel, let him come down from the cross, and we will believe in him. He trusts in God; let God deliver him now if he desires him. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" A fraudulent promise. What is more difficult, to descend from the cross while still alive, or to rise from the tomb while dead? He has risen, and you did not believe. Therefore, even if he were to descend from the cross, you would not believe. But it seems to me that the demons are instigating this. For as soon as the Lord was crucified, they sensed the power of the cross, and they understood that their powers were broken. And this is what they are doing, that he may descend from the cross. But the Lord, knowing the snares of his adversaries, remains on the scaffold in order to destroy the devil.


<h2 id='tocuniq636'>(Vers. 44.)</h2>

(Verse 44) And the thieves also, who were crucified with him, reproached him. Here, by way of a figure of speech called synecdoche, both thieves are portrayed as blaspheming. But Luke asserts that while one was blaspheming, the other confessed, and he rebuked the blasphemer. It is not that the Gospels disagree, but rather that both initially blasphemed, and then, as the sun set, the earth shook, rocks were split, and darkness fell, one of them believed in Jesus and corrected his previous denial with a subsequent confession. Among the two robbers, both the Gentiles and the Jews blasphemed the Lord at first. Later, one of them, terrified by the greatness of the signs, repented and continues to rebuke the Jews today for blasphemy.

<h2 id='tocuniq637'>(Vers. 45.)</h2>

(Verse 45) And at the sixth hour, darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. Those who wrote against the Gospels suspect a solar eclipse, which usually happens at fixed and regular times, as the disciples of Christ were mistakenly interpreted on the resurrection of the Lord: since a solar eclipse only occurs when the moon rises. However, there is no doubt that the moon was full at the time of Passover. And so, lest it should appear that the shadow of the earth, or a lunar eclipse, had caused a brief and rust-colored darkness to occur, it is stated to have lasted for a period of three hours, so that every opportunity for natural causes could be eliminated. And I believe this was done to fulfill the prophecy, which says: The sun shall go down at noon, and the earth shall be darkened in the day of light (Amos, VIII, 9); and in another place: The sun has gone down while it was still day (Jerem. XV, 9). And it seems to me that the brightest light of the world, that is, the greater luminary, withdrew its rays, so that it would not see the hanging Lord, or so that the wicked blasphemers would not enjoy its light.

<h2 id='tocuniq638'>(Vers. 46.)</h2>

(Verse 46.) And about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lammasabacthani, which means, My God, My God, why have you forsaken me? He made use of the beginning of the twenty-first psalm, and that which is read in the middle of the verse: Look upon me, it is superfluous. For it is read in Hebrew: My God, My God, why have you forsaken me? Therefore, they are impious who believe that this psalm was spoken by David, or Esther, or Mordecai, since even the testimonies of the evangelists understand it to refer to the Savior, as when it says: They divided my garments among them, and upon my clothing they cast lots. And another thing: They pierced my hands and my feet. Do not be surprised by the lowly words and complaints of the abandoned, when you see the form of a servant, the scandal of the cross.

<h2 id='tocuniq639'>(Vers. 47.)</h2>

(Verse 47.) But some of those standing there, when they heard it, said: This man is calling for Elijah. Not everyone, but some, whom I believe to have been Roman soldiers, not understanding the propriety of the Hebrew language, thought that he was invoking Elijah because of what he said: Eli, Eli. However, if we want to understand those Jews who said this, they do so in their usual way, to defame the Lord of weakness, who is invoking Elijah's help.


<h2 id='tocuniq640'>(Vers. 48.)</h2>

(Verse 48.) And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, soaked it in vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to Him to drink. And these things were done so that the prophecy would be fulfilled: 'In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink' (Psalm 69:21). Even to this day, the Jews and all unbelievers drink vinegar and gall to Jesus in remembrance of His Resurrection; and they give Him wine mixed with myrrh to make Him sleep, so that He does not see their evil.

<h2 id='tocuniq641'>(Vers. 50.)</h2>

(Verse 50.) But Jesus, crying out again with a loud voice, yielded up his spirit. It is a testimony of divine power to freely release one's spirit, as He Himself had said: No one can take my life from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it up again (John 10:18).

<h2 id='tocuniq642'>(Vers. 51.)</h2>

(Verse 51.) And behold, the veil of the Temple was torn in two parts from top to bottom. The veil of the temple was torn, and all the sacred mysteries of the Law that were previously concealed were revealed and passed on to the Gentile people. In the Gospel, which we often mention, we read that the threshold of the temple, of infinite size, was broken and divided. Josephus also reports that the angelic virtues, former guardians of the temple, likewise cried out: Let us depart from these seats.


<h2 id='tocuniq643'>(Vers. 52.)</h2>

(Verse 52.) And the earth shook, and the rocks were split, and the tombs were opened. There is no doubt that ((Al. quid)) signifies literally the magnitude of the signs, such as the crucified Lord himself, and the heaven, and the earth, and all things. But it seems to me that the earthquake and the rest represent a type of the believers, who, having left behind their former errors and the hardness of their hearts, were first like the tombs of the dead, and later acknowledged the Creator.


<h2 id='tocuniq644'>(Vers. 53.)</h2>

(Verse 53.) And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised. And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they went into the holy city, and appeared to many. Just as Lazarus, who was dead, was raised, so too many bodies of the saints were raised to show the Lord rising from the dead (John 11). And yet, although the tombs were opened, they did not rise until the Lord had risen, so that he would be the firstborn of the resurrection from the dead. But let us understand the holy city, in which they were seen to rise again, either as the heavenly Jerusalem, or this earthly one, which was formerly holy. Just as Matthew is called a tax collector, not because he remains a tax collector as an apostle, but because he retains the former title. The city of Jerusalem was called holy because of the temple and the holy of holies, and as a distinction from other cities where idols were worshiped. When it is said 'truly', it appears to many that the resurrection was not general, so that it would appear to everyone, but rather special to many, so that those who deserved could see.

<h2 id='tocuniq645'>(Vers. 54.)</h2>

(Verse 54.) But the centurion and those with him, guarding Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things that were happening, were greatly afraid, saying, Truly this man was the Son of God. In another Gospel, after the earthquake, a clearer reason for the miracle of the centurion is explained: when he saw him release his spirit, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God. For no one has the power to release the spirit except the one who is the creator of souls. But let us understand spirit in this place as referring to the soul, either as making up a spiritual and vital body, or as the substance of the soul itself being spirit, according to what is written: 'You take away their breath, and they die' (Psalm 104:29). And it should be considered that the centurion, before the cross, truly confesses the Son of God in the very scandal of the Passion, while Arius preaches a creature in the Church.

<h2 id='tocuniq646'>(Vers. 55, 56.)</h2>

(Verse 55, 56) Now there were many women there from afar who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him: among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. It was the Jewish custom, and it was not considered a fault according to the ancient customs of the Gentiles, for women to provide food and clothing to their teachers from their own resources. Paul mentions that he rejected this because it could cause scandal among the nations. For he himself says: Do we not have the power to lead about sisters, women, as also the other apostles do? (I Cor. IX, 5) ? But the Lord provided for them from his substance, so that he might sow their carnal life, from whom they sowed spiritual things. Not because the Lord needed the food of creatures, but to show a pattern to teachers that they should be content with food and clothing provided by disciples. But let us see what companions he had: Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons, and Mary of James, and Joseph's mother, his aunt, sister of Mary, the mother of the Lord, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee, who had shortly before asked for the kingdom for her children, and others whom we read about in the other Gospels (Luke VIII).


<h2 id='tocuniq647'>(Vers. 57, 58.)</h2>

(Vers. 57, 58.) But when evening had come, a certain rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus, came. He approached Pilate and requested the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered the body to be given. The mention of the man being rich is not meant as a boast of the author, but to show the reason why he was able to obtain Jesus' body from Pilate. For it was not fitting for a poor and unknown person to approach the Roman governor and obtain the body of one who had been crucified. In another Gospel (Luke 23), this Joseph is called βουλευτὴς, which means counselor, and some think that the first psalm was composed about him: Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, and so on.

<h2 id='tocuniq648'>(Vers. 59.)</h2>

(Verse 59.) And Joseph, having received the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth. By this simple burial of the Lord, the ambition of the rich is condemned, who cannot even part with their wealth in tombs. We can also understand this spiritually, that the body of the Lord should be wrapped not in gold, gems, and silk, but in pure linen, even though this also signifies that Joseph wrapped Jesus in a clean linen cloth, who had received Him with a pure mind.


<h2 id='tocuniq649'>(Vers. 60.)</h2>

(Verse 60.) And he put it in his new tomb, which had been hewn out of the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. The new tomb is placed, so that after the resurrection, it would not be claimed that someone else had risen while the other bodies remained. However, it can also symbolize the new tomb of the Virgin Mary's womb: the stone placed at the entrance and the large stone showing that the tomb could not be opened without the help of many.


<h2 id='tocuniq650'>(Vers. 61 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 61 seqq.) Now there was there Mary Magdalene and another Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. And the next day that followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive: After three days I will rise again. And while the others left the Lord, the women remained faithful, waiting for what Jesus had promised; and therefore they deserved to be the first to see Him risen, for whoever perseveres until the end will be saved (Matthew X, 22; XXIV, 13).


<h2 id='tocuniq651'>(Vers. 64 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 64 onwards) Therefore, command that the tomb be guarded until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last deception will be worse than the first.' Pilate said to them, 'You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can.' So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard. It was not enough for the chief priests and the Pharisees to crucify the Lord Savior, unless they also guard the tomb, receive a cohort, seal the stone, and put their hand against the one rising, so that their diligence might confirm our faith: for the more it is kept hidden, the more the power of the resurrection is shown. And he was buried in a new tomb, which had been hewn out of a rock, so that if it had been constructed from many stones, the foundations of the mound being dug up, it would be excavated by theft. But the testimony of the prophets is that he should be placed in a tomb, saying: He will dwell in a hewn cliff of a very strong rock (Isaiah 33:16). And immediately after two verses follows: you will see the king with glory (Ibid., 17).


<h2 id='tocuniq652'>(Chap. XXVIII.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter XXVIII, Verse 1.) But on the evening of the Sabbath, when the first light of the Sabbath dawned, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb. The fact that these women are described at different times in the Gospels is not a sign of falsehood, as the wicked claim, but rather a diligent act of visitation, as they frequently come and go, and do not allow the tomb of the Lord to be empty or far away for long.

<h2 id='tocuniq653'>(Vers. 2, 3.)</h2>

(Va. 2, 3.) And behold, there was a great earthquake. For the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and coming, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it. And his appearance was like lightning, and his garment like snow. Our Lord, one and the same Son of God and Son of Man, according to both natures, divine and human, now demonstrates signs of his greatness, now of his humility. And even in the present place, although he is a man who was crucified, who was buried, who is enclosed in a tomb, whom a stone restrains, nevertheless the things that happen outside reveal the Son of God, the fleeing sun, the approaching darkness, the trembling earth, the torn veil, the split rocks, the raised dead, the ministry of angels, which from the beginning of his birth attest that he is God. Gabriel came to Mary, the angel spoke to Joseph; the same message was announced to the shepherds, afterwards a chorus of angels was heard saying: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will (Luke 2)."  } He is tempted in solitude, and after the victory, immediately the angels serve Him. Now also the Angel comes, the guardian of the Lord's tomb, and in a white garment, He manifests the glory of the triumphant one. Moreover, as the Lord ascends to heaven, two angels are seen on the Mount of Olives, promising to the apostles according to the Savior's coming (Acts 1).

<h2 id='tocuniq654'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

(Vers. 4, 5.) But because of his fear, the guards were terrified and became like dead men. But the angel, answering, said to the women: Do not fear. For I know that you seek Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here, for he has risen as he said. The guards, terrified with fear, lie astounded like dead men, and yet the angel comforts not them, but the women. Do not fear, he says to them. Let them fear, he says, let the terror continue in those who continue in disbelief. Furthermore, because you seek Jesus crucified, hear that he has risen and fulfilled his promises.

<h2 id='tocuniq655'>(Vers. 6, 7.)</h2>

(Verse 6, 7.) Come and see the place where the Lord was placed. And quickly going, tell his disciples. So if you do not believe my words, believe in the empty tomb, and go quickly and tell his disciples.

Because he has risen, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee: there you shall see him: behold, I have told you. This is at the turning point of the nations, where there was previously error and a slippery path, and he did not leave a firm and stable footprint.

<h2 id='tocuniq656'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) And they quickly went out of the tomb with fear and great joy, running to announce to his disciples. The hearts of the women were filled with two emotions, fear and joy: one because of the magnitude of the miracle, the other out of the desire for his resurrection; and yet both stirred up their feminine courage. They went to the apostles, so that through them the seed of faith might be spread.

<h2 id='tocuniq657'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(V. 9.) And behold, Jesus met them, saying: Hail. Those who were seeking, those who were running thus, deserved to have the risen Lord meet them first and to hear, Hail, so that the curse of the woman Eve might be overturned in women.

But they came close and held his feet, and worshiped him. These women approached and held his feet because they worshiped him. However, she who was seeking the living among the dead and did not yet know that the Son of God had risen, rightly heard: Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father (John 20:17).

<h2 id='tocuniq658'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) Then Jesus said to them: Do not be afraid. And in the Old and New Testament, this must always be observed: that when a more splendid (or narrower) vision appears, fear is first driven away, so that, with the mind calmed, what is said can be heard.

Go, tell my brothers to go to Galilee, there they will see me. And when they had gone, behold, some of the guards came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened. These are the brothers of whom he said elsewhere: I will declare your name to my brothers (Psalm 22:23): who do not see the Savior in Judea, but in the multitude of the nations.

<h2 id='tocuniq659'>(Vers. 12 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 12 seqq.) And gathering with the elders, having taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, saying: Say that his disciples came by night and stole him away while we were sleeping. And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and make you free from worry. So they took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day. The guards report the miracle: they return to the city excitedly and report to the chief priests what they have seen, what has happened. Those who were supposed to convert to repentance and seek the risen Jesus persist in wickedness and turn the money that had been given for the use of the temple into the redemption of falsehood, just as they had previously given thirty pieces of silver to the traitor Judas. Therefore, all those who misuse the offerings of the temple and the funds dedicated to the Church for their own desires are similar to the scribes and priests who bought falsehood and the blood of the Savior.


<h2 id='tocuniq660'>(Vers. 16, 17.)</h2>

(Verse 16, 17.) However, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them. And when they saw him, they worshipped; but some doubted. After Jesus' resurrection, he is seen on the mountain in Galilee and is worshipped there; although some doubt, and their doubt increases our faith. Then he reveals himself more clearly to Thomas, showing him the wounded side with a spear, and the hands with nails.

<h2 id='tocuniq661'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) And Jesus approached them, saying: All power is given to me in heaven and on earth. Power is given to those who were recently crucified, buried in a tomb, lay dead, and later resurrected. In heaven and on earth, power is given so that the one who previously reigned in heaven may now reign on earth through the faith of believers.

<h2 id='tocuniq662'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19) Therefore, go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. First, they teach all nations, then they immerse them in water. For it cannot happen that the body receives the sacrament of baptism unless the soul has first accepted the truth of faith. And they are baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, so that there may be one divinity of those who give, one bestowal: and the name of the Trinity is one God.


<h2 id='tocuniq663'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. The principal order: He commanded the apostles that first they should teach all nations, then dip them in the sacrament of faith, and after faith and baptism, they should command what should be observed. And lest we think that what is commanded is light and few, he added: All things whatsoever I have commanded you. That whoever believes, who is baptized in the Trinity, should do all the things that are commanded.


And behold, I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world. He who promises to be with his disciples until the consummation of the world, and shows that they will always be victorious, and that he will never depart from the believers. But he who promises his presence until the consummation of the world does not ignore the day on which he knows he will be with the apostles.
