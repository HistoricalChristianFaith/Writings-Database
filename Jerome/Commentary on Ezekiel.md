<h2 id='tocuniq3'>Book One</h2>

Book One

Having finished in eighteen volumes my Explanations on Isaiah, I desired to pass on to Ezekiel, as I often promised you, O Virgin of Christ, Eustochium, and to lay the finishing touch, so to speak, on the prophetical work. But suddenly news reached me of the death of Pammachius and Marcella, the siege of the city of Rome, and the death of many brothers and sisters. I was so stunned and bewildered that for days and nights I could think of nothing else but the salvation of all. I thought I was in captivity with the saints, and I could not unlock my lips until I had learned more definite news. Between hope and despair I am tossed on the billows, and the miseries of others torture me. But when truly the most brilliant light of all the earth was extinguished, indeed the head of the Roman Empire was severed: and, to tell the truth, the whole world perished in one City, I became silent and humbled, and I was silent from the good, and my grief was renewed: my heart grew hot within me, and in my meditation a fire was kindled (Psalm. XXXVIII, 4): nor did I think that sentence should be neglected: Music in mourning is an intrusive narrative (Sirach. XXII, 6). But because you persistently demand it, and a scar gradually covers a great wound: and Scorpius is pressed between Enceladus and Porphyrion and crushed by the Trinacrian soil, and the Hydra with many heads has at last ceased to hiss against us: and a time has been given in which we ought not to respond to the snares of heretics, but rather devote ourselves to the exposition of the Scriptures, I will undertake the prophet Ezekiel, whose difficulty is confirmed by the tradition of the Hebrews. But unless someone among them has reached the age of thirty for the priestly ministry, that is, has completed the thirtieth year, they are not permitted to read the beginnings of Genesis, the Song of Songs, or the beginning and end of this book, in order to approach the perfect knowledge and mystical understanding that the full time of human nature requires. If, by the mercy of the Lord, I bring this work to a conclusion, I will move on to Jeremiah, who, in his Lamentations, laments the four parts of the world under the figure of Jerusalem, using a quadruple alphabet.


<h2 id='tocuniq4'>(Chap. I.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 1, Verse 1) And it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month. The thirtieth year is not, as many think, the age of the prophet, nor the Year of Jubilee, which is the year of remission; but from the twelfth year of King Josiah of Judah, when the book of Deuteronomy was found in the temple of God, until the fifth year of the captivity of Joachin, also known as Jeconiah, when he was led with his mother to Babylon, along with Daniel and the three young men, and Ezekiel (who was among the first captives of the tribe of Judah) when the wrath of God was poured out on Jerusalem (2 Kings 22; 2 Chronicles 34; 2 Kings 24). But according to the mystical interpretation, the Lord and Savior is prefigured, who came to baptism at the age of thirty (Luke 3), which is the age of perfection in man. Therefore, in the book of Numbers, according to the Hebrews and not as contained in the Septuagint, the priests begin to minister in the tabernacle at the age of thirty and not at the age of twenty-five (Numbers 4). In this sign, Joseph also preceded when he distributed grain to the hungry people in Egypt (Genesis 41), and John the Baptist came to the banks of the Jordan and preached the baptism of repentance (Luke 3). And what is written, in the fourth, the sentence is pending, it is understood in the month. For immediately it follows, in the fifth month. And to make it more clear, they added Seventy before.

<h2 id='tocuniq5'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Verse 2) While I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God in the fifth month: it was the fifth year of the exile of King Joachin. As the captive people sat by the rivers of Babylon, David prophesied in the spirit: By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down and wept (Psalm 137). Now, Chebar, either it is the name of the river, or certainly, according to its interpretation, which is translated as "grave," it signifies the Tigris and Euphrates, as well as all the great and weighty rivers that are said to be in the land of the Chaldeans. And understand that the heavens are open not by the division of the firmament, but by the faith of the believer, because the celestial mysteries are revealed to them. Hence, in the baptism of the Savior, when the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the form of a dove, we read of the heavens being opened (Matthew 3), and through their opening, the visions of God are revealed. Not just one vision, but multiple visions, as the Lord says through the Prophet: 'I will multiply visions and as a likeness, I have been made in the hands of the prophets' (Hosea 12:10). These are the visions that the entire prophecy of Ezekiel weaves together. According to the Hebrews and other interpreters, the migration is called Joachin and not captivity, as the LXX translated. For he was not captured when the city was conquered, but by his own will, he was taken to Babylon. Therefore, let the first migration be called Joachin, that is, Jechoniah: but let the second or final captivity be called Zedekiah.

<h2 id='tocuniq6'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3) The word of the Lord came to Ezekiel, son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chebar. And to Daniel and Ezekiel, who were in Babylon by the rivers, the mysteries of things to come are revealed upon the waters, indeed in the purest waters, so that the power of baptism may be shown. Otherwise, even the apostle Paul, when he was baptized by Ananias in the Lord, having his eyes covered with scales, was freed from blindness (Acts 9). And in Genesis, the first creatures that lived came forth from the waters. It should also be understood that in the thirtieth year of his age the Lord came to baptism: in the fourth month, which is called January among us, and is at the beginning of the year, except for the month of Nisan, the month of the new moon, in which the Passover is celebrated. Among Oriental peoples, after the gathering of crops and the pressing of grapes, when tithes were brought to the temple, October was the first month, and January the fourth. But he adds the fifth day of the month, to signify baptism, in which the heavens were opened to Christ, and the day of Epiphany is venerable until now, not as some suppose, the birthday in the flesh, for he was hidden at that time and did not appear. This is suitable for this time, when it was said: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased (Matthew 3:17). Furthermore, Buzi is translated into our language, despised and rejected: Ezekiel, strengthened by God. What is thus joined to the Lord, that we may say the Creator of the world, who is the Father of the Savior, is despised and rejected by all heretics, who do not accept the old Testament. It is not surprising that the Lord is the strength of God, since He is the power and wisdom of God Himself.

And the hand of the Lord came upon him there. LXX: And the hand of the Lord came upon me. In order to see the visions of God and understand them, we need the hand and strength of God upon us (1 Corinthians 1). With that hand and arm, the people of Israel were led out of Egypt; even the Magi understood a part of that power, saying: This is the finger of God (Exodus 8). And the Savior in the Gospel said: But if I cast out demons by the finger of God (Matthew 12:28). For it is written in another Gospel: If I cast out demons by the Spirit of God (Luke 11:20).

<h2 id='tocuniq7'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4) And I saw, and behold, a whirlwind wind was coming from the north, and a great cloud, and a rolling fire, and brightness around it. And within it was something like the appearance of electric sparks, that is, from within the fire. LXX: And I saw, and behold, a spirit was coming from the north, carrying (or lifting) a great cloud within it, and a shining fire, and brightness around it. And within it was a vision like electric sparks within fire, and brightness within it. In the consolation of the migrating people, and in the revelation of God's sentence, the prophet sees the greatest vision. By its interpretation, all the synagogues of the Jews are rendered speechless, beyond those who say that it is beyond human, and they attempt something about this and about the building of the temple, which is written at the end of this prophecy. However, we, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things, according to the measure of our small intellect, can more suspect than explain. We will believe kind and faithful readers, seeking forgiveness, that they may favor our audacity, or rather the measure of our faith, rather than be angry. First of all, it must be known that the term spiritus, which we have interpreted as 'wind' in accordance with Aquila, and as 'blast' and 'stormy wind' in accordance with Symmachus and Theodotion, can be understood by others as coming from a favorable direction and by others as coming from an unfavorable direction. The Hebrew word Rua, depending on the quality of the places, can be understood as 'spirit,' 'soul,' or 'wind.' 'Spirit' as in: 'Send forth your spirit and they shall be created' (Ps. 103, 30). Soul: His spirit will go forth and return to its own land (Ps. 144:4). Wind: You will break the ships of Tarshish with a violent wind (Ps. 47:8). And elsewhere: Fire and brimstone, and a spirit of storms, is the portion of their cup (Ps. 11:7). Those who study the wind and the breath of the storm understand this: the anger and fury of God coming from the north, that is, from Nebuchadnezzar, and that Jerusalem will be captured after six years of this vision. This is the vision of the fifth year of the reign of King Joachin, who was the fifth king of Jerusalem during the reign of Sedeciah. We read that after six years, in the eleventh year of his reign, when the city was captured, he was taken to Babylon. It is revealed to those who dwell near the river Chobar and who willingly submitted themselves to the king that they have done well to obey God's judgment. In a short time, both the province of Judaea and the city of Jerusalem are to be captured. And when a great cloud is described, let us understand that it brings rains of destruction upon Judea, and showers of collisions. And the wrapped fire shows the future punishments and the evils of captivity. And the splendor around it signifies the open judgments of God. But those who think in the opposite way, that is, the good, understand the spirit that takes away, or lifts up, the Holy Spirit, who takes away vices and sins from people, or raises the fallen to sublime things, and makes them retreat from the very cold North wind, from which evils blaze up over the whole earth (Ecclesiasticus 43); and in Jeremiah, that terrifying pot is kindled from the face of the North wind (Jeremiah 1). They also refer to the great cloud in relation to the person of Christ, who came to Egypt of this world upon a light cloud: and properly it is called great in comparison with the lesser clouds, namely, the prophets and apostles and all the saints, of whom it is written: And thy truth unto the clouds (Ps. XXXV, 6); and: I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon Israel (Isai. V, 6); and elsewhere: The cloud is the dust of his feet (Naum I, 3); and again: Clouds and darkness are round about him (Ps. XCVI, 2). And also the shining fire and the splendor around it, according to what is written: God is a consuming fire (Deut. IV, 24). The Savior says that he came to send fire upon the earth, and desires to burn in us and all who believe (Luke XI); although he brings terror and punishment to sinners, nevertheless he shines with splendor and is full of light and brightness. Therefore, he purifies us so that he may grant us greater joys in purity and purification.


<h2 id='tocuniq8'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) And in the midst of it is the likeness of four living creatures, and this is their appearance: the likeness of a human in them. And what follows, And there is a brightness in it, should be noted with a mark. Unless the Scripture had added, saying: That is, from the midst of the fire, because of the ambiguity of the word, we might have erred and thought that the appearance or vision was of lightning in the midst of the wind or of a spirit. Therefore, it should be understood that in the midst of the fire and torments of God, there is a likeness of lightning, which is more precious than gold and silver. So after judgment and torments, which seem sad and hard to those who endure them, the more precious brightness of lightning appears, while the providence of God governs all things, and what is thought to be punishment is actually medicine.


<h2 id='tocuniq9'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6) And in the midst of it is the likeness of four living creatures, and this is their appearance: the likeness of a man is among them. In the midst of it, it is understood, is indeed electricity: but it is better to understand it as fire, which is light for believers and punishment for unbelievers. Therefore, in the midst of this fire, there was the likeness of four living creatures, a likeness, not a nature; and the four living creatures that are later called quadriform, are one likeness of a man, so that all things in the world may be shown to be rational: 'Let us make man in our image and likeness' (Genesis 1). But the image and likeness of God is not the form of the body, but of the mind: described according to the true image of Christ, who is the image of the invisible God. These rational creatures exist in four places, either because of the four cardinal points of the world, by which the globe is enclosed, or because of the four places: celestial, terrestrial, infernal, and supercelestial, of which the apostle Paul also speaks: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth (Philippians 2, 10). Of the three, there is Paul's testimony. Let us see the fourth. Praise the Lord, ye heavens of heavens, and the water that is above the heavens, let the name of the Lord be praised (Psalm CXLVIII, 5). And again, by the Apostle, other heavenly things are said, and other things above heavenly (I Corinthians XV).

<h2 id='tocuniq10'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) The four faces to one, and the four wings to one, and their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like the appearance of burnished brass. And the hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides. LXX: And the four faces to one, and the four wings to one, and their legs were straight, and they had winged feet. And they sparkled like flashing bronze, and their wings were light, and the hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides. Of the four animals, whose appearance was a likeness of a human (only in such a way that each had four faces, and four wings, and straight legs, and the sole of their feet was like the hooves of a calf, or, as the eagle interpreted it, round, which the LXX completely omitted), of the shining sparks of bronze, and of their light feathers, which are not mentioned in Hebrew, of the hand of man also under their wings in four parts, and the rest which the prophetic speech describes, we will endeavor to explain what it seems to say to us, when we briefly summarize the opinions of each person. Some claim that the four Gospels, which we have also followed in the preface of the commentary on Matthew, are designated by the names of these animals: Matthew, because it describes Jesus as a man: The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. They attribute it to Mark the lion: The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as it is written in the prophet Isaiah: The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight (Isaiah 40:3). Calves, to the Gospel of Luke, which begins with the priesthood of Zacharias. Eagles, to the beginning of John, who, soaring to the heights, began: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Regarding what we think about these, we have said in the aforementioned work, and more fully in the Apocalypse of John (Chapter IV), the appearance and names of these animals refer to the four Gospels (or, to the Evangelists). We will try to explain in their proper place how the description of all animals can be adapted. But others, who foolishly follow the wisdom of philosophers, think that there are two hemispheres in the two temples of the Cherubim, us and the Antipodes, as if humans were lying on their backs and falling. Many, according to Plato, attribute the rational soul, the irascible soul, and the concupiscent soul, which he calls the logical, the spirited, and the appetitive, to man, lion, and calf: placing reason, knowledge, mind, and counsel, as well as the same virtue and wisdom, in the citadel of the brain; but attributing ferocity, anger, and violence to the lion, which resides in the gall. Moreover, they place desire, luxury, and the craving for all pleasures in the liver, that is, in the calf that clings to the works of the earth. And they consider as a fourth thing, which is beyond and outside these three, what the Greeks call συντήρησιν, which is the spark of conscience that is not extinguished even in Cain's heart, after he was cast out of paradise. And it is by this spark that we, conquered by pleasures or by madness, and sometimes deceived even by the semblance of reason itself, feel that we sin. How properly they are appointed to eagles, not mixing themselves with the three, but correcting the three wandering ones; which in the Scriptures we sometimes read is called the spirit, who intercedes for us with unutterable groanings. For no one knows the things that belong to man, except the spirit that is in him. Whom Paul also, writing to the Thessalonians, prays that they may be preserved sound in soul and body. And yet this very conscience, according to what is written in Proverbs: The wicked man, when he comes into the depth of sins, contemns it (Prov. XVIII, 13): we see certain individuals being precipitated and losing their place, who do not even have shame and modesty in their transgressions, and deserve to hear: Your face has become like that of a harlot, you did not want (Al. you do not know) to be ashamed (Jerem. III, 3). Therefore, God guides this chariot like a charioteer, and restrains it running with uncontrolled steps, making it obedient, and forces it to obey His command. We will also discuss the nature of the soul, that is, the soul of man, which is called the microcosm by the same philosophers. Some believe that the four elements of the world, namely fire, air, water, and earth, are simply represented in four animals, according to the opinion of Hippocrates. How these elements mix with each other, and how they seem to be joined together and touch each other, and how they have four distinct species and forms in one animal, is not the purpose of this work. They also consider the four wheels rising from the earth to the heights, joined to each other by four-formed animals or the mixture of the same elements, or the cycle of the four seasons, which is completed by nine months, and the turning year, which has received its name from the fact that it always turns and returns to itself. Of these things, it has been beautifully said in one verse:

Spring, summer, autumn, winter, and months, and years. And it is said: There was a wheel in a wheel, they think to signify the year in the year. About which another poet (Virgil, II Georg.) says:

And in its own footprints, the year rolls on. They also want this sky, which we observe, to be understood as a likeness of crystal: under which four living creatures roll and pass. And they think that the throne of sapphire-colored, and the man sitting above it in human likeness, described the omnipotence of God, who rules over all things and has everything under his feet. And, finally, it is said: This is the vision of the likeness of the glory of God, through which, as through a certain picture and image, providence is demonstrated. And just as the feet of animals are said to be straight, and the hoof of a calf, or round, to soar from earthly things to heavenly things, and with all angles cut off, to follow roundness, which is the most beautiful of all shapes. To show shining sparks, indicating all things full of light, and the hands of man under the wings of both man himself, and lion, and calf, and eagle: so that reason may support all things, and lift them up from earthly humility to heavenly things. These things can be referred to both the Gospels and everything we have mentioned above. I remember hearing about four passions, which Cicero discusses in detail in his Tusculan Disputations: joy, sadness, desire, and fear, of which two are present and two are future, symbolized by four animals, about which Virgil also briefly speaks in Book VI of the Aeneid.

From here they fear, desire, grieve, and rejoice: the things that should be subject to the rule and power of God; and which, on the contrary, the four virtues - Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance - are set against or imposed upon, in order to be governed by their authority. They completely neglect to mention how these virtues are adapted to the faces of man, lion, calf, and eagle. On these matters, the same philosopher and orator discuss in three books addressed to their son concerning duties. I have read a brief dispute by a certain Catinaeus, whom the Syrians call 'subtle,' that is, sharp and ingenious, which asserts that the arrangement of the twelve tribes of the camp can be described in the wilderness, towards the East and West, North and South, which are joined together by love and kinship, and this is the wheel within a wheel, which is guided by the spirit and protected by a cloud in the desert, and illuminated by a column of fire at night; they do not return to Egypt, but always hasten to go to the promised land. But the eagle in the midst represents the Holy of Holies, and the face of the man represents the whole of Israel; the lion represents the royal scepter of Judah; the calf represents the priestly and Levitical tribe. In addition, the face of the eagle symbolizes the divine vengeance and retribution from heaven, overseeing everything, and prepared to tear apart the sinner, as it is said in Hosea: 'As an eagle over the house of God' (Hos. 8:1), that is, the temple. And in the same prophet Hosea (17), the great eagle with large wings and claws, which has the ability to enter into Lebanon, is understood to represent Nebuchadnezzar, whom even now signifies as coming, and sitting upon such a four-wheeled chariot like a charioteer, governing and commanding what is to be done or not to be done. However, he says, it is said to the people who live in Babylon, that if they submit their necks to God and obey his restraints, they will earn his help again, and they will regain the land which they had lost.

<h2 id='tocuniq11'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Vers. 8, 9.) And they had four wings, and their wings were joined one to another. They did not turn back when they walked, but each one moved forward before its face. The Gospels are joined to each other and cling together, and they fly to and fro throughout the whole world, running here and there, without end to their flight, never surpassing or receding, but always proceeding to further things. And both Paul and Virgil say: Forgetting the things that are past, and reaching forth towards those things that are still to come. We can say the same about the virtues of the soul, about the passage of time, and about the mingling of the elements, that, leaving behind the past, they always hurry back to the former things. And the fact that times slip away and flee is demonstrated in a short verse.

But meanwhile it flees, time flees irreparably. And in a lyric poem (Horace, Odes, 14).

Alas, alas, fleeting years slip away, Posthumus, Posthumus!

<h2 id='tocuniq12'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) The likeness of their faces, the face of a man and the face of a lion on their right side, and the face of an ox on their left side, and the face of an eagle above them. The faces represent the beginning of the Gospels, in which the human and lion symbolize the birth of Christ and the voice of the prophets thundering in the wilderness on the right side. The ox, which represents the sacrifices and the priesthood of the Jews, is on the left side, which was abolished and passed on to the spiritual priesthood, as it is written: You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek (Psalm 110:4); so that all things may belong to him and be counted as one body. But the eagle, which is both about the birth and the prophecy, which is fulfilled by the Lord's coming, and about the priesthood that has passed, and beyond all these things, referring to the spiritual birth, how the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father. Concerning which it is rightly said: Who shall declare his generation (Isaiah 53:8)? These are, according to the Apocalypse (Chapter 4), as we have already said, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind, of which one is like a lion, and the second like a calf, and the third has the face of a man, and the fourth is like a flying eagle. There they are said to have the form of Seraphim with six wings, two covering their face and two covering their feet, and two flying, and they do not rest day or night, saying: Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come (Rev. 4:8).

<h2 id='tocuniq13'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11) And their faces and wings were stretched out from above, with two wings of each joined together and two covering their bodies. And above we have said that the Gospels and the seasons are joined together, and all rational creatures, and the four virtues, so that whoever lacks one lacks all. And that the two are stretched out and rise up high signifies heavenly preaching and all things tending towards the majesty of God. But two things hinder the knowledge of bodies: human knowledge is excluded, and perfect intuition is not provided, as the Apostle says: For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away with (1 Cor. 13:9).

<h2 id='tocuniq14'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12) And each thing moved forward before its own face. Wherever the impulse of the spirit was, there they moved forward and did not turn back while they traveled. The one who holds the plowshare should not look back (Luke 9:62), nor should one imitate Lot's wife (Genesis 19), lest they fall into the punishment of Deuteronomy (Chapter 19) and perish like the incurable paralytic, whom Eli also fell because he had offended God with the fault of his sons (2 Kings 4). How much more should the four animals that were full of light and wings, which follow the preceding Holy Spirit, fly around the world and elevate themselves to the heights in order to protect their bodies with the feathers of history and not grant us a fuller vision? But what is also said secondly: They did not turn back when they went forward, signifies the sacrament of each of these four living creatures, and the Law and the Gospel hasten toward the future; and they never receive a backward movement.

<h2 id='tocuniq15'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Vers. 13, 14.) And the likeness of the creatures, and their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of torches. This was the vision running among the creatures, a gleam of fire, and lightning coming forth from the fire. And the creatures went and returned like the flashing of lightning. LXX: And in the midst of the creatures a vision like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches running among the creatures; and a gleam of fire, and lightning came forth from the fire. And what follows: And the animals were running and returning as if they were species of beasts, it is added from the edition of Theodotion to the Septuagint: who, lest he seem to say something contrary to the two previous statements of the prophet, thought it best to omit what they thought to be contradictory, that is, and the animals were running and returning, so as not to cause scandal to the reader. It is better, however, to translate in divine books what has been said, even if you do not understand why it has been said, rather than remove what you do not know. Otherwise, many other things that are ineffable and cannot be grasped by the human mind will be destroyed by this freedom. But we say this, as it is also written in the Proverbs in the same place: \"Do not answer a fool according to his folly, lest you also become like him\" (Prov. XXVI, 4, 5); and in another place it is put that seems to be contrary to us: \"Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he appear wise in his own eyes;\" and both are in agreement with the diversity of times and persons, since the fool is despised because he does not receive wisdom; and foolish pride is brought down by other foolishness, as the Apostle says: \"I have become foolish, you compelled me\" (II Cor. XII, 11): so also in this place we should seek why it was said above for the second time: \"The animals did not turn back when they walked;\" and now, once, the animals ran and turned back. And if there were not a question following, it would be like a flashing lightning: which in Hebrew is called Bezec, and is interpreted by Symmachus, as if it were the appearance of a lightning bolt. Therefore, just as the ethereal fire flashes with frequent sparks, and the lightning bolts flash and return in the blink of an eye, without losing their source and, so to speak, the origin of fire and material; in the same way, these animals, when they continue with an unhindered foot, hasten towards their former state. But if they see something opposed to their attempts, they do not so much turn back as they contract themselves, to be extended again, and to give the light that they had hidden for a while, to give food to the slaves in their proper time, to not give what is holy to dogs, nor to throw pearls before swine (Matthew 7). Therefore, Paul also says: I have given you milk to drink, not food, for you were not yet able to receive it (1 Corinthians 3:2). And the choice of Judas and the anointing of Saul do not indicate that God is ignorant of future events, but they show that He is the judge of present things (Matthew 10). And it is commanded to the Apostles, that if they perceive an unworthy house by the salutation, they should first shake off the dust from their feet; and the peace which they have given to the house should return to them. But the burning coals and the lamps running among the animals are interpreted from that place of Isaiah: And the fire shall eat the flesh as the grass, and I will sanctify them in the burning fire (Isaiah 5:24) . And it is written elsewhere: Burning coals shall fall upon them (Psalm 140:11) . And against deceitful lips, it is said in another psalm: 'What shall be given to you, or what shall be added to you, to a deceitful tongue? Sharp arrows of the powerful, with coals of desolation.' (Psalm 119:3-4). And in another place: 'You have coals of fire, you shall sit upon them, they shall be to you for help.' (Isaiah 47:14). Whatever creature we behold, it reflects the knowledge of God, as the Creator is recognized through his creatures. And from the midst of living beings comes the splendor of fire and lightning. For if you study the Gospels, amidst the letters and humble history, you will discover the sacraments of the Holy Spirit.

<h2 id='tocuniq16'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 and following) And as I looked at the animals, a wheel appeared on the earth beside the animals, having four faces. And the appearance of the wheels and their work was like the vision of the sea, and the four of them had the same likeness, and their appearance and work was as a wheel within a wheel. They went in the four directions, and they did not turn as they walked. The wheels also had a height and a terrifying appearance, and the whole body was full of eyes all around the four of them. LXX: And I saw, and behold, a wheel was following animals four over the earth. And the appearance of the wheels and their construction was like the color of tarshish. And their appearance was in four: and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel. They walked in their four parts, and did not turn back when they walked. And their backs and their height were to them. And I saw them, and their backs were full of eyes all around the four. Up to this point, the picture describes the four living creatures that had four faces, following the spirits and the cloud that was in the midst of the spirit, now the individual wheels are mentioned for each animal, which were not attached to the animals but followed them. Or a wheel appeared upon the Earth, which, divided into four, had as many faces as the number of animals that followed. And such was the similarity of the four wheels to the four following animals, that one wheel was truly believed. And their work and creation was like the vision of tharsis, which we turn into the sea. The eagle placed the hyacinth; which stone resembles the sky. And their appearance was like one wheel in another, so that you would not believe it was one wheel, but rather one wheel joined to another. They were moving in four directions, and they were not being dragged or turned back. For how could they turn back when they were following animals that always move towards the front? The height and size of the wheels were also so great that it amazed those who saw it. The entire body and backs were filled with light all around, so that you could not see any part that did not have the light of eyes: like the stories of the poets describe Argus, who had a hundred or many eyes, which Juno turned into a peacock for his careless watch, so that what is a miracle of God the Creator would be a punishment for adultery without recompense. All things celestial and terrestrial, and whatever falls under human understanding, are turned by the wheels of the Sun. The Sun travels through its yearly circle, with the Moon coursing through each month. The Morning Star itself, known as Lucifer, as it twinkles from East to West, tempers the darkness of the night with a small light and completes its course in two years. The four other wandering stars, called planets, and everything that shines in the sky, as well as the varieties of crops, trees, and herbs, follow their courses in four seasons on their own respective wheels; and we behold nothing that has not existed before. The spirit moves by whirling and returns to its own circles. All rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full (Ecclesiastes 1:6-7). Why? Because they return to their sources from the deep abyss. But of the Gospels, that is, of the four living creatures that breathe, live, and understand, if anyone considers the wheel and its course, in a short time he will see the world to be complete with the Apostolic proclamation. The wheel is also within a wheel, or the joining of the two Testaments, which indicates the ladder of Jacob (Genesis 28) and the prophetic word of Isaiah (Isaiah 6) and the double-edged sword. Or it represents the harmonious Gospels whose course and stature tend towards heaven and touch the earth only briefly, always hastening towards the heights. About which it is said elsewhere: Holy stones roll upon the earth (Zech. IX, 16); from which the celestial Jerusalem is built. I believe this signifies the same thing as what is sung in the psalm: The voice of your thunder is in the wheel (Psalm LXXVI, 19). And elsewhere: Which sets the wheel of birth on fire (James III, 6). The meaning of these testimonies in their proper places is not of this time. But whoever sees that there is nothing in the Gospels that does not shine with its own light and illuminate the world with its splendor, will approve the whole body and the backs filled with eyes, so that even the things considered small and lowly may shine with the majesty of the Holy Spirit.


<h2 id='tocuniq17'>(Vers. 19 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 19 seqq.) When the animals walked, the wheels walked alongside them. And when the animals were lifted up from the ground, the wheels were also lifted up. Wherever the spirit went, the wheels went there too, for the spirit of life was in the wheels. As the animals went, the wheels went, and as they stood, the wheels stood. And when the animals were lifted up from the ground, the wheels were lifted up as well, following them, for the spirit of life was in the wheels. Four animals followed the spirit, and the cloud that was in the spirit. And again, the wheels lifted themselves off the ground, not the animals, but the spirit followed, to show its own will: because the spirit of life was in the wheels. Three, however, are indicated both in the animals and in the wheels, when they stood, when they walked, when they were lifted up, which both the animals and the wheels did in common. For neither could animals that were standing walk on wheels, nor could animals walking on the ground lift themselves on wheels, but of those actions, one was rest, one was motion, and elevation. And secondly it is said, because the spirit of life was in the wheels: so that we should in no way consider the wheels as vessels, which we see in the carts of wagons and chariots, but as living beings, indeed above living beings. For the animal man does not perceive those things that are spirits. Therefore, these wheels, in which the spirit of life was, do all things in order and measure, and they have harmony with animals, following them, and through them, the Holy Spirit; indeed, having skipped the middle, they enjoy the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. All of which, according to the earlier understanding, a wise reader can fit into various interpretations.

<h2 id='tocuniq18'>(Vers. 22 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 22 onwards) And the likeness above the heads of the living creatures was like the appearance of a crystal dreadful ice; extended above their heads was what appeared to be a firmament. Under the firmament their wings were straight, one toward another. Each of them had two wings that covered their bodies, and each one had two wings that covered one side. And I heard the sound of the wings, like the sound of many waters, like the sound of the Almighty God. When they walked, it was like the sound of a multitude, like the sound of a camp; and when they stood still, their wings were let down. For when the voice was being made above the firmament that was above their heads, they would stand and submit their wings. And above the firmament that was over their heads, there was a likeness of a throne, and above the likeness of the throne, there was a likeness as the appearance of a man from above. Wherever we would place ourselves, their wings were straight, and like the sound or voice of the exalted God, the seventy translated it. Their wings were extended and flying; and like a strong voice: which in Hebrew is called 'Almighty' (Saddai). Many things in this chapter and in other chapters have been omitted by them, which they have chosen to skip due to their length. But what we have interpreted more clearly, from one to another: each one covered their body with two wings, and the other likewise covered theirs, for which it is written in Hebrew, a man, on account of his sister, covered his body with two wings, and a man likewise covered his; therefore, after woman, man is put in the same person, so that we may not think of gender in heavenly things: since in one and the same way, according to the Hebrew usage, both man and woman are called the same. Moreover, there appears above four living creatures and as many wheels, the likeness of the firmament, which we call the sky, having the appearance of crystal, which is most pure, and is said to solidify from clean and shining waters by excessive coldness - as much as water is also constricted by frost and called κρύσταλλος in Greek. But it was fitting that in the higher things there be extraordinary purity, which protects all things, that is, rational and wise virtues, and the course of the four seasons, and the regions of the world, and the order of all things, and the preaching of the Gospel, which is understood in part and veiled in part. And the voice that is heard of flying wings, like the voice of many waters, which, according to the Apocalypse of John (Chapter XVII), signifies peoples, and gradually progresses as the voice of camps, and as the voice of the sublime God, which in Hebrew is called Saddai, and according to the Septuagint, the voice of the word; so that we may believe that the voice of the Son of God is everything that is proclaimed in the world. But while the animals were standing, their wings were lowered. For they could not bear the resonating voice of Almighty God in the heavens, but they stood and marveled; and with their silence, they demonstrated the power of God, who sat upon the firmament. The firmament below had the likeness of crystal, but the firmament above appeared like a sapphire stone. The likeness of the sapphire stone was the throne of the one who sat in the likeness of a human. From this, we understand that the firmament, crystal, sapphire, and human are shown in resemblance, not in truth. However, many testimonies teach that the human should be understood as God the Father. Among these is the parable in the Gospel: A certain man planted a vineyard and leased it to farmers (Matthew 21:33). And shortly after: He sent his servants, and above all his son. Again: A certain man made a wedding feast for his son. Not that the son is excluded from the kingdom, of which Isaiah wrote: I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne. And John said: Isaiah said these things because he saw the glory of the Son of God; but he reigns in the Father and the Son. For all the Son of the Father are, who is the image of the invisible Father God (Colossians 1:15). For also in Daniel, God the Father is portrayed sitting (Daniel 7), and the Son of man is offered to him, that he may receive the kingdom. And in the Apocalypse of John, the same things are written about the Son (Revelation 3:7). And in the battle of the first martyr Stephen, he is seen standing at the right hand of the Father. Of whom it is sung in the psalm: The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand. I will make your enemies the footstool of your feet (Psalm 110:1). Just as the most pure and shining things are shown in the heavenly bodies, which illuminate our seeing body, so in the sapphire, that is, in the throne of God, and above the firmament that we perceive as the sky, the hidden and secret and incomprehensible mysteries of God are revealed: He made darkness His hiding place (Psalm 18:11), and He is seen in the cloud and in the darkness. And in Exodus it is written: And under the feet of God there was as it were a work of sapphire stone, and as the appearance of the sky when it is most clear (Exodus 24:10). And the bride describes the beauty of the bridegroom in the Song of Songs: His belly is like a block of ivory, set on sapphire stone (Song of Songs 5:14). And in the Book of Revelation, the first foundation is jasper, the second sapphire (Revelation 21). And in the breastplate of the high priest, in the order and arrangement of each stone, the second order has carbuncle, sapphire, and jasper (Exodus 28). Concerning which we have spoken in part about the stones, in the Expositions of Isaiah.

<h2 id='tocuniq19'>(Vers. 27, 28.)</h2>

(Verse 27, 28.) And I saw something like the appearance of electrum, like the appearance of fire within it all around. From the appearance of his loins and upward, I saw something like the appearance of glowing fire all around, like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day. This was the appearance of the splendor of the Lord's glory. When I saw it, I fell facedown and heard a voice speaking. The electrum had the appearance of fire both inside and outside. But from the loins downwards, there was a shining fire all around, to show that those things which are above the loins, where the senses and reason reside, do not need fire or flames, but rather the most precious and pure metal. However, those things that are below the loins, where sexual intercourse, procreation, and the incitement of vices take place, need the purifying flames, so that when they have been purified, they may have a resemblance to a rainbow, which is commonly called Iris, when it appears in a cloud on a rainy day. For indeed the rainbow, which is called Iris in the Holy Scriptures, and in the Apocalypse of John is also called Iris (Apoc. IV), can only appear in rain and a watery cloud, of diverse and most beautiful colors, gradually transitioning into others. Hence the poet (Virgil, Aeneid IV).

Adversity brings a thousand different colors. But the same poet also follows the custom of the common people when he says: 'When he drinks, the rainbow.' From this he signifies that the rainbow never appears unless in the cloud and in the waters. This rainbow is a sign of God's mercy and covenant that he made with humans: that when it appears in the cloud, we, according to the example of antiquity, may know that we will never be destroyed by a flood (Genesis 9). From this it is shown that after punishment and punishment, and the purification of sins, there will be future mercy, only for those who deserve to see God reigning. Where it is said: Here was the appearance of splendor in a circle. In a circle of God, or of thrones, or of all things that are seen. And this is the vision of the glory of the likeness of God: not that he saw the glory of the Lord, but the likeness of his glory. And this whole vision is: a Spirit lifting up, and a great cloud, and four living creatures, and wheels following the same creatures, and the spirit, which deserve to be under the firmament of God. And after they were lifted up, and heard a voice like many waters, and like the sublime word of God, and the voice of camps and armies, they let down their wings, and showed astonishment in silence: and there appeared one sitting upon the likeness of a sapphire stone, as it were the likeness of a man that was from his loins upward, and the likeness of fire from his loins downward, and from his loins upward, as the appearance of amber. Afterwards, a sign of mercy is given to counteract this fear; just as the appearance of a rainbow when it is in the cloud on a rainy day. We have spoken at length about this vision because it is both obscure and interpreted in various ways by many. In the remaining parts, as much as possible without harming the senses, we will strive for brevity due to the large volume of the work.

<h2 id='tocuniq20'>(Chap. II.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 2, Verse 1) And I saw, and fell on my face, and heard the voice of the one speaking. The greatness of the visions did not lift me up, but the awareness of human frailty caused me to fall on my face. Therefore, even the Apostle Paul, after the ascent to heaven and paradise, and the hearing of ineffable words, says that a messenger of Satan was given to him, who would buffet him so that he would not be exalted (1 Corinthians 12). And Abraham fell on his face after hearing the words of God. And yet, because he had fallen not through sin, but through humility, he is lifted up by the Lord, and he is commanded to hear His words (Gen. 17). It must also be known that to fall on one's face is one thing, and to fall backwards is another. Abraham, after he heard of the birth of Isaac, fell on his face and laughed (1 Sam. 4). But Eli, who had sinned, fell backwards. And it is written about Dan in Genesis: Let Dan be a serpent in the way, biting the horse's heel, and let the horseman fall backwards, waiting for the salvation of God (Gen. 49:17-18). For because he had fallen from the horse by the snake's bite, therefore he awaits the coming of the Savior. And in the Gospel according to John, those who had come to apprehend the Lord, after he answered: I am, fell backward to the ground (John XVIII, 6); his words, who had said to Moses: Go, tell the children of Israel: The One who is, has sent me to you (Exodus III, 14), they could not bear.

And he said to me: Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you ((Vulg. with you)). He could not hear the word of God while lying down, but he hears with Moses: But you stand here with me (Exodus XXXIV, 2). Which Daniel also recounts happening to him (Daniel X).

<h2 id='tocuniq21'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Vers. 2.) And the Spirit entered into me after He spoke to me and set me on my feet. And I heard Him speaking to me, saying: Son of man. LXX: And the Spirit came upon me, and took me up, and raised me, and set me on my feet: and I heard Him speaking to me, and He said to me: Son of man. The divine word had commanded the prophet and had said: Stand on your feet (Psalm XXXIX, 3); but he could not stand without the help of God and the coming of the Holy Spirit: therefore, the Spirit enters into him, or assumes and raises him up, so that he may stand firmly and be able to say: He set my feet on a rock (Ephesians VI, 14). We do not read of any sinner standing, but it is said to the saints: Therefore, gird your loins. However, the sinner deserves to hear what is written in Deuteronomy: The sole of your foot shall have no steadiness  (Deut. XXVIII, 56) . It is frequently said to Ezekiel: Son of man  (Matth. VIII, 20) , and rarely to Daniel: both referring to the one who said: The Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head, He consoles the captive people, and draws them towards repentance.


<h2 id='tocuniq22'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) I send you to the children of Israel, to the apostate nations, who have turned away from me. They and their fathers have violated my covenant until this day. They are no longer called the people of God Israel, but rather the apostate nations, those who have turned away from the Lord, not only the fathers, but also the sons. It is not that the sons are guilty because of the sins of their fathers, but rather that the wickedness of both fathers and sons is equal. Furthermore, what the Septuagint translated as 'irritating me' or 'turning into bitterness' signifies that our kind and sweet God is changed into bitterness by our vices. For as it is said to the holy ones: Taste and see that the Lord is sweet (Psalm 33:9); so sinners perceive him as bitter. Therefore the Apostle refers to the goodness and severity of God towards the holy ones and sinners (Romans 21). And concerning the sinners who were lying down, it is written: The Lord raises up the fallen, the Lord loves the just, the Lord loosens the bound (Psalm 145:8). But to the holy ones who stand, he promises rewards.


<h2 id='tocuniq23'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) And they are sons with a fierce face and an untamed heart, to whom I send you. This is not found in the Septuagint. It is of great mercy to send God to such people and not to despair of their salvation; and it is prophetic confidence that he is not afraid to go to such people as well. But we must understand that with an untamed heart and a fierce face, we should accept what is said to the sinner: Your neck is an iron sinew and your forehead is bronze (Isaiah 48:6). And those who are accused of having a heart of stone in their subsequent actions, God says that He will uproot them and restore them with a heart of flesh, so that they may receive God's commands through His gentleness.

<h2 id='tocuniq24'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) And you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: If perhaps they will listen, and if perhaps they will be quiet, for the house is provoking, and they will know that there was a prophet among them. Something similar is written in Jeremiah: If perhaps they will listen and do penance. (Jer. XXVI, 3). And in the Gospel: Perhaps they will fear my son. (Matth. XXI, 37). However, God speaks these things with a doubtful emotion, to demonstrate the free will of man, so that the foreknowledge of future evil or good does not make immutable what God knows will happen. For not because he knows what is about to happen, it is necessary for us to do what he predicted: but because we are going to do it of our own free will, he knows the future like God.

<h2 id='tocuniq25'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

Verse 6: Therefore, son of man, do not fear them, nor be afraid of their words, because they are unbelievers and destroyers with you. LXX: And you, son of man, do not fear them, nor be afraid of their presence: because they are insane, and they will gather against you in a circle. Though they may have hard necks and stubborn hearts, my commandments are stronger. And do not think yourself deceived if you are sent to those who do not listen to you. Behold, I foretell to you that they will go mad, and gather together against you, and surround you, leaving you no escape. And they will do this because they are unbelievers and despise the commands of God.

And you live with scorpions. Do not fear their words, and do not fear their faces, for their house is unsettling. They are capable of striking with a curved wound, and with a stinging sting, so that the same blow may open both skin and spread venom. Each one is called by their own behavior. And to the scribes, it is said: Generation of vipers (Matthew 23:33). And of Herod, who was a fox, it is said: Go and tell that fox (Luke 13:32). And false prophets are compared to foxes in this same Prophet. And now they are said to be scorpions with an untameable heart. Hence, we read in the Gospel: All who came before me were thieves and robbers, and the sheep did not hear them (John 10:8). And how did the lost sheep of the house of Israel hear their adversaries? From this it is shown that those who hear thieves and robbers have lost the name of sheep and have taken on other names, so that they have not perished like sheep, but like vipers, foxes, and scorpions.


<h2 id='tocuniq26'>(Vers. 7, 8.)</h2>

(Vers. 7, 8.) And you shall speak my words to them: if perhaps they will hear, and be afraid, or be quiet, since they are provokers. But you, son of man, hear what I speak to you. Therefore, you must not cease, although they are wicked to whom we speak; indeed, according to the Apostle (II Tim. IV), we must preach the word of God opportune and importune, because it is possible that even a stubborn person may be corrected to gentleness, and someone who is obedient, with a change of will, may not hear.


Do not be exasperating, as the house is exasperating. Once we said to put exasperation, or irritation, seventy bitterness. Therefore, what he says is this: You should not imitate those whom you are sent to correct, lest you deserve a similar sin and punishment.

Open your mouth and eat what I give you. Be worthy, he says, to my words, and receive spiritual food, so that as it is said in the Gospel: He who has ears to hear, let him hear (Luke 8:8); and here it is said: He who has an open mouth to eat, let him eat. Hence the Lord speaks to the Psalmist: Open your mouth, and I will fill it (Psalm 81:10). And he responded: I opened my mouth and drew in the spirit (Psalm 119:131). And the Apostle Paul, who had in himself the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and in whom the Lord Christ spoke, writes to the Corinthians: My mouth is open to you, O Corinthians (2 Cor. VI, 11). And Matthew reports about the Savior: Opening his mouth, he taught the disciples (Matt. V, 2).

And I saw, and behold a hand was sent to me. For the hand that is sent, they translated it as extended in the Septuagint. It is sent and extended to those who receive blessings. But it is contracted by those to whom the prophet speaks: 'Has the hand of the Lord been shortened and contracted?' (Isaiah 50:2). And in the Psalm: 'Why do you withdraw your hand and your right hand from your bosom to the end?' (Psalm 73:11). Finally, he stretched out his wings in suffering, he received the disciples, and he carried them on his shoulders, and he spoke: 'All day long I have spread out my hands to a disobedient and opposing people' (Isaiah 65:2), to gather the children of Israel, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings. And by the stretching out of Moses' hands, Israel overcame Amalek (Exodus 17).

(Verse 9.) In which was a wrapped book, and he unfolded it before me, and it was written inside and outside: and there were written in it lamentations, and a song, and woe. And he said to me: Son of man, whatever you find, eat. Concerning the wrapped book, the seventy chapters of the book were translated. In the hand of the Lord sitting on the throne, which was sent and extended. Concerning which it is also said in the Psalms: In the chapter of the book it is written about me (Psalm 39:8). Chapter, let us understand the beginning. This book was wrapped and sealed, written inside and outside, or before and after, of such difficulty that no one was able to open and read it, neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor underneath the earth, except the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David and Jesse, whom John in the Apocalypse said devoured it (Rev. 5), not whole, but in a chapter, that is, in the beginning. For it is impossible for human nature to devour the entire treasure of this book. And He unfolded it before the prophet, and He made it available to be read and understood, who is said to be marked in Isaiah as belonging to the people who do not believe (Isa. XXIX). For even to this day the veil is placed upon the Jews in the old Testament. And it was written before and after; concerning things to come and concerning things past. Truly, outwardly in historical writing, but inwardly in spiritual understanding, of which the Psalmist says: The glory of the king's daughter is from within (Psal. XLIV, 14). And there were written in it both inward and outward lamentations, and song, and woe. Lamentations, concerning those who are called to penance, just as Samuel and the Apostle Paul mourned and lamented for Saul and the Corinthians, whom they desired to save (2 Chronicles 16; 2 Corinthians 12). Song about those who are worthy of God's testimony, and whom the Psalmist commands: Sing to the Lord a new song (Psalm 95 and 97, verse 1). Furthermore, woe to those who have completely despaired and, when they come into the depths of sin, they scorn (Prov. XVIII).

<h2 id='tocuniq28'>(Chap. III.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter III, Verse 1) Eat this scroll, and go to the sons of Israel. Unless we eat the open scroll beforehand, we cannot teach the sons of Israel. Finally, even David, after he obtained mercy, said: I will teach the wicked your ways, and the impious will turn to you (Psalm 50:15).

<h2 id='tocuniq29'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Verse 2.) And I opened my mouth, and he fed me with that scroll. And he said to me: Son of man. I, he said, opened my mouth, because I was told: Open your mouth, and eat. And, with my mouth open, the Lord bestowed food; so that the beginnings of the will are in us, and we attain the perfection of blessedness from the Lord. For it is not of the one willing, nor of the one running, but of the merciful God (Rom. IX, 16). However, both to will and to run is of our own free will. For He opened, they translated it as 'opened,' so that God may be understood, because He Himself both opened the mouth of the prophet and fed him.

<h2 id='tocuniq30'>(Vers 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) Your stomach will eat; and your bowels will be filled with that volume which I give to you. LXX: Your mouth will eat, and your stomach will be filled with that chapter given to you. The beginning of the reading, and of a simple story, is the essence of this volume. But when we have stored the book of the Lord in the treasure of our memory through constant meditation, our spiritual stomach is filled, and our bowels are satisfied, so that we may have, with the Apostle Paul, the bowels of mercy (Colossians 3), and that stomach may be filled of which Jeremiah speaks: My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart: my heart maketh a noise in me (Jeremiah 4).


And I ate it, and it was in my mouth like sweet honey. David also speaks: How sweet are your words to my throat, sweeter than honey to my mouth (Psalm 118:103). And elsewhere: The judgments of the Lord are true, desirable more than gold and many precious stones; and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb (Psalm 19:10, 11). And Samson found honeycomb in the mouth of a lion (Judges 14); and after the resurrection, the Lord ate a piece of fish and honeycomb (Luke 24). And in Proverbs it is said about the bee, although there are no Hebrew examples of this: Go to the bee, and learn how diligent she is and how she makes her work clean: by whose labors kings and ignorant people abuse their health (Prov. 6:8, LXX version): just as Moses and the prophets, and the evangelists and the apostles did; so that whoever becomes a king, whose heart is in the hand of God, may enjoy sweet foods. But whoever is simple and without the cunning of the serpent has the innocence of doves, let them believe in simple faith and be saved: because there are snares everywhere, and often the Devil disguises himself as an angel of light (2 Cor. 2): and honey drips from the lips of a prostituted woman, promising sweetness but spreading poison (Prov. 5).


<h2 id='tocuniq31'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(V. 5) And he said to me: Son of man, go and enter (in Vulg. there is no 'and enter') the house of Israel, and speak my words to them. It is said to him: Go and enter the house of Israel, it is shown that he was not with the sinful people; although he seemed to dwell in the same place along the banks of the river Chebar. For it is written: And I was in the midst of the exile next to the river Chebar. Indeed, the prophet's conversation was separate, and he was offended by the sight of the wicked. Moses also did this (Exod. 33), setting up the tabernacle far away from the camp: and when he entered, the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the entrance of the tabernacle.

<h2 id='tocuniq32'>(Vers. 5, 6.)</h2>

(Verse 5, 6.) For you are not being sent to the people of deep and difficult (unknown in the Vulgate) language, to the house of Israel, nor to many people of unknown language, whose language you cannot understand. And if I were to send you to them, they would listen to you. Because they do not want to come to you, you go to them. For they do not have a need for a healthy doctor, but for ones who are sick (Luke 5:31 ). Nor can you say: I cannot speak to them, because they speak a different language, and we are barbarians to each other, and we cannot understand each other's speech. What shall I speak of one people? If I were to send you to different nations, nevertheless my authority and power would conquer all difficulty. And if only the time were approaching, when I am going to send my apostles to all nations, to give thanks for the languages, so that they may preach and bring the whole world under my yoke with one faith and that the diversity of languages may be subordinate to me; it would be easier for those who are deep and high in speech to hear, and they would have nothing of the levity of the Jews, but they enter with a slow and steady step, and although the languages are unknown, the faith is familiar. And it is followed by: And if I were to send you to them, they would listen to you. Finally, he sent and all believed at the same time. Hence Paul and Barnabas speak to the Jews: It was necessary for the word of God to be preached to you, but since you did not want to receive the message, behold, we turn to the Gentiles (Acts 13:46). And concerning the centurion, it is said: I have not found such great faith in Israel (Matthew 8:10).

<h2 id='tocuniq33'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) But the house of Israel does not want to listen to you, because they do not want to listen to me. For the entire house of Israel is stubborn and hard-hearted. Do not be dismayed, he says, if they do not want to listen to you. For this reason, they will not listen to you: because they will despise listening to me: as the Savior also said:  Whoever does not receive you, does not receive me  (Ibid., X, 40) . In which it is clearly shown that there is free will. And two reasons are given why they do not listen: because they are perverse in their will, and stubborn-hearted, or, as the Septuagint translates, they are contentious: and it is understood that often, when called to salvation, they did not want to listen.


<h2 id='tocuniq34'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Verse 8, 9.) Behold, I have made your face stronger than their faces, and your forehead harder than their foreheads. I have made your face like diamond and flint. Do not fear them or be afraid of their presence, for they are a rebellious house." And He said to me, "The house of Israel has a stubborn and defiant forehead, and their heart is as hard as scorpions. Therefore, I have given you an extremely firm countenance and a forehead that cannot be ashamed. From this, we learn that sometimes it is a grace of God to resist impudence, and when circumstances demand it, to confront face-to-face. This, however, is attributed so that our modesty and human decency do not fear the snares of adversaries.

<h2 id='tocuniq35'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Ver. 10.) Son of man, take all my words that I speak to you, and assume them in your heart, and listen with your ears. This is the food of the book, and these are the words by which it speaks to different listeners, either with lamentations, or with a song, or with a woe to mankind. And yet it should be noted that before the words of God are to be composed, heard, and understood in our hearts more diligently, and thus proclaimed to the people.

<h2 id='tocuniq36'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) Go, enter into the exile (or captivity), to the sons of your people, and speak to them, and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: perhaps they will listen and be still. And our Lord came to the people of the Jews, sent by the Father, to proclaim remission to the captives, and to fulfill what is written: Ascending on high, he led captivity captive: he gave gifts to men (Psalm 67:19).


<h2 id='tocuniq37'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12). And the spirit took me, and I heard behind me a voice of a great commotion: Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place. The God of whom it is written: The Lord lifts up the meek (Psalm 146:6), he Himself lifted up the prophet, who was not in the flesh but in the spirit, and walking in the spirit, he did not fulfill the works of the flesh; for the Spirit of God was in him. Therefore, despising earthly things, he is caught up by the spirit and hears behind him the voice of a great commotion, forgetting the past and extending himself into the future, leaving the snares of his enemies behind him. We read about this in Exodus (Exod. XXIV) when Pharaoh and all his army pursued Israel, and the angel in the pillar of cloud left the front of the camp; and he came behind them, and stood all night between Israel and the Egyptians: so as to frighten the enemies, and the Israelites might hear: Blessed be the glory of the Lord who came from his place. But the place of the Lord is wherever he finds hospitality. Or rather, the Son is the place of the Father, just as the Father is the place of the Son, as the Lord and Savior says: I am in the Father, and the Father is in me (Joan. XIV, 11). This same thing also signifies Michael: Behold, the Lord shall come forth out of his place, and will come down upon the high places of the earth. And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys shall be as wax melting before the fire, and as waters that run down into a steep place (Mich. I, 3, 4). For when the Lord, the Savior, came down and set forth from the Father, the high places of the earth and the mountains were moved, and the lower parts of the valleys were melted. The place can be the glory of the Lord and the inaccessible light, of which the Apostle speaks: Who alone has immortality and inhabits unapproachable light (I Tim. VI, 16). When we recall the past judgments of the Lord, we hear the voice of a great upheaval from behind. When we ponder the future in our hearts, a voice is heard from what came before, and from what is to come.

<h2 id='tocuniq38'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) And the sound of the wings of the living creatures striking against one another, and the sound of the wheels following the creatures, and the sound of a great commotion. Because it is understood, 'I heard behind me the sound of a great commotion, and I heard the sound of the wings of the living creatures, and the sound of the wheels,' the Septuagint added: 'And I saw the sound of the wings of the living creatures striking against one another,' and the rest according to what is written in Exodus: 'And all the people saw the voice of God' (Exodus 20:18): so that the prophet may have heard the voice that was coming from behind, and seen what was before him. But it is better and truer to have understood a heard voice rather than a seen one, as well as the striking of wings against each other and the sound of wheels, which we mentioned above, and the great commotion which showed that God's wrath was going to come upon the people of Israel.

Ver. 14. The Spirit also lifted me up, and took me away, and I went embittered in the indignation of my spirit. LXX: And the spirit lifted me up, and took me, and I went up in the impetuosity of my spirit. After being lifted up by the spirit, and taken by it, then he went in the indignation and bitterness of his spirit, understanding the indignation of God, and what the vision signified, pondering in his mind. Whether he was carried up on the heights by the impetuosity of his own spirit, desiring to go where the Lord commanded. But by 'his spirit' we understand not the Holy Spirit, but the spirit of man, of which it is said in many places, as in Isaiah: At night my spirit rises within me, O God (Isa. XXVI, 9). And the prophet is transported (not, as some think, in spirit, but) in his own body, as we read of Habakkuk according to Theodotion (Dan. XIV).

<h2 id='tocuniq39'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15) For the hand of the Lord was with me, strengthening me. And I came to the exile at the heap of new fruits, to those who lived by the river Chebar. And I sat where they sat, and I stayed there for seven days mourning among them. LXX: And the hand of the Lord became strong upon me, and I entered into captivity exalted. And I went around the inhabitants of the river Chebar who were there, and I sat there for seven days dwelling among them. For the sense in which we translate, the translators Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion used the Hebrew words Thel Abib (): which the Seventy translated as sublime and I went around; believing it better to say something than to impose something that would cause the reader to question. However, we have learned from the Hebrews that Thel abib means, when new grains or barley are gathered, and after hunger and scarcity, before they are ground in the barn, they promise some hope of food. So too is Israel small and humble, who dwelt on the banks of the river Chobar, like one revived and rising from the earth, promising the seed of the Jewish people. But the hand of the Lord is upon the prophet, strengthening him, so that he may receive the name of a watchman, and teach what he has learned. And for seven days he moves among them, seeing all that they do, so that afterwards he may know what he should reprove. Yet he mourns, or dwells among them, seeing their wickedness, and the just judgment of God for the iniquity of their sins. For because we have said, grieving, and it is written in Hebrew Masmim (), Theodotion translated, marveling, in order to express the astonishment of the Prophets who saw their iniquities. But the second edition of Aquila, which the Hebrews call 'according to accuracy,' translated: being calm, that is, quiet, and being separate, to show that he was indeed among the captives, but separated from them in mind.

<h2 id='tocuniq40'>(Vers. 16, 17.)</h2>

(Verse 16, 17.) But after seven days, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel, and you will hear a word from my mouth and will declare it to them from me. The watchman, who is to be the messenger of God's words to the people, must rest for a long time and be sorrowful for the things he sees. And he must have no personal guilt for the sins he will rebuke in others.

<h2 id='tocuniq41'>(Vers. 18, 19.)</h2>

(Verse 18, 19.) If I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn him or speak out to warn him from his wicked way that he may live, that wicked person shall die for his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul. There are two wicked or iniquitous persons, as the Septuagint has translated. One who hears nothing as a viewer, and dies in his impiety; whose blood is sought by the hands of the viewer. Another, to whom the viewer announces, and he, despising to hear, dies due to his own fault: in such a way that the viewer is innocent of the fault. From which we understand that the Lord threatens the impious one, and says: 'You will die by death', so that he may turn away from his impious way, and live. For the threat is not against humans, but against sins, and not against those who turn away from vices, but against those who persist in sin. And there is a great danger in keeping silent on the words of God for three reasons: either out of fear, or out of laziness, or out of flattery. Hence Isaiah says: Woe is me, for I have kept silent (Isaiah 6:5). And what follows, You have freed your soul, signifies the same as the saying of the Apostle: If anyone's work burns, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire (1 Corinthians 3:14), so as to prove whether an external observer was the cause of his death or whether he was guilty. For the work of the master is the well-being of the disciple.

<h2 id='tocuniq42'>(Vers. 20, 21.)</h2>

(Verse 20, 21.) But even if a righteous person turns away from their righteousness and commits iniquity, I will set a stumbling block before them. They shall die because you did not warn them; in their sin they shall die, and their righteous deeds shall not be remembered; but I will require their blood from your hand. However, if you warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin, they shall surely live because you warned them, and you have saved your own soul. Just as we read about two wicked or unjust individuals: One, who did not hear, and perished; the other, who heard and persisted in wickedness: so there are two righteous individuals, one who did not hear and perished; the other who heard and turned to repentance, saved his soul. It should be noted that a righteous person can fall; and if he has a teacher, he can be converted to better things. And therefore, good works require a constant teacher, so that a slip does not cause him to step back from the best path. And indeed the wicked, or the unjust if they have not converted, will die in their wickedness and injustice. But if the just commit impiety and sin, they do not immediately die; but a stumbling block or torment is set before them, as Theodotius said, an infirmity, so that they may be tormented and not find a straight path, and understand themselves to be weak, of whom the Apostle also says: Therefore many are weak and sleep among you (I Corinthians 11:30). For it is advantageous for the just to understand their own transgression and the torment of their conscience, and to say with the Psalmist: I am turned in my sorrow while the thorn is fastened on me (Psalm 31:4). And just as the wickedness of the impious is not obvious if they turn away from their wicked ways and live, so the ancient virtues do not benefit the just if they are oppressed by new crimes. But what has been brought upon oneself: He will die, because you did not announce to him, it is understood, that he could have lived if the watcher and teacher had instructed him.

<h2 id='tocuniq43'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) And there, the hand of the Lord came upon me and He said to me: rise up, go out into the field, and there I will speak with you. This phrase, \"there,\" which we have translated from the Hebrew and is not found in the Septuagint, is intentionally placed and undoubtedly signifies a specific location. For earlier we read: And I came to the captivity at Tel-abib, to those who dwelt near the river Chebar (Ezekiel 3:15). And rightly so, the one to whom he spoke, sat down, is commanded to rise up. And he who had entered into transmigration hears, 'Go forth, not into rugged valleys, not onto steep cliffs, but into the width of the fields that can contain the glory of the Lord.' Hence it is also said to the Corinthians: 'Be enlarged' (1 Corinthians 6:13). When he enters to capture the captives, of whom it is said that they are insane and persecute him, perhaps he needs a strong hand in order to resist and endure the fury of those who pursue him. But when he goes forth into the field, surely the hand of the Lord is upon him: for without his help he could not go forth, but strength is not added. For he goes out to see the glory of God, not to fight. And it should be noted that while sitting among the captives, the Prophet himself did not see the glory of the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq44'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23.) And I arose ((Vulg. arose)) and went out into the field, and behold there the glory of the Lord was standing, as the glory that I saw by the river Chobar. At the Lord's command, it enters and at the Lord's command, it goes out, and it sits among those who sit; for those who stand could not hear him. And going out into the width of the field, he saw the standing glory of the Lord, which he had seen before walking and lifting itself up, and sometimes standing. Because next to the river of this age, called Chobar, which can be interpreted as very serious, glory was seen: which signifies that all the glory of this world overflows and does not have a stable position. But the standing and enduring glory of the Lord, when seen with the standing Prophet in the field, could not stand nor be seen amidst the captives.

<h2 id='tocuniq45'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24.) And I fell upon my face, and the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet: and he spoke to me, and said to me: Go in, and shut thyself up in the midst of thy house. Unable to bear the weight of the glory of the Lord standing, he fell on his face, so that he could be lifted up by the entering spirit. The spirit stood him upon his feet, and spoke to him, saying: Enter and shut thyself up in the midst of thy house. And this is the meaning: Because you have been strengthened by the vision of the Lord's majesty, you should not fear anyone or be afraid of anything; but rather return to your home or tend to the needs of the body, as some think, or as a sign of the future siege. And just as Isaiah, barefoot and naked (Isaiah 20), proclaimed the captivity of three years and the nakedness of the people, so you, confined to your home, by the action itself, foretell the imminent siege of the city of Jerusalem.


<h2 id='tocuniq46'>(Vers. 25, 26.)</h2>

(Verse 25, 26.) And you, son of man: behold, chains have been placed upon you, and they will bind you with them, and you shall not go out from among them, and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth (or throat), and you shall be mute, not speaking as a man who reproaches them: for the house is rebellious. What is enclosed in a house, what is bound with chains, what does not go out to those among whom it dwells, but suffers the solitude of a prison among a multitude of captives, is a sign of siege, as I have said before, that Jerusalem, closed and surrounded by the army of the Chaldeans, will not allow any of its inhabitants to go out. This is the pot about which Jeremiah speaks (Jeremiah I), and he himself as the Prophet in the following words; in which the flesh of the people is consumed. That the language of the Prophet cleaves to the palate or throat and becomes mute is not the result of a reproachful authority, but has a clear cause: for he says, the house is provoking. And the meaning is: They are of such bitterness, and of such contention against God, that they do not deserve to hear the reproacher. From this it is clear that where there is a multitude of sins, sinners are unworthy to correct those who are corrected by the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq47'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Let him who hears, hear; and let him who remains quiet, remain quiet; for the house is rebellious. What we read in Ecclesiastes: A time to be silent, and a time to speak (Ecclesiastes 3), is also supported in prophetic speech: that it is wise to both be silent and speak in due time, and to give food to our fellow servants at the appointed time. Therefore, Isaiah also said to the unbelieving people: I kept silent, will I always be silent? says the Lord (Isaiah 65). Therefore, he who kept his mouth closed for a long time due to the multitude of sins, because he saw that some could be converted, about whom it was said: Let him who has ears to hear, hear; and let him who is at peace with evil, be at peace; and let him cease: therefore, speaking with an open mouth, not by his own will, but by the command of the Lord, he speaks to the people. However, this is what we have set forth: Let him who has ears to hear, hear; and let him who is at peace, be at peace; for which the Septuagint translates: Let him who has ears to hear, hear; and let him who is unbelieving, be unbelieving; the second edition by Aquila translated it as follows: Let him who has ears to hear, be heard; and let him who leaves, be left. And he said: To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to them that are without, all things are done in parables. (Mark 4:11)

<h2 id='tocuniq48'>(Chap. IV.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 4, Verses 1-2.) And you, son of man, take a brick for yourself and set it before you, and portray on it the city of Jerusalem. Build siege works against it, build a siege mound against it, raise a ramp against it, set up camps against it, and place battering rams against it all around. As we have said before, go inside and enclose it in the midst of your house; and behold, ropes will be put on you, and you will be bound, and you shall not go out. This is a symbolic representation of the prophet's future siege of the city of Jerusalem. Now he is commanded to use geometric art to depict it on a brick, and to place that brick in front of the prophet. After he has portrayed Jerusalem with dust, he is to depict the entire siege against it, representing the fortifications, the raised mound, the encircling army, and the battering rams, all of which are typical in capturing cities. Fortifications are called the things by which a city is enclosed, so that none of the besieged can escape: mounds are brought together by which ramparts and ditches are filled; camps are the guards of soldiers in a circuit; battering rams are those by which the foundations of walls are shaken, and the joining of stones is dissolved. However, this is said in order to signify the neighboring captivity of the city of Jerusalem under Zedekiah: in the eleventh year of which both the king and the city were captured. On the side, which is called in Greek the feminine gender ἡ πλίνθος, Symmachus has more clearly interpreted it as πλίνθιον, which we can call a brick and a tile. In whose dust geometers are accustomed to draw lines, that is, lines and rays. From which some wish, not unreasonably, also to have knowledge of this doctrine (replicating those examples, that Joshua son of Nun sent explorers, who described the land (Joshua 2), which is properly called Geometry: and the Angel in Zechariah had a Geometric cord to measure Jerusalem (Zechariah 2). And what the Prophet now commands to describe in the dust (which is properly called scenography) we can take as a brick and as a stroke of the Israelites, which served Pharaoh in mud and clay (Exodus 1). Or suppose that the city, which they thought was strong and impregnable, is compared to a very fragile wall, which immediately dissolves upon contact with water, as was previously stated: is the hardest rock or a deserted mountain turned into a brick, which is corrupted by the Babylonian flood; according to what is written: Therefore, the Lord will bring upon you many and strong waters, the king of Assyria.


<h2 id='tocuniq49'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Ver. 3.) And you shall take for yourself an iron pan: and you shall place it as an iron wall between you and the city, and you shall set your face against it, and it shall be for a siege, and you shall surround it. This is a sign for the house of Israel. What we previously said, both the prophet himself and the description of the side, the fortifications, the rampart, and the battering rams surrounding (or surrounding), as a sign before the siege of Jerusalem, is now stated more clearly, after many things that are in the middle: The sign for the house of Israel is an iron pan, which is placed as a wall between the prophet and the city, demonstrating the great wrath of God, which shall not be tired by any prayers, nor be inclined to mercy. For just as iron tames all metals and there is nothing harder than it, so the incredible crimes of Jerusalem, by their own fault, made the gentle nature of God to be the harshest. The frying pan is also said to be a wall placed in the middle between the people and God, so as to show that the whole multitude is to be broken in a short time and reduced to nothing. However, the sternness of the face towards the city is an indication of severity, according to what we read elsewhere: The face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth (Psalm 34:16).


<h2 id='tocuniq50'>(Vers. 4 seqq.)</h2>

(Ver. 4 seqq.) And you shall lie on your left side, and you shall bear the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number of days that you lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity. For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of days, three hundred and ninety days; so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. And when you have completed these, you shall lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have given you one day for a year, I say, one day for a year. Let us consider the 390 years that are counted as the same number of days, during which the prophet lay bound and constrained on his left side; so that he did not turn to his other side, showing the captivity and miseries of the ten tribes, that is, the Israelites. And as for the other forty years, in which he lay on his right side for the sins of Judah, or as the holy Scripture narrates, slept, it must be said about Israel that under King Pekah, the son of Remaliah, who reigned in Israel for twenty years, Tiglath-pileser, the king of Assyria (2 Kings 15), came and captured Aijon, Abel, the house of Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee, and all the land of Naphtali, and took them into Assyria. After whom, Osee, the son of Ela, reigned for nine years in Israel, and he was captured with all of Samaria by Salmanassar, king of the Assyrians, and he was transported to Elam and the rivers of Abor and Gozam in the cities of the Medes. But in the sixth year of the reign of Ezechias, as the holy history of the Kings relates, Osee was captured. From this, if we calculate in order, how many years Israel was in distress and oppressed by the yoke of captivity, we can find out. From the sixth year to the twenty-ninth year (for Hezekiah reigned for twenty-four years) a total of twenty-four years are counted: after him came Manasseh, and he reigned for fifty-five years. After him, Amon reigned for two years. After him, Josiah reigned for thirty-two years. After him, Joakim, also called Eliakim, reigned for eleven years. After him, Jeconiah, also known as Jehoiachin, who was immediately led into captivity, reigned for eleven years, and for him, Zedekiah reigned for eleven years, during whose reign Jerusalem was captured and the temple destroyed. Therefore, from the first captivity of Israel, which occurred under King Pekah until the eleventh year of Zedekiah, when the Temple was desolated, there were 164 (or 174 according to some) years. From the second captivity, when Hoshea was captured and all of Samaria was destroyed, there were 135 (or 80 according to some) years. And the years of the desolation of the Temple were 70, added to the first captivity, making a total of 234 years. For in the second year of the reign of Darius, king of the Persians, the temple was built by Zerubbabel, the son of Salathiel, and by Jesus, the son of Josedech, while Haggai and Zechariah were prophesying. Darius reigned for thirty-six years, and after his death, thirty-five years were added. After him, Xerxes, the son of Darius, reigned for twenty years. After him, Artabanus reigned for seven months. And Xerxes, who was also known as Macrobiochus, reigned for forty years. After him, Xerxes reigned for two months, and Sogdianus reigned for seven months (or four, according to some). After him, Darius, nicknamed Νόθος, reigned for nineteen years. After him, Artaxerxes, nicknamed Μνήμων (also known as Memnon), son of Darius and Parisatis, reigned for forty years. He is called Assuerus by the Hebrews. During his reign, the story of Mordecai and Esther is told (Esther VIII), when the entire Jewish people were saved from the danger of death and regained their freedom. From the second year of Darius to the final year of Assuerus, there are a hundred and fifty-five years and four months. In the last 234 years that have been added to the previous ones, they make 389 years and 4 months. However, the death on the right side, that is, the 40 years, can be easily calculated. For after Eliakim, who was also called Joachim, his son Joachin, also known as Jechonias, reigned for three months. During his reign, the servants of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up to Jerusalem, and it was surrounded by fortifications. Then King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to the city, while his servants were besieging it. And Joachin, the king of Judah, went out to the king of Babylon, along with his mother, his servants, his princes, his eunuchs. And the king of Babylon received him in the eighth year of his reign and brought out all the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the royal house. And after a little while, he carried away all of Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, ten thousand into captivity, and every craftsman and smith. And nothing was left except for the poor of the land (Ibid.) . After capturing it with an infinite multitude of people, and with all the resources of Jerusalem, Zedekiah ruled for eleven years: under him the city was captured and the temple was destroyed. Its desolation lasted until the second year of Darius, seventy years in total. In the thirtieth year of the desolation of the temple, Cyrus ruled in Persia, after overthrowing King Astyages of the Medes. In accordance with the prophecy of Isaiah (Isaiah 45), he sent back almost fifty thousand men from the tribe of Judah to Jerusalem, along with the temple vessels that Nebuchadnezzar had taken away, and other things that are narrated in the history of Ezra (3 Ezra 1). So just as in Israel, that is, the ten tribes under King Phacee of Israel, under whom Salmanasar devastated the Israelite people greatly, we count three hundred and ninety years until the fortieth year of Assuerus, when the persecution of all the Jewish people was mitigated; so from the first year of Jechoniah, when a large part of Jerusalem was transferred to Babylon, until the first year of Cyrus, king of the Persians, which was the thirtieth year of the desolation of the temple, forty years are counted, under which the captivity of the Jews was loosened and freedom was restored to the people. Around 390 years after the Israelites and 40 years after the joining of the Jews, making a total of 430 years, they wish to be fulfilled by the baptism of the Savior until the end of the world. However, others, especially the Jews, want to be reckoned in tribulation, distress, and the yoke of captivity of the people from the second year of Vespasian when Jerusalem was captured by the Romans and the temple was destroyed, for a total of 430 years. And thus, the people will return to their former state, just as the children of Israel were in Egypt for 430 years. And it is written in Exodus: Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. And again: It came to pass after four hundred and thirty years, all the armies of the Lord went out by night. And I am quite amazed why the Vulgate manuscripts have ninety hundred years, and in some it is written one hundred and fifty, when clearly the Hebrew, Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotian versions hold three hundred and ninety years; and among them the Septuagint, which, however, is not corrupted by the fault of the scribes, has the same number. We believe that the most difficult question, and dare I say arrogantly, not explained by anyone, has been made known not so much by our knowledge but by the grace of the Lord, fulfilling what He Himself promised: Seek, and ye shall find; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you (Matthew 7:7). But whoever wishes to calculate from the first captivity, which took place under Manahen the son of Gaddi, king of Israel, who reigned in Samaria for ten years (2 Kings 15); when Phul, the king of the Assyrians, came into the land of Israel and took a thousand talents of silver; and after him, two years later, Phacce, who reigned in Israel, will find that three hundred and ninety years were completed in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of King Assuerus, when the history of Esther is said to have taken place, which is also more credible. For Israel, not after the reign of Assuerus had ended, but while he still reigned, cast off the yoke of a most grievous servitude.

<h2 id='tocuniq51'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) And you shall turn your face towards the siege of Jerusalem, and your arm shall be extended, and you shall prophesy against it. LXX: And you shall set your face towards the siege of Jerusalem, and you shall strengthen your arm, and you shall prophesy over it. Preparation of countenance is necessary, as well as strength, and the confirmation of the extended and exposed arm, so that not only by voice, but also by gesture and appearance of a prophet, the siege of the city may be demonstrated.


<h2 id='tocuniq52'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) Behold, I have surrounded you with chains, and you will not turn from one side to the other, until the days of your siege (or conclusion) are completed. The left side, because it was without a temple and knowledge of God, is assigned to the Israelites; the right side, to the Jews, in whom (or where) the worship and religion of God reside. And it should be noted that in one side there is punishment for sinners, and in the other, exercise of virtue. He does not turn from one side to the other, so that no respite from torment is indicated, until the perfect conclusion of the aforementioned days is reached. The day of the prophets is like a year for those who are patient (Gen. XXIX). And the years that Laban thought were few days for Jacob. Not only in punishments is there diversity according to the variety of merits, but also in the retribution of good things, the lambs are on the right, and the kids are on the left. Therefore, it is also written in another place: The heart of the wise is on the right, but the heart of the fool is on the left (Ecclus. X, 1). There are other bonds of the Lord by which we are bound for salvation; there are also the devil's bonds, by which he had bound the woman for eighteen years in the Gospel (Luke XIII). Wherefore each one is bound with the cords of his own sins (Prov. V, 22). Which the Lord looses through the raising of Lazarus, who lay bound with bandages and graveclothes in the tomb (John XI).

<h2 id='tocuniq53'>(Vers. 9 seqq.)</h2>

(Vrs. 9 ff.) And you will take for yourself wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt; and you will put them into one vessel, and you will make for yourself breads according to the number of days on which you will sleep on your side: three hundred and ninety days you will eat it. But your food that you will eat will be in the weight of twenty shekels a day: from time to time you will eat it. And you will drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin; from time to time you will drink it. And you shall eat it as barely bread, and cover it with human excrement in their sight. What vice we have interpreted as, which in Hebrew is called Chasamim (): The Seventy and Theodotion placed ὄλυραν, which some interpret as oats, others as millet. But the first edition of Aquila and Symmachus interpreted it as ζέας, or ζείας: which we call either far or spelt in the native language of Italy and Pannonia. They also added pottery to the vase, but the prophet orders a future famine and demonstrates the shortage of the people of Israel. Just as in a scarcity of all things, different types of food and delicacies are not sought after; but rather how the stomach can be filled: thus the prophet now puts wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and oats into one vessel, and makes three hundred and ninety loaves of bread, which will be eaten each day: these loaves weigh twenty sicles, that is, staters. However, a siclus, that is, a stater, has four drachmas. And eight drachmas make one Latin ounce: so that one loaf of bread is said to have ten ounces, by which the soul is more drawn than sustained. The sterility of food is increased by the sterility of water. For it is commanded to drink the sixth part of the Hebrew measure, which is called hin, each day. Furthermore, two chœnixes Attic make one hin: which we can call two Italian sextarii, so that the hin is the measure of the Jewish sextarius and our military, the sixth part of which makes a third part of the Italian sextarius. Food and drink, according to the famous Speaker, not only give strength but also prevent death. What he says, 'From time to time you will eat or drink,' means from evening to evening, although some may mistakenly understand it as from year to year. And these loaves are made like barley bread made with ashes. And it is said to him, that he cover them with human dung, not for those who will eat them (ignorance is accustomed to temper miseries) but for those who see, and in their eyes, to experience horror before enduring nausea. It is also to be noted that, according to the number of days of the left side, three hundred and ninety sub-cinereous loaves are to be made and eaten each day, and there is to be no mention at all of the forty loaves of the right side; so that the holy Scripture may secretly hint that the punishment of the people who have sinned is not the same if they have knowledge of God and of him who has completely departed from the true religion. Furthermore, we can also say, according to spiritual understanding, that the Jewish people, after offending God, still eat sub-cinereous loaves mixed with wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and oats; of which one is the food of men and the other is the food of animals. For in that which they appear to believe in one God, they have something of grain. But what they deny the Son, they are sustained by the barley of animals and beans, by which the stomach of those who eat is inflated, and the mind is said to be oppressed: so much so that even to Pythagoreans, the food is detestable. Because of lentils, Esau lost his birthright (Gen. 25). Millet is the food of peasants, and of wild animals, and of birds. Oats, or vetches and alsike clover, are the food of dumb animals. But what is written, according to the Septuagint, that Elijah fleeing from Jezebel found bread ὀλυρίτην, made of ashes (3 Kings 19), is a sign of persecution and scarcity. Therefore, he is also fed by the ravens, so that because he did not find food in Israel, he would be nourished by unclean foods from the nations. The law itself, which they read but do not understand, is bread made of ashes and covered with human excrement. Therefore, the apostle Paul also says that he considered the gains of the Law and the observance of the former ceremonies as dung, in order to gain Christ (Philippians 3).


<h2 id='tocuniq54'>(Vers. 13 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 13 and following) And the Lord said: Thus will the sons of Israel eat their polluted bread among the nations to which I will drive them out. And I said, ah, ah, ah, O Lord God: Behold, my soul is not polluted, and I have not eaten carrion or torn flesh from beasts from my youth until now, and all unclean flesh has not entered into my mouth. And he said to me: Behold, I have given you cow dung instead of human dung, and you shall make your bread with it. According to the book of Zachariah (Zech. III), prophets are seen as portentous men who foretell the future through their works and are spoken of by God. We frequently read throughout the Bible that prophets are compared to God's hands (Hosea XII, 10). As we see in many instances, just as Ezekiel ate bread in dung, the children of Israel, or the entire population of Judah, or as some believe, the ten tribes, will eat polluted bread among the nations. This is not a threat to those who have already been expelled but to those who will be expelled from the promised land. When the Prophet learned this, he strongly condemned it according to Aquila, ah, ah, ah. But according to Symmachus and the Septuagint, he responded by saying 'μηδαμῶς', which means ' by no means' in Latin. For which Theodotion translated: 'O Lord God'. We should not think that he contradicts the command of the Lord, but rather that he gives reasons and even begs why he cannot do this. Finally, he obtained what he asked for, and the severity of the sentence was tempered by a milder command. It is asked why Ezekiel refused easier things: and why Hosea was immediately joined to a prostitute without objection or response, saying that he keeps his body chaste and should not be defiled by the touch of a harlot, as the Apostle says: 'Whoever is joined to a harlot becomes one body with her' (I Cor. VI, 16). From which it is shown that the figure of the Synagogue or Church was not truly accomplished according to the letter: which we have explained more fully in our exposition of the prophet. Morticinium is said to be the taking of life without the shedding of blood, and in which the soul dies, torn by beasts, which is called θηριάλωτον in Greek. But as for the filth granted to human excrement, which is called dung, lighter evils are signified: for indeed they are commanded to eat bread cooked in ox dung; but it is far from uncleanness of human excrement: and even today among the Jewish people this opinion is preserved, that they do not eat their bread in human excrement. For they do not serve idols, nor do they worship the various wonders of demons; but they work for the flesh and stomach, and the goods of this earth, as it is said: 'He who does these things shall live by them' (Leviticus 18:5; Deuteronomy 4). But we disdain earthly things, and not only do we trample on the food of human waste, and consider earthly pleasures to be worthless, but we eat the bread that descends from heaven (John 6), and we enjoy that food of which the Psalmist sings: 'Man ate the bread of angels' (Psalm 78:25); living not on the flesh of the Egyptians, but on the thinness of manna.


<h2 id='tocuniq55'>(Vers. 16, 17.)</h2>

(Verse 16, 17.) And he said to me: Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and they shall drink water by measure and with dismay; so that when bread and water are lacking, each one shall stumble to his brother, and they shall waste away in their iniquities. The Hebrew word Mate () is interpreted as staff in the first edition of Aquila, and as firmament in the second edition and by Symmachus and Theodotion. But what he had shown through his work, he also demonstrates through his speech, and the silence of both the left and right sides, and the ash bread mixed with the six varieties of spices, signifying the evils of the world, he points to the fact that a famine of food and an incredible shortage of water will occur in Jerusalem, so that everyone will fall to their brother, hoping for help from another, which they do not foresee in themselves. For it is the nature of humans, when pressed by evils and the weight of distress, to have more confidence in what is close at hand than in themselves: and they waste away in their iniquities, while suffering everything because of their iniquities. And I fear lest this breaking of bread may also be found in our Jerusalem, in which the vision of peace is seen, which the Lord crushes when he is angry, and judges us unworthy of his bread. And if only we could at least merit to receive him with weight and solicitude, and wet the dry tongue with excessive dryness, like the last finger of Lazarus (Luke 16). But with the Church lacking in bread and water, a man will fall against his brother, and everywhere there is discord, as our Christ's tunic is torn apart by those who even the soldiers in the Savior's passion dared not tear apart (John 19); and as we waste away in our iniquities, for we do not possess the justice of God. It is written in Jeremiah that the little ones, that is, the common people of the Church, sought bread, and there was no one to break it for them (Lamentations 4:4). But Paul, truly a man of the Church, knew that Christ had broken the legal bread and given it to the disciples to distribute. He confidently speaks: The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the Body of Christ? (I Cor. X, 16.) And those who are weak and in need of the milk of infancy cannot eat the staff or the strength of bread, nor can they receive solid food. And nothing strengthens the mind of the one who eats like the bread of life, of which it is written: And the bread strengthens the heart of man (Psal. CLXXXIII, 15).

<h2 id='tocuniq57'>(Chap. V.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 5, verses 1 onwards) And you, son of man, take for yourself a sharp sword, like a barber's razor, and pass it over your head and your beard; then take scales for weighing and divide them. One third you shall burn in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are completed, one third you shall strike with the sword all around it, and one third you shall scatter to the wind; and I will unsheathe a sword after them. And you shall take from there a small number, and bind them at the top of the cloak, and take them out again and throw them into the midst of the fire, and burn them. From there a fire will come out into all the house of Israel. For three parts of hair and wool, one of which is burned in the midst of the city, another is cut with a sword around it, the third is scattered to and fro by the wind, of which a small part is taken and bound at the edge of the cloak, and again a little of the third part is thrown into the fire, from which a flame comes out into all the house of Israel. Seventy-four parts have been interpreted. And when they had said: Burn the fourth part with fire in the midst of the city, and cut the fourth part with a sword all around it, and scatter the fourth part to the wind, for there remained another fourth part to them, they added from their own: And take the fourth part and burn it in the midst of the city: as if it is not the same as the first, and something else was said in the first, something different in this one that was added. Finally, even in the following, the Lord Himself explained the riddle of the divided hairs into three parts through the Prophet, saying: The third part of you will die by pestilence, and be consumed by famine in your midst, signifying famine and pestilence as fire; and the third part of you will fall by the sword all around you, describing external killings and wars. But, he says, I will scatter your third part to every wind, showing those who are to be led into captivity. After them, he says he will lay bare or pour out his sword, so that captivity is not the last of their evils; and he will take from those dispersed and captive, and bind to the top of his cloak those who are to return from captivity to Jerusalem, and he will also take some part from them, and consume it with fire and flame, signifying the Macedonians under whom the inhabitants of Judaea, and especially Jerusalem, have suffered greatly. But what he says, from this, that is, the people of the Jews; or, according to the LXX, from her; so that it is understood, from the city of Jerusalem, fire will come forth into every house of Israel: The history of the Maccabees relates that a certain part of the Jews surrendered to Antiochus Epiphanes, and incited him to persecute the people, and many other things that are written in the same history, and in the volumes of Josephus, especially the discord between Hyrcanus and Alexander, on account of which Cneus Pompeius, the consul, took Jerusalem and subjected it to Roman rule; and afterwards, under Titus and Vespasian, the city was captured and the temple destroyed. And after fifty years, under Aelius Hadrianus, the city was burned to the ground and destroyed, to the extent that it also lost its original name. However, in the case of emperors, both the hair on their head and their beard are an indication of beauty and manliness, as if they are shaved, an ugly nakedness is revealed, and the most distant and, so to speak, lifeless part of the body is in the hair and beard: in the same way, Jerusalem and its people are lifeless and separated from the living body of God, being handed over to famine, disease, killing, and the sword, and to captivity and dispersion. From this dispersal, under the form of hair, a part of it is tied at the top of the cloak, so that a small amount may be handed over to fire again, from which an infinite flame, almost completely devastating, emerges into every house of Israel.

<h2 id='tocuniq58'>(Vers. 5 seqq.)</h2>

(Version 5 and following) Thus says the Lord God: This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations, with the lands surrounding it; and it has despised my judgments, being more wicked than the nations, and my commandments more than the lands that surround it. For they have rejected my judgments and have not walked in my commandments. The Prophet also attests to Jerusalem being situated in the midst of the world, showing it to be the navel of the earth. And the Psalmist expressing the birth of the Lord: Truth, he says, has arisen from the earth (Ps. 48:12). And thereafter his passion: He has worked salvation in the midst of the earth (Ps. 74:12). For the plague called Asia is surrounded by the eastern parts. From the western parts, by that which is called Europe. From the south and the north, by Libya and Africa. From the north, by the Scythians, Armenia, Persia, and all the nations of the Pontus. Therefore, placed in the midst of nations, in order that the God who was known in Judea (Ps. 75) and his great name in Israel, all the nations surrounding her would follow her examples, she overcame even the nations themselves in her wickedness. Which Symmachus interpreted beautifully saying, 'These things, he says, Jerusalem, which I placed in the midst of nations, and the regions around her, changed my judgments for the impieties which she learned from the nations, and my statutes for the regions which are around her: for they rejected my laws, and did not walk in my judgments.' But what the Seventy have said, that my justifications are unjust from the nations, and my laws are not consistent with the regions around it, is clear even when I am silent.

<h2 id='tocuniq59'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Vers. 8, 9.) Therefore thus says the Lord God: Because you have surpassed the nations that are around you, and have not walked in my commandments, and have not kept my judgments, and have not acted according to the judgments of the nations that are around you, therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, and I myself will execute judgments in your midst in the sight of the nations. And I will do in you what I have not done, and the like of which I will not do again, because of all your abominations. Therefore, because we have understood: Because you have surpassed the nations that are around you, Symmachus translated: Because your multitude was from the nations that are around you. Aquila's second edition: Because you have been counted among the nations that are around you. Moreover, the Septuagint: Because your occasion is from the nations that are around you. And the meaning is, either that Jerusalem, by its own crimes, surpassed all the nations around it, or that its multitude, not the people of Israel, but the crowd of other nations, should be called. Certainly, among the other nations that are around it, they had been converted, or had every opportunity to teach the nations that they should be inclined towards the good. 'Why,' He says, 'have you not followed my commandments and not observed my judgments, when you have even conquered all the nations around you with your wickedness, and have not done what they often did, which is written by natural law in their hearts?' Therefore, I will not do my judgments through Angels or through any other ministers, but I myself will do them in you, with everyone watching, things that I have not done before and will not do again. By speaking of judgments, he shows the truth of his sentences, so that anger does not appear to exceed the measure of punishments. And he did not do in any nation the things that he did in Jerusalem: Because the servant who knows the will of his master and does not do it will be beaten with many lashes (Luke 12:48). And the mighty endure mightily severe torments (Wis. 6:7). And he says, I will not do the same again. He spoke well, I will not do the same again. For much harsher things he will do after the killing of Christ. For it is one thing to have at times worshipped idols for which they were previously punished, and another to have killed the Son of God.

<h2 id='tocuniq60'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) Therefore, fathers will eat their sons in your midst, and sons will eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on you and scatter all your remnants to every wind. This is in accordance with what was said before: Because you have surpassed the nations that surround you, or because your behavior is like the nations that surround you, you have not walked in my commandments and have not kept my judgments. This is why it is repeated for the third time. First, thus: Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am coming to you, and I myself will bring judgments in your midst. Second: Therefore, fathers will eat their sons in your midst. Third: Therefore, as I live, says the Lord God; if you have violated my sanctuary in all your offenses, and the rest. However, it should be noted that where there are beautiful and honorable things, and according to the merit of those who uphold them, God professes to act for their sake. But where there are sad and unworthy things for God, he indeed says that they happen, but not by his own doing, as at present: Therefore, fathers will eat their sons in your midst, and sons will eat their fathers. For he did not say, 'I will make the fathers eat their sons in your midst, and the sons eat their fathers.' But what was proper and not unworthy of the majesty of God, he says he will do. For it follows: 'And I will execute judgments in you, and I will scatter all your remnant to every wind.' We can expect such a thing to come in curses in Deuteronomy, especially in that place: 'Those who glorify me I will glorify, but those who despise me will be brought to nothing.' (Deuteronomy XXVIII). For he who glorifies himself, glorifies himself. But those who despise him will not be despised by the Lord, or be reduced to nothingness (for it followed that he said), but absolutely, they will be reduced to nothingness: not by God, but by their own merits and sins. We read in the Book of Kings, driven by the necessity of hunger, a mother devoured her son (2 Kings 6). Josephus also recounts many such acts in the siege of Jerusalem. However, the story does not tell when fathers eat their sons or when sons eat their fathers, except perhaps in many desperate situations, it must be believed that these things have also happened. This can also be applied to our Jerusalem: when teachers are against their students, that is, fathers against sons, and students against teachers, that is, sons against fathers, they are stirred up by mutual rebellion, and what is said by the Apostle is fulfilled: But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you are not consumed by one another (Gal. 5:15). And so the Prophet sang in mystical speech: When they drew near against me, who afflict me, to eat my flesh (Psalm 26:2). And Job speaks something similar: But if my handmaids have said: Who will give us of his flesh, that we may eat (Job 31). And concerning the leaders who seek profit from the disciples and have no concern for their salvation, it is said: Who devour my people as bread (Psalm 52:5). And concerning these, the Apostle says: 'And they devour the houses of widows' (Luke 20; Matthew 23). We can understand, fathers, that those who have eaten their children and children who have eaten their fathers, not only in Babylon, but also in the Roman siege. However, what is said, 'I will scatter all your remnants to every wind,' pertains more to the Roman captivity, when they were dispersed throughout the whole world. And this is the scattering to every wind of hair and beard.


<h2 id='tocuniq61'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) Therefore, I am alive, says the Lord God: unless for the reason that you have violated my sanctuary in all your offenses, and in all your abominations: I also will shatter (or, according to the LXX, cast away) you, and my eye will not spare, and I will not have mercy. This is specifically said to Jerusalem, because you have violated my sanctuary by forsaking me, and you have worshipped idols in my temple. I also will shatter all your idols, and I will break and overthrow them, or cast you away, because you have cast me away first. And my eye will not spare when I see you hungry, with a sword, submitting your neck to servitude, nor will I have mercy; because you do not deserve my mercy. For it is written: Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy (Matthew 5:7). This same thing must be understood in the Church, that God can say daily to teachers and priests who have acted negligently: Because you have violated my holy things in all your offenses, and in all the abominations you have committed, I will also crush and break you, and I will repay through me what you have perpetrated against my people. About whom the same Prophet speaks more fully against the shepherds here (Infra, XXXIV), that they cover themselves with the wool of the sheep and feed on milk and cheese, and do not seek the broken and sick.

<h2 id='tocuniq62'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>

(Verse 12, 13.) A third part of you will die by pestilence and be consumed by famine in your midst, and a third part will fall by the sword all around you. I will scatter your third part to every wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them. And I will pour out my fury and make my anger rest upon them, and I will comfort myself. And they will know that I, the Lord, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my anger upon them. Because they had divided the Septuagint into four parts, they approved that only the prophetic discourse about the fire, sword, and dispersion were superfluous, so that the first part of the fire would be divided into two parts in this place as well, they also divided the same first part into two, saying: The fourth part of you will be crushed by death, and the fourth part of you will be consumed by famine in your midst, and the fourth part of you will fall around you, and I will scatter the fourth part of you to every wind; although what we have added: And the fourth part of you will fall by the sword, is added from Theodotion's edition under asterisks. It is clear, however, that the Hebrew truth contains three parts. Of the first of these, it is said: 'And a third part of you shall die of pestilence and be consumed by famine in your midst.' It would have been much better to translate what is written than to seek support for a poorly translated matter. And we do not say that this was done by those to whom antiquity gave authority, but it was corrupted by the fault of many centuries of scribes and readers. Although both Aristeus and Josephus, and the entire school of the Jews, claim that only five books of Moses were translated by the Seventy. The chapter we mentioned above now seems to be omitted. I will only add this, which is necessary in what he says: And I will pour out my wrath and make my indignation rest upon them, and I will comfort them, and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have poured out my indignation upon them; how the wrath, indignation, and zeal of God are to be understood, we have often explained, that God speaks with human emotions: not because he is angry himself, but so that we may perceive God as angry through punishments and torments. But zeal is to be understood under the metaphor of a husband and wife, who as long as he loves his wife, is jealous; if he neglects her, he says what we are going to say in the following: My jealousy will depart from you, and I will no longer be angry with you (Below, LXI, 42). And it is joined: And they shall know that I the Lord have spoken in my jealousy, not to those who have perished by famine and pestilence, nor to those who have fallen by the sword around the city, but to those who will be scattered to every wind, they will feel the anger of God for the deaths of others and their own miseries, whom they did not want to perceive as merciful.


<h2 id='tocuniq63'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) And I will make you a desert; and what follows: and a reproach to the nations that are around you, which is not found in the Septuagint: for which they added from their own, and your daughters in your vicinity. And again, according to both editions, in the sight of all passing by. However, it is beneficial for Jerusalem to be destroyed by all its vices, and to be brought to a desert, and to recognize its own sins, so that what should have been an example of virtues to other nations may be an example of miseries. But we can understand his daughters, the cities or villages, or the Churches dispersed throughout the whole world, so that whoever is a pilgrim of this world may say with the Psalmist: I am a stranger and a sojourner like all my fathers (Ps. 38:12); and regarding whom it is said: Those who pass by say not: The blessing of the Lord be upon you (Ps. 129:8), let him see his disgrace and mourn.

<h2 id='tocuniq64'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15) And you will be a reproach and a blasphemy, an example and a wonder among the nations around you. For in the Septuagint it is written: And it will be στενακτὴ, which means mournful. And in Theodotion it is added, καὶ δηλαἳστὴ; the meaning of this word is unknown to us. For this reason, three other interpreters have translated it as blasphemy, which is called Geddupha in Hebrew (). It follows:

When I pronounce judgment on you in my anger and wrath and in the fierce blows of my fury, in full view of your sinfulness, you groan and moan like the deserving city of Jerusalem, which experiences the wrath and indignation of God because it has offended him. This is also confirmed by the words of Paul, who says, 'We were by nature children of wrath, just like everyone else' (Ephesians 2:3). And again, 'While we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened' (2 Corinthians 5). We also say with Jerusalem, 'I will endure the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against him.' Some interpret 'Δηλαἳστὴν' or 'δηλαίαν' as unfortunate and miserable, while others believe it to mean clear and exposed to miseries.

(Verse 16.) When I send the most destructive arrows of famine (the Vulgate adds 'against them'), which will be deadly, and I will send them to destroy you, and I will gather famine upon you, and I will break the staff (or rod) of bread. Famine and pestilence, and the most terrible beasts, and whatever other evils we endure in this world, it is clear that they come because of our sins. Thus, that famine which is mentioned in the book of Ruth (Ruth 1) and in the book of Kings under Elijah (3 Kings 17), when the heavens were closed for three years and six months, and under Elisha (4 Kings 6), whose incredible scarcity was compensated by sudden abundance by God's judgment, was sent. Not only was this done in Jerusalem at that time, but it also happens in our Jerusalem, where, because of the magnitude of sins, hunger is first sent to hear the word of God. Then hunger is followed by death, so that those who have not heard may experience: Taste and see that the Lord is sweet (Psalm 33:9), and afterwards let us feel: The death of sinners is most bitter (Psalm 22). We have already spoken about the firmament and the staff of bread (above, IV).

<h2 id='tocuniq66'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) And I will send famine upon you, and the most evil beasts to annihilate you. And pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I am the Lord who has spoken. The most evil beasts are brought upon the desolate land, which has been devastated by famine, the sword, and pestilence. These times also show when familiar animals, like dogs, are driven to madness and attack their masters' flesh, and the land is filled with bears, wolves, and all other kinds of beasts. The pestilence and blood passing through it signify disease and the sword. But even in our Jerusalem the worst beasts are sent, when we are handed over to ignominious sufferings, and to a reprobate sense and consciousness of our sins, which torture and tear apart our soul (Rom. I). Dissensions, heresies, schisms, rivalries, envy, sadness, detractions, evil desires, greed, which is the root of all evils (II Cor. XII), are the worst beasts. When they are within us, we deserve to hear: Your transgression shall rebuke you (Jeremiah). And we pray and say: Do not deliver the soul confessing to you to the beasts (Ps. LXXIII, 19).


<h2 id='tocuniq67'>(Chap. VI.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 6, Verses 1 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, turn your face towards the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them. And you shall say: Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God. Thus says the Lord God to the mountains and hills, to the cliffs and valleys. That which is often said in this Prophet as 'Adonai Dominus' seems to be briefly explained for the Greeks and Latins who do not have knowledge of the Hebrew language. Adonai is one name from the ten names of God, and it signifies Lord, which we often use in reference to God. Finally, when Sarah called Abraham her lord, she used this name (Gen. XVIII). And when it is said 'O Lord, my king', it is written Adonai (Exod. XXVIII). Therefore, when the two names, Lord and Lord, are joined together, the first name is common, the second properly belongs to God, which is called ἄῤῥητον (ineffable), which was also written on the golden plate that was on the high priest's forehead. But the mountains of Israel, which were occupied by the idols of demons, hear and understand their Creator not with their ears, but with the command and power of the one who made them. Just as the sea saw and fled, the Jordan river turned back (Ps. CXIII): not, of course, with the eyes of flesh which it lacked. And it is said to the sea: Be silent, be calm (Mark IV, 39). And the winds are commanded by his breath; and the worm is commanded, which struck the shade of Jonah (Jonah IV). And from the same land it is written: Who looks at the earth and makes it tremble (Ps. CIII, 32). The Prophet speaks to those indicating that idols are to be destroyed and altars, and all the ceremonies they previously served to be crushed. We can understand the mountains of Israel and the leaders as those who excelled in power, wisdom, knowledge, and wealth. And it should be noted that the face is indeed hardened, and it is set against the mountains: but it does not speak only to the mountains, but also to the hills, rocks, and valleys, where inferior dignity and degrees of prudence and knowledge are known. They seem to me to be tropologically mountains, those who have reached perfect knowledge; hills, who are slightly lower; rocks, who have no knowledge and only rely on conversation, presuming something about the interpretation of the Scriptures, having zeal for God according to the Apostle, but not according to knowledge (Rom. X; James III); valleys, on the other hand, are called the lowest in the Church, who are inferior in both life and knowledge, yet do not depart from the gathering of the Lord's family. Those who are commanded to hear the word of God, so that each one may understand according to their own measure and understanding what the Lord commands.

<h2 id='tocuniq68'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

(Vers. 4, 5.) Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places. And I will overthrow your altars, and break your images, and cast down your slain before your idols. And I will give the dead bodies of the children of Israel before the face of their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars in all your dwellingplaces. It is said of the mountains of Israel that God will destroy their high places, where people worshiped false gods, and will break their altars and images, and cause their worshipers to be killed in front of their temples; so that the bodies of the dead may lie where the offerings used to lie; and the bones of those who were on the mountains, not the mountains themselves, will be scattered around the altars and in all the cities and villages of Israel. This literally. Otherwise, against those who are uplifted in pride, and of whom the Apostle speaks: Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up (I Cor. VIII, 1), the sword is brought forth, so that all their images, which they have fashioned in their own minds, may be crushed and lie dead, and they may feel themselves to be dead, realizing that their images and creations are of no benefit to them. And he says that the bones of the mountains shall be scattered around the altars, indicating that the strongest among them should be separated from one another. For it is beneficial for evil to be separated from evil by perverse knowledge. And as those who were building the tower with the worst consent were dispersed for their own utility, and their tongues were divided (Gen. XI), so will the bones of the mountains be scattered, that they may understand the vanity of their endeavors. This that we have set forth: 'And I will give the bodies of the children of Israel before the face of your idols,' is not found in the Septuagint.


<h2 id='tocuniq69'>(Vers. 6, 7.)</h2>

(Verse 6, 7.) The cities shall be deserted, and the lofty places shall be demolished; and your altars shall be scattered and your idols shall cease, and your temples shall be broken down and your works shall be destroyed. And the slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am the Lord. The clear cause why the cities of the mountains are to be deserted: namely, that the lofty places may be demolished, and the altars and idols may be destroyed, and the temples may perish, and all worship of the idols may cease; and the slain may fall in the midst of the mountains; and they may know that he himself is the Lord. For this reason, we are given the opportunity to follow the spiritual intelligence more, so that the cities of heretics, which are interpreted as Churches, and the high pride of their teachings, and the altars of their perverse doctrines, are shattered, and the idols perish, which they simulated in their own hearts, and the shrines are destroyed, not the temples, which rose up against the temple of the Lord, and are called 'temples' in Greek, that is, shrines and all the works of mountains are crushed, which are not the works of God, but of false masters of knowledge. And when the slain shall fall in the midst of the mountains, either those whom the mountains themselves have slain, or the ecclesiastical men who have slain them wickedly to their own safety: then shall be the end of the proud mountains, that they may know that he is the Lord. But it may happen that from one people of the mountains of Israel, others being slain, others may know. For when a pestilent scourge is slain, the foolish will be wiser.

<h2 id='tocuniq70'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) And I will leave among you those who have escaped the sword among the nations, when I scatter you among the lands. And they shall remember me, the ones who were delivered, among the nations where they were taken captive. That which the Lord speaks to Elijah: I have left for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal (1 Kings 19:18); and the Apostle Paul writes: And now at this present time, there is a remnant according to the election of grace that has been saved (Romans 11:5), which may be applicable to this chapter. For indeed the Apostles, who were of the seed of Israel and had fled the sword, are therefore reserved, so that they might be scattered into the lands and preach the Gospel among the nations, and be remembered among the nations of God, in which they were living during the time of captivity. And it can also be said that some were reserved from the captivity of Judah, so that they might be remembered among the nations and preach the power of His name. The peoples of the heretics who were able to escape the sword of their destruction, and the wicked faction that had been incited against God, will remember the name of God, repenting and rejoicing that they were captured by the men of the Church.

<h2 id='tocuniq71'>(Vers. 9, 10.)</h2>

(Verse 9, 10) Because I have broken their heart by committing adultery and turning away from me, and their eyes are adulterous, looking after their idols. And they will displease each other with the evils they have done in all their abominations. And they will know that I, the Lord, have not spoken in vain, in order to bring harm upon them. Many things from this chapter have been omitted by the Septuagint, and that part has been changed. I have sworn to their adulterous heart: therefore we have put: I have broken their heart by committing adultery. But he swore and determined that he would do what he had shown through his actions; or he deceived by fornicating and turning away from God, concerning those about whom the Lord speaks through Hosea: They have been seduced by the spirit of prostitution (Hosea 4:12). And they fornicated their eyes after idols, through whose windows it is said that death entered. For this reason, in the book of Daniel, two elder men commanded that Susanna be revealed, so that they could enjoy the beauty of her naked body (Dan. 13). And the Lord spoke not in vain, when He brought evil or evils, when those who were subject to His sentence repent. But if the heart is hard and untamable, not even feeling the punishments of the correcting benefactor, it is said to them: I struck your children without cause: you have not received discipline. (Jeremiah 2:30). However, it is beneficial even to heretics, that their heart be broken, the worst treasure of perverse doctrines, because they have turned away from the Lord, and their eyes commit adultery after their own inventions. Those who remember the Lord will be displeased with all their abominations and those who understand the truth of the true faith will know that He is the Lord. Therefore, He often brings tribulation, which seems harmful and evil to the patient, so that they may be converted to repentance.

<h2 id='tocuniq72'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) Thus says the Lord God: Strike your hand, and stamp your foot, and say: Alas! for all the abominations of the evil house of Israel. The prophet is commanded to show the magnitude of sins with his hands, feet, and words, so that he may display through the movement of his body and the indignation of his voice, the appearance of one amazed and astonished, weeping and lamenting. For just as when we see something new and marvelous, we tremble both in body and mind, so that we clap our hands and stamp our feet on the ground, and bow our voice to weeping; in the same way, now the prophet, seeing with the eyes of his soul the coming punishments, speaks of all the abominations of the evil house of Israel that follow. We strike spiritually with our hand, when we separate ourselves from evil works. We stomp our foot, when we do not proceed on the path of sin. We weep and cry, when we are displeased with what is happening. What is shown in words, alas. For which Aquila interpreted as ἂ ἂ, Symmachus σχετλίασον, which means to lament or weep. LXX and Theodotion εὖγε, which is more of an insult than a lament.

Those who are going to perish by the sword, famine, and plague. This is indeed the cause of weeping, because the inhabitants of the mountains and the worshippers of altars and idols are going to perish by the sword, famine, and plague. Those who are led astray by various errors, and change their faith daily, are tossed about by every wind of doctrine: they are killed by the sword and divided into factions, abandoning the unity of the Catholic faith. But whoever does not have spiritual food dies of hunger, not knowing him who said: I am the life (John XIV, 6). Moreover, those who are devoted to either single or multiple vices cannot be separated from them, as if once they fell from an ancient pestilence, or rather a certain uterine pestilence.

<h2 id='tocuniq73'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) Whoever is far away will die from the plague; whoever is near will fall by the sword, and whoever is left and surrounded by famine will die, and I will fulfill my wrath upon them. Whoever escapes the siege of the city and migrates to the desert will die from the plague; whoever is near will fall by the enemy's sword. And whoever is surrounded by the enemy's army will perish from famine and lack: in all of these, the wrath of God will be fulfilled, so that those who remain may know that He is the Lord. Whoever departs from the Church will immediately die of the plague. Whoever considers themselves free and diligent, unless they take caution, will be struck by the sword of their enemies. Whoever is content with simple faith, like dumb animals, indeed belongs to the Church, but does not make any progress in good works; nor is he an imitator of the ant, which prepares and gathers food in the harvest, he will die of hunger, and the anger of the Lord will be fulfilled in all these things.

<h2 id='tocuniq74'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) And you shall know that I am the Lord, when your slain shall be in the midst of your idols, round about your altars, upon every high hill, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols. It is evident according to the literal sense, and needs no interpretation, that in the mountains of Israel, and in the high places, among the altars and groves, which are called thick trees, the army of Israel was slain, that they might be punished in the same places where they had sinned. According to allegory, let us follow the proposed order. When the masters of heretics, who are instructed in the knowledge of Scriptures, have been crushed and overcome by the Ecclesiastical men, we see them lying among the idols they created, and those who elevated themselves against the knowledge of God lie scattered on the mountains and hills beneath every leafy tree; those who have pompous words and the shadow of leaves, but do not have the fruits of good works; those who are under every leafy oak tree, which does not bear the fruits of men, but of pigs: where they burn fragrant incense not to God, but to their idols. And they could not say what is written about Noah: 'The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma' (Gen. VIII, 21): and that which Paul speaks: 'For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing' (II Cor. II, 15). But just as a holy person delights God with their fragrance, so sin is committed from whose person that psalm is sung: 'My wounds stink and fester because of my foolishness' (Ps. XXXVII, 6), he kindles his foul incense for his idols. What we interpreted, on all the highest points of the mountains: and a little later: And under the whole leafy oak, they left seventy.

<h2 id='tocuniq75'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) And I will stretch out my hand upon them and make the land desolate and forsaken, from the wilderness of Deblath to all their dwellings. And they shall know that I am the Lord. O mountains of Israel, when your slain ones have fallen among your idols and on every high hill and on all the mountaintops, when I have filled your forests with the corpses of the dead, those whom you once burned incense to, then I will stretch out my hand against you in vengeance, which has been restrained until now, and I will make the whole land of Israel a desolation, from the wilderness of Deblath in the land of Hamath, which is called Epiphania of Syria, to all their dwellings. So that all may know that there is nothing between the wilderness and the Great Sea that the sword of the enemy has not consumed. Many people think that the same place is meant, about which it is written in Jeremiah: 'And they took Zedekiah in the desert that is near Jericho, and all his company fled from him.' And when they had captured the king, they brought him to the king of Babylon in Riblah, which is in the land of Hamath (Jer. 39:5). It may also be called Deblatha or Reblatha due to the close similarity of the Hebrew letters Daleth and Res, which are distinguished by a small dot. But according to mystical understanding, the Lord extends His hand over all those who have been deceived by heretical error, in order to make their land, which is interpreted as the Church, desolate from the desert of Deblatha, which in our language means 'mass of figs', and of compacted thistles, so that after they have discovered bitterness in the simulated sweetness, which was not of cultivated land but of solitude, then they may know that He Himself is the Lord. Honey drips from the lips of a prostitute, who temporarily satiates the mouths of those who eat, but afterwards is found bitter as gall (Prov. 5:3,4). This also signifies the two baskets of figs that were placed in front of the Temple in Jeremiah (Jer. 24): one basket of good figs and one of rotten figs. One of these refers to the Church of Christ, the other to the congregation of the wicked.

<h2 id='tocuniq76'>(Chap. VII.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 7, Verses 1, 2.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, thus says the Lord God of the land of Israel: The end has come, the end has come upon the four corners of the earth. These corners of the world we have interpreted as the East and the West, the South and the North. Concerning these corners, Isaiah also speaks: Lord, from the corners or ends of the earth, we have heard wonders (Isaiah 24:16), which were accomplished throughout the whole world by the apostles. And it is written of the saints: 'If you sleep among the clergy of the silver dove's wings, and their backs are pale with gold' (Psalm 67:14). Therefore, when the Lord approached and saw Jerusalem, he wept and said, 'How often have I desired to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing?' (Matthew 23:37). This is the one who, in the song of Deuteronomy, spread his wings and received them, and carried them on his shoulders (Deuteronomy 32). Certain spiritual wings of the earth, by which we fly upward to the heavenly, He places into four types of believers: the house of Aaron, and the house of Levi, and the house of Israel, and those who fear the Lord. Concerning them, the Psalmist also sings: House of Israel, bless the Lord: house of Aaron, bless the Lord: house of Levi, bless the Lord; you who fear the Lord, bless the Lord (Psalm 134:19-21). In Aaron, the priesthood; in Levi, the priests and ministers; in Israel, the whole people; in those who fear the Lord, the understanding of proselytes. But we think that it needs to be simply explained, that after the commination of the mountains of Israel, the prophetic discourse is directed to all the land of Israel, whether ten or twelve tribes: and that the prophet does not predict future events, but sees the impending captivity. For in the fifth year of Sedecias, Ezechiel began to prophesy to the captives in Babylon; and in the ninth year, Nabuchodonosor came and besieged Jerusalem: and he captured it in the eleventh year of Sedecias. From which it is evident that the end has come and drawn near, not over mountains and hills and rocks and valleys, but over the four corners of the earth from every part of Israel: not all the earth: if he had said that, it could be believed of the whole world; but the earth simply, which signifies Israelites. For thus he had begun: Thus says the Lord God of the land of Israel: The end, the end has come upon the four corners of the earth.

<h2 id='tocuniq77'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(Verse 3, 4.) Now the end is upon you, and I will unleash my fury upon you, and I will judge you according to your ways, and I will bring all your abominations against you. And my eye will not spare you, and I will have no pity, but I will bring your ways upon you, and your abominations will be in your midst, and you will know that I am the Lord. In this chapter, according to the Septuagint Interpreters, the order has been changed and confused, so that the first become last, and the last become first or middle, and even the middle is now transferred to the extremes and vice versa. From this point, following the Hebrew and other interpreters, we have set forth the order of truth. Therefore, the speech is directed to the land of Israel, because the end and consummation will come upon it, and the Lord will send forth His anger upon it, not unjustly, but only coming from indignation; but it will be full of equity and reason, so that He may judge it according to His ways, and show it all its abominations. He will remember His works and understand what evil it has done. But as he says: My eye will not spare you, and I will not have pity, like a most merciful physician who wants to cut away putrid flesh and burn festering wounds with a cauterizing iron, he does not spare in order to spare; he does not have pity in order to have more pity; so that nothing putrid and corrupting remains in the body to infect the living flesh nearby. The Lord strikes those whom he loves, and he chastises every son whom he receives (Heb. 12:6). Of this understanding, it is said: I will strike and I will heal (Deut. 32:39). For every medicine has bitterness in the beginning, but afterwards the fruits of pain are revealed, and health is shown. This is what God speaks through Amos: 'Because I have known you from all the tribes of the earth, therefore I will avenge upon all your sins.' For the Lord knows those who belong to Him. And He says in Second Timothy: 'I will set forth his ways, and all the steps of his life, his abominations and stains, that the previous sins may be placed before the eyes of the sinner who is punished for the sake of health.' And when the Lord has done this, those who were oppressed will know that He is the Lord. This itself signifies and that testimony: I will punish Jacob according to his ways, and repay him according to his deeds. (Hosea 12:2).

<h2 id='tocuniq78'>(Vers. 5, 6.)</h2>

(Verse 5, 6) This is what the Lord God says: A single affliction, behold, is coming: the end is coming, the end is coming. He has awakened against you, behold, he is coming. Constriction is coming upon you, you who dwell in the land. These are not found in the Septuagint, but they have been added in their edition of Theodotion's translation under asterisks. However, we will follow the Hebrew. Instead of affliction, which according to Symmachus, who interpreted it as κάκωσιν, we have put for the sake of clarity: and in Hebrew and in Greek it is written κακία, or πονηρία: that is, wickedness. It is said (Al. Dicit) that the final time of the sins of the land of Israel has come: so that it may no longer escape the judgement of God, which it has deserved for a long time. And because it had not yet completed its sins, punishment was therefore delayed; according to what is written: For the sins of the Amorites are not yet complete (Genesis XV, 16). Therefore, the Lord also said to the Jews: And you, He says, fill up the measure of your fathers (Matthew XXIII, 32). Therefore, misery comes to you; affliction comes, and captivity comes. And lest you think that I threaten future things again, I show with my finger and demonstrate. Behold, it comes, the end comes, the end comes. He who seemed to you until now to be sleeping and resting, has suddenly awakened against you and risen up. Constriction comes, which is called Sephphira in Hebrew, and which Aquila interpreted as προσκόπησιν, that is, contemplation and foresight, which you always fear will come to you with trepidation; and which Theodotio interpreted as πλοκὴν, that is, the order and intertwining of all evils. Furthermore, what is said about you who dwell on earth, according to the Book of Revelation of John, we must understand: Woe to all who dwell on the earth. (Rev. 8:13). For the holy person is not an inhabitant of the earth, but a stranger and a pilgrim; and he says: I am a stranger and a sojourner, like all my fathers. (Psalm 38:13). Therefore, even Abraham the Hebrew, that is, a wanderer and a stranger passing through, is remembered; hastening to pass from the present world to the future. We can interpret this passage spiritually against the Jewish people, upon whom came the end and completion from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom they killed between the temple and the altar (Matt. XXIII). For as long as they did not lay hands on the Son of God, the judgment of the Lord slept and was delayed. But when they killed the heir, so that the inheritance would perish, then He arose against them and all the order of miseries and confusion awakened. Because they did not seek the heavenly things, but desired to cling to earthly things.


<h2 id='tocuniq79'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Ver. 7.) The time has come, the day of slaughter is near, and not the glory of the mountains. The Hebrew word Adarim, which we have divided into two words, first Ad, second Arim, according to Theodotion, we have translated as the glory of the mountains. Symmachus translates it as the restoration, and he said: And the time is near: the day of hastening, not of restoration. Moreover, the LXX translates it as: The time has come, the day is approaching, not with disturbance, nor with pains. Theodotio: The time has come, the day of hunger is near, and not the day of glory for the mountains. It is also a time of slaughter, and even now it is evident among the Jewish people, who have no prophets or the word of God to nourish the souls of believers. But understand, O mountains, you who have knowledge of the Scriptures. As it is said elsewhere: 'You shine forth wondrously from the eternal mountains' (Psalm 75:5). Furthermore, the Seventy who said 'not with disturbance, and not with pains' signify that they have such great ignorance of God and blindness of soul, that they are not troubled by their sins, and are not tormented by the pains of repentance.


<h2 id='tocuniq80'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) Now I will pour out my anger upon you and vent my fury against you; I will judge you according to your ways and bring upon you all your abominations. If we calculate from the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin to the ninth year of the reign of King Zedekiah, when Nebuchadnezzar came and besieged Jerusalem, it will be three years in total. Therefore, it is rightly said: Now I will pour out my anger upon you. I will by no means foretell to you what is to come, nor will I threaten you with things that are far off in the future: now I will unleash my fury upon you. This fury and anger is by no means without judgment: but it is to return your ways upon your own head, and to make you feel all your abominations. Moreover, we can also speak of the ultimate captivity, that after the killing of Christ, when their end came and sin awoke against them, that was fulfilled which was written: Now the wrath of God has come upon them to the end (1 Thess. 1:16). When Titus and Vespasian surrounded Jerusalem, and its desolation arrived, and it was fulfilled: Behold, your house will be left abandoned to you (Matthew 23:38). Then they were judged according to their ways and the blasphemies with which they denied the Lord; and they felt the fury of God, and all His indignation was poured out upon them, and they received their crimes, so that the destruction of the temple might endure until the end.


<h2 id='tocuniq81'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) And my eye shall not spare, neither will I have compassion: but I will lay (or give) upon you your ways, and your abominations shall be in your midst, and you shall know that I am the Lord who strikes. He subjects the causes of severity and sternness, or, as heretics think, the cruelty of God that his eye does not spare nor have compassion, saying: I will give you your ways, and your abominations shall be in your midst; so that you may feel what you have done, and seeing your abominations either before you or placed in the midst of all, you may correct your error with repentance, and turning away from your former works, when you hate what you have done, then you shall feel that he himself is the Lord (Heb. XII). He who strikes in order to correct and chastise every son whom he receives.

<h2 id='tocuniq82'>(Vers. 10, 11.)</h2>

(Vers. 10, 11.) Behold the day, behold it comes, the contraction has gone forth: the rod has blossomed, pride has sprouted. Iniquity has risen in the rod of wickedness, not from them, and not from the people, nor from their noise: and there will be no rest for them. LXX: Behold the day brings forth, behold the end comes, the complex has gone forth, and the rod has blossomed, pride has sprouted, injury has been awakened, and it will crush the strength of the wicked, and not with disturbance nor with haste, and they are not from them, nor is there beauty in them. The day has been contracted, says [someone], and shortened. And approaching is a neighboring captivity. The rod that threatened you for a long time has blossomed, and from the flower of its bloom it has given birth to the fruit of punishments. Your pride has sprouted what you deserved, so that the injustice, which is not from a pitiable people, nor from those who are led like dumb animals by their masters, nor from the shouting and noise with which they vociferated in vain, deceived by the priests and pharisees, may rise up with a united voice and say: 'Crucify, crucify such a one.' (John 19:6) Where there will be no rest for them, but eternal captivity. Furthermore, the Seventy interpreted it in the sense in which it is written: 'For you do not know what the coming day may bring' (Prov. 27:1), saying: 'Behold, the day brings forth what was conceived long before: and the end has come, and the fulfillment has gone forth, which embraces all your evils and holds them, or as Symmachus interpreted, inspection, so that God may see all that you have done and consider your works, and render to each one what he deserves.' And in that which they have likewise transferred, the rod flourished, as we can use that testimony: Do not take the rod away from your son (Prov. XIII, 13). And the Apostle: What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and the spirit of gentleness (I Cor. IV, 21)? But even God speaks through the mouth of the Psalmist: I will punish their iniquities with the rod, and their sins with scourges: but I will not take away my mercy from them (Psalm LXXXVIII, 33, 34). Therefore the Lord visits and strikes, so that every pride which was long hidden and enclosed may arise and be revealed; and injury is aroused against the arising and budding pride, and the strength of the wicked is crushed, not with disturbance or haste. For the end of a flourishing rod is health and correction, which comes not by merit to those who are reproved, nor by beauty which they do not possess in themselves, but by the mercy of the Lord. A difficult passage, and one that differs greatly between the Hebrew and the Septuagint, to which many additions have been made from Theodotion's edition, in order to make it seem to have some consistency.

<h2 id='tocuniq83'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) The time has come, the day is approaching. It is not only said of Jerusalem that the time of its captivity has come and the day has approached when it will be besieged by the Babylonian army, but also to the one who was rejoicing in his built and expanded storehouses, the Lord speaks: Fool, tonight your soul will be taken from you; and the things which you have prepared, whose will they be (Luke 12:20)? From where the Apostle also says: The time, he says, has been shortened (1 Corinthians 7:29). And in another place: For the form of this world passes away (Ibid., 31). It is to be noted that he did not say it will be postponed to the future, but he spoke of the present, it passes away, and the form of the world slips away daily. For it never remains in the same state; but the form of things that are growing and decaying flies by and changes. Hence the Lord also said: Heaven and earth will pass away (Matth. XXIV, 35). But if these things, in which all things that are in the world are contained, pass and go through, what can be perpetual in human affairs?


<h2 id='tocuniq84'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13). The one who buys should not rejoice, and the one who sells should not mourn. It is natural to rejoice in the purchase of possessions and mourn in their sale. However, when slavery and captivity are imminent, both joy and sorrow are in vain. Hence, the Apostle says: Time is shortened. Henceforth, those who have wives should live as if they did not have them, those who weep as if they did not weep, those who rejoice as if they did not rejoice, those who buy as if they did not possess, and those who use this world as if they did not make full use of it (I Cor. VII, 29 seqq.). For just as the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. (Matthew 24)

Because his anger is upon all his people. This is found in the Septuagint. For the word 'people' can also be understood as 'multitude' and 'crowd' according to the Hebrew, for it signifies 'Amona.' And the reason is clear: that the one who buys should not rejoice, and the one who sells should cease mourning, because the anger of God will soon come upon all the multitude of the land of Judah, or Jerusalem. For it is understood from the preceding text, in which it is written: Thus says the Lord God of the land of Israel, etc.


<h2 id='tocuniq85'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) Because the one who sells will not return to that which he sold. He speaks according to the Hebrew custom. For every sale was returned to the seller in the fiftieth year of remission, which among them is called the Jubilee. Therefore, before the year of remission comes, when possessions return to their previous owners, captivity will come upon them, which will take away all the city's customs. Moreover, what the Seventy translated as: Because the buyer will not return to the seller, although it does not completely agree with the historical account, according to allegory, it can have this meaning: that we can say that the one who was deceived by a heretical error, when he understands the deceit of the teacher, will by no means return to the seller, that is, to the teacher; but will despise and reject him.


And yet in the lives of those still living, because the vision will not return to the entire multitude. Just as possession does not return to the previous owner with the imminent destruction of a city, so the prophetic vision and warning, which is directed to the entire multitude of the city, will by no means return and will become invalid; but it will be fulfilled in the remaining days, to those to whom the prophetic message is directed. However, he says this in order to show the impending captivity, lest they should say according to custom: This vision will be for a long time, and will be fulfilled after many years. We can say this, that after the prophetic vision has departed from the Jews, the Law and the Prophets do not return to them, nor do they deserve to have prophets anymore after the killing of the Savior. And significantly, he says that the vision will not return to any multitude. Therefore, it will return to those who believed in the Lord, namely the apostles and the remnant of the Jewish people who have been saved from Israel. But these two verses are not found in the Septuagint edition.

And a man in the wickedness of his life will not be strengthened. LXX: And a man in the eyes of his life will not obtain. And the meaning according to the Hebrew: His wickedness will not benefit a man, nor will it provide him with any strength. According to the Septuagint: And a man, who desired what he thought to be precious in the world, will not obtain it; but with freedom perishing, everything that is beautiful will be lost. However, the ambiguity of the Hebrew letters Yod and Vav, which are distinguished only by their size, caused some to interpret it as wickedness and others as eyes.


<h2 id='tocuniq86'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) Blow the trumpet, let all be prepared.  LXX: Blow the trumpet, and judge all things. We read in many places about the sound and noise of trumpets, as in Isaiah: 'Lift up your voice like a trumpet' (Isa. LVIII, 1); and elsewhere: 'Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the appointed time, on our solemn feast day' (Ps. LXXX, 3); and in the Apostle: 'For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God' (I Thess. IV, 5). And in the Gospel: Do not sound the trumpet before you (Matthew 6:2). And the story of the trumpets, both golden and silver, is told in the book of Numbers (Numbers 10 and 31), which is compared to prophetic discourse and Apostolic doctrine. And now it is commanded that everyone be prepared for battle at the sound of the trumpet and the blowing of the trumpet. Moreover, what the Seventy said, "Judge all things," there is no doubt that it agrees with the authority of the apostles. After the trumpet of the angels has sounded, they will judge on twelve thrones the twelve tribes of Israel. Of whom Paul spoke: We will judge angels (I Cor. VI, 3); and elsewhere: The world will be judged in you (Ibid., 2). But according to the present sense, those who are entrusted with this office are commanded ironically to blow the trumpet, so that all may be prepared against the army of Babylon.

And there is no one who goes to battle. For my anger is over his whole multitude. And these are not found in the Septuagint. God had commanded (Num. X) that the trumpet should sound to prepare the army, which could resist the strength of the Babylonians; but it was of no use to command, since there is no one in the people who dares to proceed to war. Therefore, the people are weak and lacking in fighting strength, because all of God's anger is over his whole multitude, understood as the city of Jerusalem or the land of Judea. But both in our land and in Jerusalem, when either public persecution or the many enticements of vices try to overcome us, the teachers sing in vain, and hurry to prepare us for battles, even though there is no strength in the people, which has been taken away because the sins deserve the present anger of God.

<h2 id='tocuniq87'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Verse 15, 16.) The sword is outside, and pestilence and famine are within. Those who are in the field will die by the sword; and those who are in the city will be consumed by pestilence and famine. And those who escape will be saved; they will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, trembling. Each one in their own wickedness. The seventy, the doves of the valleys, or as Theodotus translated, the meditators, remained completely silent. And what we have interpreted, trembling: each one in their own wickedness, Theodotus translated it as: all muttering, each one in their own wickedness; so that under the metaphor of meditating doves, it signifies each person in the nation lamenting their own sin, and understanding and feeling why they are suffering these things. But we have already mentioned three classes of people who will die in the city: those who perish from plague and famine; those who are killed by the sword outside; and those who escape captivity. Of these, those who are saved will go to the mountains and, like murmuring doves, will anxiously bewail their sins. In a tropological sense, it should be understood that those in the fields and countryside, outside the borders of the Lord's city, which is called the Church, will be struck by the sword of their adversaries, but those who live negligently in the city and have not prepared food for themselves, of which it is written in Proverbs: 'He who works his land will have his fill of food,' (Prov. XII, 11,) will die from famine and plague. But few, who have avoided the sword of heretics or the hunger of their own sloth, and death, will be saved except in the mountains, and unless they have assumed the wings of a dove, and flown away, and found rest. For as long as doves are in the valleys, they tremble and fear everything: of whom we are commanded to imitate their innocence, and about whom it is written in the psalm: 'If you sleep among the midst of the flock, the wings of the dove that is silvered, and its back parts in the whiteness of gold' (Ps. 67:14): in whose form the Holy Spirit descended, and remained upon the Lord and Savior. Beautifully we will call the dove meditating according to Theodotion (Matthew 3), he who meditates day and night in the law of the Lord, and concerning whom it is written: The mouth of the just will meditate wisdom (Psalm 36:30).

<h2 id='tocuniq88'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) All hands will be dissolved, and all knees will flow with water. And they will gird themselves with sackcloth, and terror will cover them. For knees flowing with water, Seventy have moved, thighs are polluted with moisture. But when all are trembling, and fleeing to the mountains, all hands will be dissolved, and no one will be able to resist the enemies, and with the magnitude of fear, urine will pollute the knees: and the bladder will not be able to contain the flowing waters. They will gird themselves with sackcloth, and trembling will possess all things. This happened among that people, not only under the Babylonians, but also under the Romans, when the wrath of God came upon them to the very end. Moreover, it happened in our own Judea, where the confession of the Lord is, when iniquities have multiplied and the love of many has grown cold, all the hands of good works will be dissolved, and all knees, or thighs, will flow with the waters of those who have sought unlawful unions, and who, in the law, are called eunuchs, that is, those sustaining a flow of semen and are called unclean by Scripture. Whereas those who are such, should gird themselves with the hairshirts of repentance, and fear the impending judgement. And whoever does this, will merit to hear Isaiah saying: Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees (Isaiah 35:3).

<h2 id='tocuniq89'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) In every face there is confusion, and in every head there is baldness. The reddening of the face is a sign of shame, and the conscience of sins shines forth on the face. The hope of salvation is when shame follows sin. Therefore it was said to her who gloried in her sins with a hard heart: Your face has become like that of a prostitute, you do not know how to blush (Jer. 3:3). Baldness of the head is also a sign of sorrow, when we lose the beauty of our hair and the comeliness of our youth. And it is said about Jerusalem: For the adornment of your head, you will have baldness, because of your works (Isaiah 3:17). And another prophet says: All heads, he says, will be shaved in every place, and every beard will be cut off (Jeremiah 48:37). Also, Micah to the same Jerusalem: Shave, he says, and shear over the sons of your delights, spread your baldness like an eagle (Micah 1:16). And it is commanded to make baldness over the dead. But the holy ones, that is, the Nazarites, and those who deserved to obtain priesthood of the Lord, do not shave their heads (Num. VI). For they do not perform deeds of death, nor are they unclean, because they are Nazarites, that is, holy ones of the Lord. But if someone dies near them, all the previous days will not be considered as their sanctification. Samuel, the holy one of God, possessed the eternal ornament of the head: and he heard this from the Song of Songs: Your hair is black like a raven (Cant. V, 11). Furthermore, Samson, because he lost his hair, lost his strength (Judg. XVI): and as his hair gradually grew back, his former strength returned, so that he killed many more in his death than in his life. However, although Elisha had a bald head, because he was a servant of the Lord, he enjoyed the locks of his head. Hence, little children, because they were little and had not yet reached manhood, mocked his baldness and said, 'Go up, baldhead! Go up, baldhead!' (2 Kings II, 23), and they were torn by the bites of wild beasts, whose leaps and woods are their dwelling place.


<h2 id='tocuniq90'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) Their silver will be thrown away in the streets, and their gold will be like garbage. Septuagint: Their silver will be thrown away in the streets, and their gold will be despised. In the midst of flight and captivity, they will throw away their riches and the weight of gold and silver on the streets, only seeking to save their own lives, so that they are not burdened by what was once luxury. Otherwise, according to the anagoge, all the silver of the captives and fugitives from Jerusalem will be thrown away in the streets, on the wide and spacious road that leads to death, because they have abandoned the narrow path of salvation. But all gold will be considered worthless, even esteemed as dung and filth. For one cannot have purity who is outside the Church of the Lord.

Their silver and gold will not be able to save them on the day of the wrath of the Lord. And this is not found in the Septuagint. Without a doubt, during times of siege and famine, it does not free those hungry for gold and silver, and their teeth are blunted like the hardest stone. Finally, it follows:

They will not satisfy their souls, and their bellies will not be filled. In the presence of evil, we have learned that many rich people, depleted by poverty, have had the end of beggars, among silk, gems, and weights of gold and silver. But the silver and gold of those who are outside the Church cannot free the souls of the possessors on the day of the Lord's wrath; instead, it shows that they will have eternal hunger and be tormented with an empty stomach. This testimony confirms it, saying: The redemption of a man's soul is his own wealth (Prov. XIII, 8). Our true riches are those which Christ's truth has taught us (Luke 16), who commanded us to make for ourselves friends with unrighteous wealth, who will receive us into eternal dwellings.

Because a scandal of iniquity has occurred among them. Therefore, he says, the possessors of gold and silver will not be satisfied, nor will their stomachs be filled, because this very gold and silver has become a scandal of their crimes. But it signifies idols, which are made of gold and silver, condemn their own creators. For this reason, the Seventy translated it: because the torments of their iniquities were such that they would be tormented in their own iniquity and understand that they have turned the gifts of God into blasphemy.


<h2 id='tocuniq91'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) And they put the ornament of their necklaces upon their pride, and they made images of their abominations and idols from it. LXX: The chosen ones of the world have put it upon their pride, and they have made images of their abominations and stumbling blocks from it. Which I, he says, had given as an ornament to those who possessed and to the wealthy, they have turned into pride, so that they could use them to free their own souls through alms and good works, and from them they had material for arrogance. Finally, they made idols out of gold and silver, and turned my gifts into images of demons. Moreover, what the Seventy said is applicable to their pride in bringing gold and silver: nothing is considered more precious in the world. And what follows, we know is found in Theodotion. The meaning is easily understood according to the allegory, that heretics have used gold and silver, the senses and the words of Scripture that have been chosen as the world's treasures, and which have been given to us as ornaments, as fuel and material for pride, and they have made images of various doctrines and abominations and stumbling blocks from them, so that by means of these they could worship and adore God, but instead they offend God.


<h2 id='tocuniq92'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21) Therefore I gave them over to uncleanness: and I will give them into the hands of foreigners to plunder them, and to the wicked of the earth as prey, and they will defile it. LXX: Therefore I gave them over to uncleanness: and I will give them into the hands of foreigners to plunder them, and to the pestilential ones of the earth as prey, and they will pollute it. Because they made for themselves images of their abominations and idols from the gold and silver and ornaments of their necklaces, which I had given them, therefore I gave them into uncleanness and into excrement. For which Symmachus interpreted, expressing disgust, wanting to cleanse the filth of the idols. And he said, 'I will deliver these into the hands of the enemy, so that they may plunder everything, and not only defile them, but also demonstrate that they, which previously seemed most sacred, are contaminated.' We too are delivered into the hands of our enemies and strangers to God when we make our ornaments into images of demons, and all our glory is possessed by the impious or the plagues of the earth, so that they may subject us to their power.


<h2 id='tocuniq93'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22) And I will turn my face away from them: and they will violate my sanctuary: and emissaries will enter it (as the Septuagint rashly translated, or as Symmachus and Theodotio, bursting in, and pestilential), and they will defile it. For, he says, because of the previous abominations of the people, I will turn my face away from them and I will not judge them worthy in my eyes: then they will violate my sanctuary, which signifies the Holy of Holies, for which the Septuagint translated visitation (to demonstrate the presence of God in holy places) and the impious and pestilent ones of the earth will burst in: which, except for the priests and the high priest alone, no one else dared to enter. What we know, both from the Babylonians, and from King Antiochus and Gnaeus Pompeius, and finally from what happened under Vespasian and Titus, when the temple was captured and destroyed, and all the things that the following prophet's speech encompasses. God also turns His face away from our evil deeds: and because His face is turned away, the secret of God is violated, so that the pestilential may enter for the priests and saints of God, and contaminate everything: so that the place that should have been holy becomes a place of uncleanness, according to the Gospel saying: 'My Father's house shall be called a house of prayer: but you have made it a den of thieves' (Matthew 21:13).


<h2 id='tocuniq94'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23.) Make a conclusion, for the land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of wickedness. LXX: And I will bring disturbance, for the land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of iniquities. The Hebrew word Arethich () is interpreted by Aquila as conclusion, and by Symmachus and Theodotion as καθήλωσιν, meaning crucifixion. For this reason, the Septuagint uses φυρμὸν, which we translate as disturbance. Therefore, O prophet, conclude my wrath upon the land of Judah and upon the city of Jerusalem in a brief speech, so that just as the land is full of bloodshed, for all are judged in bloodshed, shedding innocent blood: which the Scripture also records that the Jews did in the person of Naboth: thus their own blood is shed, and the city full of wickedness is demonstrated. For the city of Jerusalem, from gate to gate, is filled with the blood of the prophets, even under Manasseh (1 Kings 21). And there will come for them a conclusion, and disturbance and affliction, so that none of those who are facing imminent miseries can escape.

<h2 id='tocuniq95'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) And I will bring the wicked from the nations, and they will possess their houses. And these are not found in the Septuagint. For the priests and prophets, I will bring the wicked Babylonians from all nations, that they may possess your houses and subject you to servitude. But even our houses, that is, our souls (for we are the temple of God, and the Holy Spirit dwells in us - 1 Corinthians VI), the wicked demons will possess, if our land is filled with bloodshed and our habitation is full of iniquity.


And I will make the haughtiness of the mighty to cease, and their sanctuaries shall be possessed. I will turn away their roaring, and their holy places shall be defiled. All pride offends God. Therefore, the worst of the nations shall possess the houses of the mighty and the proud, and they shall occupy their sanctuaries, for a profane place of holiness enters, and its uncleanness contaminates it. But significantly, because the sanctuaries of God were polluted and his secret violated, he did not say, 'They shall possess my sanctuaries,' but 'their sanctuaries,' for they have departed from me after their contamination.


Distress is imminent. LXX: Propitiation will come. According to the higher order, they have been correctly interpreted as Eagle and Theodotius, the distress is imminent; and Symmachus, mourning. But the seventy, in the midst of all sorrows, have set down the word of joy: so that the soul of the grieving may be sustained, and may hope for better things amidst adversity, and a propitious Lord; of whom it is written: The Lord raises up those who are crushed (Ps. 145:8). But we, according to the earlier opinion of Symmachus, have combined it with the later, that we may say:

<h2 id='tocuniq96'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) With impending distress, they will seek peace, and it will not be. This cannot possibly be reconciled with the Septuagint. For if propitiation comes, how will they seek peace and not find it? But he who has heard from the apostles will seek peace and not find it, for he has not kept it in his mind, nor has he made it rest, but driven away by wicked deeds, he cannot find it. Indeed, peace is that which surpasses all understanding, and which the victorious Savior, ascending to the Father, left to the apostles.


<h2 id='tocuniq97'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26.) Disturbance will come upon disturbance, and hearing upon hearing. LXX: Woe upon woe will be, and message upon message. Just as it is said to the saints: Rejoice, again I say rejoice (Philippians IV, 2); and concerning them it is written: They will go from strength to strength (Psalm LXXXIII, 8), so that present good things may abound with future good things: likewise, for those upon whom distress comes, and who sought peace but did not find it, disturbance will come upon disturbance, or woe upon woe, as it is also written in the Apocalypse: woe has gone away, and woe will come quickly (Apocalypse IX, 12). And news will come upon news, and message upon message; according to the blessed Job: While one was still speaking, another messenger came (Job 1:16), increasing evils with evils, and describing the noise and tumult of approaching Babylonians.

And they will seek a vision from the Prophet: and the law will perish from the Priest, and counsel from the elders. Specifically, each individual seeks specific things. The prophet seeks the prophecy of the future. The interpretation of the law is the duty of the priest. The prudent counsel is sought by those of mature age; according to what is written: In the counsel of the saints (or the just) and the assembly, are the great works of the Lord (Ps. CX, 1, 2). However, these things were not only sought by the prophets, priests, and elders when the Babylonian army came against Jerusalem, but they are sought daily in the churches. But if they have lost sight, law, and counsel, in vain do they boast of having prophets, priests, and elders.

<h2 id='tocuniq98'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27) The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed in sorrow, or, according to the Septuagint, in death: those who desired something, what we have expressed in the Hebrew language, the king will mourn, they have completely remained silent about it. However, the Holy Scripture commemorates that Zedekiah mourned, and all the princes of the people of Judah were consumed with sorrow. But, although this may seem blasphemous at first glance, we can say that the king mourning for our vices and sins is Christ, who speaks in the Psalms: What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to corruption? (Ps. 29:10) And when he approached Jerusalem, he wept over it saying: Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing (Matthew 23:37)! Even the leaders can be apostles, whether they mourn sinners in a good way or, on the contrary, those to whom it is said: Hear the word of the Lord, leaders of Sodom (Isaiah 1:11). And he will be clothed, according to the Septuagint, in destruction, who does not have the armor of God, nor is he clothed in Christ. For all who have been baptized in Christ, have clothed themselves with Christ (Galatians 3:27).

And the hands of the people of the earth will be troubled, or, according to the Septuagint, dissolved. When there is no vision in the prophet, and knowledge of the Law in the priest, and counsel in the elders. And the king will mourn, and the prince will be in grief, or in destruction, consequently the hands of the people will be troubled, losing their order, or dissolved, not having ancient strength. And it is said beautifully that the people of God is not mentioned, whose hands are troubled, and who does not have a place in heaven; but the people of the earth, about whom it is written: Those who turn away from you will be written upon the earth. (Jeremiah 17:13).


According to their way, I will deal with them, and according to their judgments, I will judge them, or as the Septuagint translated, I will avenge them. God repays sinners according to their ways, so that He may keep the truth of judgment. However, in the saints, the extent of mercy exceeds the limits. For the sufferings of this temporary time are not worthy of the future glory that will be revealed in us (Rom. VIII, 18). For the wages of sin is death (Ibid. VI, 23), which the sinner receives according to their ways and works. Moreover, the virtue of the righteous enjoys the generosity of the Lord, of which Paul speaks: The gift of God is eternal life. And he added: and according to their judgments I will judge them, that Gospel saying: with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged (Matthew 7:1). And the Apostle: For in the judgment you pronounce you condemn yourself as you do the same things (Romans 2:1).

And they shall know that I am the Lord. This verse is often placed in this prophet, that it may be known that the knowledge of God is followed by sufferings and tortures, so that those who did not understand through blessings may understand through torments.

<h2 id='tocuniq99'>Book Three</h2>

Book Three

Nothing is long that has faith, and all the past series of times that have passed are not useful: unless perhaps it has prepared a provision of good deeds for itself, which always look to the future, indeed to eternal things, and are not limited by any boundaries. The true saying is: All things that arise perish, and all things that grow old decline. And elsewhere: There is nothing made by work and hand that old age does not complete and consume. Who would believe that Rome, built by victories from the whole world, would fall, and that it would become both the mother and tomb for its own people: that the shores of the whole East, Egypt, and Africa, once dominated by the victorious city, would be filled by the number of slaves and maidservants: that Bethlehem, once noble for both sexes and abundant in all riches, would receive beggars every day? Since we are unable to provide assistance to those in need, we sympathize and join tears with tears: occupied with the burden of holy work, while not allowing ourselves to see flowing together without groaning, we have ignored explanations in Ezekiel, and we have almost abandoned all study, desiring to turn the words of the Scriptures into deeds, and not just speak of holy things, but do them. Therefore, once again reminded by you, virgin of Christ Eustochium, we resume our interrupted work and, undertaking the third volume, we desire to fulfill your desire: praying not for our strength, but for our intention, considering one of them to be human fragility, and the other to be holy will in the Lord.


<h2 id='tocuniq100'>81 (Chap. VIII.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

Chapter 8, Verse 1. And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me. In the fifth year of the exile of Jehoiachin, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, we read about a previous vision to the prophet. But now, in the sixth year of the same king, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, a new vision is mentioned. From this, it is clear that these events, which are written, occurred after a year and two months, and either the prophecy was interrupted for a year and two months, or it spanned the entire fourteen months that the previous discourse covers. But in the sixth year and the sixth month, and on the fifth day of the month, which are numbers that refer to the creation of the world, and (( Al. ad)) the carnal senses, which perceive earthly things and do not yet contemplate heavenly things, the prophecy will not astonish one who understands that the word is directed to the elders of Judah. Among them, seventy held censers, and twenty-five worshiped the sun in the temple, and the prophet sat in his house, fleeing the crowd. And the elders of Judah sat before him, either desiring to hear the prophet's words or plotting against him. And those who are called elders of Judah are said to refer not to Israel, that is, to the ten tribes that were previously captured, but to those who were taken into captivity from the tribe of Judah with Jechoniah, let us understand.

<h2 id='tocuniq101'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Version 2.) And there fell upon me the hand of the Lord God there. And I saw, and behold, a likeness as the appearance of fire from the appearance of his loins, and downward fire: and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the sight of lightning. LXX: And the hand of Adonai the Lord came upon me: and I saw and behold, a likeness as the form of a man from his loins, and downward fire, and from his loins, and upward as the sight of the aura, like the sight of lightning. The Hebrew language does not include the word “man.” However, we have added the mention of the vision of the divine presence, which is not found in the Septuagint, from Theodotion. And because of what we have said, the hand of the Lord fell upon me. Symmachus translated it as 'the hand of the Lord came upon me,' which in Hebrew is Tephphol (). However, the word manus signifies 'power' or 'works,' so that one may understand the mysteries of the vision. And it should be noted that he does not see the truths themselves, but a likeness of fire, for fire appeared from the loins downwards; and from the loins upwards, it appeared as a radiant appearance, like the vision of lightning. For the splendor, which in Hebrew is called Zor, transferred the aura to Theodotus, in order to reveal the refreshing presence of God in the heavens. Finally, in the book of Kings, the blessed Elijah does not contemplate the coming of the Lord in a storm and whirlwind, nor in the burning fires, but in the sight of a thin and gentle breeze, to attest to the gentleness of Almighty God. However, the works of the body, symbolized in the loins, are purified by fire from top to bottom. And the works of virtues, which rise from the loins to the upper parts, have splendor and brightness, and yet neither fire is said to reach to the feet, nor the brightness of lightning to the head, but downwards and upwards, so that, according to the diversity of merits, one reaches to this and that member, another to those members. And just as those who hold the perfection of holiness reach to the summit, so those who are in the depths of sin are believed to hold the feet of the fiery ones.

(Verse 3) And a reaching out likeness of a hand seized me by the lock of my head. LXX: And the likeness of a hand extended and took hold of me by the fringe of my crown. And this likeness of a hand, the hand itself does not extend, for there is nothing corporeal in God. And the hand appears as a member of the human body and familiar, it does not frighten the one who is being assumed and grasped. For if it had touched the prophet in the likeness of a serpent or any other beast, the dissimilarity of the limbs would have frightened the one assumed. And a part of the hair is included, because the human nature cannot bear the apprehension of the whole head. For a headband, the Seventy translated κράσπεδον, which means fringe: one of which is usually taken in the hair, the other in the clothes.

And the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the sky. At first, he is grasped by the hand in a likeness; then he is lifted up by the spirit, which does not immediately raise him to the sky, but between the earth and the sky, so that, leaving the earthly things for a while, he hurries to the sky. And we can also say this, that because of good works, the prophet is grasped by the hand of God in a likeness, and because of knowledge of spiritual things, he is lifted up by the spirit.


<h2 id='tocuniq103'>(Vers. 4)</h2>

(Verse 4) And he brought me to Jerusalem in a vision of God, near the inner gate that faces north, where the idol of jealousy was set up to provoke jealousy. And behold, there the glory of the God of Israel was, as the vision that I had seen in the field. LXX: And he brought me to Jerusalem in a vision of God to the entrance of the gate that faces north, where the statue of the possessor was. And behold, the glory of the Lord God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the field. However, what is found in some codices. And in the statue is added the image of Zel, from Theodotion. The rest is similar. When he says 'he brought me to Jerusalem in a vision of God,' he shows that he was not transported in the body, but in the spirit. According to this vision, we can see both the heavens and the depths of the sea and the underworld, while we grasp the reasoning of each through contemplation. First, however, he comes to the vestibule that faces the North, so that he may see the statue of the idol Zel and provoke emulation; so that from that place he can penetrate the inner areas and see the rest, which are described afterwards. But the story tells of a statue of the idol Baal placed in the temple of God. It is beautifully called the idol of Zeal because it provokes emulation and zeal for the Lord, according to what is said in Deuteronomy: 'They have provoked me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will provoke them to jealousy with those which are not a people' (Deut. 32). Moreover, because zeal and possession, which are called 'Cena' in Hebrew, are also called by the same name, the Seventy interpreters translated the statue of Zeal as the statue of the Possessor. Finally, when Cain was born, his parent said that he possessed a man through God (Gen. IV, 1), referring to the possession of a human being, giving Cain his name. And there was the glory of the God of Israel, not because he delighted in such proximity, but in order to destroy the idol of Zeal and its temple with his presence. Hence, the destruction of the city and temple followed shortly after. And in Isaiah it is written that a narrow bed cannot accommodate two, and a short cloak cannot cover both (Isa. XXVIII), with Scripture indicating what the Apostle said: What agreement is there between Christ and Belial? Temple of God and idol (2 Cor. 7:25)

<h2 id='tocuniq104'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5) And he said to me: Son of man, lift up your eyes toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of the altar gate was the idol of jealousy in the entrance. Because we have set up the idol of jealousy north of the altar gate, the seventy translators have translated it as: From the north to the east gate, which is not found in Hebrew; leaving out the rest of what is written there. He said, he said to me, either the glory of God, which I had seen in the field, or the spirit that lifted me up between heaven and earth. And he spoke to me, after he had transported me to Jerusalem, and made me see either the city or the temple, and commanded me to lift up my eyes towards the way of the North. For there a statue of Baal was placed, which he calls the idol of Zeal, at the very entrance of the gate. But those who attribute the idol of Zeal, either to the possession or to the glory of God or the spirit, do impious things, by changing the persona of the idol, altering the majesty of God.


<h2 id='tocuniq105'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) And he said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing? The great abominations that the house of Israel is committing here, to make me go far away from my sanctuary? Yet again, you will see even greater abominations. Do not think, he said, that I am unjustly abandoning the temple and leaving the city to be destroyed. Look at what they are doing in the temple. And when you see that, do not think that their wickedness will end, you will still see even greater things. Indeed, this can also be understood about our Jerusalem and our temple, when we commit the crimes of idols in the house of God, following the example of Ophni and Phinees (2 Kings 2); and we fornicate with those who have vowed themselves to the service and ministry of God; and we seize the choice offerings of His sacrifices, giving them to clients and servants for their own use, and we do everything for the sake of profit. But if these things that we see are so great, how much greater must be the things that escape human conscience?


<h2 id='tocuniq106'>(Vers. 7 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 7 and following) And He brought me to the entrance of the courtyard, and I saw, and behold, there was a hole in the wall. And He said to me, Son of man, dig through the wall. So I dug through the wall, and there was a doorway. And He said to me, Go in and see the wicked abominations that they are committing here. This is what I have translated: And I saw, and behold, there was a hole in the wall. This is not found in the Septuagint. And because everything is shown as if in a picture, he says that he saw a hole in the wall and was commanded to dig through it and make it wider, so that he could enter and see what was outside that he could not see before. By which it is shown that, both in the Church and in each of us, greater sins are shown through small vices, and as if through certain holes, one can reach great abominations. For from the fruits the tree is known (Matthew 12:33, 34); and from the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. Words bursting forth are a sign of the interior man: just as lustful language sometimes reveals cunningly hidden vices; and a hidden greed signifies a desire for small things on the inside. For greater things are revealed to the lesser, and conscience cannot be disguised by expression and eyes, while a luxurious and wanton mind shines forth in the face; and the secrets of the heart are revealed by bodily movement and gestures.

<h2 id='tocuniq107'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10) And I entered and saw: and behold, every likeness of creeping things and abomination of animals: and all the idols of the house of Israel were depicted on the wall all around. Not only did the idol of Zele stand at the entrance of the northern gate, but also all the walls of the Temple were painted with various images of idols: so that there was no animal that the painting on the wall did not show. This we see so far in the temples of idols and the shrines of the Gentiles, because foolish religion worships all kinds of beasts. And Virgil says:

Omnigenumque deum monstra, et latrator Anubis, Quasi non et illa sint monstra quae laudat

Against Neptune and Venus, and against Minerva. We are able to show idols depicted on the walls of our temples, when we are subject to all vices, and we depict in our hearts the conscience of sins, and various images. Concerning which it is said in the Psalm: Lord, in your city you will scatter their image (Psalm 72:20). And in another place: Nevertheless, in image man walks around (Psalm 38:7). That is to say, there is no man who does not have some image, either of sanctity or of sin. Therefore, it is said to the furious and the irascible: Fury is to them according to the likeness of a serpent: as of the deaf adder that stoppeth her ears, which will not hear the voice of the charmers (Psalm 57:5). And concerning wicked men: Generation of vipers, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come (Matthew 3:7)? And concerning the sly and deceitful: Go and say to that fox (Luke 13:32). And concerning lovers of women: The horses went insane for the women: each one neighed at his neighbor's wife (Jer. 5:8). Even about beasts and the foolish: Do not be like horses and mules, which have no understanding. And again: Put a bit and bridle on their mouths, those who do not come near you (Ps. 32:9). And many such things. However, what we have set down: And behold, every likeness of creeping things and animals is not found in the Septuagint.


<h2 id='tocuniq108'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) And seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and Jezoniah the son of Saphan stood among them who were standing before the paintings, and each one had a censer in his hand, and the smoke of incense rose from the censers. When it says that seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel held censers in their hands, it shows that there were many other priests who did not do this, but perhaps were held back by other sins. And it mentions specifically that Jezoniah the son of Saphan stood among them, as if he were the chief of their wickedness and sacrilege, who, having abandoned the religion of God, worshipped idols, and in the temple, did not worship the God whose temple it was, but the paintings on the walls. And it is rightly said: Jezonias, son of Saphan, stood in the midst of the standing elders, as a symbol of his judgment and condemnation, because he, as well as those whom he was the leader of, stood firmly in their sins and did not waver in wickedness; rather, they persisted strongly. And the steam of incense, the fog of confusion, and the whirlwind that rose from the offering of sacrilege demonstrated this. This event happened at that time, according to the letter of the law. Furthermore, we must pray that the elders of the house of Israel, by multiplying the sacred number, which is seven, by seven decades, do not stand in their errors and worship the images of idols, and that the sacrilegious vapor does not rise up against God. When we see the worst people gathered, of whom it is written: 'I hate the assembly of evildoers' (Psalm 26:6); and worse than the people are their leaders, and the leader who is in charge of the people and the elders, let us say that Jezoniah stands before the images and each one holds a censer in their hands, worshiping not the majesty of God, but their own opinions, and not offering a pleasing fragrance to God, but a foul odor to idols.


<h2 id='tocuniq109'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12) And he said to me: Surely you see, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel do in darkness, each one in the secrecy of his room. For they say: The Lord does not see us; the Lord has forsaken the land. From this, he says, it is shown what each one does in his own room when they gather together in the temple. But according to the anagogy, it can be better understood that some leaders of the Churches do in darkness things that are even shameful to speak of. This is a hidden person of the heart, of whom it is said: Enter into your inner chamber (Mich. VI, 4). And again: He who sees in secret will repay you. Let each one examine his own conscience, and let him remember the works of darkness in the darkness, and let him know the scripture: Everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest he be accused by the light (John III, 20; I Thess. V). And in themselves they will understand it to be fulfilled: He who is drunk, is drunk at night (Prov. II, 25). For what cannot stand according to the letter. For how many are intoxicated with feasts and banquets of days? But because the drunkenness of the heart offends God, it belongs to darkness, and not to light, therefore whoever is intoxicated, is intoxicated at night. But when the elders of the house of Israel have done evil in the darkness and in the hiddenness of their chambers, and have thought that they can hide from God, then consequently they will say: The Lord does not see us, the Lord has forsaken the earth. There are many sinners who walk according to their own thoughts, who do not believe that God cares about mortal things or that our vices concern Him. Certainly, if we were to think that God sees and is present when we sin, we would never do what displeases Him. Furthermore, it follows that the Lord has abandoned the earth, as is the opinion of some philosophers who, from the movement and constancy of the stars, suspect that there is providence in the heavens and that earthly things are despised, since nothing good or in accordance with order takes place on earth.


<h2 id='tocuniq110'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verse 13, 14). And he said to me: You will still see greater abominations that they (or these) do. And he brought me through the entrance of the gate of the house of the Lord, which faced north; and behold, there were women sitting there, mourning for Adonis. Whom we interpret as Adonis, and in the Hebrew and Syriac languages is called Thamuz. Therefore, because according to the Gentile fable, in the month of June the lover of Venus and the most beautiful young man is killed, and it is narrated that he then revived, they also call the same month by the same name and celebrate an annual commemoration for him, in which he is mourned by women as if dead, and then praised and honored when he revives. And afterwards, when the leaders and elders of the house of Israel saw what had been done in the temple and in the dark chambers, even the vices of women are described, who lament in private the loss of their lovers and rejoice if they are able to obtain them. And because the same Gentile people subtly interpret such fables of poets, which have obscenity, as the killing and resurrection of Adonis, accompanied by lamentation and joy: the former of which he thinks is shown in the seeds that die in the earth, and the latter in the crops in which the dead seeds are reborn; we also call those women who are saddened or excited by the good and evil of the world, with a soft and effeminate spirit: and we say that they lament for Thammuz, namely, those things which are considered the most beautiful in worldly matters.


<h2 id='tocuniq111'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Verse 15, 16.) And he said to me: Surely you have seen, son of man: yet you will see even greater abominations than these. And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord, and behold, at the entrance of the temple of the Lord, between the vestibule and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east, and they were worshiping the sun in the east. We interpreted this vestibule to be near Symmachus, who placed the πρόπυλον, because the LXX and Theodotion translated the Hebrew word for it as Aelam (): Aquila's first edition, προστάδα: second edition, was interpreted as the Aelam of the temple, which we can express as the portico of the temple: or the covered courtyard that was between the temple and the altar. And as we read above, after the idol of Zeal, which appeared at the Northern Gate: You will still see even greater abominations; and the pictures of all the beasts that the seventy priests and Jezonias, son of Saphan, were worshiping were shown on the wall, with the censers in their hands. It is said a second time: You will still see even greater abominations, which these people do, because the women were sitting and mourning for Adonis; and after the third sin, it is said: You will still see even greater abominations than these. But what is the greatest abomination of the three previous sins? Namely, the fourth that follows: Behold, at the entrance of the temple of the Lord, between the vestibule and the altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east, and they worshipped the rising sun. They did this because they despised the Lord, that is, the Creator, and worshipped the sun, that is, the creature of the Lord, as the Lord Himself commanded through Moses (Deut. XII), that they should not worship God against the east in the manner of the Gentiles: but wherever they were in the world, whether to the east, or to the west, or to the south, or to the north, they should worship toward the temple, where it was believed the Lord dwelled in the Holy of Holies. Indeed, we read in Daniel (Dan. VI) that he did this in Babylon, who, with the windows of his upper room open, worshipped the Lord opposite the temple, which was in Jerusalem. That this was sacrilege according to the letter, no one doubts. According to allegory, he will be able to know that all heretics are worse than their predecessors, that is, the idol of Zeal and the painted figures of animals on the wall, and the lamentation for Adonis, through which idolatry and pleasures are demonstrated, he who understands the prophet saying: But you hate discipline, and you have cast my words behind you (Ps. XLIX, 17). And in another place: They turned against me the back and not the face (Jer. II, 27). Do we not know Marcion and the other heretics, who tear apart the old Testament, despising the Creator, that is, the just God, and worship and adore another false good God, whom they have invented from their own imagination? And all the heretics of our time, who preach that the Son of God is a creature, and yet adore him, confess with their own words that they adore a creature, having deserted the temple of divinity and turned their backs to it. But we worship the sun of righteousness in such a way that we worship God in the temple of the old Testament, where the Law and the Prophets, where the Cherubim and the mercy seat are. These twenty-five men we have translated, the seventy placed twenty, and in some copies, five from Theodotion were added.

<h2 id='tocuniq112'>91 (Vers. 17.)</h2>

91 (Ver. 17.) And he said to me: Surely you have seen, O son of man: Is it a light thing to the house of Judah, that they commit the abominations which they have committed here, because they have filled the land with wickedness and turned to provoke me? And behold, they put the branch to their nose. For we have said: And behold, they put the branch to their nose, the LXX translated: and behold, they are like mockers, to whom Theodotion added: They stretch out the branch; so that it is all together: And behold, they stretch out the branch as if mocking. About this, Symmachus interprets it as if they emit a sound like a song through their nostrils. However, it signifies twenty-five men who are positioned firmly in a square formation and, through their five senses, create a square shape. They not only have a temple behind them, but they also attach a branch to their nostrils, resembling idols. Undoubtedly, this signifies that they worship idols, which in Greek are called βαΐα. Finally, Job says among the other virtues that he has also had this, that he has never looked at the sky and the sun, and the moon, and the shining stars, and kissed his hand (Job. XXXI), that is, worshipped creatures. However, Symmachus' interpretation means a foul and hoarse sound coming from the nostrils in contempt of God. And all heretics, who have filled the earth with injustice, and turned to the knowledge of false names, in order to provoke the Lord to anger, are to be regarded: when they wanted to praise God, they would blaspheme with an ugly sound, or consider the God of the Old Testament of little importance, mock, and despise Him.


<h2 id='tocuniq113'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) Therefore, I will also act in fury: My eye will not spare, nor will I have compassion. And when they cry out to my ears with a loud voice, I will not listen to them. Moreover, the following phrase, 'And when they cry out to my ears with a loud voice, I will not listen to them,' is not found in the Septuagint. For all the things they have done, I will act in fury and my eye will not spare, nor will I have compassion,' says the Lord. When the ancient heretics heard this, they falsely accused the Creator of being cruel and bloodthirsty; and they did not consider the Apostle Paul, who is certainly an apostle of the good God (as they claim), writing to the Corinthians, 'If I come again, I will not spare' (2 Corinthians 12:2), in order to discipline the wrongdoers with a rod and bring the wanderers back to salvation. For those who do not understand what is beneficial for themselves, and frequently pray for the opposite, it is expedient that they are not heard by the Lord. Hence, in the Lord's Prayer, we say: Thy will be done (Matt. VI, 10). Not our own will, which is accustomed to err: but Thy will, which knows the future. And sometimes it is of great happiness to not deserve mercy in the present. Therefore, the Lord will not spare those who are from the house of Judah and have departed from the confession of the Church. And when they cry out with a loud voice, about which the Lord has said: Their cry has come to me (Genesis XVIII): yet the Lord will not hear them, so that, being compelled by their evils, they may understand what they have done.

<h2 id='tocuniq114'>(Chap. IX.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter IX—Verse 1) And he cried out in my ears with a loud voice, saying: The visitations of the city have drawn near. In place of visitations, the Seventy translated 'vengeance.' For I will exact vengeance, and I will repay, says the Lord (Deuteronomy 32:35). And every vengeance is like that of a sick person, like one who has wounds, like someone waiting for healing hands, according to what is written elsewhere: I will visit their iniquities with a rod, and their sins with lashes, but I will not take away my mercy from them (Psalm 88:33-34). And rightly (as we have said above), a visit or revenge is said to be approaching with imminent captivity.

And each person has a vessel of destruction in their hand. He did not say, he had, as the Septuagint translated. For he does not narrate the past, but demonstrates the present and the future. Therefore, whoever strikes evil people because they are evil and has vessels of destruction in order to kill the worst, is a servant of the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq115'>(Vers. 2, 3.)</h2>

(Verses 2, 3) And behold, six men were coming from the way of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his weapon of destruction in his hand. And there was one man among them clothed in linen, with a scribe's inkhorn at his side. They went in and stood beside the bronze altar. And the glory of the God (Vulgate: Lord) of Israel went up from the cherub on which it rested to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the scribe's inkhorn at his side. According to the lines, which we have interpreted alongside Symmachus, LXX, ποδήρη; Theodotius translated the Hebrew word Baddim (); Aquila, the chief, interpreted. Again, when we said, and the writer's inkwell at his kidneys, they put LXX: And a sapphire belt on his kidneys; Theodotius, the scribal pen in his hand; Aquila, μελανοδοχεῖον, that is, the writer's inkwell at his loins; Symmachus had writing tablets at his kidneys. And when we moved, the threshold of the house, the Seventy and Theodotion, the open area, that is, placed the entrance under the sky. As for the vase, which each man held in his hands, only the Seventy interpreted it as an axe. Therefore, in order to atone for the sins of man, who were made on the sixth day of the creation of the world, six men come and descend from the upper gate, or as the Seventy translated, the heights to the North. And each person had an ax in their hands, about which John speaks: For now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire (Matt. III, Luke III, 9). And in the middle of the six men there was one, that is, the seventh, dressed in the garments of a high priest, made of linen, and he had a scribe's inkwell at his kidneys, with which he would record the sins of all and separate the number of holy individuals from the sinners: or a sapphire belt of the color of a sapphire stone, which is in the ornaments of the high priest. Six men went out and stood next to the brazen altar. There were two altars: one for burning incense, golden inside; and the other in front of the temple, bronze for burnt offerings. They are said to stand ready by the altar to carry out the commands of the one who commands, so that if they see any sins not forgiven there, they may know the judgment of the Lord and subject themselves to his punishment. The glory of the God of Israel also ascended, or was taken up, from one Cherub and went to the threshold, or to the inner court of the house and vestibule, which is not covered but enjoys the freedom of the air. The glory of the Lord Himself called the man, who was in the attire of a high priest and had an inkwell in his loins, and said what the Scripture testifies. Some interpret the six men as six Angels who obey the will of God, and they understand the one who had the attire of a high priest as the Savior; in accordance with that, the Priest is both the Angel of great counsel and that which is said: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek (Psalm 110:4). However, what the Seventy translated as 'podērē' is one of the eight vestments of the high priest, which is called 'talaris' in Latin; and it receives this name because it reaches down to the feet. I know that I published a book about the vestments of the high priest many years ago, and I am sending the reader the explanation of it. For I cannot say everything in every place, and when I asked Aquila and Theodotion what the Hebrew word 'כַּ֫סְתָּ֥ח' meant, they replied to me in Greek that it is called 'καλαμάριον', because it is adorned with reeds. We call ink 'atramentarium' because it contains ink. Many people call it a more significant name, 'thecas', because they are the cases of writing quills. Of the four Cherubim, one Cherub is sent from the glory of the Lord's majesty to speak to the one who was clothed in the garments of the pontiff. And although many think that 'τὰ χερουβεὶμ' should be said in the neutral gender and plural number, we must know that 'Cherub' is singular in number, masculine in gender, and its plural is 'Cherubim' of the same gender: not because there is gender among the ministers of God, but because each thing is called by different genders according to the properties of their language. Angels are called by the plural number Malachim, and Cherubim, and Seraphim of the same kind and number. Furthermore, Sabaoth, which is interpreted as hosts or armies and virtues, are called by the feminine gender, plural number, and end in the final syllable Oth (). However, those who want the Savior to be understood under the figure of a pontiff use the example from the Book of Revelation of John, in which it is written: And I turned and saw a voice that spoke with me. And when I turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, and so on.

<h2 id='tocuniq116'>(Vers. 4 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 4 and following) And the Lord said to him: Go through the middle of the city, in the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who groan and lament over all the abominations that are done in the midst of it. And to the others he said while I was listening: Go through the city after him and strike. Your eye shall not spare, nor shall you show pity. Old men, young men and maidens, little children and women, kill them all to total destruction. But on whomsoever you shall see Thau, ye shall not kill him: and begin ye at my sanctuary. So they began with the ancient men who were before the house. Or, as the Hebrews understand it, because the Law is called Torah among them, which is written with the letter at the beginning of its name; those who have fulfilled the precepts of the Law received this sign. And to come to our point, the ancient Hebrew letters, which the Samaritans still use today, have the shape of the letter Thau at the end, which bears resemblance to a cross, which is painted on the foreheads of Christians and is frequently marked in handwriting. There are those who think that, because in the Hebrew alphabet this is the last letter, it is demonstrated that the remains of the saints survive in a multitude of sinners. Therefore, those who groan and lament are saved; those who not only did not consent to evil deeds, but also mourned the sins of others, just as Samuel mourned over Saul (3 Kings 16), and the apostle Paul mourned over those who did not repent after sin. And he himself also said: We who are in this tabernacle groan (2 Cor. 5:2). And elsewhere: I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart (or in my mind) (Al. cordi meo). And it is commanded to the six men that they should kill everyone except those who can say: The light of your face, O Lord, is signed upon us (Psalm 4:7), that they should spare neither the old man, nor the young man, nor the virgin, nor the little child, nor the woman. According to a mystical understanding, the old men are those in the Church of whom it is said: The gray hairs of a man are his prudence (Wisdom 4:8); the young men are those who are most ready for the battles of faith; the virgins are those who preserve chastity with their whole mind; the little children are those who drink milk of infancy and have not yet perceived solid food; the women are those who, by the weakness of their sex, reveal the frailty of the soul. To all of these, no mercy is shown if they believe themselves to be something without the seal of Christ. And what follows: 'And begin from my sanctuary,' or as the Seventy have translated, 'begin from my saints,' which means the priests who served in the temple and worshipped idols; or those who were called holy due to their merit in the priesthood among the people, and who were the first to deserve punishment for the sins of the people. For it is time, as it is written in I Corinthians 7, that judgment begin from the house of God.


<h2 id='tocuniq117'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) They therefore began with the older men who were before the house. And he said to them: Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Fill the courts with the slain. For the courts, which are called the Asroth in Hebrew, the Seventy set up roads. However, the older men, of whom we read above that they had censers and offered incense to idols, are killed. There is no longer any religious worship in the temple, for, having offended the God of religion, all things are defiled, so that where there is sin, there is also judgment. The atriums are filled with corpses in the temple, and not the streets, which were certainly outside, unless we can perhaps understand the streets as the city squares. The angels could not dare to defile the temple with the blood of the dead, in which the glory of God previously dwelt, unless the Lord of departing glory commanded it. Everyone who is dead because of sin defiles the atriums of the temple and the streets of the Lord's city, in which he lives. But when he rises again with Christ, he ceases to be dead.


And they went out and struck those who were in the city. Or, as others have translated: they struck the city, calling the city itself the ones who were in the city.

<h2 id='tocuniq118'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

And when the slaughter was complete, I remained: and I fell upon my face, and crying out I said: Alas, Lord God, wilt thou then destroy all the remnant of Israel, pouring out thy fury upon Jerusalem? For when all those who did not have the seal were slain, the prophet fell down on his face, thinking that no one except himself had remained among the dead. And because this seemed to be contrary to the commandment that the Lord had given, that the men with sealed foreheads should not be slain, it was therefore removed from the Vulgate edition. But we, following the Hebrew truth, have established, I remained. And it should be noted that He did not say alone: as if He had said, it seemed to be contrary; but I remained, so that it is understood with the others who had marked foreheads. But in order to know distinctly what is said here, I remained, in the book of Kings, when Elijah speaks to God: Your altars have been demolished, and I alone have been left, and they seek to take my life (1 Kings 19:14); He said alone, because He did not know that others had remained. Some think that, from the person of the Lord in whose likeness Ezekiel preceded, this can be understood of the people of the Jews: when all turned aside, they became useless together (Psalm XIII). And the Prophet testifies: Save me, O Lord: for the holy one has failed (Psalm II, 1). For only the Lord has been found who did not sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth (1 Peter II). But what he inflicted, pouring out your fury upon Jerusalem, the word of outpouring shows the magnitude of the punishments, as we read elsewhere: Scorn has been poured out upon the princes (Psalm CVI, 40). And again: My steps have almost slipped (Psalm 73:2). And in a good way. The love of God has been poured out into our hearts (Romans 5:5). And: Grace has been poured upon your lips (Psalm 45:3). And on the contrary: Pour out your fury upon the nations that do not know you, and upon the kingdoms that do not invoke your name (Jeremiah 10; Psalm 79:6). And: Draw out your spear and stop those who pursue me (Psalm 35:3).


<h2 id='tocuniq119'>(Vers. 9, 10.)</h2>

(Verse 9, 10.) And he said to me: The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. And the land is filled with blood, and the city is filled with perversity. For they said: The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see. Therefore, I will not show pity nor have mercy: I will repay their ways upon their heads. Seeing his prophet weep for the people, the Lord, in his great anger, explains the reasons: not as he thought, unjust or excessive punishment, but a deserved and just sentence. Iniquity, he says, is great among the ten tribes of Israel and the two tribes of Judah, and not only great, but exceedingly great. And he not only said this once, but repeated it forcefully, so that the punishment is as great as the magnitude of the iniquity. From this we learn, contrary to what most people think, especially the Stoics, that sins are not equal; but rather, they are either great or small, and the judgement of the punisher varies according to the quality and quantity of the sinners. 'The land is filled,' he says, 'with blood,' or as the Septuagint translates, with peoples; and the city is filled with aversion, or as the Vulgate edition has it, with iniquity and uncleanness. Not a small amount of blood has been shed, but from one end of the city to the other; and the whole city has turned away from the worship of God, and as a result it is filled with uncleanness, clearly of idolatrous filth. But the cause of such great crimes is that they believed there is no providence over the earth, nor does God care about mortal things, according to what we read elsewhere (Virgil, Book IV, Aeneid).

Undoubtedly it is a task for the gods, this concern disturbs their tranquility. Because therefore they either thought that there is no providence, or that which was in other nations has now abandoned its own people: on account of this, the eye of God will not spare, nor will it have mercy: so that raging against vices, it may be appeased by virtues, and may repay their ways and sins upon their heads, either upon the principal (ἡγεμονικὸν) of the heart, or upon the leaders of the people, according to the book of Numbers, in which the leaders of the people are said to be the heads of the people.


<h2 id='tocuniq120'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11) And behold, a man who was clothed in linen, who had a writing utensil at his waist, answered saying, 'I have done as you commanded me.' LXX: And behold, a man who was clothed in a long robe and had a belt around his waist, answered and said, 'I have done as you commanded me.' He is the man who was commanded to pass through the midst of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it. He says that he has fulfilled the commandments of the Lord, and has marked the foreheads of the mourners with the seal of the letter Tau (or armed them). But the six men to whom the Lord commanded, saying: Go through the city following him, and strike; show no mercy to anyone until complete destruction, do not report such a thing. For they filled not the sentiment of joy, but of sorrow, which is proven not by words, but by actions. And in this place, instead of ποδήρη, which is translated by the Seventy as a long robe, Theodotion placed the Hebrew word Baddim (); Symmachus, a rope; Aquila, a main robe, or a stole. Symmachus also placed the tablets; Aquila, the inkwell; Theodotius, the helmet.

<h2 id='tocuniq121'>(Chap. X.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 10, Verses 1, 2) And I saw, and behold, in the firmament that was above the heads of the cherubim was as a sapphire stone: and the likeness of a throne appeared upon it. And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said: Enter between the wheels that are under the cherubim, and fill your hands with burning coals, which are between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. Let it suffice to have said of the firmament that was above the cherubim, and of the sapphire stone that had the likeness of a throne, and of the wheels that accompanied the living creatures. Now concerning what is commanded to the man clothed with linen, for whom the Septuagint in this place have interpreted as a robe, to take the burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter or sprinkle them over the city, it seems to me that it signifies, after the slaughter and killing of many, and the corpses of the dead on the streets, the taking up of burning coals to punish or cleanse Jerusalem, according to what is written in Isaiah: He has made him holy in a burning fire, and it will consume like dry grass (Isa. 10:17). These are the coals which the Prophet, desiring to remedy the burning of his tongue, asks: What shall be given to you, and what shall be added for your deceitful tongue? Sharp arrows with desolating coals (Psalm 120:3, 4). And many similar passages we can find in the Holy Scriptures, of which we have often spoken. It is important to note only that in Isaiah, who had sinned so much in speech and claimed to have unclean lips, a coal is taken up with tongs for cleansing. But here, because the city was full of wickedness, and after punishments with the corpses of the dead, many coals of fire are taken up, and not with one hand, but with both, so that all of Jerusalem may be cleansed. Although it should also be understood that the taking up of burning coals is not for cleansing, but for punishment and torment, which are poured out over Jerusalem.

<h2 id='tocuniq122'>(Vers. 3 seqq.)</h2>

(Verses 3 and following) And he entered in my sight. But the cherubim stood at the right side of the house, when the man entered, and the cloud filled the inner courtyard. And the glory of the Lord was lifted up from the cherub to the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the courtyard was filled with the splendor of the glory of the Lord. And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard up to the outer courtyard, like the voice of God Almighty speaking. And when he commanded the man who was dressed in linen, saying: Take fire from the middle of the wheels, which are between the cherubim: he entered and stood beside the wheel. And the cherub stretched forth his hand from the midst of the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it and went out. And there appeared in the cherubim the likeness of a hand of a man under their wings. Then the prophet, seeing the vision, approached the man who was clothed in a long linen garment or tunic. And according to the Septuagint now they change the interpretation, the holy vestment, when among the Hebrews it is called Baddim, and the other interpreters persist in the translation they have begun. However, as it is said in the second part, he entered into the midst of the wheels, which are beneath the Cherubim, to fill his hands with burning coals. When he had entered, he stood only next to the wheel, either out of sadness for the punishment of Jerusalem, or out of astonishment at the greatness of glory, he himself did not put his hand into the fire, but one of the Cherubim, that is, the Cherub, put his hand into the fire and took the fire, which was in the midst of the Cherubim, and gave it into the hand of the one who was clothed in linen garments. The one receiving went out; and yet Scripture does not say what he did, so that it would leave the narration of the sad event to our understanding rather than subjecting it to our eyes. But when the man entered, who was dressed in linen garments, the Cherubim stood on the right side of the house, so that they seemed to hold the right part of the house of God, as holy and heavenly powers, and those who are sent for punishment, of whom it is written: 'He sent upon them the heat of his anger, fury and indignation and trouble, a sending of evil angels.' (Psalm 78:49), may be believed to possess the left parts. And when the glory of the Lord was lifted up from the cherub, who was about to deliver coals of fire to the man; and it passed over to the threshold of the house, immediately the cloud, darkness, and gloom fill the inner courtyard. For in the presence of the majesty of the Lord, no punishments are carried out, and the glory of the Lord is seen in the courtyard, of which it is written: The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer courtyard. For the Hebrew word for sound is used instead of the Latin word voice: and this sound had a resemblance to the voice of God Almighty speaking. Why they translated it as seventy: as the voice of God Saddai (); which Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotio translated as suitable, which signifies strong and powerful. Note, reader, in which they agree, and in which they differ, so that from the comparison of both, without our admonition, you may understand the divine sacraments, and that which I mentioned before, that both in the firmament and on the throne, and in the hand of man, it is not called untruth but resemblance. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known. (I Corinthians 13)

<h2 id='tocuniq123'>(Vers. 8 seqq.)</h2>

(Versed 8 and following) And I saw, and behold, there were four wheels beside the Cherubim. One wheel beside one Cherub, and another wheel beside another Cherub. The appearance of the wheels was like the gleam of a chrysolite stone, and they all had the same likeness, like a wheel within a wheel. When they moved, they went in the four directions without turning as they went. And the wheels went toward the place where the first wheel went, and they followed in its tracks and did not turn back. And all their bodies, and necks, and hands, and wings, and circles, were full of eyes all around the four wheels. And these wheels he called voluble, as I heard. But it had four faces. One face, the face of a Cherub; and the second face, the face of a man; and in the third, the face of a lion; and in the fourth, the face of an eagle. And the Cherubim were elevated. Notice what was before, or how many species of wheels, according to the Septuagint, like the appearance of a beryl: but now, according to the same, like the appearance of a carbuncle; so that the likeness of wings being moved by fire, which is attributed to the Cherub, may be shown: although in Hebrew, both above and here, it is written 'beryl,' which the Eagle translated as 'chrysolite' and Symmachus as 'hyacinth.' And again, when we turn to them: And the whole body of them, which is understood to be of the wheels, is written in Hebrew: And all their flesh, and necks, and hands, and feathers, and circles. Note that flesh is called in heavenly powers, as when we read: Flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of God, neither shall corruption possess incorruption (I Cor. XV), let us know that not the substance of the flesh, but the works, are condemned: For Basar () which is written in this place, signifies not the body, but rather flesh. But he called the circles of wheels, iron edges, by which the roundness of the wood is constrained and tightened. And these wheels not only have flesh, or bodies, or limbs: but also necks, and hands, and feathers, so that we perceive the effectiveness of things in each, not images of limbs. The wheels themselves are also called in the Hebrew tongue Gelgel, which Symmachus interpreted as revolving, and Aquila as a wheel. Furthermore, what follows: When I was listening, until the place where it is written: The Cherubim are lifted up, it is not found in the Septuagint; but it has been added from the Hebrew. In which it is to be noted that, as stated above, there are not, as it were, four faces on the right and four faces on the left: the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right, and the face of a calf on the left, and the face of an eagle; so that they are believed to be different on the left and on the right. But an equal order of all is described, with Scripture saying: Yet it had four faces: one face, the face of a Cherub, and the second face, the face of a man; and in the third, the face of a lion; and in the fourth, the face of an eagle; so that the first and second, and third, and fourth faces, are described not by the difference of places on the right and the left, but by one order of degrees. He named the first face Cherub, which he had spoken about earlier as the face of a calf. From this, it is understood that the face of the Cherub is the face of a calf. The explanation of this vision includes the meaning of all these things.

<h2 id='tocuniq124'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 15 seqq.) It is a creature that I saw beside the river Chobar. And when the Cherubim walked, the wheels also went beside them. And when the Cherubim lifted their wings to be lifted up from the ground, the wheels did not resist, but were also beside them. When they stood, they stood, and when they were lifted up, they were lifted up. For the spirit of life was in them. All things live to God and feel their Creator. For God is not the God of the dead but of the living (Matthew 22:32). And all the bodies of the wheels are full of eyes  (Supra I) . And in the psalm it is said: The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands. Day unto day speaks forth speech, and night unto night reveals knowledge  (Ps. 19:1-2) . The sun also and the moon, the sea and the rivers, the mountains and hills praise God, and in their own cycle they revolve through the years, and we perceive the order of the heavens on earth, so that, by preserving the order of the ancient law, they may turn and run; and let us not see anything new upon the earth. But when it is said, 'It is an animal, which I saw by the river Chobar' (Ecclesiastes 1)', Scripture shows that we should understand the same thing in the interpretation of 'animal' as we understood above.

<h2 id='tocuniq125'>(Vers. 18 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 18 seqq.) And the glory of the Lord went forth from the threshold of the Temple and stood over the Cherubim. And the Cherubim lifted up their wings and were exalted from the ground before me. And as they went, the wheels also followed them. And it stood at the entrance of the gate of the house of the Lord, which faces east, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. It is the creature that I saw beneath the God of Israel, by the river Chebar, and I understood that they were Cherubim. Four, through four faces to one: and four wings to one, and the likeness of the hands of a man under their wings: and the likeness of their faces, the very faces which I had seen by the river Chobar, and their looks, and the way each one went forward to his own front. The glory of the Lord, or the majesty, which had stood in the entrance of the temple, stood over the cherubims. They lifting up their wings, and the prophet seeing, were raised up: and the wheels followed them: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them. First, he was in the temple, then he stood in the courtyard of the temple or at the threshold. As he was departing from the temple, clouds and darkness filled the inner sanctuary of the temple. And once again, the glory itself sat upon the cherubim, and as they immediately flew away and departed to the outside, the wheels followed. And the glory stood at the gate of the house of the Lord facing east, not at the entrance of the temple, but behind the courtyard and threshold at the entrance of the gate of the house of the Lord facing east. When the prophet saw this, he said, 'It is the creature that I saw beneath the God of Israel by the river Chobar, and I understood that they were cherubim.' For what new thing had he seen, which he understood to be Cherubim, which he had not understood before? Cherubim, in our language, is a multitude of knowledge: the knowledge of the sacraments of God, and his throne and rest. Therefore, it is said in the psalm: You who sit above the Cherubim, reveal yourself. (Ps. LXXIX, 2). For the glory of the Lord always resides in the multitude of knowledge; and it is manifested when all things are shown by divine providence; nothing happens by chance, nor does anyone say anything without reason: The Lord has abandoned the earth, and the Lord does not see. (Supra IX, 9). Wherefore also, having beheld the cherubim and their desire, is to forget the things that are past, and to stretch forth unto those which are before (Philippians 3).

<h2 id='tocuniq126'>(Chap. XI.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter XI — Verse 1) And the spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the Lord, which faces east and overlooks the rising sun. For the glory of the Lord had come out from the threshold of the temple and stood over the cherubim. And as the cherubim lifted their wings and rose from the ground, the glory of the Lord also stood at the entrance of the gate of the house of the Lord, facing east. And the prophet, unable to approach it himself, was lifted up by the spirit and taken to the same gate of the house of the Lord, which faces the sun of righteousness, as it is written: Behold the man whose name is the East (Zach. VI, 12), so that he would not remain in the temple, which was clouded by the veil of ignorance, but would stand at the gate of the house of the Lord facing east, where he could understand the sacred mysteries that follow.


<h2 id='tocuniq127'>(Vers. 2 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 2 onwards) And behold, at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men, and in their midst I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the princes of the people. And he said to me, Son of man, these men devise iniquity and give wicked counsel in this city, saying, 'The houses have been recently built. This is the pot, but we are the meat.' Therefore, prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man. And the spirit of the Lord rushed upon me, and he said to me, speak: Thus says the Lord: So you have spoken, O house of Israel, and I know the thoughts of your heart. You have killed many in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain. Therefore thus says the Lord God: Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, they are the meat, and this city is the pot, but you shall be brought out of the midst of it. You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, declares the Lord God. And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and give you into the hands of foreigners, and execute judgments upon you. I will judge you with the sword of the Chaldeans; you shall know that I am the Lord. This will not be a pot for you, and you shall not be in the midst of it as flesh. I will judge you at the borders of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord. The following is not found in the Septuagint, but is added from the Hebrew: Because you have not walked in my commandments and have not kept my judgments, but have acted according to the judgments of the nations that surround you. The prophet is assumed according to what is written: The Lord raises the meek (Ps. 146:6); whether he is lifted up from the earth and brought into the eastern gate of the Lord's house, so that he may know the oaths of the twenty-five men who were at the entrance of the gate, and the sons of Jezaniah the son of Azur, and Paltheiah the son of Benaiah, the princes of the people. Therefore, those who were at the entrance of the eastern gate of the Lord's house, despairing of salvation and prepared for destruction by the consciousness of their crimes, and not desiring to correct their sins through repentance, say: Although recently houses have been rebuilt that had fallen, yet we know that this city is like a pot, and we are like the flesh in it, to be consumed and burned, according to what is written in Isaiah: If a tempest passes by, it will not harm us (Isa. 28:15). While they were saying these things, the spirit of the Lord rushed upon the prophet; and for a second time he commanded him to prophesy and say: Because you have spoken these things and the secrets of your hearts are not hidden from me, I will interpret for you how the city will be transformed into a cauldron, and you yourselves will be considered as meat: not according to the sense in which you spoke, but according to another sense which you do not fear. Indeed, the city is like a cauldron, but it will not be filled with your flesh; rather with the flesh of those whom you have killed. But you, who consider yourselves to be dying in this city, I will bring out from the midst of the city and deliver into the hands of the enemy. I will execute judgments against you. And when you have fallen by the sword, you shall not be in the city, nor outside the boundaries of Israel, but rather in the borders of your own province, then you will know that I am the Lord. And it is furthermore said: In the borders of Israel I will judge you, and you will know that I am the Lord. But you will endure all these things because you have not walked in my commandments, and you have not observed my judgments, but have committed the abominations of the surrounding nations. And when it is clear according to the literal sense of what is said, omitting for a moment the names of Jezoniah, Azur, Phaltiah, and Benaiah, which we reserve for another time, it must be said that even to this day in the Church, which is the house of the Lord, and before the gate, and at the entrance, or at the way of the gate, which signifies the Savior, through whom we enter to the Father, there are twenty-five men who represent everything concerning the senses. And as far as my memory serves me, I have never been able to find this number in a positive sense; although in Leviticus twenty-five years are chosen for the priestly ministry; for in Hebrew it does not have this number, which is said in the Seventy, but thirty, which is contained in the beginning of this prophet and the age of the Lord, when He came to the banks of the Jordan and was baptized by John (Luke 3). But in the Gospel there are found five wise virgins and five foolish ones (Matthew 25), let us know that this number is placed in the middle and can be applied to either the good or the bad, depending on the users. Therefore, these men, who refer everything to the senses and have two principles, as we mentioned above, are contained in the dual number, which divides unity, and in the number of the second day, does not seem to be from the Lord, according to the Hebrew truth. And in Noah's Ark, two by two unclean animals are brought in (Genesis 6). But the Lord, restricting division into one, made both one, and broke down the middle wall, condemning enmities in His flesh (Ephesians 2). Therefore, He speaks more augustly and sublimely: I and the Father are one (John 10:30), so that He may bring us from the Judaic duality into the unity of the Christian faith. Finally, with the priesthood of the Jews being lost, the Lord suffered not under one ruler, but under two, Annas and Caiaphas, to show the dividedness of their religion (False). There are many at the entrance of this gate in front of the house of the Lord of the East, who are compared to their own nations in vices, and in the conscience of sins despair of salvation, and say: The city in which we live is a cauldron, and we are all flesh, and we will be consumed by the burning Babylon, whose fiery arrows are: unwilling to repent and despairing of salvation; therefore they hear that they themselves are not the flesh of the past and lost city, but those whom they have scandalized and killed. And so the sword is drawn against them, so that after they have been judged not among the nations, but among Christians in the land of Israel, they may then know that He Himself is the Lord, according to what is read in the Psalms: When He killed them, they sought Him (Psalm 77:34), so that by the torments they may come to know Him whom they did not recognize through His blessings.

<h2 id='tocuniq128'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Phaltias son of Banajae died. And I fell on my face, crying out with a loud voice, and I said, Alas, alas, alas, Lord God, are you making an end of the remnant of Israel? As the prophet prophesied, one of the two chief princes, Phaltias son of Banajae, dies. He is interpreted as falling ruin, and he is the son of a builder or mason, for οἰκοδόμος cannot be translated into our language otherwise. Another prince is preserved unharmed, Jezonias son of Azur. Jezonias serves as his ears, that which is subaudible to the soul. Azur, on the other hand, serves as his support or help. Therefore, he who falls away from the Lord, and was in a state of very bad construction, falls rightly, as prophesied by him, whom God strengthened. But he who obeys the commands of God, and is sustained and supported by his help, rightly remains in the leadership of the people. We read in Exodus (Chapter II), after Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, died, the sons of Israel groaned from the works of mud, straw, and bricks, and cried out to the Lord, whom they could not cry out to while he was alive. Isaiah also (Chapter VI), after the death of King Uzziah, who was leprous, saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the Seraphim standing around him; and understanding that his lips were unclean, and he dwelt among a people with unclean lips, he deserved to have a hot coal sent from the altar, and his lips were cleansed of impurity. In this situation, with the strength of God prophesying, the prince who had turned away from the service of the Lord falls in order to be elevated by Christ. For if the resurrection is of the Lord, then the downfall is of the devil. In this, it is sought how it is spoken of the Savior. Behold, here He is placed in ruin, and the resurrection of many in Israel (Luke II, 34). In the ruin of those who were standing wickedly, and in the resurrection of those who had fallen. When the prophet saw this, he fell on his face, not by the merit of sinning, but by the affection of lamenting; and with a loud voice, which came from great fervor of faith, he cried out three times, and said, Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, are you bringing about the consummation of the remnant of Israel? And there is this understanding: Even the remnants themselves, which seemed to exist in the people, are destroyed when you are displeased.

<h2 id='tocuniq129'>(Vers. 14 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 14 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, your brothers, your brothers: the men near you and all the house of Israel, all of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said: Depart far from the Lord: to us the land has been given as possession. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: because I have removed them far off among the nations, and because I have scattered them among the lands, I will be a small sanctification for them in the lands which they have come to. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, your brothers and the men of your captivity, and all the house of Israel is consumed; to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said: You are far off from the Lord; to us is given the land in possession. Therefore say: Thus saith the Lord God: Because I will remove them far off among the nations, and because I will disperse them in the countries, and will be to them a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. First, we must discuss the variety of interpretations. Because in the Hebrew it says, 'the men who are near to you' (for this is the meaning of 'Goolathach'), the LXX translated it as 'the men of your captivity'. Then it follows: 'all whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem told'; instead of 'all', they put 'those' due to the ambiguity of the letters and the word. 'Chullo', which Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion translated as 'all', they rendered as 'consummated', which does not make any sense at all in terms of the meaning. Therefore, the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel, who had said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, are you bringing to an end the remnant of Israel? Specifically, through the death of Phaltiel and those who were killed with him, because those were not the remnants that the prophet thought were in Jerusalem, but rather those who appeared to be captive in Babylon. And the meaning is this: O son of man, your brothers, who were born of the same lineage as you, your brothers, I say, to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem said, you have turned away from the Lord because you are captives, and you have given yourselves to Jechoniah, but to us the land of Israel has been given as an eternal possession. So tell them that though I have sent them far away from the land of Israel and scattered them among the nations and commanded them to be in foreign lands, because they have obeyed my command, I will be with them even in foreign and hostile places for a small sanctification. As long as there are some among them who do not submit their necks to idolatry but remember God's commandments, like Daniel and the three young men, it is to be believed that there were others like them, in the likeness of such great rulers that Scripture now recalls (Dan. III). From all these things we learn that we should not insult those who have been handed over to punishment by the judgment of God, nor reproach a person who has turned away from their sins, nor should we ever say to those who repent and leave the Church: 'You have gone far away from the Lord; the land has been given to us as a possession.' For thus says the Lord: Although I have temporarily separated them from my Church and scattered them among the nations, I will still be for them a sanctification, as long as they remember their sins and hasten to return to their former dwelling places due to repentance.

(Verse 17 and following) Therefore, speak and say, 'Thus says the Lord God: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. And they shall go there and remove all offenses and all abominations from it. And I will give them one heart (or I will give them a new heart) and put a new spirit within them; I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, so that they may walk in my statutes and keep my ordinances and do them; then they shall be my people, and I will be their God.' But as for those whose heart follows their detestable things and abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads," declares the Lord God. This is a divine message to those who were captive in the land of Babylon, to the brothers of the prophet Ezekiel, and to the near ones to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem (or Israel) said: 'You have gone far from the Lord, the land has been given to us as a possession.' But these are the words that follow: 'I will gather you from the peoples and give you the land of Israel.' And when you have entered, you shall remove all idols, because of which you have offended God, and I will give you a unified heart of fear and servitude to God, so that you may not serve diverse idols, or any other than what you had before. And I will give a new spirit in your midst, according to what is written: Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me (Psalm 51:12). And I will remove from you a heart of stone, that is, a hard heart, according to what Stephen, the first martyr in Christ, spoke: Stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart (Acts 7:51). And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he would not let the people of Israel go (Exod. VII). And I will give them a heart of flesh, a soft and tender heart, that they may receive the commandments of God, so that they may be written on the tablets of their carnal hearts. Therefore, a soft heart is given and a hard heart is taken away, so that they may walk in my precepts, keep my judgments, and be a people of God. And the Lord, who was previously an adversary, shall be their God. But those who do not correct their previous sins with repentance, but follow after their abominations, I will repay them according to what they deserve, so that their ways may be upon their heads. These things are believed by many to have happened under Zerubbabel, the son of Salathiel, and under Jesus, the son of Josedec, the high priest, and under Ezra and Nehemiah, to the tribe of Judah, and to those who returned with them. The inhabitants of Jerusalem, who were taken captive under King Zedekiah of Judah, or who fled with Jeremiah to Egypt, are believed to have been dispersed into all lands and not to have returned to the city of Jerusalem. But the full conversion of those who were captive and the remnant of Israel is understood in Christ, when the remnant was saved, and three thousand believed in one day, and again five thousand (Acts 2); and others, of whom James speaks to the apostle Paul: Do you see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed? hi, all the imitators of the Law are. But even the proud daily inhabitants of the city of Jerusalem, whose hearts walk after their stumbling blocks and abominations, deserve the offense of God, but those who were outside, with their stony heart removed and a very soft heart accepted, return to the Church through repentance, and they walk in the precepts of the Lord and keep His judgments, and they become the people of the Lord, and the Lord, whom they formerly offended, becomes their God.


<h2 id='tocuniq131'>(Vers. 22, 23.)</h2>

(Verse 22, 23.) And the Cherubim lifted their wings, and the wheels with them, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. And the glory of the Lord ascended from the midst of the city: and stood upon the mountain, which is towards the east of the city. Gradually, the glory of the Lord departed from Jerusalem. First leaving the temple, it stood in the courtyard or at the threshold of the house, and afterwards at the entrance of the Eastern Gate; finally, with its wings and accompanying wheels lifted up, it stood upon the mountain, which is towards the east of the city, no doubt signifying the Mount of Olives, from where the Savior ascended to the Father. And the glory of the Lord stood and went from the city of Jerusalem over the Mount of Olives, as a sign of resurrection and light, so that from there it might behold Jerusalem about to perish and be consumed. And it says: 'The glory departs from the midst of the city' (John 14:31), in other words, the Lord speaks to his disciples: 'Rise, let us go from here' (Luke 13:35). And to the Jews: 'Your house will be left to you desolate' (Matthew 23). Josephus also reports the voice heard in the temple of angels and celestial powers that were previously in the city's defense: 'Let us go from these seats' (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews). And to this present day, in a wondrous manner, the glory of the Lord, which abandoned the temple, stands upon the Mount of Olives, shining forth in the sign of the cross, gazing upon the once-Jewish temple, dissolved into ashes and rubble.

<h2 id='tocuniq132'>(Vers. 24, 25.)</h2>

(Verse 24, 25.) And the spirit lifted me up and brought me to Chaldea for the transmigration in a vision in the spirit of God, and the vision that I had seen was taken away from me. And I spoke to the transmigration all the words of the Lord that he had shown me. Because we have translated from the Hebrew truth: And the vision that I had seen was taken away from me, the LXX translated: And I ascended from the vision that I had seen. Both of which signify not that the prophet was physically transported from Jerusalem to Babylon, but in spirit, the vision that had led him in spirit to Jerusalem was taken away, and he returned to himself and spoke to the transmigration all that had been shown to him, namely, about those of whom it is written above: I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting beside me, and there the hand of the Lord God fell upon me, and I saw (Above, VIII, 1). And in a marvelous manner, while these people who had come to visit were seated, the prophet saw mystical visions and was absent from those who were sitting in front of him, present in body but without spirit. And everything happens so that those who were captive may receive consolation, because they will be brought back to the land of Israel and will walk in the commandments of the Lord, and they will be his people and he will be their God. But those who do not turn to repentance and continue to walk in their abominations will receive the consequences of their actions. But we often mention that words in the Holy Scriptures are often used for things.

<h2 id='tocuniq133'>(Chap. XII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 12, Verses 1 et seq.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house: they have eyes to see, and do not see: and ears to hear, and do not hear: because they are a rebellious house. Because we translate it as: You dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, the LXX (Septuagint) has put: You dwell in the midst of their iniquities. But from what follows, Because they are a rebellious house, we understand that the preceding sentence also agrees with this verse. Furthermore, we learn from frequent teaching that in the midst of a house turning to bitterness, you, who by nature make God sweet and kind, make him bitter and cruel with the bitterness of your vices. Otherwise, we read about God: Taste and see that the Lord is sweet or pleasant (Psalm 33:9). But the prophet dwells in the midst of the people who provoke God to bitterness, who has eyes but does not see, ears but does not hear, not due to a defect of the senses, but due to the obstinacy of wickedness. And so the Lord said to the Jews: If you were blind, you would not have sin (John 9:41): accusing and condemning their voluntary blindness. Therefore, since they have eyes to see, but do not see; ears to hear, but do not hear; and they despise your words, teach them through images and pictures; and show them with visible examples, that they may recognize the impending captivity not only by hearing, but also by their eyes.


<h2 id='tocuniq134'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3) Therefore, son of man, prepare for yourself the vessels of exile, and you shall go into exile during the day in their presence. You shall go from your place to another place in their sight, in case they might look upon it, for it is a rebellious house. LXX: And you, son of man, prepare for yourself the vessels of captivity, and you shall be held captive during the day in their presence. You shall be held captive from your place to another place in their sight, so that they may see that it is a rebellious house. There is no doubt that the entire extent of this place indicates the future captivity of King Zedekiah of the tribe of Judah, who was captured with Jerusalem. But since some desire to precede the captivity of Zedekiah, which is interpreted as the just Lord, as a type of the Savior who descends from the heavens to earth and assumes a human body, and these things are said to be vessels of captivity: therefore, I think it is necessary to warn the wise and cautious reader and to present these things, so that we may not seem to leave anything unmentioned, but not to prove them. For an impious king cannot surpass the example of piety shown by him who is the epitome of all piety. However, it is narrated in the history of Jeremiah the prophet and the Kings that Zedekiah was captured by the Babylonians and Chaldeans and was taken from place to place (Jeremiah 39 and 2 Kings 25), that is, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and other things that Ezekiel speaks of in the following passages. But those who refer to the Lord Jesus Christ believe that his captivity and migration from place to place signify his descent from heavenly to earthly realms.


<h2 id='tocuniq135'>(Vers. 4 seqq.)</h2>

(Ver. 4 seqq.) And you shall bring out your baggage like the baggage of an exile by day in their sight. And you shall go out in the evening before them, as one goes out into exile before their eyes. Dig through the wall for yourself, and you shall go out through it in their sight. You shall bear your baggage on your shoulders (Vulgate: you shall be carried): you shall escape in darkness (Vulgate: you shall be brought out). You shall cover your face, and you shall not see the ground: for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel. LXX: And you shall bring out your vessels of captivity by day in their sight. And you shall go out in the evening in their sight, as a captive goes out. Dig for yourself through the wall, and you shall pass through it in their sight. You shall be carried on your shoulders and go out in hiding. You shall cover your face, and you shall not see the ground, for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel. The prophet is commanded to act in a manner that Sedecias will do in truth. Gather, he says, your belongings (for these are the vessels of the one who is crossing over), while they are watching. And after they have seen what you are going to do, you will go out in the evening in the likeness of the one who is crossing over. We read that Zedekiah, with the wall secretly pierced, fled during the night to the deserts of the Jordan, and there he was captured by the Babylonians, and this signifies the wall being pierced. But when he says, 'you will carry on your shoulders,' your belongings are understood, and whatever they are accustomed to carry as a solace on the journey while fleeing. In the darkness you will escape ((or: you will lead out)); may you not be seen by anyone. You will cover your face, or by the blindness that befell him, the eyes will be plucked out by Nebuchadnezzar; or so that it is not recognized that he himself is the king, and the concern of the servants will be greater. And what follows: And you will not see the land, that signifies that he who is blind is led into Babylon, and will not see it. For I have given you as a portent to the house of Israel: for both the words and the deeds of the prophets have been spoken and fulfilled as a sign and a figure. And in Zechariah, extraordinary men are called, because they foreshadow the future (Zech. III). And in Hosea, God says: I have been compared to the hands of the prophets (Hosea XII, 10). But those who want to understand Christ in the person of Ezekiel, take the vessels of captivity to mean the human body, and the pierced wall through which he broke the bars of hell, and rising, he appeared to the believers alone; carried on their shoulders when he ascended as the victor to heaven with the angelic powers, and he came forth in concealment and veiled his face, so that the divine majesty might not be seen in mortal flesh, and he does not see the earth, lest the earth shine in his eyes, which does not deserve to see him. For the eyes of the Lord are upon the just (Ps. XXXIII, 16), and his face is turned away from the wicked. But they say that all these things were done in order to convert the hard hearts of the Israelite people to faith through the likeness of a man. And it is given as a sign to the house of Israel; according to what is written: Behold this child is set for the fall, and for the resurrection of many, and for a sign which shall be contradicted (Luke II, 24).

<h2 id='tocuniq136'>(Vers. 7, 8.)</h2>

(Vers. 7, 8.) So I did as he commanded me: I brought out my belongings like the belongings of someone going into exile during the day, and in the evening I dug a hole in the wall with my own hands. In the darkness I went out, and on my shoulders I carried myself in their sight. LXX: And I did exactly as he commanded me: during the day I brought out my belongings like the belongings of a captive, and in the evening I dug a hole in the wall with my own hands, and I went out in hiding. I was carried on the shoulders in their sight. He testifies that he has completed the work that was ordered above, and does not need interpretation according to both opinions, as has been explained above. However, it should be noted that at the same time, Jeremiah prophesied in Jerusalem, and Ezekiel in Babylon, and his prophecy was sent to the captives; and the prophecy of the former was sent to those who lived in Jerusalem; so that by the providence of God, the unity of the two could be proven in different regions, and those who heard it would understand that whatever happened to the people was not by the power of idols, but by the command of the Lord.

(Verse 9) And the word of the Lord came to me in the morning, saying: Son of man, did not the house of Israel, the house of rebellion, say to you, 'What are you doing?' Say to them: Thus says the Lord God. If the rebellious house, they say, asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' Or even if they do not ask, you go, so that they may know why you have done these things. Say to them: Thus says the Lord God.

<h2 id='tocuniq138'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 and following) This burden is upon the prince who is in Jerusalem, and upon all the house of Israel who are among them. Say: I am your omen: as I have done, so it shall be done to them. They shall go into exile and captivity. But the prince who is among them shall be carried on shoulders, he shall go out in darkness; they shall dig through the wall to bring him out; his face shall be covered, so that he may not see the land with his eyes. And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there. And all who are around him, his helpers and his troops, I will scatter to every wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them. And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the countries. But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence, so that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the Lord. First, let us explain the history. Say, he says, to them, O son of man, whether they ask or do not ask. What are you doing here? which is above the burden of that vision, which is in Jerusalem, signifying the leader Zedekiah. And say: I am your portent, or as the Septuagint translated, I am the one who makes portents; so that the future may be known from the present. As I have done, so it will be for them, the leader and all who are in the leader's entourage. Upon the transmigration to Babylon, the captives will be led, and the leader who is in their midst will be carried on their shoulders, either by beasts of burden or by those who fled with him. In darkness and in the shadows of the night, he will go forth: and his companions will dig through the wall to bring him out. His face will be covered, either by the fear of a fugitive or by the injury of blindness, so that the blind man may not see the land of Babylon. And I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my snare. Indeed, being seized by the Babylonians, he was captured as a result of God's permission. And he testifies that he himself caused these things to be done by the enemies. And being led into Babylon, he will not see the land of the Chaldeans, and there he will die as a captive. However, when he is captured, I will scatter all his allies, helpers, and companions in flight, here and there, and I will not allow them to depart in safety. But I will unsheathe my sword in the hands of the enemies, so that when they are dispersed among the nations, they may understand that I am the Lord, and all things are done according to my will. And I will leave behind, he says, a few from his companions who have fled with him, and those who have been able to escape the sword, famine, and plague, so that when they have come to various regions through either flight or captivity, they may recount all their crimes either through speech or example; because of which they have deserved such great evils, and understand that I myself am the Lord. But those who attempt to explain the allegory and the beginning of the explanation concerning the Savior, the leader who is in the midst of Jerusalem, interpret him, who has preceded as a sign and wonder, that he and his companions may be captives of this world, and as the victorious one ascending from the infernal regions, may be carried on the shoulders of angels: having gone forth in darkness, unknown to the unbelievers, having destroyed the middle wall, he has made both into one: his face being covered, so that he does not regard the land of the Jews (Ephesians 2). It is not surprising that the Lord hid His face; even today, the veil is placed before the unbelieving people when they look upon the face of Moses. And the Lord spread His net over him, as the bride speaks of him in the Song of Songs: Behold, he is behind our wall, looking through the windows, appearing through the lattice (Song of Songs 2:9). And also Jeremiah: The breath of our nostrils, the Lord's anointed, was captured in our sins (Lamentations 4:20). And: When he had not committed sin, he was made sin for us (II Cor. V, 21). And he shall be brought, he says, into Babylon, the confusion of this world, into the land of the Chaldeans who are interpreted as demons, so that he may draw back to salvation those who were enslaved to demons, and lead captive the ancient captivity. And he says that he will not see the land of the Chaldeans, and there he will die; so that he may give us life through his death. But he scattered all his helpers and partners, the apostles and apostolic men, throughout the whole world. And he unsheathed the sword after them, so that they might be crowned with various martyrdoms, and then they themselves or those who believed in them would understand that he is the Lord, and therefore he scattered them among the nations, and dispersed them in the lands, so they could bear much fruit. And he left a few men from among them, like the Apostle John, and others, freed from the sword, hunger, and pestilence, avoiding the onslaughts of persecution, to narrate the crimes of the Jews and the injustices of all the nations they entered, so that, through repentance, they may know that he is the Lord. We have said these things, leaving judgment to the discretion of the reader. However, there is no doubt that it is dangerous to compare the captivity and death of an impious king to the sacrament of the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq139'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 17 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, eat your bread with agitation (Vulgate adds but); and drink your water with haste and sorrow. And say (Vulgate says you shall say) to the people of the land: Thus says the Lord God to those who dwell in Jerusalem, in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with solicitude, and drink their water in desolation, so that the land may be desolate because of the multitude of its inhabitants, because of the wickedness of all who dwell in it. And the cities that are now inhabited shall be desolate, and the land shall be a desert: and you shall know that I am the Lord. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, you shall eat your bread with sorrow, and your water with torment and distress. And you shall say to the people of the land: Thus says the Lord God to the inhabitants of Jerusalem concerning the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with scarcity and drink their water with dismay, so that the land may be desolate and its fullness be destroyed. For in impiety all who dwell in it and their cities which are inhabited shall be desolated, and the land shall be scattered, and you shall know that I am the Lord. After the prophecy of the prince and his companions, which was shown under a bodily image, came to the people: and whatever is said by the prophets is referred by the prophet to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that in the evil of the siege, they eat their bread in distress and poverty, and drink their water with torment and tribulation. But these things, says the prophet, are spoken to you, that you may speak to the people of your land and say: Thus says the Lord to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who are in the land of Israel: You will endure the evil of being besieged by Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldeans, famine and thirst; so that all the land with its abundance may be destroyed, indicating by it those who inhabit it. And lest they think that this happens to them without cause: Say to them that because of their crimes and impiety, all the cities of Judah will be reduced to solitude, and all cultivation of the land will perish, so that they may know the wrathful God, whom they did not want to recognize as merciful. Can we, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who believe in Christ, say, those who dwell in the Church. And if they have deserved by his sins the offense, let them eat bread with poverty, and drink water with mourning and distress: not food of bread, nor drink of water, but hunger, supporting the word and doctrine of God (Amos 8). For when, either by the fault of princes, who are to be captured and delivered to the Babylonians, or by our own hardness, we have lost the word of God, and have not deserved to have useful waters: then in sorrow and scarcity, we shall take our food, and the earth will lose the multitude of believers, and the cities, which are understood in the whole world as the Church, will be desolated, and the land will be deserted, so that all may know that the Lord has been offended. And indeed we can understand this even in times of persecution.

<h2 id='tocuniq140'>(Vers. 21 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 21 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying: The days are prolonged, and every vision fails? Therefore say to them: Thus says the Lord God: I will make this proverb to cease, and it shall be used no more in Israel. Speak to them, and say: The days are at hand, and every vision shall be fulfilled. For there shall no longer be any false vision, nor ambiguous divination in the midst of the children of Israel. Because I, the Lord, will speak, whatever word I have spoken will be done. It will no longer be delayed, but in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak a word and I will do it, says the Lord God. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, behold the house of Israel, saying: The vision that this man sees is for many days and he prophesies for a long time. Therefore, say to them: Thus says the Lord God: My word will no longer be delayed: the word that I have spoken will be fulfilled, says the Lord God. What we have said, the proverb, according to Symmachus, all other interpreters have translated as a parable, which in Hebrew is called Masal. Again, where it has been said by us: 'There shall not be an ambiguous divination,' the Seventy have translated it as 'nor one divining according to favor.' For which reason all have interpreted it as slippery, whereas what we have said is ambiguous, so that we may understand the deceiving words of our prophets. Now the meaning of the entire chapter is this: He had previously prophesied against the ruler who was in Jerusalem, then he declared to the people that there would be famine and a burning thirst. So the unbelieving crowd takes up an old and well-known proverb: The threat of prophets is postponed to a distant time, and every vision will perish, while it is seen in vain; or, according to Symmachus, it will vanish into thin air and a gentle breeze. Therefore, say to them, my threat will by no means be postponed, nor will a false and ambiguous prediction be made to the people that has an uncertain end, so that it is said at one time and fulfilled at another; but now, while you who speak and those who hear are alive, let the word that I have spoken be fulfilled. However, it signifies the imminent captivity of the city of Jerusalem and the capture of Zedekiah with the people of Judah. Not only at that time, but even today the unbelieving crowd and the hard hearts of mortals do not accept the prophecy of God: but they consider everything that the prophets threaten, everything that the Gospel preaches, to be postponed to another time. And here let us understand the parable that is presented by the Septuagint as being received as a proverb, in accordance with what we read in the psalm: 'And I became a proverb to them' (Psalm 68:12). And in the same prophet: What is this parable to you in the people of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the sons are set on edge? We clearly explain, so that we may remain in the more obscure.

<h2 id='tocuniq141'>Book Four</h2>

Book Four

I would like, if it were possible, Eustochium, to weave explanations into the book of Ezekiel through each individual book with its own prophecies, and to not separate what is connected by prophecy with exposition: so that the course of the one dictating and the one reading would be easier; and to separate the long and immense journey of interpretation into certain intervals, as if with titles and indices, and, to speak more properly, with arguments, to show what each individual book contained. But what should I do, when some prophecies are short, others are long: so often we are constrained by necessity to condense many into one book, and divide one into many? Hence now also against the prophets and prophecies, to the elders of the people of Israel and to the land over which they are being led, we want to include in the fourth book a catalogue of the four worst plagues, and of the vine tree, which when it has been cut off, is useless among all the trees of the forests, we want to include a catalogue of vices of Jerusalem. Because it does not fit within the narrowness of one volume, we reserve the other part of it for the fifth volume: forewarning the diligent reader's concern, so that they know what we are explaining here and what they should read.

<h2 id='tocuniq142'>(Chap. XIII.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 13, Verses 1, 2) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy from their own heart: Hear the word of the Lord: Thus says the Lord God. This is what we have added: 'who prophesy,' and say to those who prophesy from their own heart, which the Septuagint omitted, and because it is not found in Hebrew, they added, 'and you shall prophesy' and say to them. This is a message against false prophets who deceived the people and, against God's commands, prophesied something else. And let it not bother anyone that they are called prophets, for Holy Scripture has this custom, that it names each one of its prophecies and speeches a prophet, just as the prophets are called Baal, and the prophets of idols, and the prophets of confusion. Hence the apostle Paul also calls a Greek poet a prophet: A certain one of their own prophets said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons (Titus 1). And in Hosea we read: Like a prophet driven mad, a man carrying the Spirit (Hosea 9:7). But whatever was said to the people of Israel at that time is now applied to the Church: so that the holy prophets may be the apostles and apostolic men. But the false and mad prophets are all heretics, whose leaders invent falsehoods from their own hearts; and those who are led astray by them believe in the lies of others.

<h2 id='tocuniq143'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and see nothing. LXX: Woe to those who prophesy from their own heart and do not see at all, forsaking what is proposed by us and following their own spirit. Although the name of prophets, according to the rule of the Scriptures, is common to both the good and the bad, they differ in that the good prophets are said to be wise, while the bad ones are foolish and ignorant. The former is associated with ecclesiastical men, and the latter with all heretics, who, forsaking the spirit of God, follow their own spirit and prophesy not by divine inspiration but by their own heart. Hence, they see nothing. But whoever is wise, follows not the thoughts of his own heart, but the Spirit of God, according to what is mentioned in the earlier texts, that even animals and wheels followed the Spirit of God. And the prophet says: You shall walk after the Lord your God. And in another place: Lead me in the right path. And again: Your good Spirit shall lead me into the land. And for the people of God, the pillar of fire and the clouds were a guide in the wilderness. And Jeremiah speaks: I have not labored following you (Jerem. XVII, 16). But whoever of the heretics follows his own spirit, will stumble in darkness, and the blind will lead the blind into a pit? Although they may seem to see more in their mysteries, or rather orgies, than the ecclesiastical doctors, they do not see anything at all: because they have lost the sun of righteousness, and in vain imitate those who were previously called Seers, and to whom it is said: Go, you who see; turn back to the land of Judah; and in Bethel you will not prophesy (Amos VII, 12, 13). Therefore, the vision of Isaiah and Obadiah are placed in the titles. And the Lord commanded the apostles: Lift up your eyes and see (John 4:35). And the prophet earnestly prays: Open my eyes, and I will behold wondrous things out of your law (Psalm 119:18).

<h2 id='tocuniq144'>(Vers. 4 seqq.)</h2>

(Versed 4 et sequentia) Your prophets, Israel, will be like foxes in the desert. You did not go up to face the enemy or build a wall for the house of Israel to stand firm in battle on the day of the Lord. They see false visions and speak deceptive divinations, saying, 'The Lord declares,' when the Lord has not sent them; yet they hope for the fulfillment of their words. Have you not seen a false vision and uttered a lying divination when you say, 'The Lord declares,' though I have not spoken?' LXX: Like foxes in the deserts are your prophets, O Israel ((Add. they were or will be)). They did not stand in the firmament, and they gathered flocks over the house of Israel. Those who say in the day of the Lord did not rise: seeing falsehoods, divining vanities, those who say, says the Lord, and the Lord did not send them: and they began to stir up discourse. Did you not see false visions, and speak vain divinations? And you said, says the Lord, and I did not speak. Let us first speak according to the Hebrew. The prophets of Israel are like foxes, committing thefts of domestic birds every day: those who live, according to Aquila and the Septuagint, in the deserts; according to Symmachus and Theodotion, in walls and ruins: who cannot advance opposite, nor oppose a wall for the house of Israel. We read that Aaron stood in the middle against the fire devouring the people of Israel, and opposed a wall for the salvation of the people (Num. XVI). It is also said of Jeremiah, 'Do not confront the Lord, nor stand against His wrath with persevering prayer' (Jer. 7). Just as a wall is set against an enemy and is usually met head-on by the adversary, so the will of God is weakened by the prayers of the saints. Therefore, Moses is also told, 'Let me alone, and I will destroy this people' (Exod. 32:10), which shows that he had the power to hold back. These people cannot stand in battle on the Day of the Lord, to fight for the people with prayers and resist the judgments of God's pleas. Therefore, because they see in vain and falsely prophesy, and claim to be sent by the Lord when they are not sent by Him, and persist in their errors, and desire to affirm their own words; they are accused of preaching empty things, saying that their lies are the words of the Lord. Furthermore, according to the Septuagint, the sense here is: All heretics are like foxes because of their deceit and wickedness, about whom the Savior speaks: Foxes have dens, and birds of the air have nests (Matthew 8:20). And it is written about Herod: Say to this fox (Luke 13:32). And about those same foxes that deceive the innocent and plunder the vineyard of Christ, Solomon speaks: Catch for us the little foxes, who spoil the vineyards (Song of Solomon 2:15). And in the psalm about those who are deceived by their trickery, it is sung: They shall go into the depths of the earth, they shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall become the portion of foxes (Psalm 63:10, 11). O prophets who are like foxes, they did not stand in the firmament; nor did they deserve to hear from Peter: You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church (Matthew 16:18). Nor are they like Moses, to whom it was said: You stand here with me (Deuteronomy 5:31). Nor like him who says: He has set my feet upon a rock; but they have swayed with every wind of doctrine. They have not stood in the firmament, of which we read in the eighteenth psalm: The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands. These gathered together the irrational ones, and due to the excessive innocence of the livestock, they are similar to the house of God. Hence, it is now said: And they gathered flocks over the house of Israel: neither they themselves rose, nor were they able to raise others; but whatever they did and do, they are full of lies. And what follows: And they began to stir up discourse, signifies that they indeed desire to rise up and lift themselves to heights; but what they desire, they cannot fulfill: and it is said to them: Have you not seen a false vision and spoken idle divinations? And what follows, and you were saying, 'Thus says the Lord,' and I have not spoken, it is not found in the Septuagint.

<h2 id='tocuniq145'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Vers. 8, 9.) Therefore thus says the Lord God: Because you have spoken idle words and have seen falsehood, behold, I am against you, declares the Lord God. And my hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord God. LXX: Therefore say: Thus says the Lord God. Because your words are lies and your divinations are empty, therefore behold, I am against you, says the Lord God, and I will stretch out my hand against the prophets who see falsehood and speak empty words. They will not be in the discipline of my people, nor will they be written in the scroll of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel. And they will know that I am the Lord. Under the guise of prophets, this speech is against heretics, who speak empty words and see falsehood, and they persist in establishing their own doctrine. May the Lord Himself come against them and rise up, and may He stretch out His hand against them to strike, and may He not hold back in sparing them. And He threatens that they will not be among the assembly of the people of the Lord in the future, nor in His Church, but in the synagogue of the devil, nor will they be written in the house of Israel. About which it is said in another place: They will be written above the earth (Jeremiah 17:13): not in the land of Israel which is the land of the living, about which it is now said, nor will they enter the land of Israel, but in the land of the dead and the shadow of death, so that after they have endured these things, separated from the assembly of the people of God, they may understand that He is the Lord. Instead of 'for what we render, they will not be in the council of my people,' the Seventy translated, 'they will not be in the discipline or correction of my people.' For there is one kind of correction for enemies, another for sons. Hence Jeremiah says: Correct us, O Lord, but with judgment, not with anger, lest you make us few. Pour out your anger on the nations that have not known you, and on the kingdoms that have not invoked your name. (Ibid. X, 24, 25).

<h2 id='tocuniq146'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 and following) Because they have deceived my people, saying: peace, and there is no peace. And he was building a wall: but they were plastering it with mud without straw. Say to those who plaster without mortar, that it will fall. For there will be a overflowing rain: and I will give great stones falling from above, and a stormy wind blowing. Indeed, behold, the wall has fallen. Will it not be said to you, where is the whitewash that you plastered? Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: I will unleash the spirit of storms in my anger; and there will be a torrential rain in my fury, and great stones of wrath will be poured out, and I will destroy the wall that you have whitewashed without mortar, and I will level it to the ground; its foundation will be exposed, and it will fall and be consumed in its midst; and you will know that I am the Lord. And I will fulfill my anger against the wall and against those who whitewashed it without mortar; and I will say to you: The wall is no more, and there are no longer any who whitewash it. The prophets of Israel who prophesy to Jerusalem see a vision of peace, but there is no peace, says the Lord God. LXX: For they have deceived my people, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace. And this one builds a wall, and these ones plaster it with folly. Say to those who plaster with folly, it will fall. There will be a flooding rain, and I will give great stones for their joints and they will fall. And a wind will come and tear it apart. And behold, the wall has fallen, and they will not say to you, 'Where is the whitewash that you whitewashed with?' Therefore, thus says the Lord Adonai: I will break the spirit of fury that carries away, and rainwill overflow in my anger, and I will bring great stones in fury to a consummation, and I will dig up the wall that you have plastered, and it will fall. And I will put it on the ground, and its foundations will be exposed, and it will fall. And you will be consumed with reproach, and you will know that I am the Lord. And I will complete my fury on the wall, and on those who plaster it, it will fall. And I said to you: There is no wall, nor those who plaster it, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem and see peace for her: there is no peace for them, says the Lord God. The prophets of Israel, who will not be in the assembly of the people of God, nor be written in the scriptures of the house of Israel, nor enter the promised land, therefore suffer these things because they have deceived my people, proclaiming peace and prosperity by the severity of repentance and the wrongfulness of conversion, according to what is said elsewhere: Peace, peace, where is peace? (Jeremiah 8:11) Therefore, God figuratively built a wall for them through the commands of the law and the words and warnings of the holy prophets. For this Hebrew word signifies 'His', that is, it would repel every incursion of wild beasts and hostile attack from them, while they turned to God, they would be surrounded by this like a very strong wall and fortress. But the false prophets, not once but often, promised them peace, for this repeated talk of peace signifies this. And they were building the very wall which is called 'Cir' in the following, the false prophets were coating it without any restraint, as Symmachus interpreted, that is, with pure mud, and that it did not have straw, so that it could not provide any strength. But indeed, both the Septuagint and Theodotion interpret it as folly: but the eagle has interpreted the Hebrew word Thaphel as ἀνάλῳ, which means without salt, passing from one translation to another, just as food without salt has no flavor: so too clay, without straw to strengthen and bind it, can offer no strength to a wall. Say, he says, to those who make empty promises and pledge useless help, that this wall and this structure will fall, and I will send a very violent rain, namely the most fierce enemies. But it refers to the Babylonians and the Chaldeans; and it signifies the same hails stones falling from above, everything through a metaphor, by which a sudden whirlwind overturns and destroys an unstable wall; and afterwards it is said to them, that is, to the false prophets, Where is the plaster with which you plastered it, and where is the help that you promised? But whatever we have said about false prophets can also be applied to heretics, for all their God-inspired inventions will be dissolved by God's wrath; and the structure of false teachings, which the Holy Spirit does not support, shall fall and crumble down to its foundations and turn to dust, and become equal to the wall of the earth, and fall, and the prophets who made promises and the people to whom the promises were made shall be consumed in its midst; so that once He has completed His wrath and says to them: this is not a wall, that is, this is not your defense; and there are none who plaster it, but all are empty and amount to nothing: then you shall come to know by these actions that I am the Lord. But in order to know who these individuals are who daub the wall, it follows, the prophets of Israel, that is, the false prophets, who prophesy to Jerusalem and see for her a vision of peace, these are the cause of sin and ruin, and foolish security. For there will be no peace, says the Lord, because the Lord did not send them, nor did he speak to them. This which the Septuagint translated as 'and on their joints' is not found in the Hebrew. However, it signifies the joints of the stones in the wall, or the supports of wood, by which the walls are strengthened. And also that which we read above: he himself was building the wall; most people report that Israel, who promised himself either the empty help of the Egyptians or of peace, was referring to the people.

<h2 id='tocuniq147'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 17 and following) And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own heart, and prophesy against them, and say, 'Thus says the Lord God: Woe to those who sew cushions for all armholes and make veils for the heads of people of every height, to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of My people, and keep yourselves alive? And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, killing people who should not die, and keeping people alive who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies.' Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against your cushions, with which you hunt the flying souls, and I will tear them from your arms, and I will release the souls whom you hunt, souls to fly. And I will tear off your necklaces, and I will free my people from your hand, and they shall no longer be in your hands for plunder. And you shall know that I am the Lord. Because you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad, and you have encouraged the hands of the wicked, so that he does not turn away from his evil way and live, therefore you shall no longer see false visions nor practice divination. And I will deliver my people from your hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord. LXX: And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; prophesy against them, and say, 'Thus says the Lord God: Woe to the women who sew magic charms on their sleeves and make veils for the heads of people of every height, to hunt souls! Will you hunt down the souls of My people, and keep yourselves alive? And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, killing people who should not die, and keeping people alive who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies?' Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against your cushions, on which you gather souls, and I will tear them from your arms, and I will release the souls that you have perverted, their souls into dispersion. And I will tear off your veils and deliver my people from your hands, and they shall no longer be in your hands for a gathering. And you shall know that I am the Lord. Because you have perverted the soul of the righteous unjustly, and I did not pervert him, and you strengthened the hand of the wicked, so that he would not turn from his evil way and live. Therefore, you will no longer see your lies, and you will not be able to divine any divinations from now on. And I will free my people from your hand, and you will know that I am the Lord. A divine word was directed above the prophets, who were lining the wall with clay, which had no straw, and could not give any strength to the wall or the mortar. Now, they are commanded to put their faces or direct them against the prophetesses of the people, and, as the Septuagint translated, to harden. But just as some false prophets were inspired by a diabolical spirit to subvert the commands of God, so too against prophetesses, such as Deborah (Judges 5) and Huldah (2 Kings 22), and in the Acts of the Apostles, the four daughters of Philip the evangelist prophesying were inspired by a demonic spirit (Acts 21), there were also others of the same sex, among whom were Prisca and Maximilla, who by their false prophecy subverted the faith of truth. However, the Hebrews are said to be skilled in the evil arts through necromancy and the Pythian spirit, such as the one who was seen to have raised the soul of Samuel (1 Samuel 28); and in the Acts of the Apostles, there was a fortune-telling woman who gained much wealth for her masters through divination, from whom an unclean spirit was cast out by the command of the apostle Paul (Acts 16). But we will say that other heretics preach power through the falsehood of their doctrines. Pythagoras and Zeno were among them, from whom the Stoics originated: the Indian Brachmans and the Ethiopian Gymnosophists, who, due to their self-control in food, are considered a marvel by their nations (or, unbelievers). And rightly they are said to whitewash the wall and promise some strength; but because they do not have the seasoning of Christ, their labor is in vain, and their building will perish. For unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain (Psalm 127:1). But other doctors of pleasures and desires, such as the Epicureans, the Pyrrhonians, Jovinianus, and Eunomius, say: Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. Therefore, the prophet is commanded to set or harden his face against the daughters of his people. First, it must be explained what it means for the face to be set or hardened. Indeed, it is that which is written about the Lord: 'The face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth' (Psalm 34:16). For just as wax melts before fire, so sinners perish before God's presence. In the same sense, the prophet says: Son of man, set your face against Theman, Darom, and Nageb. And again: The word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face against the children of Jerusalem. And a little later: The word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face against the children of Ammon. And again: Firmly set your face against Pharaoh, king of Egypt (Infra, XXIX, 2). And again: Son of man, set your face against Gog and Magog. And in another place: I will set my face against that man, and I will make him a desolation and a byword, and I will remove him from the midst of my people, and you shall know that I am the Lord (Infra, XIV, 8). Woe, therefore, to these heresies and doctrines which, promising rest, deceive people of every age and sex, in order to capture the souls of the wretched and lead me away from my people, while I am believed to love pleasure. And this not because of their barley, or the barley of the half-farsang, as we read in Hosea (Hosea V), but because of a handful of barley, by which animals are intoxicated, and a fragment of bread. Not whole bread or solid testimonies of the Scriptures, but those which have been broken, cut, and diminished by heretical depravity; so that they deceive and lead astray even the holy ones, and drag them to death; and they claim to give life to sinners with empty promises. Therefore, the merciful and compassionate God does not kill the prophetesses themselves, but he breaks their spindles, which like nets capture flying souls, so that once they are broken, they have the freedom to fly. And they would tear the veils or kerchiefs, in which the principal soul would recline, and with which the heads of the deceivers would be covered. Since the Apostle teaches that the heads of men should not be covered, but should have the glory of the Lord revealed (II Cor. III). For, he says, you were breaking the spirits of those who serve God with false terrors, and you were holding the impious captive with fraudulent promises, so that, while they were repenting, they would not regain the life they had lost. Therefore, you shall by no means see empty visions, nor shall I call your lies prophecies; but rather divinations, of which it is written: There is no omen in Jacob, nor divination in Israel (Num. XXIII, 23): so that I may deliver my people from your hands, and you may know that I am the Lord who has rescued the lost.

<h2 id='tocuniq148'>(Chap. XIV.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 14, Verse 1 onwards) And the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their hearts and have put the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. Should I be consulted by them? Therefore speak to them and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Every man of the house of Israel who sets up his idols in his heart and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face and comes to the prophet, I the Lord will answer him with the multitude of his idols, that I may lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, who have turned away from me through all their idols. Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: Turn away and withdraw from your idols, and turn your faces away from all your abominations. For any man of the house of Israel, or of the aliens who immigrate to Israel, if he has estranged himself from me in Israel and has set up his idols in his heart, and has placed the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and has come to the prophet to inquire of me through him: I, the Lord, will answer him in person. And I will set my face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people. Then you will know that I am the Lord. And if the prophet is deceived and speaks a word, I am the Lord who has deceived that prophet. I will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. And they shall bear their punishment—the punishment of the inquirer shall be the same as the punishment of the prophet—so that the house of Israel may no longer go astray from me, nor defile themselves anymore with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people and I may be their God, declares the Lord of hosts. LXX: And the men of the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, these men have set their thoughts in their hearts and have set the torment of their iniquities before their face: If I answer them when they ask? Therefore, speak to them and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Every man of the house of Israel who sets his thoughts in his heart and sets the torment of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet to inquire of him concerning me: I, the Lord, will answer him with the matters that are on his mind, in order to turn the house of Israel away according to their hearts, which have turned away from me in their thoughts. Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: Repent and turn away from your idols, and turn your faces towards me. For all the people of Israel, both those who belong to the nation and those who are foreigners in the land, are accountable to me. Those who have turned away from me and have set their hearts on evil will face punishment for their sins. If they come to a prophet to seek guidance from me, I, the Lord, will answer them according to their own wickedness and I will show my displeasure towards them. I will banish them into a desolate place and remove them from the midst of my people. Then you will know that I am the Lord. And if a prophet should wander astray and speak a word, I, the Lord, have caused that prophet to wander astray. And I will stretch out my hand against him and remove him from the midst of my people Israel. And they shall bear their iniquity according to the iniquity of the inquirer, and the guilt of the prophet shall be the same, so that the house of Israel shall not stray from me and they shall not yet be defiled by all their sins. And they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them a God, says the Lord God. After he spoke to the prophets who prophesied in their hearts, and they plastered the wall without tempering it; and to the prophetesses who used necklaces and placed their hands under every elbow, and made veils and covered the heads of all ages (through which the doctrine of perverse teachings is shown), they came to the prophet, not all of the elders, lest they all seem to be mistaken; but some of the elders of Israel, and they sat before the prophet: for what reason they had come, they were waiting in silence; and immediately the word of God came to the prophet, indicating why they were present. For it is not within the nature of man, no matter how holy, to know the secrets of the heart. Hence it is said of the Savior alone: 'And Jesus knowing their thoughts, said: Why do you think evil in your hearts?' (Matthew 9). The meaning is: Son of man, these men who sit before you have placed their impurities or thoughts in their hearts; and, according to Symmachus and Theodotion, idols and scandal, that is, the destruction and torment of their wickedness, they have set against their own face and thus they came to seek the word of the Lord. Should I respond to people of this kind, who come to me with their previous thoughts, not even abandoning their impiety in this time, but believing in idols and fraudulent divinations; holding on to the ruin of wickedness against their own face and torment, while despairing of better things and being prepared for punishment, and thus desiring to know my words through you? Therefore, since they have come to you with a corrupt heart, respond to them not in your own person, so that the authority of the one responding is not slight; but by my command, and say to them: Thus says the Lord God. But the summary of the whole passage, in a brief explanation, is this: Man is not like other nations, which may receive pardon for their errors, but the house of Israel, who, coming to the prophet to inquire about their former vices, mentioned above, I will answer them according to their heart, and their impurities, so that they may hear according to what they desire and believe. For he does not deserve correction, who asks not with the intention of learning, but of testing. For they have departed from me, and have followed idols. And this is a brief warning, that they may depart from idols and perverse thoughts, and turn to me, leaving behind their former sins. For he who deceitfully asks does not deserve to hear the truth, but he must be captured by his own heart, just as the scribes and Pharisees, questioning the Lord, or rather testing Him, hear: Why do you test me? And again: Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things (Matthew 21:27). But whoever is such a person, and thus asks, God sets His face upon him, or confirms; as by the severity of His countenance, the hardness of His forehead is softened, and becomes an example, and a proverb, or solitude, and destruction, so that by the destruction of him from the people of God, others may know that He is the Lord who knows the secrets of the heart, and understands the perverseness of the mind; and He does not consider the words of those who speak, but their hearts. And what follows seems to raise the question: When a prophet errs and speaks a word, I, the Lord, have deceived that prophet, we cannot say that he is a true prophet, but rather a false prophet, who is called a prophet in a derivative sense. And this can be understood from the Scripture passage when King Ahab of Israel goes to battle, he does not want to listen to the prophet Micaiah, but rather he complies with the advice of the false prophets (1 Kings 22). And Michael says that he saw the Lord sitting on a throne, and that the spirit of error offered itself willingly to deceive the king. The Devil is also said to go about the earth in the book of Job, and it is said that he can receive power from the Lord over Job's substance and then his body (Job. 1 and 2). And Balaam the diviner is sent by the Lord to deceive Balak son of Beor (Num. 22). But all of this is said so that the strength of false prophets is not regarded, that the people are deceived, and that they prefer to hear lies rather than accommodate their ears to the truth. But it is said that it is to the wrath of God, that the perverse and unbelieving people would rather listen to false prophets than true prophets. Finally, he extends his hand over him, understood, the prophet, and he is erased from the midst of his people, to bear his iniquity, so that there may be a similar error and a similar punishment: so that both the one who asks and the one who is asked may bear their iniquity, and not at all shall the house of Israel be deceived by the perverse prophecies of those who have wanted to hear the words of God; but may they be the people of God and may they deserve to have the Lord. In what he said: 'I, the Lord, have deceived him,' the words of Solomon agree, who, in speaking about God, says: 'He will mock the mockers' (Prov. III, 34), and this testimony: 'If the wicked walk contrary to me, I will also walk contrary to them in fury' (Lev. XXVI, 27, 28). And what is said secondly, 'a man of the sons of Israel and of the strangers who join themselves to them,' shows in us, according to the Apostle, a twofold man, outward and inward (I Cor. XV). For they have the outward appearance of a human being, but assume the images of various animals, which the prophet, wishing to disperse them, implores: Lord, in your city you will disperse their image (Psalm 73:20). Those of whom it is written: Though a person is in honor, they do not understand; they are compared to senseless animals and become like them (Psalm 49:21). They are not true human beings, but rather human beings are like animals. Again, those who hear in the Gospel, 'You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?' (Matthew 23:33) are not humans, but humans snakes. And about whom it is written, 'Foxes have dens, and birds have nests in the sky.' (Matthew 8:20) and about Herod, 'Go and tell that fox.' (Luke 13:32) They are not humans, but humans foxes. But those who possess both terms of human, if they stray, are corrected through punishments, so that they understand that He Himself is the Lord. And also what we have set forth according to the Septuagint: It is fitting that the person who has been estranged from me, and has placed his thoughts in his heart, and the torment or punishment of his wickedness before his face, should receive witness that it is written in Isaiah: Walk in the light of your fire, and in the flame that you have kindled (Isaiah 50:11). For each person kindles the ardor of flames for himself, and prepares punishments, while he does not want to correct the errors of his mistaken heart with repentance, but remains in errors, deserving the burning of flames.


<h2 id='tocuniq149'>(Vers. 12, 13 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 12, 13 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, when a land sins against me by acting treacherously, I will stretch out my hand (some versions add 'upon it') and break its staff of bread, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast. And if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver their own souls by their righteousness, declares the Lord of hosts. If I also bring the most harmful beasts upon the land to devastate it, and it becomes impassable because of the beasts, and these three men are in it, as I live, says the Lord (Vulgate adds 'God'), they shall not deliver sons or daughters, but they alone shall be delivered; but the land shall be desolate. Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say to the sword, Pass through the land, and I cut off from it man and beast, and these three men are in the midst of it, as I live, says the Lord God, they shall not deliver sons or daughters, but they alone shall be delivered. But if I bring a deadly disease upon that land and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to remove from it man and beast, and even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, says the Lord God, they would save neither son nor daughter. They would deliver only themselves by their righteousness. For thus says the Lord God: Even if I bring four deadly judgments upon Jerusalem – sword, famine, evil beasts, and disease – to kill off its inhabitants and its livestock, yet there will be survivors who will bring out sons and daughters. Behold, they themselves will come out to you, and you will see their path and their inventions, and you will be comforted concerning the evil which I have brought upon Jerusalem with everything that I have brought upon it. And you will be comforted when you see their path and their inventions, and you will know that I have not done all that I have done in vain, says the Lord God. Four plagues are brought upon the earth, the transgressing and sinful earth, as the Seventy have translated it: famine, beast, sword, pestilence. If each one of these plagues were brought in separate parts to each region, and these three men, Noah and Daniel and Job, whose righteousness is proclaimed by the voices of the Scriptures, would pray for the sinful earth, they would not only be unable to save it, but not even their own sons and daughters, if they were to perpetrate the works of the sinful earth; but they would only be able to save themselves. The question is why mention only Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and the other righteous patriarchs and prophets. This is easily solved: Noah, because of the impending flood that would cleanse the earth, could not prevent or delay it as the whole earth had corrupted the ways of the Lord (Genesis 6:7). However, he had preserved his sons who might have possessed the same virtue, as a seed for the human race. Daniel also mitigated the imminent captivity of the people of Judah with no tears (Dan. 1). But Job, not because of sins, but because of testing, did not save neither his house nor his children (Job 1). Others, however, say that these three men alone witnessed both prosperity and adversity, and then prosperity again: therefore, they are named together; and this is secretly meant to signify that just as they saw both good and bad, and then joy again, so too the people of Israel, who first enjoyed good things and later endured the yoke of captivity, if they repent, will return to their former happiness. And if Noah and Daniel and Job were gathered together in one place, they would not be able to avert the wrath of God from the sinful earth, that is, those who dwell on the earth. What can be said then about those who believe that through the merits of their parents and their own virtues, they can free their sinful children from the fires of hell? Therefore, neither a sinful father can save his sinful son, nor can a righteous mother, from a chaste conversation, give rewards for chastity to her unchaste daughter. And on the other hand, the vices of parents will not harm their children; but the soul that sins, it shall die (Ezekiel, XVII, 4). Lot, dwelling in Sodom, not only in spirit but also in flesh, did not save his wife when she looked back, but only his daughters, who perhaps had not sinned (Genesis XIX). And the holy man Josiah, not only did he not save the sinful people with his virtues, but he himself died in their sins (2 Kings XIII). But if sometimes the Lord promises his mercy to their descendants on account of Abraham and David, it must be noted that he does not spare those who persist in wickedness; but he helps the conduct of those who repent, so that the merits of the fathers may benefit the conversation of the sons. When, he says, these things are so, and prayer does not save the sinful land from the individual punishments of such great men: thus says the Lord God, because Jerusalem has committed abominable sins, I will bring four plagues upon her at once: the sword, by which she is slain by enemies; and famine, which she endures in siege; and wild beasts, by which she is devoured while fleeing in the deserts and mountains; and pestilence, which always follows hunger and scarcity. He transferred death over her, but this, he says, I will bring upon her, so that neither men remain in her, nor animals. And yet, by my mercy, I will leave some in her, who will raise their sons and daughters; and let the captives come here, that is, to Babylon, and to Chaldea, so that when you see them and observe their works, then you will understand that they were justly captured, and my judgment was just, and may your captivity have consolation; while you understand that I have freed them from the sword, famine, beasts, and pestilence, so that by their perversity you may learn the reason why Jerusalem was overthrown, the temple set on fire, and the people led into captivity, except for those whom the sword, famine, beasts, and pestilence have consumed. These words are spoken about that Jerusalem, to which the captivity was approaching while Ezekiel was prophesying among the Chaldeans. Moreover, it is also spoken about our land, which is called: You are dust, and to dust you shall return (Gen. III, 19); and it is spoken about our Jerusalem and each of the believers, that if they have despised God's commandments and have earned the title of transgressors, famine will be induced; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the word of God. And a sword shall be brought, of which we read: They shall be delivered into the hands of the sword: the parts of foxes were (or will be) (Psalm 62:11). And to Mary: And thy own soul a sword shall pierce (Luke 2:35). And beasts shall be brought, to whom the just man shall not be delivered, it is demanded: Do not deliver the soul of the one who confesses to you to beasts (Psalm 73:19). And pestilence shall be brought (for which 70 interpreted death), of which it is written: The worst death for sinners (Psalm 33:22). And: The soul that sins, it shall die. And, if bitter death separates thus (Infra XVIII, 4)? Concerning all these, neither the teaching of spiritual parents, whom we understand as masters (I Reg. XV), nor the rulers will be able to free them, unless there is agreement of the sons, and their petitions have aided their efforts. For the justice of the just person will be upon him, and the iniquity of the wicked person will dwell in him: Each person will die for their own sin, and their righteousness will save them (Deut. XXIV, 16). And the Jews say in vain: Abraham is our father (John 8), when they do not have the works of Abraham. But if there is any confidence, let us trust in the Lord alone. For cursed is every man who has hope in another man (Jeremiah 17), even if they are holy, even if they are prophets. We read: Do not trust in men (Psalm 146). And again: It is better to trust in the Lord than to trust in princes (Psalm 118). Not only in secular rulers, but also in the rulers of the churches, those who are just will only save their own souls. However, they will not be able to save their sons and daughters, whom they have borne in the church, if they are negligent. And yet the Apostle says: If someone's work is burned up, he himself will be saved, but only as through fire. (1 Corinthians 3:15) However, the hand is extended over the rebellious earth, so that the rod or the strength of the bread may be crushed. She extends and threatens with blows, unwillingly those who extend her and lifts up sinners to strike, but terrifies with extension and preserves the frightened.

(Chapter 15, verse 1 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, what will be done with the vine wood among all the trees of the forest which are among the trees of the woods? Will its wood be taken to make something, or will a peg be made from it to hang any vessel on? Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel: both ends of it have been consumed by the fire, and the middle part has turned into ashes. Will it be useful for any work? Even though it was intact, it was not suitable for work: how much more so when that fire devoured it and consumed it, will nothing come from it as a work? Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Just as the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for devouring, so I will give the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will set my face against them. They will come out of the fire, and the fire will consume them. And you will know that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them and make the land a waste and desolate, because they have been transgressors, says the Lord God. For this is what we have interpreted: both parts of it have been consumed by fire, and half of it has been reduced to ashes. The Seventy have translated it as: The annual purgation consumes it by fire, and sends it to an end. Again, when we said: When I set my face against them, they turned, when I hardened. They have interpreted it as a transgression and a sin. Moreover, through various similes, which the Greeks call parables, the destruction of the city of Jerusalem is foretold. And as above (Chapter IV), in the pan in which the meats of the people were fried, and on the side on which the fortifications and the mounds of battering rams and siege machines were painted, the siege of the same city and the famine are described, and afterwards we will read about it here in the same passage: in Jeremiah also it is written (Jeremiah I, 13), the pot which is kindled from the face of the north indicates the city of Jerusalem; and the forests of Negev, and Teman, and Darom being cut down, signify this very thing: so in the present place, the same Jerusalem is compared to fruitful vineyards and vines. Concerning which it is written elsewhere: I have planted you a fruitful vineyard, the whole truth: how have you turned into the bitterness of a strange vine? (Jeremiah II, 21.) And in Isaiah: I have planted, he says, a choicest vine (Isaiah V, 2), which sounds beautiful and chosen. And in the Psalms we read: You have transferred a vineyard from Egypt: you have cast out the nations, and have planted it: you were the leader of its journey in its sight (Psalm LXXIX, 9). And we learn more clearly, as the Scripture says: But the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel (Isaiah V, 7). As long as this vineyard produces fruit, there is nothing more valuable than it in all the trees of the forest; but if it ceases to bear grapes, it will be of no use at all, unless it is given over to fire with its roots and branches. Other trees of the forest (not to mention fruit-bearing trees, of which the Scripture makes no mention at present) when they do not bear fruit, provide much usefulness when cut down, both in agriculture and in the use of weapons: when they are made into shields, they are shaved into spears, they form gates, they enclose armories, fridges, and chests; and they provide all the furniture for a house. But if a vine once ceases to produce grapes, it is so useless that not even a peg can be made from it, on which something can hang. And when you cut off the little branches, fire first seizes both parts of them, then the flame consumes them: and it is so useless when reduced to ashes that even when it is whole, it provides no benefit without fruits. However, there is ambiguity in the Hebrew word Sene (), which is written with three letters, Sin, Nun, and Yod; if it is read as Sene, it means two; if as Sane, it means years. And it came to pass, that for its two extremities, which we have interpreted as each part of it, the Seventy interpreted its annual purification: when Aquila said, its two last things; Symmachus Theodotion, its two extremities. And there is an order: As a fruitless vine is given to the fire, for no advantage: so also Jerusalem, nay its inhabitants, shall be given to burnings, so that they may come forth from the fire, and the fire may consume them, that is, even if they have escaped from the city, they shall be consumed by the hostile sword outside; and those who remain, pressed down by the weight of their own miseries, shall recognize me as the Lord: when I have set my face against them, and given them over to eternal desolation. For sinners have not arisen like the rest of the nations, but rather transgressors. For it is one thing to neglect what you are ignorant of, and another to despise what you have cherished. We can understand the vineyard and Jerusalem according to spiritual intelligence, understanding the multitude of believers. But if it is negligent, and loses the cultivation of the former religion, and brings neither the fruits of virtues, nor makes the wine that gladdens the heart of man, it will be handed over to eternal flames, and considered as nothing. For the servant who knows his master's will and does not do it, he will be beaten with many blows (Luke XII, 47). Such a thing the Lord also speaks in the Gospel according to John: I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he will take it away. And everyone who bears fruit, he will prune it so that it may bear more fruit (John XV, 2, 2). Indeed, the Savior is the vine, and we are the branches, and God (also called) the Father is the vinedresser, as long as we keep God's commandments, we are constantly cultivated, and our cultivation is purification: For it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy (Romans IX, 16). But if we bear fruit, we are pruned by the Father, so that we may bear even more fruit. It is shown that all of our effort, with the help of God, leads to the end and produces the fruit of fullness. But those who do not produce fruit will be taken away by the Father. And when they are taken away, Scripture does not say what the Father will do with them, except that perhaps separation from the body of Christ is a perpetual punishment and destruction. What we have understood in the vineyard and the vine, the Savior teaches in the Gospel under a different figure: Salt is good, but if salt loses its flavor, it is no longer useful, except to be thrown out and trampled on by men (Mark 9:49). And the eye that illuminates the whole body, if it is blind, hears from the Lord: If the light that is in you is darkness: how great will the darkness be? For indeed, the punishment of the transgressor, and of the one who has denied God when choked, is lighter than that of those who have never had knowledge of God. But the trees of the meadows or forests, according to the variety of believers, have some usefulness in a great house; in which not only are there vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earthenware; some for honor, others for dishonor.


<h2 id='tocuniq151'>(Chap. XVI.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 16, Verses 1, 2.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, make known the abominations of Jerusalem and say: Thus says the Lord God to Jerusalem. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, testify against Jerusalem for her iniquities, and say to her: Thus says the Lord God. In which the brief summary of each prophecy was, we have included the entire chapter, immediately following as it seemed to us. However, because this discourse is directed to Jerusalem, testifying and teaching about the sins it has committed; and it extends nearly to the number of two hundred verses, to that place where it is written: 'When I am appeased by you for all that you have done,' says the Lord God, we must divide every prophecy into parts; and we must adapt proper explanations to those things which we have proposed. Under the person of a prostitute woman who was first joined to the company of men, Jerusalem is intertwined with birth, and upbringing, and puberty, and marriage, and adultery, and divorce, and again reinstatement; so that the mercy and judgement of the husband, and the crimes of the adulteress and prostitute may be known, while after all punishments, he raises for her an eternal covenant: that she may remember her iniquity, and be confounded, and may no longer have the courage to speak because of her shame, when he has been appeased by her for all that she has done. For it is very beneficial for sinners to know what they have done. Thus, the repentant one speaks: For I know my iniquity, and my sin is always before me (Psalm 50:4). However, Jerusalem can be understood in four ways: Either as that which was burned with the fire of the Babylonians and Romans; or as the celestial city of the first ones; or as the Church, which is interpreted as the vision of peace; or as the souls of individuals who, through faith, see God. And that which many think should be interpreted as the celestial Jerusalem, the Church does not accept, lest we be compelled to include in it all the ruins and torments of the heavenly powers, as well as the restoration to their original state, that are woven into the present prophecy.


<h2 id='tocuniq152'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3) Your ancestors and your lineage are from the land of Canaan (Vulgate: Canaan). Your father is Amorite, and your mother is Hittite. Great faith and immense boldness of the prophets, to accuse one man and the whole city of ignobility. Marvelous is Daniel, who dared to say to the delinquent elder, committing adultery and murder: The seed of Canaan, not Judah, has deceived you (Dan. 13:56). Great is also Isaiah, who cries out to the princes and the people of Judah: Hear the word of the Lord, you princes of Sodom, listen with your ears to the words of the Lord, people of Gomorrah (Isa. 1:10). But not less so Ezechiel, who speaks confidently to the whole city: Your root, and your generation from the land of Chanaan: Your father Amorrhite, and your mother Chethite, Although even Stephen, the first martyr of the Gospel, spoke to the insane people (Acts 7:51): You have always resisted the Holy Spirit with stubborn necks and uncircumcised hearts (Al. you resist). And although we may understand that Jerusalem is the root and its generation the land of Chanaan, according to what is said, that the people was called in Egypt and dwelled there for a long time (for Cham, father of Chanaan, was the head of the Egyptian nation), nevertheless, according to the similarity of their crimes, we will say that the root of Jerusalem is the land of Egypt: Hence its father is also called Amorrhite, which means 'being talked about,' that is, being much celebrated in speech. And your mother Chethaea, that is, one who is possessed; who either herself is insane, or who sends others into madness. For everyone who commits sin is born of the devil (John 8:54). Therefore, in the whole world, the famous name of this ancient father is, and he turns many into madness. And it is commanded to Jerusalem, either according to the letter or according to the spirit, to leave the ancient father; and it is said to her: Hear, daughter, and see, and incline your ear; and forget your people, and your father's house: and the king will desire your beauty (Psalm 45:11). And it is promised to him that if he desires to return to the true father after sin: I will restore you as you were when you were born. What great nobility, that the city of Jerusalem, which descended from the lineage of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, had God as its father? And yet because he sinned and abandoned the true parent, he deserves to hear: Your root and your generation are from the land of Canaan: Your father is Amorite, and your mother is Hittite. If she heard this: what will happen to us who were called from the filth of the nations, who have lost every stain in the baptism of the Savior, if we defile the garment of Christ and do not have the wedding garment at the banquet? Certainly, it is necessary that we are handed over with bound hands and feet to eternal flames, in which there is weeping of eyes and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 22).

<h2 id='tocuniq153'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

(Verse 4, 5.) And when you were born, on the day of your birth your umbilical cord was not cut, and you were not washed in water for your own health, nor were you sprinkled with salt, nor wrapped in swaddling clothes. No eye had pity on you, to do any of these things out of compassion for you: but you were thrown out into the open field, in the abjection of your soul, on the day you were born. LXX: And on the day you were born, they did not bind your breasts, and your umbilical cord was not cut, and you were not washed in water for your own health, nor were you sprinkled with salt, and you were not wrapped in swaddling clothes; no eye had pity on you, to do any of these things for you, and allow anything to happen to you, and you were thrown out into the open field, in the corruption of your soul, on the day you were born. Let us discuss each point in the order of the reading. When Jerusalem was born from her father Amorite and her mother Hittite, and was poured out from the womb, her umbilicus was not cut, with which fetuses are nourished in the womb like trees and plants, which are nourished by the hidden moisture of the earth through their roots. And just as the seed of men is signified in the loins, so the genitalia of women are called umbilicus in honorable speech according to the custom of the Scriptures, as witnessed by Job, who speaks figuratively of the devil as a dragon: His strength is in his loins, and his power is in the navel of his belly (Job 40:11). For this ancient dragon serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, deceives the world; he has power over men in their loins, and over women in their navels. But this refers to Jerusalem: that it did not immediately receive the law, and that the beginnings of its shameful birth were not cut off; but it first lived a Gentile life; for this reason the Seventy translated: 'On the day you were born, they did not bind your breasts' (Ezek. 7:8), having this holy Scripture custom, that it might use the words heart, bosom, or breast, and breasts according to each appropriate context. Priests in whom there should be doctrine, and they seek the law from their mouth, receive a small breast. John reclines upon the Lord's breast, so that he may draw from the most abundant fountain the flows of wisdom (John 13). In the Song of Songs, the Virgin has two breasts, like two twin young goats that feed among lilies until the day breathes and the shadows flee away (Song of Songs 4). A loving mother, as soon as her little child is born, binds her breasts so that they may cease from tender swelling and preserve her virgin beauty. But when she reaches the age of puberty, it will be said of her: Will the bride forget her adornment, or the virgin her breastband? (Jeremiah II, 32) It follows: And you were not washed in water for salvation. The bodies of babies, as soon as they are born from the womb, are usually washed with water: so too does the spiritual generation require the saving washing. For no one is clean from filth, not even if his life were of only one day (Job XXVI, 14, 15). And in the Psalms we read: In iniquities I was conceived, and in sins my mother conceived me (Psalm 50:6). The second birth dissolves the first birth. For it is written: Unless one is born of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God (John 3:5). Many are the baptisms that the Pagans have in their mysteries, and the heretics promise: they all cleanse; but they do not cleanse for salvation. Therefore, it is added: and in which you have not been cleansed for salvation. This can be understood not only about heretics, but also about ecclesiastics who do not receive baptism with full faith. It must be said about them that they receive water, but they do not receive the spirit, just like Simon Magus who wanted to buy the grace of God with money. He was indeed baptized in water, but he was by no means baptized unto salvation (Acts 8). Thirdly, it is said: 'not seasoned with salt.' When the tender bodies of infants still hold the warmth of the womb, and they announce the beginnings of laborious life with their first cries, they are usually touched with salt by the midwives to make them drier and more constricted. Furthermore, Jerusalem, which was born of wicked parents, has achieved nothing of taste, nothing of diligence. But those who are reborn in Christ are said to: 'You are the salt of the earth' (Matthew 5); and it is commanded to them by the Apostle: 'Let your speech always be seasoned with grace' (Colossians 4). Hence, both the wise are commonly called salty, and the foolish are called tasteless. And in the book of Leviticus it is established by law: 'All your sacrifices shall be seasoned with salt.' The salt of the Testament of the Lord will not cease from your sacrifices: you shall offer salt with all your offerings (Leviticus 2:13). He who is seasoned with this salt, and has dried up every harmful decay and moisture by its mixture, will no longer say: My wounds have festered and become rotten because of my foolishness (Psalm 37:6). I know that I have read in a certain volume about the Lord Savior, that he himself is the heavenly salt; and not only the earthly and infernal, but also the celestial things are seasoned by its flavor: so that what is written may be fulfilled: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will (Luke 2:14). The fourth thing is: not wrapped in swaddling clothes. And the Savior was wrapped in swaddling clothes as an infant, and everyone who is born needs God's protection through the swaddling clothes. It is natural, however, that where the diligence of parents is not lacking, the infants' umbilical cords are first cut after birth: then they are washed with water to cleanse the blood. Thirdly, the moisture of the infants' bodies is dried with the addition of salt. Fourthly, so that the tender bodies of infants are wrapped in swaddling clothes, for two reasons: so that the body is dried with salt, and so that it is kept and tightened with the clothes so that it does not flow away; and so that the most delicate limbs are not easily deformed. And even the bodies of the barbarians are more upright than Roman bodies. Until the second and third year, they are always wrapped in cloths. But not such is Jerusalem, whose navel is not cut off, nor are her breasts bound, nor is she washed with water for health, nor seasoned with salt, nor wrapped and bound with infancy cloths. But why she deserved none of these, the following Scripture testifies. The eye has not spared you: to do one of these things, being moved with compassion for you. For which reason, the Seventy determined: 'Your eye spared not over you: that it might make you one of all these.' And it is necessary, that a double edition have a double understanding. The prior signifies this: 'Your eye spared not over you, that it might make one of these things be merciful to you.' And the sense is: No one had mercy on you, having offended God; no one's bowels were moved for you, that out of the four higher Tensions at least one might be made for you; because you did not deserve to receive all things at once. In the second it is said: Your eye did not spare you, so that I may do this one thing for you out of pity for you. And this has the meaning: You have acted in this way, and thus you were born in sin and conceived in guilt by your mother, so that even she does not have pity on you. And when you acted in this way, so that you emerged as cruel against yourself through evil deeds: what could I have done for you, who did not even deserve to receive one thing from your superiors? Therefore, since none of the things that are commonly done for infants was done for you; and this not without cause or without judgement, but due to your fault and sin, for which even you have no pity on yourself: therefore you are cast down upon the face of the earth, or the wayside; and cast down because of the wickedness of your soul on the day you were born. Let us not be thrown down into the face of the field by the wickedness of the soul, in which there is a wide and spacious road that leads to death; in which the cavalry of the Chaldeans revels. It must also be considered that no one can commit any evil on the day of their birth, except at the time of the bath, when the wise generation of the faithful is assumed.

(Verse 6, 7.) But passing by you, I saw you trampled in your own blood. And I said to you when you were in your own blood, live: I said to you, indeed, in your own blood, live. I made you multiply like the growth of the field, and you entered and came to womanhood. Your breasts swelled, and your hair grew: and you were naked and full of confusion. LXX: And I passed by you, and saw you mixed in your own blood, and I said to you, multiply your life from your blood, as I gave you growth like the plants of the field, and you multiplied, and you were magnified, and you entered into cities of cities. Your breasts were erect, and your hair was grown; but you were naked and full of shame. After you were cast down on the face of the field, or on the face of the earth, because of the wickedness of your soul, I no longer deserved to help you. Nevertheless, passing by, I saw you trampled upon, or mixed in your own blood, that is, guilty of mortal crimes. And I provoked you, granting you repentance, and said to you: Though you are in blood, nevertheless live in conversion; and there was such an abundance of all things in you, that you had the likeness of the most fertile land, and the blessing of Jacob, with which his father blessed him, saying: Behold the smell of my son is like the smell of a full field, which the Lord has blessed (Gen. XXVII, 27); and you would enter the inner chambers of the Lord, and say with the bride: The king brought me into his chamber (Cant. I, 3); and you would go to the world of women, for which the Seventy translated: and you entered into the cities of cities; so that just as the Song of Songs is called the world of worlds; so let cities be called the cities of cities. Concerning which it is said in the Gospel: You have authority over ten, or over five cities (Luke 19:17, 18): so that you may be called not only a city, but a metropolis city, according to what is read in Isaiah: Faithful mother of cities, Zion (Isaiah 1:26, 27). Moreover, what Symmachus interpreted, and you have reached the adornment of women, or as Theodotio, and you have entered the adornment of adornments, for which we have stated the Hebrew sense: and you have reached the world of women, it shows the time of puberty, when young girls are called marriageable, and can be united with the embrace of husbands. Finally it follows: your breasts have swelled, and your hair has grown. The maturity of young women is indicated by the swelling or raising of the breasts, and the growth of hair. And when she was prepared for marriage, and had the beauty of the body, she did not have the coverings of clothing, nor was she protected by the help of God. If anyone does not have the clothing of Christ, they are naked. If anyone is not clothed with the bowels of mercy, goodness, humility, modesty, meekness, patience, they lie face down on the ground: and their beauty is marred by shame and nakedness.


<h2 id='tocuniq155'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) And I passed through you, and I saw you: and behold, your time, the time of lovers. And I spread my garment over you, and covered your shame. Septuagint: And I passed through you, and I saw you, and behold, your time, the time of those who divert: and I spread my wings over you, and covered your shame. What mercy! It was not enough to see her trampled in blood once, and to provoke her to repentance: but again he visited the sinner, and because she was naked, and full of confusion, he came and visited her again, and behold, her time, the time of lovers; whether according to the Septuagint, those who divert, or according to the interpretation of Aquila, the second συναλλαγῆς, namely the betrothal and wedding time; according to the first edition of the same and Theodotion, μαστῶν, which means of breasts: for which Symmachus translates ἀγαπῆς, which signifies love. Therefore, that was the time when women could join men and endure marital intercourse. However, merciful God spread His wings, and He took them in and carried them on His shoulders, according to what is written in the Gospel: \"How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing\" (Luke 12:34)? Or rather, He extended His garment as wings; for this is what the term \"pterygium\" means, with which Ruth covered her feet while sleeping at Boaz's feet (Ruth 3). And on the border, that is, on the hem of our garment, we are commanded to attach hyacinth fringes. This was done in order to cover the shame of Jerusalem, revealing the female genitalia under this name. Indeed, according to the Apostle: We surround the dishonorable parts of our body with greater honor (I Cor. XII, 13). Hence, the Psalmist sings: Blessed are those whose sins are forgiven, and whose sins are covered (Ps. XXXI, 1). This is why Ham, because he did not protect his father, is marked with eternal curse (Gen. IX). Let us turn our thoughts on what we said about Jerusalem to our own soul, which, as long as it remains in infancy, is free from sin. But when the time of its adulthood comes, there are many lovers of demons and heretics, and of perverse teachings, who desire to lead it astray. They are repelled by the protection of God, so that it may not receive the satellites of the devil, but rather the ministers of the Savior. For the diversion of lovers, and the abundance, it is expressed in Hebrew as Dodim (), according to the nature of their language, which means everything that has been turned upside down. The time of love, and the abundance of the lovers of God, can be understood in the cases of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: when the Lord promised to them liberation for their people after the slavery in Egypt.

And I swore to you; and I made a covenant with you, says the Lord God. LXX: And I swore to you, and I entered into a covenant with you, says Adonai the Lord. For I spread my cloak, or my wings, over you: and I covered your shame: therefore I swore to you, and I entered into a covenant, or testament, with you: that you would be joined to me rather than others who wanted to turn away from you, according to that, The Lord swore and will not regret it: you are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek (Ps. 110:4; Heb. 6). For the end of every controversy is an oath. And I live, says the Lord: unless the sinner repents of evil rather than death (Ezekiel XVIII). Therefore, at the time of the wedding, Israel receives the oath of God, in place of every dowry gift. And because David had said: Remember, O Lord, David, and all his meekness (Psalm CXXXI, 1): he who swears to the Lord, vows to God Jacob; and the Lord himself swears to him, as the Scripture says: The Lord has sworn truth to David, and he will not deceive him (Ibid., 11).


<h2 id='tocuniq156'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(V.9) And you became mine, and I washed you with water, and I cleansed your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil. For I spread my wings and covered your shame, and I swore to you, and I entered into a covenant with you; therefore you have become my possession: that which once belonged to another, when you appeared unclean, you began to belong to me, when I established my covenant with you by oath. Or, according to the custom of the prophets, 'You have become mine,' he said, 'insofar as you are united to me by marriage: and I washed you,' he says, 'with the water of saving baptism.' For unless someone is born again of water and the Holy Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God (John 3:5). And elsewhere we read: He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire (Mark 1:8). Concerning this baptism, Isaiah also speaks, saying: The Lord will wash away the filth of the sons and daughters of Zion; and he will cleanse the blood from their midst with the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning (Isaiah 4:4). But when he has washed and cleansed the blood, just as he healed the woman who was bleeding for twelve years by touching the edge of his cloak (Mark 5), it is not enough for him to wash with water and cleanse with blood, unless he also anoints with oil. This is in accordance with what the Samaritan, who is interpreted as a guardian, did: he first soothed wounds with the infusion of oil, and then restrained them with the severity of wine (Luke 10). But our Lord was anointed with another oil, which did not mitigate the pain of wounds, but bestowed joy, as the Holy Spirit said to him: Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your companions (Ps. 44:8). And there are fake strengths that simulate the gentleness of oil, promising sweet things through heretics; which turn into bitterness, and which the prophet detests when he says: But the oil of the sinner will not anoint my head (Ps. 140:5). But if someone is anointed by unction, that is, Christ is called, see how much Jerusalem has advanced: so that she herself, anointed with spiritual oil, has received the name of Christ; according to which we also read in the Psalms about Abraham: Do not touch my Christs, and do not malign my prophets.

<h2 id='tocuniq157'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) And you clothed yourself in various colors. LXX: And you adorned yourself with various garments: engaging in the rituals of the law, you abandoned idols. These are the various garments with which Joseph was clothed: and his brothers could not sell him unless they first stripped him of his varied tunic (Gen. XXXVII). And it is said of the bride in the forty-fourth psalm: The queen stood at your right hand in a robe adorned with gold, surrounded by variety (Ps. XLIV, 10). This is the clothing about which the Apostle speaks: Put on the new man, who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of the Creator (Ephesians 4:24). We want to know what are the various garments? Let the same Apostle teach us, writing to the believers: Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering (Colossians 3:12). What is more beautiful than this variety? About which Job also spoke: Who gives to women the wisdom of weaving, or the skill of variety (Job 38:36, Septuagint). And the high priest, once a year, when he offered incense for the people, entered into the Holy of Holies, using various garments (Exodus XXXIX; Hebrews IX). Certainly, if riches made the variety of garments and not holiness, and if diversity of virtues did not exist, then Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar would be recorded as having had these garments, and not Joseph, who, under a foreign and pastoral father, could not have colored or royal garments.

And you put on purple shoes. LXX: And you put on hyacinth shoes ((Al. Hyacinthino)). Aquila and Symmachus, purple; Septuagint and Theodotion, hyacinth. For which it is written in Hebrew Thas (). And because the speech is beautifully directed towards Jerusalem, and under the persona of a woman, all her adornments are described, purple or hyacinth shoes are mentioned, which do not suit male persons. Finally, for those who will observe Passover it is commanded that they should be dressed in plain clothing, with no diversity of color, and have their loins girded and their feet shod. These are the shoes about which the Apostle writes: having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace. Philo, a very eloquent man among the Jews, compares the hyacinth in the high priest's garments to the air, through which he believes heavenly and celestial things are signified. Jerusalem is not adorned with hyacinth until it is washed with water. Hence, the feet of the Apostles, to whom the Lord had previously commanded to shake off the dust from their feet (Matthew X), are washed by the Savior. And the bride says in the Song of Songs: I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them? (Song of Songs 5:3). And the divine word testifies about both Moses and Joshua (Exodus 3), that they should loosen the strap of their sandals, for the place on which they stand is holy. But once their feet have been washed and cleansed of all dirt, they are adorned with hyacinths or jacinths, which are of a golden and blue color, respectively: so that they may be swept up into the presence of the Lord in the air, and hasten to the heavenly kingdom.


And I have encircled you with fine linen. Jerusalem is adorned not only with various colors and wears hyacinth shoes, but also is girded with fine linen, from which the finest threads are woven into the priest's garment. And the wife in Proverbs, who weaves double garments for her husband, for both the present and future, is said to have made clothing for herself from linen and purple (Prov. XXXI). With this linen, the loins are girded whenever the thick incentives of lust are to be restrained and nothing of gross humor is left in them. And we fulfill the precept of the Apostle who says: Stand therefore, having your loins girded with truth (Ephes. VI, 14); as if he were saying in other words, with linen. And the Lord said to the Apostles: Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning in your hands (Luke 22:35). For unless we shall have bound up the flowing of the loins from rheumatism, we cannot have lamps in our hands. From this the Lord also speaks to Job: Gird up thy loins like a man (Job 38:3). And those who are about to eat the lamb, having their feet shod, holding a staff, standing in the truth of the Gospel, and being prepared for the blood of Christ, are said to have their loins girt (Exodus 12). Elias and John the Baptist also gird themselves with a mortifying girdle around the loins (2 Kings 1; Mark 1). Concerning them, the penitent sighs mournfully, saying: For my loins are filled with illusions (Psalm 37:8).

And I clothed you in fine linen. LXX: And I surrounded you with triple-threaded fabric. For which Aquila used the Hebrew word 'Messe' (meaning 'flourishing' or 'palpable'): Symmachus, with clothing: Theodotio. And when I diligently inquired about the meaning of the word 'triple-threaded', which the LXX translated, and since I could not find its use or etymology in any Greek sources, I finally learned from the LXX that it is a compound (for new things, new names must be created) and that it was clothing of such great delicacy that it is believed to have the thinness of hair and thread. And I, wishing to express the thinness of the garment, translated it as 'subtilibus', because it was woven with a fine thread and a covering. And fittingly to those, about whom he had said, 'This people's heart has become fat, and Jacob ate and drank, and was satisfied and became fat, and kicked, and abandoned his God, their Maker' (Deut. XXXII, 15), now the thinness of clothing is pardoned. For also in the Book of Wisdom, which is inscribed by some as Solomon's, the spirit of wisdom, the only-begotten and manifold, is called 'tenuis' and 'mutabilis' (Sap. VII). And manna, of which it is written, 'Man ate the bread of angels' (Ps. LXXVII, 25), is said to have been as fine as hoarfrost and have resembled coriander seed (Exod. XVI). According to the interpretation of the second edition of Aquila, who translated it floridly, we can understand it as a metaphor for the abundance of the land of Judah or the beauty of divine worship.

<h2 id='tocuniq158'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) And I adorned you with ornaments. Now he lists the ornaments in general, which he enumerates in the following sections: bracelets and necklaces, earrings and crown, and other ornaments which he gave to Jerusalem, and it is said in Isaiah that she lost everything due to her own fault. For it is written: Because they were lifted up, that is, the daughters of Jerusalem became proud and walked with a haughty neck (Isa. III, 16, 17), and the rest: instead of a belt, they were girded with ropes, and instead of a head ornament, they were disfigured with baldness, and instead of beautiful and soft garments, they were surrounded with the roughness of sackcloth.


And I gave bracelets into your hands. LXX: And I surrounded your hands with bracelets. When God gives us good works, He surrounds our hands with bracelets. Hence it is said that it is likened to the hands of the prophets (Hosea 13), and we often read in the hand of Haggai or Jeremiah and the rest (Haggai 1). In Job, the lip of the dragon is pierced by a bracelet, and all his venomous hisses, which are understood in perverse doctrines, are pierced by the circle of good works (Job 40).


And a chain around your neck. Regarding the chain, which we have interpreted according to the second edition of Aquila and Symmachus, the Septuagint and Theodotion translated it as κάθεμα, which is written not only here but also in Isaiah: The Lord will take away the glory of their garments, their hairnets, their bangles, their crescent ornaments, and their κάθεμα (Isaiah 3:18). But I believe κάθεμα is said by them to refer to various gems descending from the necklace on the chest of women, which is also a most beautiful adornment of women.


<h2 id='tocuniq159'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) And I placed a jewel above the mouth or nostrils. The Hebrew word 'Nezem' (except for Symmachus, who interpreted it as 'ἐπιῤῥίνιον') is translated by all as 'jewel'. Not that the jewels are placed in the nostrils that are called earrings because they hang from the ears, but so that the circles made in the likeness of earrings are called by the same name, and even today among other ornaments of women, golden circles are accustomed to hang from the front of the mouth and hang over the nostrils. We then understand them according to mystical understanding, when we can say with the Apostle: We are the good odor of Christ to those who are saved and to those who perish. To some, we are the odor of death leading to death; to others, we are the odor of life leading to life (II Cor. II, 15). When we live and it can be said of us, the dead shall not praise you, O Lord, but we who live (Psal. CXIII, 17), then God smells the fragrance of our good sacrifice, and we have a golden circle of senses and divine doctrines in our nostrils. When we are truly dead and are turned into mud and in the filth of vices, we have that ring in our nostrils, of which Solomon wrote: Like a gold ring in a pig's snout, so is the beauty of a woman who is ill-tempered.

And circles in your ears. LXX: And wheels upon your ears. Who shuts his ears, so as not to hear the judgment of blood, and encloses them with thorns, so as not to become a partner to the envious and detractors, of whom it is written: Do not associate with detractors, for suddenly their destruction will come, and who knows the ruin of both (Prov. XXIV, 21, 22)? Both the one who detracts and the one who willingly listens to them have these circles and wheels in their ears, not the wheels that follow the Cherubim (for those are of angelic strength), but diminutive wheels that correspond to human frailty. Therefore it is said also to God: The voice of your thunder is in the wheel (Psalm 76:19). For in those who pass through earthly things and barely touch the earth with their small footsteps, of whom it is written: Holy stones are rolled upon the earth (Zachariah 9:16), the voice of the Lord's thunder resounds, and the sound of lofty teachings is heard. But those who are led astray by human errors and do not have solid footsteps, but are carried about by every wind of doctrine (Ephesians 2), and are expelled from the paradise of stability, dwell in the region of Naid, which means fluctuation, and deserve to bear the judgment of the deceitful tongue, which inflames the wheel of our birth (Genesis 4).


And a crown of beauty on your head. LXX: And a crown of glory upon your head. We have interpreted 'decor' as 'elegance' according to Symmachus for the sake of the senses. Otherwise, in Hebrew it is called 'Thopherth', and in other translations 'καύχησις' or 'gloriation'. The other ornamentations belong to each individual member. The ornamentation of the head is the dignity of the whole body. But the crown is called a diadem for women, with which the hair is bound and ambition is adorned. We want to know what is the crown of beauty on the head of Jerusalem, let us turn to Exodus, in which it is written: And he made a golden plate, and wrote on it the letters deformed with the seal of the sanctification of the Lord, and put it on the head of Aaron (Exod. XXXIX, 29). The sign of the Lord's sanctification, the name of the almighty God, is written with four Hebrew letters (), and among them it is called ineffable, because his name cannot be spoken. Whose majesty even the pagans do not ignore, and the altar of the Athenians testifies to the unknown God. Hence the Apostle says: Him whom you worship as unknown, Him we proclaim to you (Acts 17:23). I believe this crown is the one of which the psalmist speaks: You have put a shine on us in the light of your face, O Lord (Psalm 4:7). And the Apostle said: I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now on, there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the righteous judge will give to me (2 Timothy 4:7, 8). And in another place to the Believers: My joy and my crown (Phil. 4:1). For the glory of the fathers is the children. And in Solomon it is written: The crown of glory is old age (Prov. 12:6); namely, those who have destroyed those things that belong to children, and after reaching maturity, have come to old age and the names of the fathers, of whom John writes after the children (1 John 2), and the young men who can say: When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I understood like a child, I thought like a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things (1 Cor. 13:11).


<h2 id='tocuniq160'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) And you are adorned with gold and silver. We have often said that gold pertains to the mind, and silver to eloquence. May the Lord grant us to receive divine understanding and wisdom, and to bring forth with eloquence what we conceive in our minds, and by no means to make an idol out of them as heretics do, of whom it is written: 'I gave them silver and gold, but they made a Baal out of silver and gold' (Hosea 2:8). And this, according to spiritual understanding, is more suited to the adornment of women. Otherwise, silver, a cheaper material, is suitable for the adornment of rustic and poor maidservants, which does not befit Jerusalem, which is said to have advanced to being a queen.

And you are dressed in fine linen and embroidered cloth and many colors, 70: And your clothing is made of fine linen, embroidered with multicolored thread. The Hebrew word "Mesi" here, Theodotion has translated as "bysso" above, Aquila has translated it as "ἄνθιμον," Symmachus as "polymitum." But we have said above that "polymitum" is similar to Symmachus' translation, meaning fine linen. The LXX has translated it as "trichapta," preserving the previous interpretation, in order to show a similarity to fine hair in the clothing. But all the adornment of women is described, such as bathing, cleaning, anointing with oil, and dressing in colorful garments, wearing hyacinth on their feet, girding themselves with fine linen, wearing fine and delicate clothes, wearing bracelets and a golden necklace, hanging circles on their ears, and small wheels, wearing a diadem on their head, decorated with gold and silver. Even though silver is a cheaper material and is brought in last. You are dressed in fine linen and multicolored clothes; or, as the Septuagint translated, with a cloak and a mantle, for these things signify not only that she was adorned in her physical appearance and had all the jewelry of women, but also that she was attentive to her bed and couch with marital diligence, so that after fulfilling these things, she would come to the delights of food, and not allow anything to be lacking even in these things. We will adapt all these things according to the higher explanation of spiritual intelligence: so that they may be covered with a fine fabric and delicate, so as not to burden the delicate limbs of the spouse with a heavy load of garments, but also to provide both utility and beauty.

You have eaten both honey and oil, and you have become exceedingly beautiful. After clothing, she takes care of food, so that she may eat the honey and oil, or in parts, as many believe, or in a mixture of the three, sweeter bread, which is the bread that descended from heaven (John 6); and under three names, as some think, it indicates the sacrament of the Trinity: not that there is a different substance for each; but so that through the different names of honey, oil, and flour, the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit may be shown. And it should be noted that in many sacrifices, fine flour is offered, the purest part of the wheat, as it is written: And he fed them with the fat of wheat (Psalm 80:17): not barley or bran, which are only offered when the husband is moved by a spirit of jealousy. In the Book of Judges we read about Deborah (Judges 4), who is interpreted as a bee, whose prophecies are the sweetest honey, and she is related to the Holy Spirit, who is called by the Hebrews in the feminine gender, Rua. In the Gospel of the Hebrews, which the Nazarenes read, the Savior is presented speaking: 'My mother, the Holy Spirit, has taken me just now.' Furthermore, the wheat that is made into dough is related to the Lord, who says about himself, 'Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it yields much fruit' (John 12:24). And the oil, which sustains and refreshes the limbs of the weary, and is the nourishment of light, and with which the constant light of the lamp is kindled in the tabernacle of God, is said to symbolize the Father. All of these bestow grace on those who believe, as the Apostle says: There are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all (1 Corinthians 12:4-5). Whoever eats this food, and that most sweet and delightful bread, and is nourished and fed by the splendor of the oil, will be transformed into beauty and become exceedingly beautiful, not once, but repeatedly, excessively, exceedingly. For indeed, the repeated adverb adds weight to the speech: so much so that nothing can be added beyond the greatness of beauty.

And you have succeeded in the kingdom. This is not found in the Septuagint, which perhaps those in Alexandria who were translating the Scriptures from Hebrew to Greek out of fear of offending the king of Egypt did not include, while they were stating that Jerusalem was the rightful kingdom from God. Although learned men attest that they have translated only the five books of Moses (See above, chapter V). After an abundant display of ornaments, after a crown, after an abundance of gold and silver, after beautiful garments and robes, after incredible splendor, he advances to be queen, because she is the city of a great king, of whom it is written: Give your judgment to the king, and your justice to the king's son (Psalm 17:1). And in the Apocalypse of John, Jerusalem is described as a bride adorned and prepared for her husband (Rev. 21). In the Psalms also, it is said of the same: The queen stood at your right hand in a golden robe, adorned with various decorations (Ps. 44:10). But everything we say about Jerusalem, so as not to dwell on individual details and not to make the size of the books tedious for readers, let us refer to the Church. For if Jerusalem, according to the Apostle (Gal. 4), is our mother; and our mother is the Church: therefore, Jerusalem is the Church, the mother of the primitive ones who are described in heaven.


<h2 id='tocuniq161'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) And your name went out among the nations because of your beauty, for you were perfect in my splendor which I had placed upon you, says the Lord God. LXX: And your name went out among the nations in your beauty, for it was complete in the beauty which I had placed upon you, says the Lord God. Symmachus interpreted this passage more clearly: And your name went out among the nations, which was perfect because of my dignity, which I had placed upon you, says the Lord God. And this is the meaning: By my favors and my incredible generosity, you have obtained the title of queen, so that the speech of all nations would speak of you, and you would not be praised for your own merits and virtues, but for my perfect generosity. For unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the Lord guards the city, the guard keeps watch in vain (Ps. CXXVI, 1, 2). For neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth (1 Cor. III). For it is not the one who wills or the one who runs, but the mercy of God that makes a difference (Rom. IX, 16): so that after we have done everything we are commanded to do, we may say: We are worthless servants; we have only done what we ought to have done (Luke XVII, 10). Not that by the generosity of God, free will is taken away from man, but rather that freedom itself should have the Lord as its helper.

<h2 id='tocuniq162'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15) And having confidence in your beauty: you have fornicated in your name, and you have exposed your fornication to everyone passing by, so that they might become like you. A great danger, not to trust in the mercy of God, but in one's own beauty. And the higher one is, the more they should fear lest they fall and fornicate in their own name. Indeed, the adversaries despise ordinary food and desire foreign nourishment. Thus it is said of the devil: His food is choice (Habakkuk I, 16). He does not want to deceive anyone. Saul, the king chosen by the Lord, hastens to supplant Judas the apostle. Therefore, let us not trust in our own beauty, nor consider God's generosity to be our own virtue; but rather let us hear: Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring (Prov. 27:1). And in another place: Brothers, if a man is overtaken in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness, keeping watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted (Gal. 6:1). Let us not expose or pour out our fornication to every passerby, so that we may not become not of God, in whom we believe, but of the one by whom we are polluted. He who welcomes all vices, and receives into his bosom the spirit of various sins as they pass by, and spreads his legs to every passerby, he pours out his fornication, and begins to endure the dominion of the one whose guest he has become.

<h2 id='tocuniq163'>(Vers 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) And taking from your garments, you made for yourself lofty things sewn on here and there, and you fornicated upon them, as it has not been done, nor will it be in the future. LXX: And you took from your garments, and you made for yourself sewn idols, and you fornicated upon them, and you will not enter, nor will it happen. Symmachus interpreted this passage as follows: And when you took from your garments, you made for yourself lofty multicolored things, and you fornicated in them, things that have not been done nor will be in the future. Pro consutis et versicoloribus et excelsis, sive idolis, Aquila et Theodotio ἐμβολίσματα transtulerunt, quod significat diversos pannos hinc inde consutos, et instar emplastri factum idolum, quasi πολύῤῥαφον vestimentum. Vestivi, inquit, te versicoloribus, et induta es bysso, et polymito, et multarum varietate formarum. Tu autem vestimenta tua quibus mealargitate donata es, tulisti: et fecisti tibi idola, vel excelsa, quae Hebraice dicuntur Bamoth (), quod numquam ante factum est, neque fiet; ut quae acceperis ad ornatum, transtuleris ad injuriam donatoris. What can be understood literally about the above Jerusalem is that it has assigned all the precepts of the Law and the abundance of riches and all things to idols, which no other nation has done or will do. For all the nations that have served idols from the beginning are not guilty of such a great crime. But our Jerusalem, which is interpreted as the vision of peace, is divided by heretics when they, taking one and another testimony of the Scriptures from their own places, try to attach them to those things with which they cannot be joined. To whom and above we read in the same prophet: Woe to those who consume pillows under every elbow hand, and make coverings over the head of the whole age (cf. XIII, 18): the Lord, prohibiting this from happening, speaks in the Gospel: No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece pulls away from the old, and the tear becomes worse. Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins (cf. Matthew IX, 16, 17). There are Nazarenes who strive to adapt the observance of the old Law to the grace of the Gospel. And all heretics attempt to impose an interpretation that agrees with their own ideas, while the Domincan tunic, which is woven throughout, cannot be torn apart, but woven by the Holy Spirit it receives no division. What is said according to the LXX, 'You shall not enter, nor shall it exist,' signifies this: when you make idols of perverse doctrines, which you consider superior, and you commit fornication with them, believing in what you yourself have fabricated, you will not be able to enter the temple of God. And your idols shall not have substance, nor shall they endure forever, as the Apostle says: For we know that there is no idol in the world (I Cor. VIII, 4).

<h2 id='tocuniq164'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) And you took the vessels of your adornment from my gold and silver, which I gave to you; and you made for yourself male images, and you committed fornication with them. According to the letter of the Lord's Law, it was commanded that incense burners, vases, candlesticks, the Ark of the Covenant, and all things golden or gilded, and other things made of silver, were to be made. All of these were made in Jerusalem and turned into idols of Baal, Baalim, Chemosh, Ashtaroth, and Milcom. According to spiritual understanding, we make idols out of gold and silver from the Holy Scriptures when we corrupt the grace of perception and eloquence with heretical perversity, and we set our mouth in heaven, while our tongue reaches to the earth. The images in which every heresy commits fornication are called masculine, because each one thinks they are worshipping the most powerful and possessing what they have imagined, and that it cannot be subverted by any attack. These are the images that we have created in our hearts, and which are to be destroyed in the heavenly Jerusalem, of which the Prophet pronounces: Lord, in your city you will scatter their image (Ps. LXXII, 20). For whoever is a man and has lost the name of God, it is said of him: Nevertheless, man walks in an image, nevertheless he is troubled in vain (Ps. XXXVIII, 7). But we have one man, and we worship one image, which is the image of the invisible and omnipotent God.


<h2 id='tocuniq165'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18) And you took your multicolored garments and covered them: masculine images are understood: so that every form that he had received for use, he would turn into blasphemy. But we do this whenever we surround heretical depravity with prudence, temperance, fortitude, justice, and all virtues, and under the guise of these, we deceive even the simple; so that seeing the sweet honey of virtues, they do not beware of the poison of vices.


And you have set my oil and my incense before them. And you have set my bread (or as the Septuagint translated, my loaves) which I gave to you; fine flour, and oil, and honey, with which I nourished you, you have set them before them as a sweet-smelling aroma. The oil of which we have spoken above, and the incense, or the offering, of which the Psalmist proclaims: Let my prayer be directed as incense before you (Ps. 140:2); and the bread of the Presence, which we are commanded to offer to God: also the fine flour, the purest meaning of the Scriptures, and the honey, which Jonathan tasted, and his eyes were opened and he was strengthened (1 Sam. 14), miserable Jerusalem set before idols, or before male images, so that they might be for them a sweet-smelling aroma, which by their nature are sweetest and most pleasant: but while they are offered to idols and false doctrines, they are turned into bitterness.


<h2 id='tocuniq166'>Book Five</h2>

Book Five

So that the number of books may not be confused, and the order of volumes, divided among themselves over long periods of time, may not be corrupted, I have placed prefaces before each book, so that the reader may immediately recognize from the title page how many books he has to read, and which prophecy is to be explained by us. Therefore, in the previous volume, that is, the fourth, I discussed a part of the prophecy against Jerusalem, of which this is the beginning: Your root and your generation are from the land of Canaan, up to the place where it is written: You have nourished yourself with flour and oil and honey, which you have placed in their presence as a sweet smell, as I have spoken in a brief discourse. Now the remaining part of the same prophecy, along with the other things that follow, is dedicated to the fifth volume and to your name, Eustochium. In it, you will find nothing of rhetorical art, nothing of composition, and elegance of words, but rather the care of simple and diligent effort, so that this alone may be my praise, if you understand the words spoken by the prophet through me.

<h2 id='tocuniq167'>(Vers. 20 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 20 seqq.) And it came to pass, says the Lord God, that you took your sons and your daughters, whom you bore to me, and you sacrificed them to be devoured. Is your fornication of little consequence, sacrificing my sons? And you gave them to consecrate them. And after all your abominations and fornications, you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and full of confusion, trampled in your own blood. LXX: And it came to pass after these things, says the Lord God, that you took your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne, and sacrificed them to be consumed, as though you have acted like a whore in doing so. And you killed your sons and offered them up to them, that is, above all your whorings and abominations, and you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and exposed; you lived in your own blood. That their sons and daughters of Jerusalem, of whom it is written, 'I have begotten and exalted sons,' they themselves have despised me (Isa. I, 2); the holy Scripture recounts that they have sacrificed their sons and daughters to idols (Ps. CV, 37). And again: 'They have shed innocent blood' (Ibid., 38), the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan (Exod. IV, 22). But he calls them according to the Hebrew. For he himself had said of them: My firstborn son Israel. Or according to the Seventy, your offspring which you conceived through fornication. But in that place where we have placed them, and you have given them by consecrating them, for which the Seventy have translated, and you have given them to appease, or to atone, Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion have placed, you have translated and led them: because the pagans either cause their children to pass through fire, or compel them to cross over, whether they are infants or adults. When you do these things, she said, you do not remember your infancy, when I carried you covered in blood and washed you, and after many things that prophetic speech narrated, I united myself to you. Also, our Jerusalem, if it is supplanted by heretical deception, takes away her sons, who are stronger in faith, and daughters who do not have such great strength of faith. Or indeed sons, who know mystical things: daughters who follow a simple history; and delivers them to be devoured by demons, and when she kills them, she believes she is giving them life, and appeasing the idols, with whose slaughter they are satiated. And what is said according to the Septuagint, that is, over all your fornication and abominations, it signifies that the doctrine of demons is worse than all sins and fornications: indeed, it will kill the ones whom it had begotten for God either with much effort or had made them its own sons, whom it had generated in fornication.

<h2 id='tocuniq168'>(Vers 23 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 23 and following) And it came to pass after all your wickedness: woe, woe to you, says the Lord God. And you built yourself a brothel, and made for yourself a prostitute in all the streets. At every head of the road you built a sign of your prostitution, and you made your abominable beauty, and you spread your feet to everyone passing by, and multiplied your fornications. And you fornicated with the sons of Egypt, your neighbors with great flesh, and you multiplied your fornication to provoke me. LXX: And it came to pass after all your evils, woe, woe to you, says the Lord God. And you built for yourself a dwelling of prostitution, and you made for yourself prostitution in every street. And in the beginning of every way you built your prostitution: and you corrupted your beauty, and spread your legs to every passerby, and multiplied your prostitution: and you committed adultery with the sons of Egypt your neighbors, who are of great flesh, and you committed adultery in many ways, to provoke me to anger. What is said second, woe to you, the Vulgate edition does not have, but it has been added from the edition of Theodotion. And again, where we said: And you built for yourself a brothel, which the Seventy translated as: And you built for yourself a dwelling place of fornication, Symmachus and Theodotion interpreted as πορνεῖον; Aquila, wishing to express the etymology of the Hebrew word Gob (), put βάθυνον, which we can say means pit: to indicate a foul and deep den where the lust of prostitutes dwells. And what follows: And you have made for yourself a brothel in every street, for which Seventy translated ἔκθεμα, in Hebrew it is called Rama: and both Aquila and Symmachus and Theodotio have interpreted it as high or lofty. Finally, in the following passages, where it is written: To every head of the road you have erected a sign of your prostitution, as a sign and fornication, again in Hebrew it is called Rama (), which we have interpreted as either brothel or sign, since among the Hebrews it is one word. However, this is stated because it is lofty; so that for those who desire to fornicate, the place of fornication may be far away and there is no need to search for it. What we have said once and again and again, let it suffice to have said it forever, that under the guise of a woman, after many benefits from her husband, describing the fornication of Jerusalem, how she has departed from God and joined with idols, and was not satisfied with hidden fornication; but rather built herself a brothel and placed a sign on every street for those passing by, so they would come to the prostitute and satisfy their lust, not only their own, but also the one who has spread her legs for every passerby, and has defiled the greatness of beauty with the greatness of fornication: and among other things, she has also been bowing down to the Egyptians, her neighbors, in a love of great flesh. And in order to demonstrate every kind of ugliness, it was deformed by various forms of filth. But there is no doubt that Palestine is near Egypt, as the Lord said to Abraham: I will give you all the land from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates (Gen. XV, 18), so that on one side it includes the Egyptians, and on the other side it includes the Assyrians, with whom it is said to have committed fornication in later times. But the fornication of Jerusalem with the Egyptians is an imitation of their idolatry. But against our Jerusalem, whether the Church or the souls of the believers, if they are negligent and exposed to all vices, a double curse is pronounced, so that they may hear: Woe, woe to you, says the Lord God, according to what is written in the Apocalypse of John: Woe to all the inhabitants of the earth (Apoc. 8:13). For if the holy one says: I am a stranger and a sojourner like all my fathers (Psalm 38:13): why is it not said that the sinner is an inhabitant of the earth? However, he builds for himself a brothel, who sins with complete freedom of the forehead; according to what is written: When the sinner comes into the depths of wickedness, he despises (Prov. XVIII, 3). And he constructs the highest place in all the streets: For wide and spacious is the way that leads to death. And at every head of the street he builds; so that he leaves behind no types of sins; but imitating the prostitute of Proverbs, he openly invites foolish young men into his embraces in the streets and in the corners of the streets, and pollutes the beauty of their souls, which they obtained as a benefit from God the creator (Prov. V and VII). And all his journeys are full of filthiness, and he opens his heart to all thoughts that supply the incentives of vices, and he spreads his legs and fornicates with his Egyptian neighbors, whose examples he follows, namely the pagans, who glory in their filthiness, and it is so wicked that it even surpasses them in filthiness. And he does all these things to provoke God to anger. Moreover, the Egyptians are said to have large genitals, either because of the magnitude of their filthiness or because of the deformity of their sins. Wherefore the saint says, 'The flesh of little children, which daily decreases in it, and is attenuated by virtues, so that it is not called flesh, but spirit, and speaks in the psalm: My soul has thirsted for you, O God, how many ways does my flesh long for you (Psalm 62:2): or (as some copies have) how my flesh has been consumed: in a desert and impassable and waterless land, I have appeared to you in the saint (1 Corinthians 5).' Therefore, the Corinthian fornicator is condemned to the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved. Concerning this flesh, it is written: All flesh is grass, and all its glory is like the flower of the field. The grass withers, and the flower falls, but the word of the Lord remains forever (Isa. XL, 6, 7). The Apostle also spoke about this: Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God (I Cor. XV, 50). And in Genesis, God speaks: My spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh (Gen. VI, 3). And it is said to the believers: Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit (Romans VIII, 8, 9). But there is another flesh of the saints, of which it is written: All flesh shall see the salvation of God (Isaiah XL, 5).

(Verse 27.) Behold, I will stretch forth my hand over you and will take away your righteousness, and I will give you over to the souls of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your wicked way. LXX: But if I stretch out my hand against you and take away your lawful possession and give you over to the souls of those who hate you, the daughters of foreigners who led you astray from your path. And what follows, 'ἠσέβησας,' that is, 'you acted impiously,' is connected with the following chapter according to the Septuagint, but according to the other translations, it is the end of the previous chapter. However, the Lord stretched out his hand over Jerusalem to correct the wrongdoer and take away its rightful possessions, which, as long as he observed God's commandments, were called the rightful possessions of the Lord. But when he worshiped idols and changed his religion into impiety, they are by no means called his rightful possessions. Which not only in the law and ceremonies, but also in the Sabbaths and feast days and new moons, must be observed. For in the law, it is said: My Sabbaths and my feast days. But when they turned away from God, it is said to them: I will not receive your new moons, and Sabbaths, and great day: my soul hates your fasting and rest, and your solemnities (Exodus 31; Deuteronomy 5; Isaiah 1:14). This is also written about the people (Deuteronomy 7). For when the people, who were previously called the people of God, turned away from the Lord, it is said of them concerning Moses: 'Your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, has sinned' (Exodus XXXII, 7). The stretching out of the hand is here called elsewhere as lifting up or visiting. For when God does not correct the sinner, He withdraws His hand. But if the sinner sins and begins to be sick in God's law, a visitation is sent to him; according to what is sung in the psalm: 'If his children forsake my law and do not walk in my judgements, I will visit their iniquities with the rod' (Psalm LXXXIX, 31, 32). And in this the prophet has written: If the earth sins against me to commit a crime, I will stretch out my hand against it and break its bread supply, and so on. In this we are questioning what the difference is between the stretching out of the hand and its emission. However, the devil speaks to the Lord: Stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, unless he blesses you to your face (Job 2:5). And it seems to me that the hand is sent, for the testing of those to whom it is sent; but it is stretched out, for the punishment of those who deserve torment. Not only extension and outreach, but also the stretching out of God's hands is called expansion, as Isaiah proclaims from the perspective of the Lord: 'All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people' (Isa. 65:2). It is also narrated that the holy hands are lifted up, as Scripture says: 'Let my prayer be counted as incense before you, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice' (Ps. 141:2). But since the legitimate practices of God have been taken away from the people of the Jews, let us ask them what observance of the law they have. The victims, with the temple being destroyed and overturned, cannot be offered; nor can the stoning of adulterers and the execution of other crimes permitted by law be carried out, nor can the year of release of the land and other similar things. However, it is given to the souls of the haters of the daughters of Palestine, when they are delivered to the Palestinians, whom the Seventy indiscriminately call foreigners: which we can understand as the cities or towns of Palestine. Our Jerusalem too, if we neglect the ceremonies of God, and his hand is stretched out against us, and the observance of the entire law is taken away, will be delivered to the daughters of Palestine and not to the sons. For we are not first consigned to more severe punishments, but according to the quality of sins, to lesser ones, so that being corrected in the lesser, we may avoid the greater torments. The Philistines, that is, the Palestinians, with the first part of the word changed, interpret it as falling by drinking, or breaking ((perhaps breaking)). By which it is signified that we are to be handed over to adversarial powers, who have drunk from the cup of Babylon and have fallen, and whose works are perverse. And so great will be the correction and disgrace of wretched Jerusalem, that even the opposing powers themselves will be ashamed at the magnitude of our sins. This we have interpreted according to Symmachus, 'scelerata': Theodotion placed the Hebrew word itself 'Zemma ()'. But with the ceremonies of God removed from the people of the Jews, it has passed to us along with the priesthood and the legislation, with the Scripture saying, 'Establish, O Lord, a legislator over them' (Psalm 9:21). And in another place: Set a law for me, O Lord, in your way (Psalm 26:11).

(Verse 28, 29.) And you have committed fornication with the sons of Assyria: because you were not yet satisfied, and after you committed fornication, you were still not satisfied. And you multiplied your fornication in the land of Canaan with the Chaldeans, and even then you were not satisfied. LXX: You have acted impiously, and you have committed fornication with the sons of Assyria; and even then you were not satisfied: you have committed fornication, and you have not been filled; and you have multiplied your agreements with the land of Canaan, and with the Chaldeans; and you have not been satisfied with them either. The above is written, Jerusalem fornicated with the sons of Egypt, her neighbors, who are of great flesh: this signifies the other neighboring of the Assyrians. And for this reason, both are handed over to the nations, because they worshiped the idols of both, and entering into Chaldea, which is the land of Canaan, they imitated the errors of those whom they were subject to. According to allegory, we often pass from one sin to another. And when we do not repent of our previous sins, we increase sins with sins, and we are satisfied with no error, but like calves tied with a long rope and an unceasing strap, we drag our sins, and we multiply our covenant, or fornication, in the land of Canaan, which is interpreted as fluctuation, and with the Chaldeans, who also sound like demons (Psalm 39:3). And we always have footprints in the salt, and we can never say: 'He has set my feet upon a rock'. And we are subjected to the malice of heretics, who have the likeness of demons: whether they are Demons themselves, of whom Paul writes: 'For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places' (Ephesians 6:12).

<h2 id='tocuniq171'>(Vers. 30, 31.)</h2>

(Verse 30, 31.) In what shall I cleanse your heart, says the Lord God, when you do all these works of a promiscuous and shameless woman? For you have made your brothel at the head of every street, and your high place you have made in every square; and you have not acted like a prostitute, increasing your price. LXX: What shall I do to your heart, says the Lord God, when you do all these works of a prostitute and shameless woman? ÷ And you have committed adultery three times with your daughters ** when you built your brothel at the beginning of every street, and you made your platform in every square; and you have not been like a prostitute gathering wages. And what the Seventy said: 'And you have prostituted yourself thrice with your daughters, which is not found in the Hebrew, nor has any other Interpreter put it.' But God speaks all of this contentiously towards Jerusalem, that He may find a remedy by which He can heal the sick and the half-dead; according to that which Isaiah writes: 'What more could I have done for my vineyard, that I have not done for it?' (Isaiah 5:4). And Hosea said: What shall I do with you, Ephraim? what shall I do with you, Judah? Your mercy is like the morning clouds, and like the dew in the morning that passes away (Hosea 6:4). For your idolatry is not hidden, but committed with complete freedom, as you set up altars and high places at the beginning of every street and on every corner, and you make your bed in every square. And you have not imitated the cunning of prostitutes, who often increase the price of desire with difficulty, and from this incite lovers to madness. Or according to the Septuagint: You were not like a prostitute gathering wages, but you gave what you should have received, so that you would not be protected by the help of those with whom you fornicated and followed demons, but rather, oppressed by various captivities, you would feel your calamities. And this can indeed be applied to every Christian soul, which, having abandoned the worship of God, has given itself over to vices and luxury, and pursuing a worldly life, did not even thrive in it, but lost the riches of religion and did not receive the riches of the world. And there was no difficulty at all in prostituting yourself to it, but you yourself embraced your lovers. Moreover, there is another spiritual fornication, when we forsake the Church and join the heretics, and build our brothel at the head of every road, as the divine word commands: Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is, and walk in it (Jeremiah 6:16), namely in the books of Moses, Joshua, Judges, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the other prophets. In the beginnings of all roads, their brothel is constructed, which, to the perversion of doctrine, abuses the testimonies of the Scriptures and says: This is what Isaiah says, this is what Hosea says, this is what Moses said, this is what Daniel said. And he does not place his brothel in the middle of the streets or at the ends of the roads, but at the beginning. For if he comes to knowledge and the depths of divine books, he will not be able to err. He also makes his high place or pedestal in every public square, allowing himself to be corrupted by the depravity and vices of the heathens, even among the heretics when he has been defiled by them, having no grace but exposing himself to contempt, because he easily lost the purity of faith that has passed. But this, which (as we have said above) is not found in Hebrew: Thou art fornicated threefold in thy daughters, or to Jerusalem, according to the letter, that in all kinds in its towns and villages it has fornicated; and there will be no corner or square left, where it has not set up the signs of idolatry: or to the Church and the deceived believers, who have not heard the words of the Apostle: Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you in all things, that your whole spirit, and soul, and body may be preserved blameless in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ  (1 Thess. V, 23); but they have fornicated in every kind, with body, and soul, and spirit. We read in Proverbs: But you write them in three ways, so that you may answer with words of truth that are proposed to you (Prov. XXII, 20, 21). And it is commanded to us that we understand the words of truth, that is, the holy Scriptures, in three ways. First, according to the letter; second, in the middle through tropology; third, in a higher way, so that we may understand mystical things. According to the letter, it is this: Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and one and twenty thousand fell in one day (I Cor. X, 8). And: Do not murmur, as some of them murmured and were destroyed by the destroyer (1 Corinthians 10:10). But according to the sense and tropology, when we depart from the literal meaning and ascend a little to higher things, as the Apostle says: It is written: You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain. And immediately follows: Is God concerned with oxen? Or is He speaking because of us? (1 Corinthians 9:9). But the highest and sublime spiritual understanding, according to the same Apostle: Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife. This is a great mystery. But I speak concerning Christ and the Church (Ephes. 5:31-32). The daughters of the Church are those who fornicate, first of the believers, and afterwards of the deceived in the heresy of the soul, whose fault is attributed to the mother.

(Verse 32 and following) But like an adulterous woman, who brings in strangers over her husband. All prostitutes receive payment: but you have given payment to all your lovers, and you would give them anything to come in to you from every direction to fornicate with you. And it happened in you contrary to the custom of women in your fornications, and there will be no fornication after you. For in that you have given payment, and have not received payment: it has become contrary to you. LXX: The adulterous woman − similar to you: receiving rewards from her husband: she gave rewards to all who fornicated with her, and you gave rewards to all your lovers, and you burdened them to come to you, going around in your fornication. And it happened in you that you turned against other women in your fornication, and they did not fornicate after you: because you gave rewards, and rewards were not given to you: and it happened in you that you turned against. What is written in the Septuagint is not found in Hebrew and disrupts the order of the reading, and it raises a significant question: which woman is being referred to when it is said that Jerusalem herself is an adulterous woman? So Jerusalem took all the abundance of things that had been given to her by the generosity of her husband, and she gave them to others, namely demons and idols, according to what is written in Hosea: 'And she did not know that I gave her grain, wine, oil, and multiplied her silver; but she made Baals, silver and gold' (Hosea 2:8). Therefore, in his anger, he immediately declares: 'Therefore, I will take back my grain in its time and my wine in its season; and I will take away my wool and my linen, so as not to cover her disgrace anymore. And now I will uncover her immorality in the sight of her lovers, and no one will rescue her from my hand.' And while all women usually receive payment from their lovers, Jerusalem did the opposite, giving more than she received. And to show the extent of her generosity, she would burden them, saying, 'Come to me often,' so that there would be no neighbor who would not be mixed up in her dishonor. And indeed, Jerusalem surpassed other prostitutes in this as well, not only giving what she had earned through the shameful practice, but also giving marital gifts to her lovers and her adulterers. So great was the example of the adulteress in all its magnitude of shame, that it is preferred not only to those present, but also to future prostitutes. Hence, we have interpreted it according to Symmachus: 'And after you there shall be no more fornication.' For by comparing yourself, all subsequent fornication will be considered less serious. Whatever we have said about Jerusalem, it applies to the Church and the souls of the believers, who give their lovers the gifts of marriage, namely gold in a metaphorical sense, and silver in speech, and clothing, with which our filthiness and shame are concealed; or to contrary strengths, or to masters of perverse doctrines, when they assert that vice does no harm, and that passive lust, according to the genital parts of the body, demands sexual intercourse by natural law: all foods must be used indiscriminately, created for this purpose, to be consumed. Prudence in that only necessary, that it benefits oneself; and justice does not have a place, which if it prevails, one must beg, and other such things. Jerusalem, miserable when receiving these things, in which the vision of peace should be, perverts the sharpness of intellect and the charm of eloquence into ugliness. And for her lovers, she adorned herself against her husband with these ornaments, in which she was adorned by a man for the abuse of good. And what follows: And you gave them that they may enter to fornicate with you from all sides, signifies all types of sins, so that she is not satisfied with just one sin, but endures a hunger for sinning, and is defiled against the laws of nature with all shameful parts up to her head.

(Verse 35 and following) Therefore, prostitute, listen to the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord God: Because your bronze has been poured out, and your disgrace has been revealed in your fornication (in your adulteries), with your lovers, and with the idols of your abominations, in the blood of your sons, whom you have given to them. Behold, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have mingled, and all those whom you have loved with all those whom you have hated, and I will gather them against you from all sides, and I will uncover your disgrace before them, and they will see all your shame. And I will judge you with the judgments of adulteresses, and those who shed blood, and I will give you into the blood (Vulg. blood) of fury and zeal, and I will give you into their hands, and they will destroy your brothel, and they will demolish your prostitution house, and they will strip you of your clothes, and they will take away the vessels of your beauty, and they will leave you naked, full of shame. And they will bring a multitude upon you, and they will stone you with stones, and they will kill (Al. mutilate) you with their swords. And they will burn your houses with fire, and they will bring judgment upon you in the eyes of many women, and you will cease to fornicate and no longer give bribes. And my indignation will rest on you, and my jealousy will be taken away from you, and I will rest and not be angry anymore, because you have not remembered the days of your youth and you have provoked me in all these things. Therefore, I have given you your ways upon your head, says the Lord God, and I have not acted according to your wickedness in all your abominations. LXX: Therefore, prostitute, hear the word of the Lord: Thus says the Lord God: Because you have poured out your wrath and your shame will be revealed in your prostitution to your lovers, and in all your wicked thoughts, and in the blood of your sons, whom you have given to them. Therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have mingled, and all those you loved with all those you hated, and I will gather them against you from all around, and I will reveal your evil deeds to them, and they will see all your shame. And I will avenge on you the vengeance of adulteries and the shedding of blood, and I will put you in the blood of fury and zeal, and I will deliver you into their hands: and they shall demolish your brothel, and destroy your foundation, and they shall strip you of your garments, and they shall take away the vessels of your glory, and they shall leave you naked and full of shame, and they shall bring a multitude upon you, and they shall stone you with stones, and they shall cut you with their swords. And they shall set fire to your houses, and they shall execute punishments on you in the presence of many women: and I will turn you away from fornication, and you shall no longer give rewards, and I will unleash my fury upon you, and my zeal shall depart from you, and I will rest and will be no longer concerned: because you have not remembered the days of your infancy, and you have grieved me in all these things. And behold, I will bring your ways upon your head, declares the Lord God, so that you have done wickednesses above all your other wickednesses. We lay the foundations of the story first. Because you have done these things and those things which the previous speech comprehends: therefore hear, O harlot, what you have done and what you will suffer. You poured out your brass which you received from me, and you gave payment to your lovers, which you should have received, and you killed your sons as you offered them to idols: so that you have become not only an adulteress, but also a murderer of your own children. Therefore, I will gather all your lovers with whom you have prostituted yourself, both those whom you have loved and those whom you have hated, and I will expose you as an adulteress and reveal your nakedness, so that all may see your shame and the genitals for which you were once consumed with passion. All these things are said metaphorically of an adulterous and murderous woman, who not only committed acts of adultery against her husband, but also killed her children. They are spoken concerning Jerusalem and the gathering of all the nations against her, of which she worshiped idols and turned all of God's gifts into their worship, and the temple of Baal must be destroyed and the altars of every city must be overturned by fire, so that nothing remains in her. And just as it is customary for all to throw stones at the adulteress and to slay the harlot, so that she may be killed by the wounds of each: so shall all women see the punishment of the fornicator. Thus, in the sight of others, in the surrounding cities and nations, Jerusalem shall be abandoned. And this shall be done, so that she may cease her whoring and no longer give wages to her lovers, and the anger of God may rest, and He may not be angered by her when she ceases to love. From this we understand that there is great offense, not taken care of by God, but allowed for man's crimes and sins. My zeal will be removed from you, I will rest, and no longer be angry, as if it were someone else, and what has departed from me, and which I have handed over to eternal nakedness. But if Jerusalem has endured this, because it fornicated with idols, what do we think it will endure, when it has killed God's Son? And you have done all these things, forgetting past kindnesses, and you have provoked me to anger, or saddened me, when you should have provoked me to joy with your good works. Therefore, I have also rendered your deeds upon your head. And when I destroy you, O adulteress, I will exercise less of my anger against you than you deserve, so that divine mercy may be shown, that sins may be greater than punishments. According to tropology, every soul receives spiritual money from God, according to the Gospel (Mt. 25, Lk. 19) which is spoken in five and two parables, and of one talent, and ten servants receiving each a single mina, who, when they act negligently, become debtors of fifty (or ten) denarii and five hundred, and because of this, in the presence of lovers, whom we understand as demons and contrary virtues, the ignominy of Jerusalem is revealed, either on the day of judgment or at the time of repentance when they are reproached. And indeed only the omnipotent God sees hidden things, as the Gospel says: And the Father who sees in secret (Matthew 6:6). And in another place: God, who searches the heart and reins (Psalm 7:10). And in the book of Kings: You alone know the hearts of all the sons of men (2 Kings 8). But when it is fulfilled: There is nothing hidden that will not be made manifest, nor secret that will not be revealed (Luke 12:2). And in another place: Judge not before the time, until the Lord comes, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise from God (1 Corinthians 4:5); and when the time of correction comes, then shall be fulfilled what Hosea says: Now their own thoughts have surrounded them (Hosea 7:2). And in another place: Mutual accusations or defenses of thoughts, on the day when God will judge the hidden things of men (Rom. II, 15). And again: Behold the man, and his works before his face. And all who had fornicated with her before will see her disgrace, and God will give it to them in the blood of fury and zeal. For the fury of a man is full against an adulterous wife, and it cannot be redeemed at any price. And the blood of the children can be understood in this way, that we call the good thoughts of men implanted by God in them the children of Jerusalem; the adulteress kills them when she turns to evil deeds. It is also advantageous for Jerusalem, that its brothel be dug up, and the entire seedbed of fornication be destroyed. For when this has been done, it will no longer provide wages, and the wrath of God will rest, and he will not be jealous of its chastity: namely, according to those who understand in a positive sense what is said. Others, however, as we have said above, take the opposite view, that it is a great anger of God not to be angry, since he has once despised the fornicator, and has despaired of his salvation. But if heretics who do not accept the old Testament according to the Septuagint edition criticize this passage that was said: And you were grieved in all these; because God not only receives wrath but also submits to sorrow and sadness, let us ask them how they accept what is certainly a commandment of the good God: Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed on the day of redemption (Ephesians 4:30). Whatever they may say in defense of that testimony, we will include it in the satisfaction of the present discourse.

(Verse 44.) Behold, everyone who speaks a commonly-known proverb, will apply it to you, saying: Like mother, like daughter. You are the daughter of your mother, who has cast away her husband and her sons, and the sister of your sisters, who have cast away their husbands and their sons. Seventy: These are all the things that they have spoken against you in a parable, saying: Like mother and daughter. You are the daughter of your mother, who has rejected her husband and her sons; and the sisters of your sisters, who have rejected their husbands and their sons. In the catalog of vices and corrections ((otherwise known as repentance)) in Jerusalem, by which one is drawn back to salvation, a well-known proverb in the common speech of the people is adapted, or as the Seventy translated it, a parable: Like mother, like daughter. The mother, however, is called Jerusalem, as is written above and in the following passages, and she is called Chethaea, which means raging or turning to madness: through her, the provocations of this world are shown, which lead the captive soul to destruction and separate her from her husband (no doubt, this is said by the word of God and his teaching). And the sister of their sisters, as we have read a little later, is called Sodom, and Samaria: one of which signifies the Gentile life and luxury, the other the deceitful followers of heretics. Moreover, what is read in the Septuagint, 'the sisters of your sisters, who rejected their husbands and their sons,' has no meaning. For what other sisters did Sodom and Samaria have, who are sisters to Jerusalem? And it must be asked, which husbands did Sodom and Samaria send away, and which sons did they reject? Unless, perchance, we are able to say this: that the feet of those who always wander are tossed about and there are no solid footsteps which are contrary to the truth; but they run hither and thither, and are carried about by every wind of doctrine, until they pass from falsehood to another falsehood (Ephesians IV). And when they realize that they have labored in vain at first, they proceed to second and third things.

<h2 id='tocuniq175'>(Vers. 45 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse. 45 seqq.) Your mother Hethaea (also spelled Chethaea), and your father Amorrhaeus, and your older sister Samaria: she and her daughters who live on your left. But your younger sister, who lives on your right, is Sodom and her daughters. But you did not walk in their ways, nor did you commit crimes like theirs, but rather, you committed even more wicked things in all your ways. LXX: Your mother Chethaea, and your father Amorrhaeus, your older sister Samaria: she and her daughters who live on your left, and your younger sister, who lives on your right, is Sodom and her daughters: and even so, you did not walk in her ways, nor did you act according to her wickedness, but rather, you transgressed against them in all your ways. He had said above: your father is Amorrhæan, and your mother Chethæan; here with the order and number changed: Your mother is Chethæan, and your father is Amorrhæan. For when they have advanced in wickedness, they are divided into parts; and deserted unity, they make progress into a tumult and multitude, which is not able to ascend to the mountains with Jesus. But Jerusalem is the sister of Samaria, and Sodom, of which one is on the left, the other on the right, even according to the carnal understanding, if you look from the temple at Jerusalem towards the East, you will approve. Majorca is said to be Samaria, because it sinned first and was led into captivity by the Assyrians; and Minor and younger Sodom, which is related to a multitude of nations. Otherwise, at that time Sodom was not there, which we read about before in the Scriptures, with Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, it was destroyed by divine fire (Gen. 19). However, in between the two sisters, Jerusalem, which is also called Judah, was led into Babylon by the Chaldeans; and Jerusalem sinned much more wickedly than Samaria and Sodom, worshipping the idol of Baal in the temple, and later killing the Son of God. Furthermore, according to tropology, Samaria and Sodom, that is, heretics and the Gentiles, often commit less serious sins than those who are considered Jerusalem, that is, the Ecclesiastics. Therefore, it is said to the Corinthians, who indeed believed in Christ but were oppressed by evil works: Certainly there is heard among you fornication, and such fornication that not even among the Gentiles, so that one has his father's wife (I Cor. V, 1), and so on. The heretics, however, who still accept the old Testament, understand three natures from this place: spiritual, animal, and earthly. And they refer the spiritual to Jerusalem; the animal to Samaria; the earthly to Sodom. Let us briefly ask them how the three natures, spiritual, animal, and earthly, which are certainly distinct from each other, are said to have one mother and one father? This does not correspond to their fabrication. And how will the animal and earthly nature be restored to their original state, that is, the spiritual state, according to this same prophet? This is contrary to their own reasoning. Moreover, the understanding that Samaria refers to heresies is confirmed in the prophet Hosea and many other places, especially by this testimony: Woe to those who despise Zion and trust in the mountain of Samaria, they have taken the firstfruits of the nations (Amos 6:1). For all heretics despise Zion, which is interpreted as a watchtower, and is referred to the Church; and they trust in themselves on the mountain of Samaria, namely in the pride of perverse doctrines, which they think are sublime, and through these fraudulent preachings, they plunder and pillage the beginnings of nations, so that, through the wonder of teachings, they may draw even the powerful ones of the Gentiles into heretical error.

(Verse 48, 49) I live, says the Lord, that Sodom, your sister herself and her daughters did not do as you and your daughters have done. Look, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, abundance, and idleness of herself and her daughters; and they did not strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty and committed abominations before me, and I took them away as you saw. And Samaria did not commit half of your sins; but you surpassed her in your wickedness, and you have justified your sisters in all your abominations that you have done. LXX: I live, says the Lord Adonai: this is what your sister Sodom did, and her daughters did the same as you and your daughters. However, the wickedness of your sister Sodom was pride, fullness of bread, and abundance. She and her daughters lived in luxury and had an abundance, but they did not support the poor and needy. They were proud and committed iniquities in my sight, so I took them away as you have seen. And Samaria has not sinned half as much as your sins, and you have multiplied your iniquities upon them; you have justified your sisters in all your iniquities which you have done. What the LXX has placed, she and her daughters also have, but it is not found in Hebrew. In the Old Testament, there is the oath of God: As I live, says the Lord (Num. XIV, 21). But in the New Testament: Truly, truly, I say to you (John XIII, 16). But if this is common with others: God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, He is not the God of the dead, but of the living (Mark XII, 16, 27). And in another place: I will please the Lord in the land of the living (Ps. CXIV, 9): we seek to understand how the common term properly belongs to God. But how is it said, a good tree, and a good man, and a good shepherd, and a good servant (Luke XVIII); for no one is absolutely good, except God alone: so when the angels and other virtues, as well as patriarchs and prophets, and even the apostles, are called living in comparison to almighty God, they are called dead. For what is the man who lives, and does not see death? (Psalm LXXXVIII, 49). Hence, the apostle Paul also said about God: He alone, he said, has immortality and dwells in inaccessible light (I Timothy VI, 16). And about the fountain of life: Our life, he says, is hidden with Christ in God (Colossians III, 3). Therefore, this person who swears and says: As I live, says the Lord, describing the crimes of Sodom and its daughters, established the first pride, the very own of the devil, and the first sin. Wherefore as the same Apostle says: 'Lest being inflated with pride, he fall into the judgment of the devil' (1 Timothy 3:6), on account of which he says: 'And his pride fell from heaven' (Isaiah 14:12). For he had said: 'I will do it in the strength of my hand, and by wisdom of my understanding I will take away the bounds of the people, and I will rob their strength, and I will make their cities desolate: and I will break them asunder, and they shall not be able to stand, nor shall they be able to resist my force' (Isaiah 10:13-14). And: 'God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble' (James 4:6). We also read in another place: 'Why do you boast, O earth and ashes?' And the Gospel tells of the Pharisee's pride overcome by the humility of the tax collector (Luke 18): whose seedbed is the abundance of bread and all things, and leisure; or as the Septuagint translated, the luxury and opulence of delights. That rich man in the Gospel, dressed in purple (Luke 16), is reported to have had no other fault except that, being abundant in wealth and riches, he had burst forth with such pride that he did not reach out his hand to the needy and poor Lazarus: and thus he had forgotten his own condition, to the point that he did not even give this miserable man what was to be thrown away. For what reason and in another place it is written: Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted (Luke XIV, 11). Pride, gluttony, abundance of all things, leisure and indulgence, are sins of Sodom, and because of this, the forgetfulness of God follows, which considers present goods to be perpetual and never in need of necessities. Therefore, it is also commanded by the law: Take care lest, while eating and drinking and being satisfied, you build good houses and possess sheep and oxen, silver and gold, you forget the Lord your God (Deuteronomy VIII, 11). And in another place it is written about Israel: 'He ate and drank, and was satisfied, and grew fat, and kicked' (Deut. XXXII, 15). Knowing this, the wisest of all, Solomon, prays in Proverbs: 'Give me what is necessary and sufficient, so that I may not become full and deny you, saying: Who will see me? Or becoming poor, steal and profane the name of my God' (Prov. XXX, 8, 9). And what follows: 'And you justified your sisters in all your abominations, which you have done, not simply judging Sodom and Samaria to be wicked, but with a comparison to the worse: as the Publican, of whom we have spoken above, is not called absolutely righteous, but in comparison to the worse.' And yet even though Sodom and Samaria were such, they did not even sin half as much as Jerusalem. For the servant who knows his master's will and does not do it, shall be beaten with many stripes (Luke XII, 47). And: The mighty shall suffer torments mightily (Wisdom VI, 7). Furthermore, that which is contained in Hebrew for luxury (or wealth), should be understood to refer to this meaning: In desires is the entire soul idle; that is, that there should always be something to do: lest the field of our heart, with the hand resting, be occupied by the thorns of evil thoughts.


<h2 id='tocuniq177'>(Vers. 52.)</h2>

(Verse 52.) So you also bring your own confusion, having surpassed your sisters in your sins, acting more wickedly than them ((Other version: against them)): for they have been justified by you. Septuagint: And you will bear your torment because you have corrupted your sisters in your sins, in which you have acted unjustly against them, and you have justified them against yourself. The second tablet after the shipwreck is to be ashamed when you have sinned, and not to subject yourself to the reproach that is said against Jerusalem: You have become like a prostitute, you do not know how to blush (Jeremiah III, 3). But he carries his own torture, who is tormented by his own conscience, and in this world endures torment by his own will, lest he endure eternal torments (Genesis IV). And we corrupt our brothers and sisters through our sins, when they are provoked to greater crimes by our own sins. What I say will become clearer: Imagine someone in a priestly position not living well, and dishonoring their dignity with their actions. Surely by imitating his vices, the lay brother is corrupted? For even he who scandalizes one of the least of these, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and be thrown into the depths (Matthew XVIII, 6). Likewise, the sisters of Jerusalem are justified like Sodom and Samaria, not because they are inherently righteous, but as we said, by comparison with the worse.

So you will also be confounded; and your own shame, which you have justified, will become your gate. Seventy: So you will also be confounded, and you will bear your shame, because you have justified your sisters. Confusion follows shame: shame correction: correction consolation: consolation salvation: according to that of the Apostle: Tribulation works patience: patience provenance: provenance hope: but hope does not confound (Rom. V, 3-5). There is no doubt that in the future: because in its present state it has wiped out its sins through confusion. Something like this and that of the Gospel is said: There is confusion that leads to death, and there is confusion that leads to life (Eccl. 4:25). The Holy Spirit also urges sinners in the Psalms: Let all my enemies be confused and ashamed: let them turn back and be confused very quickly (Psalm 39:15). It is written also in another place: Declare your sins first, so that you may be justified (Isa. 43:26, sec. LXX). And again: The just one is his own accuser in the beginning of the discourse (Prov. XVIII, 17). Therefore, it is not surprising if Jerusalem is called to confusion and disgrace; she has sinned so much that she had to justify her sisters, to whom it is then said: And you, and your daughters, return to your former state.

<h2 id='tocuniq178'>(Vers 53, 54.)</h2>

(Verse 53, 54.) And I will restore their fortunes, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters. And I will restore your own fortune among them, so that you may bear your shame and be confounded in everything you have done, consoling them. LXX: And I will restore their fortunes like the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, I will restore the fortune of Samaria and her daughters, and I will restore your own fortune among them, so that you may bear your punishment and have shame for everything you have done, in order to provoke me to anger. Jerusalem made great progress, that after the confusion and ignominy that was brought upon it by the judgment of God, it willingly accepted and carried, saying: I will bear the wrath of the Lord, for I have sinned against Him, let restoration be promised to it in its former state. But yet, because by the comparison of its crimes, Sodom and Samaria were justified, of which one is on the right and the other on the left; first, the conversion or captivity of Sodom is restored, as Aquila interpreted; secondly, the captivity of Samaria, as Aquila and Symmachus also translated; and lastly, Jerusalem, which was oppressed by greater iniquity, will be restored, and it had shown that its sinful sisters were just in comparison to itself. For of whom is it doubted that among three sinners, rather sinners, a gentile, a heretic, and a churchman, he is more deserving of greater punishments, who is deserving of greater dignity? For the powerful, as we have said, endure torments powerfully (Wisdom 6:7). But he who is least deserving is deserving of mercy. And the servant who knows the will of his master, and does not do it, will be beaten with many (Luke 12:47). Therefore Peter also says: It is time for judgment to begin with God's house (1 Peter 4:17). And in this same place, the prophet commands those who have axes: 'From my saints begin' (Above, IX, 6) , that Jerusalem, having been converted and restored to its former state before its sisters, may bear its own shame, and be confounded, and blush over those things which it has sinned, and in all things may console its sisters, while it endures more weighty things (Jerem. VI) . Or certainly, it is confounded and blushes for this reason, because it has provoked God to anger. From this it is clear that the anger of God is not natural, but rather that the God who is most kind and gentle is provoked to anger by our vices, as the Apostle says: “Do you despise the riches of his goodness and forbearance and patience? Do you not realize that God’s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?” (Rom. II, 4, 5). You, however, with your hard and impenitent heart, are storing up wrath for yourself, which is not according to the nature of God. And in another place it is written: You have sent forth your wrath, which consumed them like stubble (Exodus 15:7). For what is joined and united in one body cannot be sent, but that which is outside the body. For example, a spear, weapon, arrow, sword. We also read in the Gospel (Matthew 10:15) that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for the one who does not receive the apostles.

<h2 id='tocuniq179'>(Vers. 55.)</h2>

(Verse 55) And your sister Sodom and her daughters will return to their former state. And Samaria and her daughters will return to their former state. And you and your daughters will return to your former state. LXX: And your sister Sodom and her daughters will be restored as they were at the beginning, and Samaria and her daughters will be restored as they were at the beginning. And you and your daughters will be restored as you were from the beginning. The Jews, among their many fables and endless genealogies and delusions that they invent, even dream of this: that in the coming of their Christ, whom we know to be the Antichrist, and in his thousand-year reign, Sodom will be restored to its ancient state, so that it may be like the paradise of God, and like the land of Egypt; and that ancient Samaria will regain its prosperity, so that the Assyrians may return to the land of Judah (2 Kings 17, 18). For we read that the ten tribes were captured by the kings of Assyria, namely Phul, and Salmanassar, and Teglathphalassar, and they have remained captive there until today. Also, at that time, Jerusalem must be rebuilt, along with all its daughters, that is, the cities, villages, and castles that will be under its future power, they will flourish as they once did, and Jerusalem itself must be built with gold, silver, and precious stones, as prophesied by Isaiah: I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning, and after this you will be called the city of righteousness, the faithful mother of cities, Zion (Isa. I, 26); and our Apocalypse speaks of this (Apoc. XXI): And David sings: Do good, O Lord, in your good will to Zion, and let the walls of Jerusalem be rebuilt (Ps. L, 20). And in another place: The cities of Judah shall be built, and they shall dwell there, and they shall remain there, and their offspring shall be established forever (Ps. LXVIII, 36). But we, leaving the perfect knowledge of these things to the judgment of God, or rather, confidently confessing, after the second coming of the Lord and Savior, that nothing humble, nothing earthly will be in the future; but the heavenly kingdoms which are first promised in the Gospel, we say that in the state of the Church, all things are complete and are being completed daily. Sodom returns to its ancient state, when it regains its original nature and the impious soul recognizes the Creator. Samaria regains its ancient blessedness, having rejected the error of heretics and joined to the teaching and faith of Christianity. And when they have returned, and Jerusalem, the vision of peace, which is interpreted as the Church, will return to its former state. Of which it is written: 'His place was made in peace' (Psalm 75:2); and: 'Jerusalem, which is built as a city, which is compact together' (Psalm 122:3); and in the Apostle: 'But Jerusalem, which is above, is free, which is the mother of us all' (Galatians 4:25); and in the same: 'You have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels in festal gathering' (Hebrews 12:22). And he returns with his daughters, who are scattered throughout the whole world. We have discussed this more fully in Isaiah's explanations.

<h2 id='tocuniq180'>(Vers. 56 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 56 and following) However, your sister Sodom was not heard in your mouth on the day of your pride before your wickedness was revealed, like it is now with the disgrace of the daughters of Syria, and all the daughters of Philistia around you who surround you. You carried your own wickedness and disgrace, says the Lord God. LXX: If your sister Sodom had not been heard in your mouth on the days of your pride before your wickedness was revealed, like it is now with the daughters of Syria, and if this had not been so, what would have happened to you and all the foreign daughters around you who surround you? You carry your impieties and your iniquities. Symmachus interpreted this passage as follows: Because your sister Sodom was not heard through your mouth on the day of your pride, before your disgrace was revealed, like the time of reproach of the daughters of Syria and all the daughters of Palestine around you, who surround you in a circle. You will bear your crime and your wickedness. Theodotus interpreted it as follows: And your sister Sodom was not heard through your mouth on the day of your pride, before your evil was revealed: like the time of reproach of the daughters of Syria and all the daughters of foreign nations around it, who abhor you in a circle. Your fornication and your contaminations, you have borne, says the Lord Adonai. Our translation agrees with the Aquila edition; all of which I have placed, so that from the comparison of all, we may find some trace of meaning, and in the meantime without prejudice from others, it seems to us that the order of the reading must be restored as follows: In the days of your pride, when you were sinning, you did not remember the overthrow of your sister Sodom, before your wickedness was revealed to such an extent that you became a reproach to all the cities of Syria and Palestine which are around you. Therefore, because you have overcome in the crime against your sister, and you were not terrified by her example, so as not to endure similar things, and you did not refrain from stepping forward: now, however, your disgrace has been revealed, listen to the sentence of God. Either you have carried, according to the Septuagint: or you have carried, according to Aquila and Theodotion: or you will carry, according to Symmachus, your crime and disgrace, so that after you have endured punishment for sacrilege, you may obtain forgiveness not by your own terms, but by my clemency. Syria is said to be called Aram in the Hebrew language, which means 'sublimity'. And according to the explanation of that passage of the prophet Isaiah, in which Aram and Ephraim conspire against Judah and Jerusalem, the clever wisdom of the nations and the claim of sublimity in knowledge, joined with the malice of heretics, attacks Judah, in which there is true confession and cannot be overcome. Here also the same arrogance of Syria, that is, of the philosophers with the daughters of foreigners, in which the manifold errors of various doctrines are shown among nations, mocks Jerusalem and reproaches her, though she is overcome by her own vices.


<h2 id='tocuniq181'>(Vers. 59 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 59 and following) Thus says the Lord God: I will deal with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath and broken the covenant. But I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish with you an everlasting covenant. Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both the older and the younger. I will give them to you as daughters, but not on the basis of the covenant. I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the Lord, so that you may remember and be confounded, and never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I forgive you for all that you have done, says the Lord God. LXX: Thus says the Lord God: And I will do to you as you have done, as you have despised these things, in order to go against my covenant. And I will remember my covenant, which I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish for you an everlasting covenant, and you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your older sisters with your younger ones, and I will give them to you as a test, not according to your covenant. And I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the Lord, so that you may remember and be ashamed, and there shall be no more opening of your mouth from the face of your disgrace, when I have been propitious to you according to all that you have done, says the Lord God. Therefore I said to you: your crime and your disgrace you carry, whether you have carried or will carry; in order to receive what you deserve: because you have despised my oath, and nullified my covenant. But when it is fulfilled, I will kill, and I will give life: I will strike, and I will heal (Deut. XXXII, 39): then I will remember my covenant, which I once had with you. And I will raise up for you a covenant, not of the Law that has passed, but an eternal covenant of the Gospel: so that when you remember your ways, and receive your older and younger sisters, Samaria and Sodom and their companions, I will give them to you as daughters, or as a proof (for there must be factions (I Cor. XI, 19) and heresies, so that those who are approved may be made manifest), not based on your merit, but based on my mercy, and then you will know that I am the Lord; and you will remember my benefits, and be confounded, and say according to the Apostle: I am not worthy to be called an Apostle: because I have persecuted the Church of God (I Cor. XV, 9). And may your mouth no longer be closed because of your confusion. For it is the duty of the holy to open their mouth, as the Apostle says: My mouth is open to you, O Corinthians (2 Corinthians 6:11), and of the Lord Savior, who opened his mouth and taught them (Matthew 5), as it is also said in the psalm: I will open my mouth in parables (Psalm 78:2). But to the sinner it is said: You have sinned, be silent (Genesis 4). And: Why do you speak my covenant through your mouth? (Psalm 49:16). And: A sinner's praise is not beautiful on the lips (Sirach 15:9). And only a saint deserves to hear: Open your mouth, and I will fill it (Psalm 80:11). From this, we understand that even when we have regained our original glory through the mercy of God, indeed when we have received the eternal covenant of the Gospel, after the Lord has been appeased towards us in all that we have done, we should still have the memory of past sin and always keep our mouths shut, for we are saved not by our own works, but by the grace of God.


<h2 id='tocuniq182'>(Chap. XVII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 17, Verse 1 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, propose a riddle, tell a parable to the house of Israel, and say: Thus says the Lord God: A great eagle with large wings, long feathers, full of plumage and variety, came to Lebanon and took the topmost branch of a cedar. It plucked off the highest of its young twigs and carried it to the land of Canaan, and set it in a city of merchants. And he took of the seed of the land, and planted it in the ground for seed so that it would establish roots over many waters; he set it on the surface. And when it sprouted, it grew into a vine of wide spread with low stature: its branches turned toward it and its roots were under it. Thus the vineyard was made and it bore fruit in the form of tendrils and it sent out shoots. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, tell a story and speak a parable to the house of Israel, and say: This is what the Lord God says: A great eagle with great wings, full of long feathers, with long wings and full of talons, came and took from among the choice cedars. He uprooted the tops of its tender shoots and brought them to the land of Chanaan. He put it in a walled city and took it from the seed of the land and planted it in a field over many waters, so that it would be seen. He planted it and it grew into a weak and small vine, so that only its branches could be seen beneath it, and its roots were underneath it. And it became a great vine and produced branches and extended its branches. When it is said of the prophets: Present an enigma, tell a parable, or as the Septuagint translated: tell a narration, it is shown that what is said is obscure. For there is no doubt that to present an enigma and a parable is to express something in words and hold something in meaning. And indeed the Savior spoke to the people in parables, which he explained in secret to the apostles. Therefore, we must understand enigma and parable in such a way that enigma and parable are Two enigmas and parables are presented in the prophecy of Ezekiel at present by Aquila. Now we must first speak: we will discuss the other in the following. And in the meantime, let us enjoy a simple story. The great eagle, with large wings, long feathers, and full of variety, or as the Septuagint translates it, full of claws, is King Nebuchadnezzar of the Chaldeans, about whom Hosea also speaks: Like an eagle over the house of God (Hosea 8:1). He who reigns over many nations and is surrounded by an innumerable army comes over the house of God, undoubtedly referring to the temple, or as Scripture says now, over Lebanon, about which Zechariah speaks: Open, Lebanon, your gates, and let fire consume your cedars. Howl, O fir tree, for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled:(Zach. XI, 12). And often the temple, which was famous and lofty, is called Lebanon in the holy Scriptures. And he took the pith of the cedar, and the top of its branches he plucked off, and brought it to the land of Chanaan, and placed it in the city of the merchants. For the merchants, or for the merchandise, the seventy translated it. Now it signifies Jehoiachin, the king of Juda, whom Nebuchadnezzar, with his mother and the princes of the people, took captive, and all the treasures of Jerusalem and the vessels of the temple; and he carried them into Babylon, which is in the land of Chanaan, and there he grew old. Afterwards, the Lord and our Savior was born through Salathiel and Zorobabel, as the Scripture of the Evangelist Matthew testifies (Matthew 1). He brought forth from the seed of the same land, that is, from the royal lineage, Matthan, uncle of Jechoniah, whose name he changed and called him Zedekiah, and he set him as king in Jerusalem, and he ruled over many peoples. And yet he set him on the surface and did not establish the power of his high empire with a deep root. But he set him there to be looked upon, and he was under the power of Babylon, or of low stature, with his branches looking towards it, so that he would indeed govern the people of Judah, but look to the command of the Babylonians. For this is what Scripture says: 'He will be lowly in stature, his branches will turn towards her, and he will be overshadowed by an eagle.' This is more clearly translated by the Septuagint, 'What had been planted grew up and became a weak and small vineyard, so that only its branches were visible, and it seemed to have a kingdom of its own, but its kingdom was lowly and weak, ruled by the authority of the Babylonian prince.' This is the interpretation of the present chapter, to which we will append the rest.


<h2 id='tocuniq183'>(Vers. 7 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 7 and following) And another great eagle appeared, with large wings and many feathers. And behold, this vineyard sent out its roots toward it, extending its branches toward it, in order to be irrigated by the streams of its sap. It was planted in good soil, above abundant waters, in order to produce leaves and bear fruit, and to become a great vineyard. Say: Thus says the Lord God: Will it succeed? Will it not uproot its roots and squeeze its fruit, causing all its branches to wither and dry up, so that it will not be strong in a mighty arm or among many people, in order to uproot it completely? Behold, it is planted, so will it prosper? When the burning wind touches it, will it not wither and dry up, and its shoots wither in its own beds? LXX: And another great eagle was made, with many wings and many claws. And behold, this vineyard was entangled with it, and its roots were attached to it, and its branches extended to it, in order to irrigate it with the soil of its plantation. In a good field, it was fattened over much water, so that it would produce shoots and bring forth fruit, and be a great vineyard. Therefore say: Thus says the Lord God: If it shall be exalted? Shall not its roots be tender, and its fruit wither, and all the things that have sprung from it wither, and it be pulled up even from its roots? And behold, it is fattened. Shall it be exalted? Shall it not, when the burning wind touches it, wither, and dry up with aridity? When the soil of its germination withers, the second eagle, that is, the other, also great, full of feathers, with many talons, because of its rapaciousness and the devastation of many nations, the king of Egypt is Pharaoh. And behold, this vineyard signifies King Zedekiah, who had been appointed by Nebuchadnezzar in Jerusalem, began, he says, to send his branches to it, that is, to send ambassadors to the king of the Egyptians, and to ask for help from him against the king to whom he was subject. For this is what the Scripture says now, that he may water it with the streams of his planting. Which had been planted in good soil by Nebuchadnezzar, in order to produce leaves and bear fruit, and to grow into a wider vineyard: therefore the prophet is commanded to speak to the vine, which had been planted by Nebuchadnezzar, and had sent its branches to the Egyptian eagle: will it prosper because she has tried to do this, and will not all her branches and shoots wither immediately? And did he not, he says, flee to a great army and not to a numerous people? For, while fleeing, Zedekiah was deserted by the help of the king of Egypt, and he was captured by the generals of Nebuchadnezzar in the deserts of Jericho. And all his allies were scattered here and there, as it is written in the books of Kings, Chronicles, and Jeremiah.

<h2 id='tocuniq184'>(Vers. 11 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 11 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Say to the rebellious house: Do you not know what these things mean? Say: Behold, the king of Babylon is coming to Jerusalem. He will take the king and his princes and bring them to Babylon. And he will take one of the royal offspring, make a covenant with him, and take an oath from him. He will also take away the mighty of the land, so that the kingdom will be humble and not exalted, but will keep his covenant and obey it. When he departs from there, he sends messengers to Egypt, to give him horses and a great population. Will he prosper? Will he escape the one who does these things? Can anyone who breaks a covenant escape? As I live, declares the Lord God, surely in the place where the king who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant with him he broke, in Babylon he shall die. Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war, when mounds are cast up and siege walls built to cut off many lives. For he despised the oath to break the covenant. And behold, he stretched out his hand, and when he has done all these things, he shall not escape. This is the riddle, this is the parable, which the Scripture showed under the two eagles and the vine, the two kings of Babylon and Egypt; and King Zedekiah, who, against his oath, abandoned the friendship of Nebuchadnezzar and transferred himself to the king of Egypt. He shall strike a covenant with him, and he shall take an oath to him, to keep his pact and observe it. He who breaks a covenant, it is said, will not escape. From this we learn that even amongst enemies, faith must be kept, and it is not important to whom you swore, but through whom. For he who believed in you because of the name of God, and was deceived by you, who, taking advantage of the divine majesty, plotted against your enemy, or rather your friend, has proven to be much more faithful. For, as it is said, in the place of the king who made him king, whose oath he made void, and broke the covenant he had with him, he will die in the midst of Babylon. For we read that Sedecias was captured, brought to Reblatha, and there his sons were killed and he was blinded like a wild animal enclosed in a cage, and then taken to Babylon (4 Kings 25). Therefore, Scripture, although it may seem contradictory to itself, is nonetheless very true in both instances. For it had been said to Sedecias: 'And thou shalt enter into Babylon, and thou shalt not see it' (Jeremiah 34:4). He entered indeed, for he was brought to Babylon, but he did not see it because he was blind. But what follows is understood in two ways: either the Egyptian king coming against King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon will not be able to fight or resist with a small army against such a great multitude, or King Zedekiah will be conquered by Pharaoh, from whom he hoped for help. Not that Pharaoh himself conquered him, or that Scripture testifies to this anywhere, but rather that the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar was opportune for the Egyptian king. And it was not the one who was besieging Jerusalem who appeared to conquer it, but the one in whom Zedekiah had vainly hoped. Behold, he said, he gave his hand to the king of Egypt and sold himself; and he committed perjury and sacrilege against God. Will it benefit him, he said? And when he has done all these things, he will not escape.

<h2 id='tocuniq185'>(Vers. 19 seq.)</h2>

(Vers. 19 seq.) Therefore thus says the Lord God: As I live, surely I will bring upon his head the oath he has despised and the covenant he has broken. I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon and there I will execute judgment on him for the unfaithfulness with which he has despised me. And all his fugitives, with all his troops, will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to every wind. Then you will know that I am the Lord, I have spoken. The sentence is secular.

Deception or virtue, who seeks in an enemy? They often oppose us, those who say that enemies are to be deceived by fraud. To whom should we agree, Sedecias did much worse: he did not deceive an enemy, but a friend, with whom he had been joined by the covenant of the Lord. Therefore, as long as you do not swear and do not enter into a pact in the name of the Lord, it is a matter of prudence and strength to deceive or overcome the adversary in whatever way you can. However, when you have bound yourself by an oath, the one who trusted you is not an adversary, but a friend: and under the pretext of the oath, that is, the invocation of God, he was deceived. Therefore the Scripture now says: I will set upon his head the oath that he despised and the covenant that he broke. And lest we should think that the oath and the covenant and the agreement belonged to the Babylonian king, or to Zedekiah who made it, it follows: In the transgression in which he despised Me. Therefore, the one who despises the oath, despises the one by whom he swore; and he does wrong to the one whose name he believed as an adversary. For this reason, I will spread My net over him, says the Lord, and he will be captured in My snare, and I will bring him to Babylon and will judge him there. Therefore, whatever Nabuchodonosor did against Sedecias, he did not do it by his own power, but by the wrath of God, in whose name he had sworn falsely. According to another interpretation, although it may seem violent, it should be known that just as all other animals are usually referred to in both a good and a bad sense, so it is with the eagle and the lion. In a good sense, it is said: 'The lion's whelp of Juda' (Genesis 49:9). In a contrary sense: 'Our adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about' (1 Peter 5:8). And in the psalm it is said: He lieth in wait secretly, as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor (Ps. IX, 9). It is said in a positive sense of the eagle that the righteous, when he becomes wealthy, makes wings for himself like an eagle, so that he can return to the house of his predecessor. And it is written in Isaiah that the righteous bring forth wings like eagles (Isa. XL): they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint. But rightly does he who said, By strength will I do it, and by wisdom will I remove the boundaries of the nations, and I will plunder their strength; and I will stir up the cities that are inhabited, and I will seize the whole world in my hand, as a nest: and as eggs that are laid (Ibid., X, 13, 14), now describe it in the persona of an eagle: because it does not want to lash out at the small and humble twigs, which are interpreted as whiteness and are related to incense, but at the tops of the cedars, and the princes, and the royal stock, according to that of Habakkuk: His prey shall be choice (Abac. I, 16). And he makes a covenant, that those whom he has captured should submit their necks to the Babylonian king, and fulfill that which the Apostle speaks of: Those whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme (I Tim. 1:20). And in another place: Those whom I have delivered, he says, to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved (I Cor. 5). Therefore, if perhaps we are expelled from the congregation of brothers and from the house of God because of some sin, we should not resist, but bear the sentence that has been passed on us with a calm mind, and say with the Prophet (Micah 7:9): I will endure the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against Him, until He justifies my cause, and so on. And it often happens that we, subjects under one another, turn to another who promises us his assistance; and he does not make us remain in our former opinion. This must be avoided by all means, so that our branches do not wither and our shoots dry up: and so that we are not believed to act against God's covenant.

<h2 id='tocuniq186'>(Vers. 22 seqq.)</h2>

(Ver. 22 seq.) Thus says the Lord (God says in the Vulgate): And I will take from the top of the cedar’s highest branch, and I will set it; I will break off a tender one from the crown of its branches, and I will plant it on a high and elevated mountain: upon the lofty mountain of Israel I will plant it. And it shall spring forth into a shoot, and it shall bear fruit, and it shall become a mighty cedar, and all the birds of the air shall dwell under it; every bird shall make its nest under the shade of its branches. And all the trees of the field shall know that I the Lord have brought down the high tree, and exalted the low tree; and have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to bud: I the Lord have spoken and have done it. LXX: For thus says the Lord God: I will take away from the top of the choice cedar tree and will give from the head of its branches, and from the heart of it I will take away, and I will plant it on a high mountain, in the lofty mountain of Israel, and I will set it, and it will bring forth branches, and it will bear fruit, and it will become a majestic cedar, and all birds of every kind will rest under it, and all flying creatures will rest in its shade. And its branches will sprout again, and all the trees of the field will know that I am the Lord who humbles the lofty tree and exalts the lowly tree, who dries up the green tree and causes the dry tree to flourish. I am the Lord who speaks and acts. This is what is read in the Septuagint: 'And I will take from the top of its branches,' which is added in Theodotion's edition. And what follows: 'And its branches will be restored,' should be noted with an obelus, because it is not found in the Hebrew. True Nebuchadnezzar therefore takes from the top of the lofty cedar, from the top of its branches, so that his kingdom may be humble and not exalted. But the Lord God Almighty, who spoke to Ezekiel, takes from the royal stock and from the house of David; and he plants on a high and lofty mountain, which speaks in the psalm: 'I, however, have been appointed king by him over his holy mountain Zion' (Psalm 2:6). For the prince of Judah had failed, and the leader of Israel, until he came who was to be laid up: and he shall be the expectation of the Gentiles. This one burst forth into a shoot, and produced fruit, and surpassed all the cedars with his greatness, so that all the birds of the sky may dwell under him, and all his creatures may be protected by his shade. Of whom Habakkuk says: Horns are in his hands, there his strength is hidden; and he who desires to gather his chicks under his wings, like a hen (Matthew 23): so that all the trees of the region may know that he is the Lord. Speaking tropologically about the believers: This is he who once humbled the prideful Israel and exalted the humble people of the nations, who dried up the green wood of the Jews, flourishing and bearing fruit in the Law and the Prophets; and made the dry wood of the nations sprout: so that he might fulfill with his actions what he always spoke. The same thing is represented by the words of Simeon in the Gospel, saying: Behold, this child is set for the fall, and rising again of many (Luke 2:34). And the grain of mustard seed, though it is the smallest of all seeds, when it grows, it becomes a dwelling place for birds (Matthew 13:32). Some interpret it differently, as the exalted humbled and the humble exalted, referring to the passion of the Lord Savior. Who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God: but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant (Philippians 2:6-7); and after the resurrection, the same tree was exalted, which was first green, dried up by death, and then revived, regaining its original greenness. Others explain both [adventus] in the context of Israel: that first he will come in humility and be rejected, and second he will be restored to his original state, after the fulfillment of what the Apostle Paul says: When the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, then all Israel will be saved (Deuteronomy 5:9-10).

Book Six

I thought that, with the serpent in the middle crushed, the new plants of the Hydra would not revive and, according to the fables of the poets, that the dead Scylla would in no way rage against me with the dogs of Scylla, who do not cease to bark. And with the heretics of God struck by hand, so that they may not be tempted, if possible, even the chosen of God (Matt. XXIV), heresy itself does not die, with the offspring of their hatred left behind against us, who pretending to be ours, do not abandon the poisons of the ancient mother and the deceitful Ulysses; they only smear their lips with honey. And according to the words of the Scriptures (Ps. LIV), they have softened their words over oil. But they themselves are javelins and fiery javelins, which must be repelled and extinguished with the shield of faith. I have said these things, my daughter Eustochium, so that you may support me in the work of prophecy and resist the heretics with your prayers. May the Lord explain the sixth book of the Explanations in Ezekiel, which I have written with my own words and understanding. And may the grace of the Holy Spirit, by which the things that we read in the Scriptures were revealed to the prophets, also be revealed to us as we discuss them, so that we may say: I opened my mouth and breathed in the spirit. (Psalm 118:131).

<h2 id='tocuniq188'>(Chap. XVIII.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter XVIII. — Verses 1, 2.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: What is that you turn a parable among you into this proverb in the land of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are set on edge? LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: ÷ Son of man, what is this parable in the children of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are set on edge? What the Seventy have said, son of man, is not found in Hebrew. However, divine Scripture warns about what was said in Exodus: I am the Lord your God. I am a jealous God, who punishes the sins of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, and shows mercy to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments (Exod. X, 5; Deut. V, 9, 10). And again: The Lord descended in a cloud and stood with Moses, and Moses called upon the name of the Lord, and the Lord passed before his face and called him, saying: O Lord, God, merciful and compassionate, patient, full of mercy and true, preserving justice and mercy to thousands, forgiving iniquities, injustices, and sins; and yet he will not cleanse the iniquities of fathers upon children and children's children, to the third and fourth generation (Exod. XXXIV, 5 seq.). Thus, it should be understood as a proverb and a parable, where the words may have one meaning but the sense another; as we mentioned in the parable of the two eagles. And the Lord also in the seventy-seventh psalm says: “I will open my mouth in parables: I will declare a proposition from the beginning” (Ps. LXXVI, 2[1]). And in the Gospel, the parable of the sower, and of the tares, and of the mustard seed, which, though it is the smallest of all seeds, rises up into a large tree (Matt. XIII, 31). He sets them forth in such a way that in the words one thing is presented, and another is held in the meaning. And even until the present day we thought that the two testimonies of Exodus, which we have placed above (Isa. XXIX, 13), were not a parable, but a simple explanation of the meaning. And although we dared not say anything, nor does a clay pot speak against a potter, why did you make me this way, either this way or that: nevertheless, we tolerated the hidden scandal, that the injustice of God seemed to make one person sin and another person suffer for sins. For if the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children to the third and fourth generation, it seems unjust for one person to sin and another person to be punished. But from what follows: to those who hate me, the scandal of threat or command is resolved. For indeed they are not punished in the third and fourth generation because their fathers sinned, since it is their fathers who were sinners that should have been punished; but because they became imitators of their fathers and inherited their evil and impiety, even as the branches grow from the root. Heretics, who do not accept the Old Testament, often say in this place against the Creator: How good and just is the God of the Law and the Prophets, who, by remaining quiet and silent about the sins of the fathers, renders punishment to those who have not sinned; rather, what cruelty is in Him that He extends His anger even to the third and fourth generation! To whom shall we respond, and in this the clemency of God the Creator is demonstrated. For it is not of cruelty and severity to hold anger until the third and fourth generation, but a sign of mercy to defer the punishment of sin. For when it says, 'Lord God, merciful and compassionate, patient and full of mercy,' and adds, 'repaying the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children's children,' it indicates that its mercy is so great that it does not immediately punish, but defers the sentence of punishment. But if the punishment of sinners is delayed to the third and fourth generation, what more does it do for the righteous and holy ones? It follows: And keeping justice and mercy for many thousands, for those who keep his commandments and follow his precepts. It is written in Proverbs: Just as a sour grape is harmful to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, so is iniquity to those who use it (Prov. 10:26). From this it is clear that it is not the teeth of others that ache and become numb, but those who have eaten the sour grape. But the sense of this passage is as follows: just as if someone were to say, 'The fathers ate sour grapes, and the teeth of the children have become numb,' it is ridiculous and has no consequence; in the same way, it is unjust and perverse for the fathers to sin and for the sons and grandsons to be tortured. There are those who interpret what is written in Exodus, 'Visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation,' in such a way that they refer it to the human soul, saying that the father is a light point of sense and the incitement to vices within us; the son, if he conceives sinful thoughts; the grandson, if he carries out in action what you have thought and conceived; and the great-grandson, that is, the fourth generation, if not only do you do what is evil and wicked, but you take pride in your own wickedness, according to what is written, 'When the wicked man comes into the depth of evils, he despises it.' Therefore, God does not punish the first and second impulses of thoughts, which the Greeks call 'προπαθείας' and without which no one can exist. But if someone decides to act on their thoughts or refuses to correct what they have done by repentance, then they will be punished. Hence it is written: No one is without sin, not even if their life is only a single day. But the years of their life are numerous (Prov. XX, 9). And in another place: Who can boast of having a pure heart? And again: Even the stars are not clean in his sight: and concerning his angels he found darkness. (Job 25:5) But if that exalted nature is not free from sin, what are we to say about human beings who are surrounded by fragile flesh, who should say with the Apostle: Wretched man that I am, who will rescue me from this body of death? (Romans 7:24) And that we should say when we have done all things: We are useless servants; we have done what we ought to have done. (Luke 17:10) And: Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain; unless the Lord guards the city, the guard keeps watch in vain (Psalm 127:1, 2). But for the proof of this matter, that not the first impulse of thought, or rather a small instinct of the mind, is punished by God, but if you consume in action what you have conceived in your mind, that is to be brought forth from Genesis: Ham sinned, mocking the nakedness of his father; and the sentence was not passed on him who laughed, but on his son Canaan: Cursed be Canaan, he shall be a servant of servants to his brothers (Genesis 9). For what justice is there, that if a father sins, the judgment should be pronounced upon the son? Moreover, the Apostle states (1 Timothy 2) that a woman will be saved if her children remain in faith, holiness, and chastity. This seems to go against the concept of justice, that the parents should be saved if their children and grandchildren are good. For how many holy parents have wicked children, and on the other hand, how many sinful parents have righteous and holy children? Therefore, according to this meaning, all the sins of parents and ancestors must be punished in the branches, not in the root, as we have said above. It is enough to have said this about the proverb or parable: that the Law and the Prophets, that is, Exodus and Ezekiel, indeed God Himself, who spoke here and there, does not seem to disagree in their teachings, or to correct here what He said wrongly there. But if anyone can find a better or different meaning that removes the scandal of conflicting testimonies, it is better to agree with that person's opinion.


<h2 id='tocuniq189'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(Verse 3-4) As I live, says the Lord, there will not be for you any longer this parable as a proverb in Israel. Behold, all souls are mine: the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine. The soul that sins, it shall die. (LXX: As I live, says the Lord Adonai, if it will continue to be said, this parable in Israel, because all souls are mine. Just as the soul of the father, so the soul of the son is mine. The soul that sins, it shall die.) What this means, 'I live,' says the Lord, and [it is] a parable or proverb, we have explained more fully above: which will never be said in Israel, but among those who do not have knowledge of God, nor can perceive the truth. 'All,' he says, 'are souls of mine;' according to [their] nature, not according to merit: as Moses was called a man of God, about whom it is written: 'The prayer of Moses, man of God' (Deut. XXXIII, 1). And Elijah, who spoke to the prince of fifty men: 'And if I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven upon you, and upon fifty men' (IV Kings I, 12). But a man who is guilty of sin and a son of iniquity is not called a man of God, just as servants and slaves of God are called, of whom it cannot be said, 'Everyone who commits sin is a servant of sin' (John 8:34). And again, 'For by whom a person is overcome, of him also he is the servant' (2 Peter 2:19). Just as the sins of children do not harm their fathers, so the sins of fathers do not pass on to their children; but the soul that sins, it shall die: not by the abolition of its substance, but by its separation from Him who says, 'I am the life' (John 14:6). And elsewhere he says: Everyone who lives and believes in me will not die forever (John 11:26). And: Amen, amen I say to you: whoever keeps my word will not see death forever (John 8:51). For our life is hidden with Christ in God (Colossians 3:3); and that will be fulfilled which is written: Amen, amen I say to you: whoever hears my word and believes in him who sent me, has eternal life; and does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life (John 5:24). But, that which is said by Balaam, 'Let my soul die among the souls of the just' (Numbers 23:10), has this meaning: that he desires to die to the world and to sin, and to live with the souls of the just, whose life is Christ, and they can sing: 'I will please the Lord in the land of the living' (Psalm 114:9). For God is not the God of the dead, but of the living (Matthew 22:32). And if Balaam, as is likely, translated into our language, sounds empty to the people: it is clear that the empty people of the nations prior desire to have fellowship with the souls of the just, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are called upright and just. And so the Book of Genesis took its name from their word.

<h2 id='tocuniq190'>(Vers. 5, 6 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 5, 6 and following) And if a man is just and does judgment and justice, does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not violate his neighbor's wife, does not approach a menstruating woman, does not oppress anyone, gives back a pledge to a debtor, does not commit robbery, gives his bread to the hungry, covers the naked with clothing, does not lend at interest or take any increase, turns his hand away from iniquity, does justice between man and man, walks in my statutes, and keeps my judgments, to do truth: this man is just, he shall surely live, says the Lord God. LXX; But the man who is righteous, who practices judgment and justice; who does not eat on the mountains, and does not lift up his eyes to the thoughts of the house of Israel; and does not defile his neighbor's wife, and does not approach a woman with menstrual impurity; and does not oppress a man; who returns a pledge to the debtor; and does not commit robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry; and covers the naked with clothing; and does not give his money at interest, and does not take more; who turns his hand away from injustice; who makes just judgments between a man and his neighbor; who walks in my statutes and keeps my ordinances, to perform them: he is righteous, he shall surely live, says the Lord God. He says, 'You wish to know what has been said: I shall render the sins of the fathers to the third and fourth generation (Deut. V, 9),' it does not mean what most people think; nor is it similar to this saying: 'The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the teeth of the children are set on edge (Jerem. XXXI, 29).' Listen to what I am going to say: if there is a just father, who does these things, and the son does not do them, and he has an evil son, who, forsaking his father's virtues, surrenders himself to vices; will not the just son still live because he is just; and the other will die because he has committed all the things that the father became just by avoiding?' Let's see the catalog of virtues of the father, which seem to me to be divided into seventeen parts. The first of these is to exercise judgement; the second, similar to this, is to unite justice with judgement; the third is to not eat on the mountains; the fourth is to not lift one's eyes to idols, or as the Septuagint translates, to the thoughts of the house of Israel; the fifth is to not violate one's neighbor's wife. The sixth is to avoid the embrace of a menstruating wife. The seventh is to not distress a person, or as the Septuagint has it, to oppress by force; the eighth is to return a pledge to a debtor; the ninth is to not take anything by force, or according to the Septuagint, to not commit robbery; the tenth is to give bread to the hungry; the eleventh is to clothe the naked; the twelfth is to not give money at interest; the thirteenth is to not receive more than what one has given; the fourteenth is to turn away one's hand from iniquity; the fifteenth, which seems similar to the first but is different in part, is to exercise true judgement between man and man, or one's neighbor; the sixteenth is to walk in the commandments of the Lord; the seventeenth is to keep his judgements and his statutes. We will explain the meaning of each of these things in the following. If, he says, a man is just and renders judgment, it is written in Proverbs: The thoughts of the just are judgments (Prov. XII, 5). Whoever possesses this virtue, to do nothing without reason and judgment, can say that prophetic saying: The judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves (Ps. XVIII, 10), and when he judges all things rightly, so as not to show partiality to the poor in judgment, he will fulfill the commandment of the Lord: You shall judge the lesser as well as the greater (Prov. XVIII), boldly saying: My soul has desired to desire your judgments at all times (Ps. CXVIII, 10). And again: I have chosen the path of truth, I have not forgotten your judgments (V. 30). And in the same psalm: I know that your judgments are righteous (or just) (V. 75); and it will lead to such great blessedness that he will understand the judgments of the Lord, which are many and deep; and he will say with the Apostle: O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out (Rom. II, 33). And in prayer let him say: For thy judgments are delightful (Psal. CXVIII, 39). After judgment follows justice, which whoever possesses will undoubtedly possess Christ, who according to the Apostle has become for us justice, and sanctification, and redemption (I Cor. I); so that he may perform true justice, and not show favoritism in judgment; but may know in the judgment of others that he himself must be judged by justice. The third is not to eat on mountains, which the Jews believe to be a sin related to idolatry. For we frequently read in the books of Kings and Chronicles: But nevertheless he did not depart from the high places. Still the people sacrificed in the high places, and burned incense in the high places (3 Kings 15:22; Paral. 20); this Scripture indicating that they sacrificed to idols in the mountains and groves, and burned incense. But we will say that he eats in the mountains, who says with the Pharisee: I give thee thanks, O God, that I am not like this publican: I fast twice on the Sabbath: I give tithes of all that I possess (Luke 18:12), etc. And on the contrary, the tax collector, upon hearing him who said, 'Learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart' (Matthew 11:29), beat his chest with his hand, that is, the treasure of wicked thoughts, and did not dare to raise his eyes to heaven. But also what is said elsewhere, 'Do not seek what is too difficult for you, nor investigate what is beyond your power' (Sirach 3:22), convicts all heretics of devouring the mountains of pride, despising the simplicity of the Church, and not knowing the scripture about themselves: 'God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble' (James 4:6). In the fourth place, it is placed, and it has not lifted its eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, for which the Seventy translated their thoughts. But the idols, that is, the simulacra they have invented in their hearts, all heretics make, to which they lift the eyes of their hearts, those who have considered their falsehood and lies to be the truth. But the house of Israel is called idols, which are found in the Church; and through the occasion of a false name of knowledge, they deceive even the simple, in order to introduce the doctrines of philosophers into the house of Israel, namely those who contemplate God with their mind. In the fifth place, it is stated: and he shall not violate or contaminate the wife of his neighbor, which explicitly prohibits adultery; but from what is added, the wife of his neighbor, unless every man is understood to be a neighbor, it seems to be a precept that we abstain from the wives of friends; but we may freely defile the spouses of enemies and strangers. Therefore, every man should be considered the neighbor of another man, according to the parable of the Gospel, which is presented by the Savior, of a certain man who was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, who was wounded by robbers: when a Pharisee asks who was his neighbor, teaching that the one who does good is his neighbor. According to a mystical understanding, the wife of a holy man can be understood as wisdom, as Solomon says: Love her, and she will embrace you; cherish her, and she will protect you (Prov. IV, 6). One who desires to defile her criticizes the blessings of others and, inflamed by the torches of envy, violates what is holy, corrupts what is chaste, and contaminates what is pure. The sixth point: He shall not approach a woman, whether a wife or menstruating. Every month, the heavy and sluggish bodies of women are relieved by the shedding of impure blood. At the time when a man has intercourse with a woman, it is said that the conceived fetus inherits the defect of the semen, so that lepers and elephantiasis sufferers are born from this conception, and both sexes have monstrous bodies, with small or enormous limbs, and corrupted pus. Therefore, men are advised to know the specific times for sexual intercourse, not only with other women but also with their own, with whom they are joined by law, as the Scripture says: 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth' (Genesis 1:28), and to know when it is time to have intercourse and when to abstain from their wives. Indeed, both the Apostle and the Ecclesiastes say: There is a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing (Eccles. III, 6). Therefore, let the wife beware that she does not, by the enticement of her desire for sexual intercourse, tempt her husband, and let the husband not force his wife, thinking that she ought at all times to be subject to the pleasure of the marriage bed. Hence, Paul also says: That each one of you know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor (I Thess. IV, 4). Beautifully, in the Pythagorean sayings of Xystus, it is said: He who desires ardently is an adulterer of his own wife. A certain person, translating this book into the Latin language, wanted to illustrate it with the name of martyr Xystus, without considering in the entire volume that he divided it in vain into two parts, omitting completely the name of Christ and the Apostles. It is not surprising that he transformed a pagan philosopher into a martyr and bishop of the city of Rome: just as he exchanged the name of the book of Origen with the name of the martyr Pamphilus, in order to conciliate the most impious books on the beginnings with Roman ears, with Eusebius also from Caesarea as the first supporter. In the seventh place, it is written: And he shall not grieve a man, or, as the LXX translated, he shall not oppress by power. I do not know to what fault and sin someone may be a stranger. And indeed, the Egyptians oppressed the Hebrews by power. Hence, Habakkuk complains, why does the wicked oppress the righteous (Habakkuk 1). And I wish that it would be said only of those who are outside, and not of those who are inside. For even the leaders of the Churches often oppress the people by pride. Of which it is written: They made you a prince, but not to be proud, and you should be among them as one of them (Ecclus. XXXII, 1). And the Savior commanded: Whoever wants to be first among you must be the servant of all (Mt. XX, 27). And what is said in Hebrew, and do not grieve the man, agrees with the testimony of the Apostle: Do not grieve the Holy Spirit, who dwells in you (Eph. IV, 30). And in the Gospel, which the Nazarenes, who read according to the Hebrews, are accustomed to read, among the greatest crimes is considered to be one who grieves the spirit of his brother. But if the sadness of another kills the one who grieves, what should be said about wickedness and a tyrannical mind, to which this applies: Why does the earth and ashes boast (Sirach 10:9)? So that, having forgotten its own condition, it, being full of phlegm, gall, feces, and worms for a little while, would place its mouth in the sky, and its tongue would extend to the earth, and it would say with true Nebuchadnezzar: I will ascend into heaven, above the stars of heaven I will place my throne, and I will be like the Most High (Isaiah 14:12). The eighth law: The pledge should be returned to the debtor. Not to all debtors, otherwise there will be many opportunities to receive pledges, which will become a material of wealth: but to the debtor about whom it is written in the law, that he is poor, and he has put up his own clothing as a pledge, and he should receive covering before sunset (Deut. XXIV), so that he does not cry out to the Lord, who is the avenger of his injury, from the torment of cold. But if, according to the following things, we should give bread to the hungry, and cover the naked with clothing (Exod. II): how much more should we return what is his own, if indeed the poverty of the debtor is without doubt? We can also return a pledge to a debtor, when we, who are joined by love, and who owe mutual charity to each other, return their pledge, holding nothing of their debt against them. The ninth place is this: He has not seized anything by force, nor has he committed robbery according to the Septuagint. The Apostle speaks about robbers, saying that among other sinners one should not even partake of such food: and all robbery is mixed with violence (1 Corinthians 6). If violence has been used, plundering is not profitable. Moreover, there is also a holy violence and a desirable plundering, of which the Gospel also writes: From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and violent men take it by force (Matthew 11:12). It is also spoken of by Judas, the brother of James: And on some have compassion, making a distinction; but others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire (Jude 23). And on the contrary, the opposing powers hastily seek to plunder the prey of those whom they seize, for their own destruction. Which means that Jacob says: A wild beast has devoured him: a wild beast has taken Joseph away (Genesis XXXVII, 33). Therefore, the sheep of the Lord that follow him are not taken from his hands. And he himself says: The Father's gift is greater than all, and no one can take it from the hand ((Al. my addition)) of my Father (John X, 29). From this it is clear that there is one power, virtue, and substance of the Father and the Son. For if no one can take from the Son's hand what the Father has given, and these same things are in the Father's hand that are not taken from him, it is clearly proven that all things are common to the Father and the Son, and that the Son holds the Father in his hand, just as the things that belong to the Son are held in the Father's hand. The tenth is: He gives his bread to the hungry. From this we are taught that alms should not be given to the satiated, but to the hungry; and not to those who belch from fullness, but to those who suffer from emptiness. For in bread is contained all food. And it is significantly said, his: so that we do not turn bread acquired from rapine, usury, and ill-gotten gain into mercy; for the redemption of a man's soul (Prov. XIII, 7) is his own riches. What we see many people doing, both clients and the poor, and farmers; not to mention the violence of soldiers and judges, who oppress by power, or commit thefts, so that they may give little things to the poor, and boast in their own crimes. And let the public deacon in the Churches recite the names of those making offerings: so much is offered by this person, so much is promised by that person, and they please themselves with the applause of the people, while their conscience torments them. And let us give material to the miserable, so that they may rejoice in what they give, and not mourn over what they have taken away. It is more fitting, however, that we understand the just bread to be the one who says: I am the living bread, which came down from heaven (John VI, 51); and which we pray to be given to us in prayer: Our substantive bread, or that which will come to us (Matthew VI, 11); so that we may deserve to receive what we will always receive afterwards, in the present world, every day. He gives this bread to the hungry, of whom it is written: Blessed are those who hunger and thirst (Matt. V, 6). For the righteous person makes the common bread of all his own, which had failed in Judea, as the prophet says: I will take away from them strength, or the staff of bread. What we are speaking of, if indeed we are of Christ, or rather, as the prophet commemorates, it is the bread of believers and the hungry. It is not to be given at all to those who have eaten and drunk and been satisfied, and have grown fat and kicked, of whom it is said: Woe to you who are full now, for you shall hunger (Luke VI, 25), lest they vomit it up, as Solomon says: For he will vomit and corrupt your good words (Prov. XXIII). What the Savior says in other words: Do not give what is holy to dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine (Matthew 7:6). He holds the eleventh place: And covered the naked with clothing. This statement, according to the explanation of the previous verse, should be discussed in two ways: that we give clothing to the naked, as the Savior says: I was naked and you clothed me (Matthew 25), and that we give the clothing of Christ to the naked in faith and virtues, of whom it is written: For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ (Galatians 3:27). He was naked in this garment, not having a wedding garment, and was thrown out of the banquet. Concerning this nudity, the Lord speaks to Jerusalem: But you were naked and filled with confusion (or shame). The twelfth commandment holds: And he shall not lend at usury, or as the Septuagint translated, he shall not give his money for usury. In Hebrew, usury is prohibited for all kinds of species; in the Septuagint, only money. According to what is written in the fourteenth Psalm: 'He who does not give his money to interest' (Psalm XIV, 5). And how is it said: 'You shall not lend to your father at interest, but you shall lend to others at interest' (Deuteronomy XV, 6 and XXIII, 10). But see the progression: In the beginning of the Law, interest is only forbidden among brothers; in the prophets, usury is prohibited for everyone, as Ezekiel says: 'He who does not give his money to interest.' Furthermore, in the Gospel, there is an increase in virtue, with the Lord commanding: 'Lend to those from whom you do not expect to receive' (Luke VI, 35). It follows in the thirteenth place: And he shall not receive anything more. Some people think that usury is only in money. But divine Scripture, foreseeing this, takes away the excess of everything, so that you do not receive more than what you have given. Usury is commonly demanded in the fields for wheat and barley, wine and oil, and other kinds of produce, as the divine word calls it, abundance. For example, in the time of winter, we give ten bushels, and in the harvest, we receive fifteen, which is more than half. Whoever considers himself very just will receive a greater portion, a fourth plus, and they usually argue and say: I gave one bushel, which produced ten bushels. Is it not just that I should receive a half bushel more from my own, since he, by my generosity, has nine and a half from my own? Let us not be deceived, says the Apostle, God is not ridiculed (Galatians VI, 7). Therefore, let the merciful usurer respond to us briefly: has he given to the one who has, or to the one who has not? If he had, he certainly should not have given, but he gave as if he did not have. So why does he demand more as if from someone who has? Others are accustomed to receiving small gifts in exchange for borrowed money of various kinds, and they do not understand that this is called interest and excess, whatever that may be, if they receive more from what they have given. The fourteenth degree is: From wickedness, he says, he shall turn away his hand, so as to flee from all wickedness in every work. For wickedness is committed not only with the hand, but also with other members, as Solomon says: Remove wicked lips far from you (Prov. IV, 24). And in the Psalms: They speak iniquity on high (Ps. 72:8). The foot also runs to iniquity, and the eye if it desires another man's wife, let him not be its imitator, of whom it is said: He has not done iniquity, and deceit has not been found in his mouth (Isa. 53:9). Therefore, we are commanded to make friends for ourselves with the wicked mammon, who may receive us into eternal dwellings. The fifteenth is: He shall make a true judgement between man and man, or his neighbor. What seems to signify the same as first, where it is written: If he shall be just, and shall do judgment; but with the addition of the truth of judgment: which makes a distinction between man and man, or his neighbor, it is observed to have the force of virtues. Hence also in the beginning of Proverbs, after many precepts, the correction of judgment is inferred. To know, he says, wisdom and discipline, and to understand the words of prudence, to receive the subtlety of speeches, and to know true justice, and after all to correct judgment (Prov. 1:2-3). Therefore the Apostle (I Cor. VI) rebukes those who are established in the Church, because they have disputes among themselves, and the least esteemed is chosen to judge between man and man, who destroys what is small and reaches up to the mature man; and yet he needs a higher judgment in order to attain to the truth of judgement. It follows in the sixteenth place: He shall walk in my precepts. And in the seventeenth: He shall keep my judgments and my precepts, to do them, and to keep them. Both of which have manifold understanding, if we are willing to replicate all the commandments of the law, in which the precepts of the Lord are, and in which the justifications are said to be. The one hundred and eighteenth psalm is full of commandments and justifications, and in part the eighteenth, in which it is written: The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts, and the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes. In which it is asked how in this same prophet God said: I have given them non-good justifications in which they will not live in them (Isaiah 28). The easy and fuller answer is in the following, that the Jews who follow the letter die, and the Christians who understand the life-giving spirit live. It is a long task if we want to prove with testimonies where the precepts of the Lord are said to be, and where justifications are said to be, and in what particularities, or diversities, or obscurities they are involved. And it is said in the present place: Here is the righteous one, he will live his life, says the Lord God. Whoever does these things, and does not do those things, will not be punished for the sins of the father, but will live by their own virtues.

<h2 id='tocuniq191'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Ver. 10 and following) But if he has fathered a son who is a robber, shedding blood, and he has committed one of these (or, as the Septuagint has translated, if he has committed sins: if he has not walked in the way of his righteous father), and he does all these things, not abstaining from them, but rather feasting on the mountains, defiling the wife of his neighbor, oppressing the needy and the poor, seizing plunder, not returning pledges, lifting his eyes to idols, committing abominations, engaging in usury, and taking more, will he live? When he has done all these detestable things, he will die: his blood will be upon himself. Regarding the thief, it is written in Hebrew Pharis, which in the second edition of Aquila means sinner; Symmachus translates it as transgressor, and the Septuagint and Theodotion as pestilent. Just as a plague creates diseases and usually devastates the regions where it has spread, so does a pestilent person ravage everything. And let us say first according to history, so that you may know that the iniquities of the fathers do not overflow onto the children. If a righteous man does the things that the previous discourse explained in order, he will live. But if he begets a son who departs from the service of the Lord and exchanges his father's virtues for vices, doing what his father did not do and not doing what his father accomplished, can he live? Surely he will not live, but will be guilty of his own blood. Moreover, according to spiritual understanding, the righteous man in Ecclesiasticus, if he proclaims the Gospel faith and his son and disciple is deceived by heretical error, will be called a pestilence. Concerning this, it is written in the first psalm: 'And he did not sit in the seat of pestilence' (Psalm I, 1). And in Proverbs, he is described as confident, shameless, and arrogantly pestilent (Prov. XXXIII). He sheds the blood of the deceived and heaps sins upon himself; he feasts on the mountains of pride, polluting the Church of his neighbor, causing distress to the needy and poor in the knowledge of Scripture, oppressing and overthrowing them; seizing plunder from those who he has led astray from the Church: not returning the pledge he received from his teacher, in order to fulfill what is written: 'Freely you have received, freely give' (Matthew X, 8). And to idols and images, which he fashioned from his own heart, he lifts his eyes, and committing all abominations; and he gives money for usury, so that the error of the master may increase by the diligence of the disciples; and seeking repayment from those to whom he loaned, he demands more than he had given: surely he will not be able to live, but he will die in his own blood.

<h2 id='tocuniq192'>(Vers. 14 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 14 and following) But if he has a son who sees all the sins his father has committed, fears them, and does not commit them himself (as Vulgate says, 'similar to them'): he does not eat on the mountains, he does not lift his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, he does not violate his neighbor's wife, he does not oppress anyone, he does not keep a pledge, he does not commit robbery, he gives his bread to the hungry, he covers the naked with clothing, he turns his hand away from the poor man's injury, he does not take interest or usury, he follows my ordinances, and he walks in my statutes: this son will not die because of the iniquity of his father, but he will surely live. His father, who accused falsely and used violence against his brother, and committed evil in the midst of his people: he died in his wickedness. So, do not be surprised, he says, if the son of a righteous man, inclined towards vice and sin, dies by death. On the contrary, if the son of a sinful and impure man sees the wickedness of his father's ways, and turns away from doing evil and does good, he shall not be held accountable for his father's crimes. And what can also be received in us, as it is said in the Psalms: Hear, O daughter, and see, and incline your ear, and forget your people, and your father's house: and the king desires your beauty (Ps. 44, 11). And we who are born of the stock of the nations, to leave behind the crimes of our parents, and to do judgment and justice, and to live in it. Therefore, we repeat what we have explored above more fully. And so, briefly, we review everything, desiring to move on to those things that are more obscure and new.


<h2 id='tocuniq193'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Verse 19, 20.) And you say: Why did not the son bear the iniquity of the father? Clearly, because the son has practiced judgment and justice, has kept all my commandments and has done them: he shall live. The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father: and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. He answers the question that the listener could have proposed in the opposite way. He often says, they say, why did the righteous son not bear the iniquity of the father? To which he himself responds: Clearly, because the son has acted well, and has not committed the father's offenses. And it is right, just as a sinner dies in his own wickedness; so the righteous live in their virtues: and let the soul that has sinned die; and let the one who has kept God's commandments live.

<h2 id='tocuniq194'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Vers. 21, 22.) But if the wicked shall do penance for all his sins which he hath committed, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment, and justice: living he shall live, and shall not die. I will not remember all his iniquities that he hath done. In a way only, saith he, the sins of the fathers are not transmitted to the children, neither doth the wicked son any longer burden the righteous father; nor are others punished for the sins of others, so that he, who before was wicked and a sinner, if he afterwards do penance, and turn to better things, and blot out his former sins, be not judged by the old sins: but let him be received into my flock, by the renewal of virtue. At the same time, let us consider what sort of repentant person an impious and sinful person receives. If, he says, he turns away from all the sins he has committed and keeps all the commandments of the Lord, so that he truly abandons all wrongdoing and follows all virtues; if he does all good things and forsakes all evil; then I will forget all the injustices he has committed.

<h2 id='tocuniq195'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) In his righteousness, which he has worked, he will live. My righteousness will live not so much as mine, but as his. It is allowed for my righteousness to give good things to the good and bad things to the bad.

Is it my will that the wicked should die, says the Lord God, and not that he should turn from his ways and live? (Ezekiel 18:23) Therefore it is the will of the Lord that all should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. Wherever God seems to pronounce a severe and harsh judgment, He condemns not men, but their sins.

<h2 id='tocuniq196'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) But if the righteous turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity according to all the abominations that the wicked person usually does, will he live? None of the righteous deeds that he had done will be remembered. In the transgression that he has committed, and in the sin that he has sinned, he shall die. Just as the previous sins do not burden a righteous person who has sinned, so the previous righteousness does not benefit a sinner who was previously righteous. For each person will be judged according to what is found in them.

<h2 id='tocuniq197'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) And you said: The way of the Lord is not fair. Hear, O house of Israel: Is not my way fair? Are not your ways unfair? Give reasons why the judgment of the Lord is just. Do you think, he says, that I am unfair, that I will render the sins of the fathers to the children (Deut. 24); and while others eat sour grapes, will the teeth of others be set on edge (Jerem. 31)? Behold, each person dies in their own sin, and is made alive in their own righteousness. In both cases, judgment is not based on the past, but on the present. Rather, your unjust opinion is that you think a parable is not a parable, but you understand it in such a way that the sins of others are punished in others as if it were the truth of a story.

<h2 id='tocuniq198'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26.) For when the righteous turns away from his righteousness and does iniquity, he shall die in them. In the iniquity which he has done, he shall die. This can also be understood: The righteous first, the people of Israel, turned away from their righteousness, because they abandoned the author of righteousness, and they committed iniquity by denying the Son of God. In the sin and wickedness which he has done, he shall die: not in many, but in one, killing the heir in order to destroy the inheritance.


<h2 id='tocuniq199'>(Vers. 27, 28.)</h2>

(Verse 27, 28.) And when the wicked turns away from his wickedness that he has done and does judgment and righteousness, he shall keep himself alive. For he considers and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed; he shall surely live, he shall not die. On the other hand, it says, the people of the nations who do not have knowledge of God and the wicked, if he turns away from his wickedness, which he previously practiced in idolatry, and does the things that are commanded by the law of Israel, he who was previously dead will give life to his soul. And seeing that he has perished in the injustices he has wrought, he will believe in him who says: I am the way, the truth, and the life (John, XIV, 6): he will live and not die.

<h2 id='tocuniq200'>(Vers. 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29.) And the children of Israel say: The way of the Lord is not fair. Are not my ways fair, O house of Israel, and are not your ways crooked? Even today Israel blasphemes God, for abandoning his people and taking in a multitude of nations. Whom the Lord reproves because their ways are crooked, he exercises his rightful judgment by sending other farmers to his vineyard after the previous ones were lost. Which, understanding in the parable of the Gospel, the Jews said: This will not be (Luke 20:16).


<h2 id='tocuniq201'>(Vers. 30.)</h2>

(Verse 30.) Therefore, I will judge each one according to their ways, O house of Israel, says the Lord God. Whether they are from the multitude of nations or from the people of Israel who are being judged: God does not show partiality (Colossians 3:25), but each one will be rewarded according to their faith, and will be condemned for their wickedness and unbelief.

<h2 id='tocuniq202'>(Vers. 31.)</h2>

(Verse 31.) Turn away and repent from all your iniquities, and iniquity will not be your downfall. Cast away all your transgressions, in which you have transgressed. This message is specifically directed towards the Israelites, urging them to repent and abandon their iniquities or transgressions against God. However, it can also be understood as applicable to both the Israelites and the crowd of Gentiles, encouraging them to forsake their vices and turn to the one who can heal their brokenness.


And make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. Leaving behind the old letter, live in the newness of the spirit. The new heart of the Israelites is to believe in Him whom they had previously denied. The new heart of the gentiles is to abandon idols and despise the worship of the dead, and to believe in Him who is the God of the living.

And why will you die, house of Israel? It is better, as we have said above, to accept this exhortation in which it is written: Repent and do penance, regarding the person of the Jews whom He does not want to die, and to whom He now speaks: why will you die, house of Israel, who have the fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of whom it is written: God of the living, not of the dead (Mark 12:27). Why will you die by your own fault, when you owe your life to the merit of the fathers and my mercy?


<h2 id='tocuniq203'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32) Because I do not want the death of the one dying (or, the sinner), says the Lord God: return and live. I do not want, he says, for you to die, whom I have begotten for salvation. For I have begotten sons, and I have exalted them, but they have rejected me (Isaiah 1:2). Therefore, return and live. It is said to return, only to those who were previously with God and have later abandoned his company. And live through repentance, who are dead through sin. Therefore, Israel, because it does not return to its former state, is believed to be dead.

<h2 id='tocuniq204'>(Chap. XIX.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 19, verses 1 onwards) And you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, and say: Why did your mother, a lioness, lie down among lions? In the midst of young lions she raised her cubs. And one of her cubs grew up, he became a lion and learned to catch prey and devour men. The nations heard about him and captured him in their own traps, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt. When she saw that she had been frustrated and her hope was lost, she took one of her cubs and made him a lion. He who walked among lions, became a lion. He learned to capture prey and devour men. He learned to make widows and turn their cities into deserts, and the land was laid waste, and its fullness, by the roar of his voice. And nations from all provinces gathered against him and spread their nets over him; he was captured in their wounds. And they put him in a cage, they led him in chains to the king of Babylon, and they sent him to prison so that his voice would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel. LXX: And you shall take up a lamentation for the prince of Israel, and you shall say: What was your mother's lioness? She has grown up among lions and has brought up her cubs among lions. And one of her cubs has come up: he has become a lion, and he has learned to catch the prey. He devours people, and the nations have heard of him. He has been trapped in their pits, and they have brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt. And when she saw that she was taken captive and her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a lion. And he went about among lions. He became a lion, and learned to seize prey. He devoured men, and fed on their audacity. He brought their cities to desolation, and laid waste to the land and its abundance with the sound of his roaring. Nations from all around set traps for him, and spread their nets over him. He was captured in their corruption, and they put him in a cage. He was brought to the king of Babylon in chains, and they brought him into prison, so that his voice would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel. I know that in this place I have read a multitude of explanations, and hindered by such obscurities, that it has not so much revealed as enveloped the reading, while all the writings refer to opposing strengths, and in heavenly Jerusalem describes lions and battles: how one of them is captured, and another is placed in his stead, and he provides many testimonies: that the devil and his companions are often called lions, as in that passage about the apostle Peter: Our adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goes about seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8); and in the Psalms: Do not give the soul of your confession to wild beasts (Psalm 73:19). Certainly, when it comes to history, it is said that Johanan, the son of Carea, was taken to Egypt: how he was called a lion while fleeing with a few, I do not know; and the other lion, Zedekiah, who was also taken to Babylon. However, leaving such explanations to the judgment of the reader, let us say that the prophet predicts not so much the future as he narrates the past. For after the sixth year of Zedekiah (for immediately afterwards we read: And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day) a lamentation is made over the princes, or over the prince of Israel, and it is said: Why has your mother the lioness lain among the lions? Therefore, the lamentation is over the princes, namely all those who are descended from the line of Josiah. The mother of the princes of Jerusalem is called a lioness, who gave birth to and nursed little lions: and she brought up one of her little lions, and made him a lion, signifying Joachaz the son of Josiah, whom Pharaoh Neco took to Egypt, and in his place made Joakim. After his death, Jechoniah his son was made king, and he was carried off to Babylon with his mother and the nobles of the city by Nebuchadnezzar: and from him is born Salathiel, the father of Zerubbabel, who received his name because he was born in Babylon (2 Kings 23). And it is clear that under the metaphor of the lioness, lion cubs, and lion, and again of another lion, those things which had already happened at that time when this prophet was speaking are described. For after he had taken Jerusalem from the royal lineage of Joachaz son of Josiah and made him king, he became so cruel in a short time that he is said to have metaphorically seized prey and devoured men. When an Egyptian came to him, he captured him not without wounds, either in a pit, as is specifically stated in Hebrew, in order to preserve the metaphorical capture of lions, which are always caught in pits. And he brought him in chains or shackles to the land of Egypt, and there he died. When his mother, who had borne him, who had raised him, who had established him as king, saw this, her hope was destroyed. She took one of the other kings, Jechoniah, son of Jehoiakim, and made him king. He, imitating the cruelty of his predecessor, is described as savage like a lion, as he devoured men, made many widows, led cities to ruin; and at the sound of his roar, the whole province was terrified, so that nations gathered around him, spread their nets over him, captured him in a pit, put him in a cage and in chains. Not that Jechoniah experienced this, for he himself surrendered to the king of Babylon and was carried off to Chaldea; but this translation is kept like that of a lion, who is caught in pits, bound in chains, and kept in cages. Furthermore, according to history: we read this about Zedekiah, who was appointed king of Jerusalem after Jehoiachin. And this is the reason why, because chains are mentioned, and a cage, and a prison is named, most people understand it to refer to Zedekiah rather than Jehoiachin. Therefore, he was saved in prison, not killed, and only removed from the kingdom. However, the history tells us that Zedekiah, being blind, was taken to Babylon, and there he was immediately killed.


<h2 id='tocuniq205'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 and following) Your mother is like a vine planted over the water, your blood. Its fruits and branches grew abundantly from many waters. And solid rods became scepters of rulers for it, and its stature was elevated in its branches. And it saw its height in the multitude of its palm trees. And in anger, it was uprooted and thrown to the ground, and a scorching wind dried up its fruit. Its strong rods withered and dried up, and fire consumed it. And now she has been transplanted into a desert in an impassable land and thirsty. And fire went out from the rod of its branches, which consumed its fruit, and there was no strong branch in it, the scepter of rulers. It lamented, and it will be mourned. Your mother is like a vineyard, like a flower in a pomegranate tree planted in water. Its fruit and offspring came from much water. And a branch of strength was made for it among the tribes of leaders: and it was exalted in its greatness among its branches. And he saw his greatness in the multitude of his palm trees, and it was broken in fury: it was thrown to the ground, and a burning wind dried up its chosen ones. They were avenged, and the rod of his strength was dried up. Fire consumed it, and now they have planted it in a desert, in a land without water, and fire has come out from the rod of its chosen ones, and devoured it, and there was no rod of strength in it. It is a lamentation in three parts, and it will be a mourning. In different speeches, the same thing is said. And just as in previous readings we read that Jerusalem is compared to a beautiful woman, and again a lioness who nursed lions in her lair, now the vine or vineyard is compared to the most beautiful one, which was planted over the waters and therefore the branches, nourished by the moisture, have grown so much that one branch, which Scripture calls a very strong or mighty rod, has become the ruler's scepter. In order to translate the Septuagint into the language of the three leaders, so that kings would be made from it. But the vineyard itself was of such beauty that the splendor of its strength was equal to the flowers of the pomegranate, which in Hebrew is called a vineyard in your blood, compared to the redness of the flowers. Therefore, the lofty and upright vineyard was exalted. For God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble (James 4:6). It was uprooted in the anger of the Lord and thrown down to the ground, so that the ruins of Jerusalem would preserve the elegant translation of the vine. However beautiful the vineyard may be, and however far its branches extend, if you take away the poles and stakes, joined to the earth, it withers from the heat, especially if the burning wind, which the Greeks call καύσωμα, dries up its fruit, so that it withers and is consumed as if by the heat of fire. As for the addition in the Septuagint: They have been avenged, instead of what is written in Hebrew, they have withered, I cannot determine what significance it may have. Therefore, how is that vineyard of such fertility and abundance, and of such beauty, now transplanted into a desert, into a rough and thirsty land? However, it signifies the land of Babylon to which they were transplanted, or Egypt to which they fled, or the land of Judah itself, in which a few poor remained, of whom Godolias (also called Gotholias) was appointed governor to gather and govern the remnants of the people (2 Kings 25). Against whom he rose up from the royal stock, and from the branch of the vineyard of Ishmael, who slew him in Maspha (also called Masepha), and ate up all the fruit of the vineyard, and from thence was no strong rod to be left, nor a sceptre of great power (Jeremiah 40 and 41). For no king remained that might govern the people, but they all fled with Johanan the son of Careah into Egypt. Therefore bewail we and lament that the royal race which in Judea hath ceased no more till he come that is to be laid upon it: and he shall be the desire of nations (Genesis 49:10). From this it is clear, both from the previous passage, in which it is said: Why did your mother, a lioness, lie down among lions? and from this passage, in which it is written: Your mother, like a vine planted by the water, belonged to Jerusalem, which lost its lions and its branches, and the rod that would rise among the tribes or the scepter of those in power did not remain in it. For it begins with mourning and ends in mourning. Assume mourning over the leaders of Israel. This is, in the beginning and now at the end, a lamentation; and with lamentation and mourning, the royal line is to be pursued like a parable. Furthermore, according to the allegory, which others refer to heavenly Jerusalem, they say that from it many have fallen into this valley of tears, and kings have ceased to be, and the once beautiful vine has been dried up by the burning wind, so that no green shoots remain in it, which later Jeremiah laments under the form of the city; we understand (Matthew 24) this concerning the Church, because in the last times, with multiplied iniquity, the love of many will grow cold, so that even the chosen ones of God may be tested, and its princes may be caught in the snares of the devil, who is not content with capturing only one king, but hastens to capture kings and princes daily, according to what is written: His chosen food (Habakkuk 1:16). The branches of the Church, which not long ago were equal to flowers and the redness of blood, are now withered by the wind. This interpretation also corresponds to the parable of the Gospel, in which, when the sun rises, what had sprouted withers and dries up suddenly (Mk 4). So that hardly any of the branches remain that can rise up as a rod and become a worthy leader of the people. In other words, this is what Amos speaks of: 'I will send a famine upon the land: not a famine of bread or a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the words of God' (Amos 8:11). Where should we mourn and lament over the princes of Israel, through whose fault and pride Judaea was deserted and Jerusalem captured.

<h2 id='tocuniq206'>(Chap. XX.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 20, Verse 1) And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth, in the tenth month, men came from the elders of Israel to inquire of the Lord, and they sat before me. After eleven months and five days of the previous vision, again the word of the Lord came to the prophet, after men came from the elders of the house of Israel to inquire of the Lord and sat before him. However, many examples testify that it was the custom of the people of Israel to seek whatever they desired to know from the Lord through the prophets. Saul, looking for donkeys, goes to Samuel and receives advice from a young boy to offer a quarter shekel to the prophet. When Jeroboam's son is sick, he is sent to Shiloh to the prophet Achiam (also known as Abiam), bringing gifts of bread, cakes, grapes, and a jar of honey, to learn about the illness of his son. David also consults the prophet Nathan, asking whether he should build a temple for the Lord. And Ahab inquires whether he should go up to Ramoth Gilead or not (3 Kings 22). In Isaiah (Isa. 37) and in the book of Kings (4 Kings 19), it is announced what will happen with Sennacherib. It is not surprising that in the Old Testament the prophets announce everything that is going to happen, since we have read that Agabus prophesied to Paul what was going to happen (Acts 21). It is written in Deuteronomy: The nations that the Lord is going to destroy before you, they will listen to dreams and divinations, but the Lord your God has not given you this (Deut. 18:14). For it is the practice of the Gentiles to consult the Chaldeans, augurs, diviners, soothsayers, and oracles of demons, by which their error is mocked. Therefore, even now the elders of Israel approach a prophet to inquire of the Lord through him, and yet they are silent about their inquiry, with the one who was to be questioned knowing what they were asking, so that a miracle occurred in him, knowing why they had come and answering the unspoken thoughts in their minds.

<h2 id='tocuniq207'>(Vers. 2, 3.)</h2>

(Verse 2, 3.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Have you come to inquire of me? As I live, I will not answer you, says the Lord God. To the righteous and worthy who ask, a promise is given. As you continue to speak, I will say: Here I am. But to the sinners, like the elders of Israel, whose crimes are described by the prophets that follow, there is no answer; only rebuke for their sins. And an oath is added: As I live, the sentence of denial is made stronger. But as for what the LXX said, if I were to respond to you, Symmachus translated it more clearly, I will not respond to you.

<h2 id='tocuniq208'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4) If you judge them: if you judge, O son of man. LXX: if I avenge them with vengeance, O son of man: They have indeed come to interrogate me, desiring to know about those things about which they are in doubt, and the future; but you, O son of man, judge them, so that the prophet's response may not be, but rather the sentence of the judge for the injustices they have committed, and for following the crimes of their fathers. Or certainly, if I avenge them with vengeance, it can be understood in this sense: They are so covered in wickedness that they are not even worthy of correction and reproof, according to what is said by the prophet: I will no longer visit your daughters, and your daughters-in-law, when they commit adultery (Hosea 4). Wherefore sinners, who have descended into the depths of sin, are forgiven to fulfill the desires of their hearts (Prov. XVIII).

Show them the abominations of their fathers, and you shall say to them: 'LXX: Rebuke them for the iniquities of their fathers, and you shall say to them: If the sins of the fathers do not flow over to their children, why are the abominations and iniquities of the fathers now placed upon the elders? Clearly it is for this reason, that similar actions may be shown to be done by their parents, and that they may drag the longest rope of inherited evils, so that they may fear the punishments of those whose vices they imitate.'


<h2 id='tocuniq209'>(Vers. 5, 6.)</h2>

(Verses 5, 6.) Thus says the Lord God: In the day that I chose Israel, and raised my hand for the offspring of the house of Jacob, and appeared to them in the land of Egypt, and raised my hand for them, saying: I am the Lord your God. In that day I raised my hand for them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into the land which I provided for them, flowing with milk and honey: which is excellent among all lands. LXX: Thus says the Lord God: From the day that I chose the house of Israel, and became known to the seed of the house of Jacob, and was recognized by them in the land of Egypt, and received them, saying: I am the Lord your God: in that day I took hold of them by my hand, saying: to bring them out of the land of Egypt into the land which I prepared for them, a land flowing with milk and honey: a Paradise beyond all lands. For what the Seventy said, 'honeycomb' is beyond all lands, for which we have interpreted it, 'excellent' is among all lands. The first edition of Aquila placed 'firmament'; the second, 'illustrious'; Symmachus, 'region'; Theodotion, 'strength'; that is to say, this is the foundation of all lands, that in it there is the religion of God, and temple, and ceremonies, and knowledge of God; and to such an extent did the people of Israel, established in Egypt, not know God, that when Moses was sent to them, he said, 'If they ask me, who sent you?' What should I say to them? Say, he said, to them: 'I AM has sent me' (Exodus 3:13, 14). He became known to the people in Egypt and to the offspring of the house of Jacob when he raised his hand against the Egyptians for them, and said, 'I am the Lord your God,' and he chose them to bring them out of the land of Egypt to a land flowing with milk and honey. For they were not yet able to eat solid food, but like infants and nursing babies, they were in need of milk and honey. Indeed, whoever considers the land of Judea, letter by letter, from Rhinocorura to Mount Taurus, and the entire land along the Euphrates River, will not be able to doubt that it is famous and more fertile than all other lands, and the power and beauty of the cities and the pleasantness of the regions - namely Palestine and Phoenicia, Arabia, Syria Coele, Cilicia, and the other regions which the Lord promised to the Israelites if they had kept God's commandments, but because they did not receive them, it was a fault of their disbelief. For even in Palestine and the province of Judea, many people remained who were not expelled. For the sponsor is not at fault if the one to whom the promise is made proves himself unworthy of the pledge, especially when the option of the promisor is presented: 'If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good things of the land; but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword.' Therefore, choices are made in the present; and the one who is chosen is not immediately capable of being tempted or destroyed, because both Saul, who was chosen as king, and Judas, who was chosen as an Apostle, later fell due to their own fault. The raising of the hand, or extension, indicates the posture of a striker: to strike against the Egyptians, and to free the people of Israel from Egypt.

<h2 id='tocuniq210'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Version 7) And I said to them: Let each one cast away the offenses of their eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. LXX: And I said to them: Let each one cast away the abominations of their eyes, and do not be polluted with the inventions of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. Regarding the offenses, which are called 'Secuse' in Hebrew, Symmachus interpreted them as nausea, the second edition of Aquila as excisions, to signify that they should be cast away like the blemishes that hinder vision and create a sense of vomiting for those who see them. The word 'gelule' is also a Hebrew term, which the LXX invented. The first edition of Aquila was defiled; the second edition of Symmachus and Theodotion interpreted as idols, whom we also follow at present. However, he commands those who are leaving Egypt to forget the idols they have served for a long time, and indeed to cast them away from their eyes so that they do not even regard them with their sight. And those who have been defiled for a long time should no longer consent to them. I, he says, am the Lord your God; not the Egyptian portents, not the figments of various monsters. But even to us, when we come out of Egypt, it is commanded that we cast off the offenses of our eyes: lest we be delighted by those things with which we were previously delighted in the world, lest we be polluted by the idols of Egypt, namely, the inventions of philosophers and heretics, which are rightly called idols. Let us also remove our eyes from the spectacles, or rather offenses, of Egypt: the arenas, the circuses, the theaters, and all things that contaminate the purity of the soul and enter through the senses into the mind; and let what is written be fulfilled: Death has entered through your windows (Jeremiah 9:21).


<h2 id='tocuniq211'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) And they have provoked me. LXX: And they have departed from me. Or as Symmachus interpreted: They have not found rest with me. And immediately when called, they depart from God, so that there is no space between the calling and the departure. And it should be noted that no one departs from God unless they were with Him before. Hence, the dragon in the book of Job is called an apostate, a transgressor, and a deserter (Job XXXIV).

And they did not want to listen to me. Each one did not cast away the abominations of their eyes, nor did they leave the idols of Egypt. LXX: And they did not want to listen to me. They did not cast away the abominations of their eyes, and they did not leave the inventions of Egypt. Therefore, they have provoked me, says the Lord, and they have turned away from me, because they did not want to listen to me while the free will of man is preserved; and they have done all the things that I commanded them not to do according to the law. Immediately, despairing of salvation, they murmur against Moses and distrust the promises of God. Unde sequitur:

And I said that I would pour out my indignation upon them, and execute my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among whom they lived, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt. So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. I gave them my statutes and made known to them my rules, by which, if a person does them, he shall live. Because they had not yet gone out of Egypt. For it follows below: I have cast them out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the desert. From which it is shown that they had not yet gone out of Egypt, when he wanted to pour out his indignation, and fill his anger upon them, and strike them in the midst of the land of Egypt.

<h2 id='tocuniq212'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) And I did it for the sake of my name, so that it would not be violated in the presence of the nations among whom they were, and among whom I appeared to them to bring them out of the land of Egypt. What I planned to do, I did it for the sake of justice, not because of the greatness of my mercy, so that my name would not be defiled and it would seem that I could not fulfill what I had promised to Israel. Therefore, I spared my name, so that the nations among whom I became known to them in the land of Egypt would not have an opportunity to blaspheme. The prophet describes what He had promised to them when they were settled in the land of Egypt, and how they immediately offended, and what the Lord had planned against them, and yet did not do. The following things, He spoke after their departure from Egypt.

<h2 id='tocuniq213'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 and following) Therefore I expelled them from the land of Egypt, and brought them into the desert, and gave them my commandments, and showed them my judgments, which a man should do and live by them. Moreover, I gave them my Sabbaths to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctifies them. But the house of Israel provoked me in the desert. They did not walk in my commandments and they cast away my judgments, which a man should do and live by them, and they greatly violated my Sabbaths. Therefore, I said that I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness and consume them, and I did so for the sake of my name, so that it would not be profaned in the sight of the nations, from whom I had brought them out. These things are said to those who were brought out of Egypt into the wilderness: that, having been freed from the vices of the Egyptians, they might more easily fulfill the commandments of God in the solitude and observe his judgments and keep the Sabbath. These things were given as a sign between the one who gave them and those to whom they were given, as the Scripture says: And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: And you, command the Israelites, saying: See, and keep my Sabbaths, which is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I, the Lord, sanctify you, and keep the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Whosoever violates it shall be put to death. Everyone who works on it shall have that soul cut off from among his people (Exod. XXXI, 13, 14). Therefore, the Sabbath and circumcision are given as a sign of the true Sabbath and true circumcision: so that we may know that we must rest from the works of the world and circumcise not the flesh, but the heart. Thus, by working for six days, we rest on the seventh day, doing nothing else day and night except acknowledging that everything we live is owed to the Lord, and at the return of the week, we consecrate ourselves entirely to His name, so that through the sanctification of the day, we may remember the Lord who sanctifies us. The Lord gave these commandments and statutes and the observance of the Sabbath in the desert, so that those who did them would live by them and not go beyond them, as promised in the Gospel. They violated them, not once or a little, but greatly, so that the extent of the violation would be shown. Therefore, he said and decided in his mind to pour out his anger upon them in the desert and consume them, as he spoke to Moses: 'Leave me, and in my anger, I will destroy them.' (Exodus 32:10). But he did not want to do it, sparing the Egyptians and the other nations, so that they would not be scandalized, and waiting for the repentance of those he had mercy on. And it should be noted that when he spoke to the Israelites after the offense that he said, 'I did it for the sake of my name, so that it would not be violated in the presence of the nations from which I expelled them.' At that time, they were still in the midst of those nations, as they had not yet left. But now, after they have left, it is said, 'From the nations from which I expelled them.'


<h2 id='tocuniq214'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15) Therefore I lifted up my hand against them in the wilderness, to not bring them into the land that I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the most excellent of all lands, because they had rejected my judgments and had not walked in my commandments, and had violated my sabbaths. After idols their heart went, and my eye spared them so as not to kill them, nor did I consume them in the wilderness. LXX: And I lifted up my hand against them in the wilderness, so as to not bring them into the land that I had given them: a land flowing with milk and honey: a hive beyond all lands: because they rejected my justifications, and had not walked in my commandments, and had violated my sabbaths, and had walked after the thoughts of their own hearts. And my eye spared them, so that I would not destroy them, and I did not kill them in the wilderness. Indeed I resolved to pour out my fury on them and to destroy them, but I acted for the sake of my name, so that it would not be profaned among the nations, namely the Amalekites and the others who fought against them in the wilderness. I did not allow them to enter the land that I had promised to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey, which is the most excellent of all lands, like a honeycomb. The cause of this punishment and sentence is that they rejected my judgments, did not walk in my statutes, and violated my Sabbaths. The cause of this cause is that they did not do these things because their heart followed the idols of Egypt. However, my eye spared them, saying that I would not kill them and destroy them completely. But it is asked, how did I spare them when their corpses fell in the wilderness, and no one entered the promised land except Joshua and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh. From which we understand that they are not kept for eternal punishments, nor erased from the book of the living, nor consumed in the presence of the Lord. For if it is believed that they perished because they were not admitted into the land of promise, then Moses also perished, who only saw the land of promise and did not enter it. This is mentioned in the book of the Lord Jesus: My servant Moses has died (Deut. XXXIV, 5). And in Malachi: Remember the Law of Moses my servant (Malachi 4:4). And in Jeremiah, as if speaking to a friend and familiar, God says: If Moses and Samuel stood before me (Jeremiah 15:1). Otherwise, it must be believed that the prayers of Moses were heard, when he interceded for the people, saying: If you forgive them their sin, forgive; but if not, blot me out of the book that you have written (Exodus 32:32, 33). But so that we may know that God's intention towards his sons and servants is for their improvement, not their destruction, let us listen to the testimonies of the Scriptures. My son, do not be saddened by the discipline of the Lord, nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him (Prov. III, 11). For whom the Lord loves, He corrects; and He chastises every son whom He receives (Heb. XII, 6). And in another place: When He killed them, then they sought Him (Ps. LXXVI, 34). And in the Song of Deuteronomy it says: I will kill, and I will give life (Deut. 32:39). We can also say this literally, that He did not destroy them, nor did He consume them with their offspring and descendants, but after killing the fathers, He spared the sons, whom He brought into the Promised Land.

<h2 id='tocuniq215'>(Vers. 18 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 18 onwards) But I said to their children in the wilderness: Do not follow the commands (or laws) of your fathers, nor keep their judgments, nor be defiled by their idols (or thoughts). I am the Lord your God. Walk in my commands, and keep my judgments, and do them, and sanctify my Sabbaths, that it may be a sign between me and you, and that it may be known (or that you may know) that I am the Lord your God. After the killing of the fathers who fell in the desert, he gives commands to his sons, in whose salvation he had mercy on the fathers. And he said, 'The eye of the Lord should not entirely destroy them and wipe them out, but should preserve the fathers in their sons.' And he testifies to the same things that he spoke to the fathers: that after they have walked in his commandments and kept his judgments and preserved the sanctification of the Sabbath, which is a sign given, then they shall know that he is their Lord God. However, the precepts and legitimate laws of the fathers, and their judgments, signify an unusual error: that they may not imitate the sins of those whose torments they witness.

<h2 id='tocuniq216'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verse 21, 22.) And my children have provoked me, they have not walked in my commandments, and they have not kept my judgments, to do the things that if a man does, he shall live in them, and they have violated my sabbaths. And I threatened to pour out my fury upon them, and to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness. But I turned away my hand, and I did it for the sake of my name, so that it would not be violated in the sight of the nations, from whom I cast them out. But the sons, he says, followed the crimes of their parents and did everything that they had done: therefore, they deserved a similar punishment. However, the same mercy by which their fathers were spared because of the greatness of my compassion, and for the same reasons for which I had pity on their fathers: so that I, as the sole and same Creator of both, might temper my anger with similar patience. We have traversed the obvious and proceeded to more obscure matters.

<h2 id='tocuniq217'>(Vers. 23, 24 seq.)</h2>

(Ver. 23, 24 onwards) Again, I raised my hand against them in the wilderness, to scatter them among the nations and disperse them in the lands, because they had not performed my judgments, and had rejected my commandments, and had violated my Sabbaths, and their eyes had been after the idols (or thoughts) of their fathers. Therefore, I also gave them statutes that were not good, and judgments in which they would not live, and I defiled them in their offerings (or transgressions), as they offered (or led astray) everything that opens the womb because of their sins (for which the Septuagint translated, to destroy them and what they had overlooked): and they will know that I am the Lord. Where in the Old Testament, against their children, who fell in the wilderness, the Lord lifted up His hand to scatter them among the nations, Scripture does not say; but it is to be believed that this was done in accordance with what is reported here. Or he signifies by this, that after they entered the promised land, they were given over at various times, for many sins, to different nations and kings, and at that time the commandments of the Lord, which were good according to their nature, and the judgments by which believers could live, were made not good for them, since they were in no way able to keep the precepts of the law in captivity, and to do what the divine word commanded. He did not say, 'I gave them evil commandments,' but, 'not good commandments.' For it does not immediately follow that what is not good is evil, as the Apostle teaches, it is good for a man not to touch a woman; but because of incontinence, let each possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor (I Cor. VII). And if he does not do this, it is neither good nor evil. Therefore, God gave them, dispersed among the nations, not good commandments, that is, he allowed them to follow their own thoughts and desires, to do what is not appropriate. And he defiled them in his gifts: just as a Priest separates lepers from the people, and shows that they are defiled; while they offer to idols what they should offer to God. And they pass everything that opens the womb through the fire of Baal, that is, the firstborn; so that after they have deserted God and been handed over to the worship of idols, then they may understand that He is the Lord whom they have provoked to anger by their own fault. Symmachus interpreted this passage more explicitly, treating the future as past. Therefore, I will also give them bad precepts and judgments for which they will not live, and I will defile them because of their gifts, as they consecrate and offer everything that opens the womb, so that I may destroy them, and they will know that I am the Lord. And the meaning is this: because I have seen the sons of the fathers equaling the wickedness of their ancestors and doing the same things for which they offended God, I wanted to divide them into nations and disperse them throughout the whole world, and give them bad precepts and judgments in which they would not live, so that I may defile them with their gifts, for they consecrated everything that opens the womb to idols, and I may destroy them forever, and they will know that I am the Lord. Through which he showed that he had not given them good commandments who dwelt in the wilderness, but to those whom he wanted to scatter among the nations, and to make foreigners in the whole world, he gave them a desire for things that he did not give: so that there they would do good commandments of God, not good because of their own fault, while they exhibited to idols what God had commanded to be exhibited. This can also be said, that before the offense, they received only the Ten Commandments; but after idolatry and blasphemy, they received multiple ceremonies of the law, so that they would offer victims to God rather than to demons, and by comparison with sacrilege, what was not good in itself became lighter, and by no means evil, because it was offered to God, and yet not good, because they offended the author of good.


<h2 id='tocuniq218'>(Vers. 27, 29 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 27, 29 onwards) Therefore speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and tell them: Thus says the Lord God: Moreover, your fathers have blasphemed against me and have treated me with contempt, even as they spurned me. And I brought them into the land that I had lifted my hand to give them ((Vulgate adds: that land)): they saw every high hill and every leafy tree, and there they offered their sacrifices and presented there the irritation of their offerings, and they placed there the fragrance of their sweetness, and they poured out their ((Vulgate is silent on this)) libations there. And I said to them, 'What is the high place to which you are going?' And its name was called the High Place until this day. Therefore speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God: As for your fathers, they have provoked Me to anger by their iniquities, by the fact that they have fallen away from Me. So I brought them into the land that I had lifted My hand in an oath to give them.' They saw every high hill and every leafy tree, and there they offered their sacrifices. They also presented there the provocation of their gifts, and they set there their pleasing aroma, and they poured out there their drink offerings. And I said to them: What is abbana, because you enter there? And they called its name abbana until this day. I wanted, he said, to scatter them in the wilderness, and to give them not good precepts, so that they would sacrifice to idols what they should have offered to me, and consecrate all their first-fruits to them by fire, so that I might kill them and destroy them. But when he says, I wanted, he shows that he did not do what he wanted. And that which follows: 'And they shall know that I am the Lord,' is not found in the Septuagint. For it did not seem fitting to them to know after their destruction that he himself is the Lord. But you, son of man, speak again to them, that is, to the elders of the house of Israel, who have come to inquire of you: Your fathers, from whom you have descended, have also blasphemed against me and held me in contempt; after I brought them into the land which I had given them to possess, they turned against me to provoke me. For when they saw every high hill and leafy tree, they would sacrifice on the mountains and in the groves and thickets, and offer victims to the idols, and pour out libations. And when I saw this, I said to them: What is this, Bama? for it is called high: or why do you enter into such a place which you have chosen for yourselves in all the hills, so that even today these places are called Bamoth, and the ancient error retains its original name? Regarding Bama, which we translate as excelsum, there is an error in the Septuagint edition, where it is written as ἀββανὰ, which does not resonate in the Hebrew language. Bama can mean 'in which' if the two syllables are divided into two words, but in the present context, that sense does not fit. However, wherever it is written in the Books of Kings and Chronicles: 'The people still sacrificed and offered incense on the high places,' Bama in the singular and Bamoth in the plural mean 'high places.'


<h2 id='tocuniq219'>(Vers. 30, 31.)</h2>

(Verse 30, 31.) Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord God says: You are defiling yourselves in the way of your fathers and indulging in their abominations; you are defiling yourselves with all your idols to this day. Shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, declares the Lord God, I will not be inquired of by you.’ Imitate the vices of your fathers and walk in the same paths, so that similar sins may deserve a similar punishment, and you have advanced so far in wickedness that you offer your sons to demons by fire: and it is not enough for you to have done this once, but you continue to do the same up to the present. Not that the elders do these things in captivity, but that those who dwelt in Jerusalem and were threatened with captivity did not cease to do all these things. And when you are bound by such great sins, you seek my response? As I live, says the Lord God, I swear by myself that I will not answer you, and what follows:

<h2 id='tocuniq220'>(Vers. 32, 33.)</h2>

(Verse 32, 33.) And the thought of your minds shall not be, of those saying: We shall be like the nations, and like the kindreds of the earth, to worship wood and stones. As I live, saith the Lord God: With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, I will reign over you. This has this meaning: Do not think that your thoughts, with which you blaspheme against me, can be fulfilled. For I say: We do not want to be under the Lord, nor to be called His people. But as all nations are in the whole world, and each people lives according to its own will, to worship wood and stones, and to serve idols, even we shall be one people among many. To which God responds and swears by Himself, saying: I will not abandon you nor despise you, as negligent runaway servants often despise their masters, but I will draw you back to my reign, and with outstretched arm, striking and pouring out fury, I will restore you to your former slavery, and I will reign over you: whether you want it or not, you will have me as your king, and you will experience the wrath of a king, whose kindness you have neglected.

<h2 id='tocuniq221'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34) And I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you were scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out I will reign over you. 'I will not let you be in the nations any longer, nor will I allow you to be held in everlasting captivity, but I will bring you out from the peoples, and gather you from the countries where hostile necessity has dispersed you to serve. However, I will do this not to destroy and obliterate you, but to be your king.' From which we also understand that what the heretics call the cruelty of the Creator, sounds like mercy: while he is angry and furious for this purpose, and pours out all his fury, in order to draw them back to his kingdom, who have chosen to serve the tyranny of demons.

<h2 id='tocuniq222'>(Vers. 35, 36, seq.)</h2>

(Verse 35, 36, and following) And I will bring you into a desert of peoples, and there I will judge you face to face. Just as I contended with your fathers in the desert of the land of Egypt, so I will judge you, says the Lord. And I will subject you to my scepter, and I will bring you into the bonds of the covenant, and I will choose from among you the transgressors and the wicked: from their place of residence I will bring them out, and they will not enter the land of Israel, and you will know that I am the Lord. Thus says the Lord: I will do for you who are in Babylon, and now serve idols, what I did for your ancestors in Egypt. I will lead you into the desert of the peoples, and there I will judge you face to face, just as I contended with them in judgment when they came out of Egypt. And after I have judged you, I will subject you to my scepter and rule, and I will make a covenant with you and bring you into your land with the bonds of love, so that bound by my love, you will never be able to depart from me. But I will choose from among you the transgressors and the wicked, who persist in the hardness of their hearts in evil deeds, not for possession, but for rejection. And I will indeed bring them out of the land of their dwelling, so that when they are brought out, they will not enter the land of Israel; but they will perish in various regions. And by the distinction between good and evil, you shall know that I am the Lord, who judges all things. The rest of the discourse hastens, and we briefly go through each point, in order to provide only the meaning to the readers.


<h2 id='tocuniq223'>(Vers. 39.)</h2>

(Verse 39.) And you, house of Israel, thus says the Lord God: each one of you after your idols walk, and serve them. But if you will not listen to me even in this, and you will further defile my holy name in your gifts and in your idols. LXX: And you, house of Israel, thus says the Lord God: Each one of you take away your inventions, and after this, if you will listen to me, and you will no longer defile my holy name in your gifts and in your pursuits. Symmachus has interpreted this passage more clearly: Each of you, going after your own idols, serve them, because you do not want to listen to me. But do not further pollute my holy name with your offerings and statues. On my holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel, says the Lord God, there the whole house of Israel will serve me. The translation by Symmachus has this meaning: Because you do not want to serve me, go and serve the idols, and trample the footsteps of your own statues. For you do not want to hear me, so that you do not sacrifice offerings to me, nor burn incense, nor call yourselves my people. For my worshippers do not serve me in the places of light, temples, and idols, like you do, but on my holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel. Moreover, the Septuagint explains the true meaning. Abandon your former thoughts and remove the sins of evil inventions; and if after this you listen to me and do not defile my name in your gifts and idols, then you shall offer sacrifices to me on my holy mountain and all the house of Israel shall serve me. But Aquila, on Symmachus' side, agrees in part and disagrees in part: 'Go,' he says, 'after your idols, and serve them, because you are unworthy of my reign, and your worship does not please me. But if you do not even hear me on this matter, but defile my holy name, pretending to offer to me what you offer to idols, and you blaspheme my name alone, so that, as worshipers of idols, you call yourselves my own; know this, that on my holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel, there all the house of Israel will serve me, not you who serve idols, but all the house of Israel that will believe later.'


<h2 id='tocuniq224'>(Vers. 40, 41.)</h2>

(Verse 40, 41.) But on my holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel, says the Lord God, there all the house of Israel shall serve me; all I say in the land in which they will please me, and there I will seek your firstfruits and the beginning of your tithes, in all your sanctifications, I will accept you with a sweet odor, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you from the lands where you were scattered; and I will sanctify myself in you in the eyes of the nations, and you shall know that I am the Lord. Concerning this mountain, on which the whole house of Israel is to serve God, Isaiah and Micah sang with equal voice: In the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord will be made manifest on the top of the mountains, and it will be exalted above the hills, and all nations will flow to it, and many people will go and say: Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house ((or mountain)) of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion the law will go forth, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem (Is. 2 ff.; Mic. 4:1-2). And again Isaiah says: 'Ascend to a high mountain, you who announce Zion. Lift up your voice with strength, you who bring good news to Jerusalem.' (Isaiah 40:9). By the mountain Zion, or the Church, we understand the watchtower, which is elevated and established on the heights of holy teachings. Or we understand the Lord Himself, the Savior, in whom the first fruits, tithes, and all offerings turn into a pleasing aroma. So that all the nations seeing that the people of the Lord have been saved may glorify God and recognize those who have been saved, that He is the Lord.


<h2 id='tocuniq225'>(Vers. 42.)</h2>

(Verse 42) When I bring you into the land of Israel, the land that I raised my hand to give to your ancestors, then you will know that I am the Lord. I will bring you into the land of Israel, the land that I raised my hand to give to your ancestors, and which they lost due to their own fault. But you, you have received it not by your own merit, but by my mercy.

<h2 id='tocuniq226'>(Vers. 43, 44.)</h2>

(Verse 43, 44.) And you shall remember ((Vulgate: interserit ibi)) your ways, and all your sins, with which you have defiled yourselves in them: and you shall be displeased with yourselves in your own sight for all the evils that you have done, and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I will have done good to you for the sake of my name: not according to your evil ways, and your wicked deeds, O house of Israel, says the Lord God. We cannot remember our sins and vices unless we have been brought into the land of Israel, and there we may say with the Apostle: "I am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God" (I Corinthians 15:9). And you will displease, he says, yourselves in your own sight in all your wickedness that you have done. Whether, as Symmachus interpreted, And you little ones will seem small to yourselves because of all the wickedness that you have done (James IV). So that, after they have been exalted, they may believe themselves to be humble: because the Lord gives grace to the humble. And in another place it is written: Before contrition, the heart of a man is exalted, and before exaltation it is humbled (Prov. XVIII, 12). For pride, there is destruction, and from humility comes exaltation. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have done good to you. And we know the Lord our Savior more when He has done good to us, and has suffered for our sins, and has borne our iniquities, and has grieved for us; not for any merit of those who are saved, but for the sake of His name. Otherwise, our ways and our most wicked crimes have not earned mercy, but punishment. But whatever we have said about the people of Israel, who were freed from Egypt and committed many sins in the wilderness, and offended God, and later were led into the promised land, worshipped idols, wood and stones, and afterward were preserved by the mercy of God: let us recount to those who, by the hand of the Lord, were freed from Egypt of this age, brought into the wilderness of vice, and once again longed for Egypt, and did the things for which they deserved to be punished; yet nevertheless, through repentance, they were preserved not by their own merit, but by the mercy of the Lord.


<h2 id='tocuniq227'>Book Seven</h2>

Book Seven

Once upon a time, we boys read: Nothing is so easy that it does not become difficult when done unwillingly. I admit that I promised explanations on Ezekiel a long time ago and I cannot fulfill them due to the occupation of people coming from all over the world here: there is no hour, no moment in which we do not encounter crowds of brothers and exchange the solitude of the monastery for the company of guests, to the extent that either the door must be closed to us or the study of the Scriptures, through which the doors are to be opened, must be abandoned. And so, in lucrative, or rather, stolen hours of the night, which have become longer with the approach of winter, we attempt to dictate these things by the light of a small lamp, and to alleviate the weariness of a restless mind with interpretation. We do not boast, as some may suspect, of receiving financial compensation, but we simply acknowledge the reasons for our delay: especially since the flight of the West and the congestion of holy places are preferable to the nakedness and wounds of the needy, which the rage of the Barbarians brings. We cannot see without tears and groaning, that once great power and ignorance of wealth has fallen into such poverty that she lacks shelter, food, and clothing; and yet the hard and cruel hearts of some are not softened while they dismiss their rags and burdens, seeking gold in captivity. Another difficulty in dictating is added to this, that with dimming eyes in old age, and with some suffering, we are unable to read the Hebrew volumes of the Hebrews by the light of night, for they are also blinded to us by the smallness of the letters, even in the brightness of the sun and daylight. But even the commentaries of the Greeks, we know only by the voice of the brothers. There is no doubt that they make those who chew food with other people's teeth nauseous. Therefore, I beg you, daughter Eustochium, to begin with those things that we are carving with the stylus of notaries and to which we scarcely have time to make corrections, that is, begin with the seventh. And, as I have already said, if the brevity or length of the books are unequal to each other, attribute the brevity and length to the ideas, yes, even to the hypotheses, since we do not want to separate what is united and compress discordant things into one mass.


<h2 id='tocuniq228'>(Vers. 45 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 45 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face toward the south, and drop your word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field. And say to the forest of the south: Hear the word of the Lord: thus says the Lord God, Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein. And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched. And I said, 'Ah, Lord GOD! They say of me, 'Does he not speak in parables?' LXX: And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 'Son of man, set thy face towards Teman, and prophesy against the forest of the south field; and say to the forest of the south field: 'Hear the word of the LORD, thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree.' The kindled flame will not be extinguished, and it will burn in it all faces from the south to the north: and all flesh will know that I, the Lord, have kindled it: it will not be extinguished. And I said: By no means, O Lord, O Lord: they say to me: Is not this a parable? What does it mean to put or harden your face, we have explained more fully above. For the hardening of the face is necessary, and the hardness of the forehead, so that the Prophets may speak fearlessly what is commanded, especially when sad things are announced to the whole multitude of the people. But our translation expresses what they have said, that Nageb should be understood in Hebrew as the leader of the southern land or region, not Sare, as the LXX thought, which signifies the word leader and prince, but it is written Sade, which properly signifies land and region, and because of the similarity of the letters Daleth and Res, the error prevailed. But divine speech speaks in the metaphor of a leap against Jerusalem, which is the dwelling place of beasts and fierce men: that is, it sets it on fire, and all its trees are burned up. It does not call these trees, which were in need of fruit, but rather prepares them as if for a fire. And first it burns the green wood in it, secondly, that which we read in this same Prophet: 'And begin with my holy ones'; and afterwards the dry wood, which could not have any life in itself: namely, the holy ones and sinners together, so that some escape the evils of captivity through death, and others be handed over to eternal torments. And it also signifies this: from the South to the North, from Jerusalem to Babylon, so that every journey of those proceeding into captivity, falling by sword, famine, and pestilence, is completed. For those who are in Babylon, Jerusalem is situated to the South; just as, on the contrary, the pot in Jeremiah which signifies Jerusalem is set on fire from the face of the North, that is, Babylon. And beautifully in the beginning: a drop, he says, to the South; so that not the whole wrath of God appears to be poured out, but a certain drop and part. But if a drop of such cruelty exists, what is to be valued in all the rains? So that all flesh, which is to see the salvation of God, may know through the burning and flame of the forests, which is extinguished by no one's help, that He Himself is the Lord. Understanding this, the Prophet responded, ah, ah, ah, O Lord God, or as the Seventy translated, by no means, O Lord, O Lord. And he adds: And they say to me: Does this man not speak in parables? And what is this parable called? And the meaning is: Speak more plainly, we do not understand what you are saying in the parable: reveal to us the meaning in clear language. The names Theman, Nageb, and Darom can be understood tropologically as Egypt: for we often read in Daniel that the South stands for Egypt (Dan. 11), and Egypt refers to the limitations of this world. Therefore, Ezekiel prophesies the future evils that will come to the world, which he calls a desert without fruit-bearing trees, but a dwelling place for wild animals. Of which it is said in the 28th psalm: The voice of the Lord perfecting the deer, and he will reveal the hidden places of the forests (Verse 9). These are the forests and woodlands that devoured more from the army of Absalom in battle than the sword killed (2 Samuel 18). And the first green tree is set on fire in the woods, and then it becomes dry, those who live in evil and those who are dead to righteousness. And what is said: And every face will be burned from the South to the North, this means: From those who seemed to be fervent in spirit to those who, with the increase of iniquity and the cooling of charity of many, have lost their former zeal; so that all flesh may see the flame of the Lord not extinguished. And the prophet prays that what the Lord has threatened may not come to pass, that is, that the forest may not be set on fire and all the trees may not be destroyed, so that either they may still have a place for repentance or the necessity of announcing sad news may not be imposed on them, especially since the people do not understand those things and, because of the obscurity of the words, are more likely to be driven to madness.

<h2 id='tocuniq229'>(Chap. XXI.—Vers. 1 seq.)</h2>

(Chapter 21, Verse 1 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and drop toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel, and say to the land of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, and I will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked. Seeing then that I will cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked: therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh, from the south to the north. And all flesh shall know that I am the Lord, for I have drawn my sword out of its sheath, the sword that cannot be returned. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Therefore, son of man, prophesy and set your face against Jerusalem, and behold their sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel, and say to the land of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, and I will draw my sword out of its sheath and cut off from you the righteous and the wicked. Thus my sword will go forth from its sheath over all flesh from the South to the North, and all flesh will know that I, the Lord, have brought forth my sword from its sheath; it will not return again. For as it was said before: They say of me, is not this one speaking in parables? And the people demanded a clear judgment: therefore what the Lord spoke metaphorically or in parable, and as others interpret, as a proverb, he now speaks more clearly, that the desert of Nageb and Darom and Theman are Jerusalem, and its temple, the Holy of Holies, and all the land of Judah; and the flame which will consume the desert is to be understood as the devouring sword, which has been brought forth from its sheath, to strike down the righteous and the wicked. For this is a green wood and a dry wood. Hence the Lord says: If they do these things in the green wood, what will they do in the dry? (Luke 23:31) For this reason, I do not know what they were thinking, the Seventy interpreted it as unfair and unjust, as if both did not mean the same. And what he had said there: And all flesh shall see that I, the Lord, have kindled it, that is, the wood or the flame, and it shall not be extinguished, he speaks here in other words: That all flesh may know that I, the Lord, have drawn forth my sword from its sheath never to be returned. For truly, the fire against Jerusalem is not extinguished, nor is the burning sword recalled, because there is little time in between, and Jerusalem with its temple is burned by the fire of Babylon.

<h2 id='tocuniq230'>(Vers. 6, 7.)</h2>

(Vers. 6, 7.) And you, son of man, groan in the breaking of your loins, and groan bitterly before them. And when they say to you, 'Why do you groan?' you shall say, 'Because of the news, for it is coming, and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be loosened, and every spirit shall faint, and water shall flow from all knees. Behold, it is coming, and it shall be,' says the Lord (Vulgate adds 'God'). LXX: And you, son of man, groan in the breaking of your loins, and groan in pains before them. And it shall come to pass, if they shall say unto thee: Wherefore dost thou mourn? and thou shalt say: Because of the tidings, for it cometh, and every heart shall be taken and all hands shall be weakened, and every spirit shall faint, and all thighs shall be filled with moisture. Behold it cometh, and it shall be, saith the Lord God. First he had said: prophesy, or pour out upon the South, the African and the South wind, and upon the southern leap. And because it seemed obscure, and the people knew not the words of the prophet, it is set down more plainly the southern leap to be Jerusalem, and all unfruitful trees, by the roots of which the axe is laid (Matt. III, Luke III), are understood to be its inhabitants: and the sword is interpreted as fire. Thirdly, the prophet is commanded, while they are silent and not questioning, to do those things by which he may be interrogated, and to respond what the Lord has spoken. 'Groan,' he says, 'lament, not with a slight voice, nor with moderate pain, but with contrition of the loins, so that your groaning may come forth from the depths of your bowels and the bitterness of your soul. And you shall do this before them: that when they have asked you why you are broken by such groaning, and what evil has befallen you that you groan in this way, you may respond to them in my words: 'Therefore, I lament, and I am unable to hide the pain of my heart, because the prophecy that had always resounded in my ears is being fulfilled by deed and is coming to pass: namely, the impending army of the raging Babylonians.' When he comes and surrounds Jerusalem, then every heart will melt, and all hands will be dissolved, so that, with the fear of men overwhelming their minds, no one will dare to resist. For the spirit of all warriors will weaken, and such great trembling and fear will seize everyone, that limbs and organs will dissolve under the pressure of fear, and the bladder will not be able to hold urine: so that urine will soil the knees. For it is natural, when fear presses, for the bladder to relax, and for moisture to flow against the will of man. Indeed, this often happens in the severity of illnesses, that after the strength of the sick people has diminished, not only their knees, but also their beds are soiled. Look, he says, it is coming, which I have often predicted, and it is being accomplished and will happen, not by me, but the Lord has spoken. I know someone who, in the contrition of his loins and with flowing waters, has repeated many testimonies, so that the chastity of the prophets may be fulfilled, and the bitterness of his soul and the internal pain of his mind, which the waters of his seed pollute his knees. But this explanation does not pertain to the current place.

<h2 id='tocuniq231'>(Vers. 8 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 8 et seq.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, prophesy and say: Thus says the Lord God, speak: A sword, a sharp sword, has been sharpened and polished, to slaughter victims; it has been sharpened, and polished, to shine: you who move the scepter of my son, you have cut down every tree. And I have given him to be polished, to be held in hand: this sword has been sharpened, and this sword has been polished, to be in the hand of the one who kills. Cry out and wail, son of man, for this has happened in my people, it has happened to all the leaders of Israel. Those who fled were delivered over to the sword along with my people. Therefore, strike your thigh and clap your hands in applause, for he has been tested and when he overturns the scepter, it will not be. This is what the Lord God says. As for you, son of man, be a prophet and strike hand against hand, and let the sword be doubled and tripled for the slayers. This is the sword of great slaughter that makes them astonished, causes their hearts to melt, and multiplies ruins. In all their gates I have given confusion of sharp and polished swords to flash: clothed for slaughter. Go to the right or to the left, wherever your desire leads your face. Indeed, I will applaud hand to hand, and I will fulfill my indignation, I, the Lord, have spoken. It is much if I present both editions, and the length of the books is extended, especially where there is either no distance or a small one. Therefore, I will present some things that differ. For this reason, what we said: 'Whoever moves the scepter of my son, cut down every tree,' they translated as: 'Kill, despise, reject every tree.' And again, where we said: 'Those who fled were handed over to the sword,' they translated as: 'My guests, or inhabitants.' And where we said: 'Applaud on the thigh,' they put: 'Strike with the hand.' And where we translated: 'And when he overturns this with the scepter, the edition belongs to them: Three are repelled.' However, he speaks to the sword of Nebuchadnezzar, that it may come against Jerusalem, to be sharpened and polished, for there are many to be slain; and he addresses Nebuchadnezzar himself. You are the one who moves and overturns the scepter of my son, the dominion of the people of Israel, and you cut down every tree, the entire multitude of the people. I have given, he says, this sword, that it may be held in the hand of Nebuchadnezzar; and let it be in the hand of a mighty man. Therefore, O prophet, cry out and wail, and with a voice filled with dire words, bear witness to the imminent calamity. This sword spared no one, nor left anyone untouched by the impending evils. It was made among the people, made among the leaders of Israel, made among my guests and priests who lived in my temple. Therefore, strike your thigh or your hand and put on the attire of one who mourns. For this sword has been tested by me, and it will overthrow my scepter and kingdom, which will no longer exist, and it will end with King Zedekiah. Again I command you, prophet, that you strike not only the thigh in astonishment and miracle, but also the hands, so that not only once, but a second and third time, the sword may come to kill. For first came Nebuchadnezzar, when he took Jehoiachin, and secondly, when Jehoiakim reigned, and thirdly, when Zedekiah. And this is the triple sword, when a great slaughter occurred and it multiplied ruins to such an extent that they were amazed in their minds and their hearts wasted away, and it caused disturbance in all their gates. Therefore it is ordered to him, that is, with a sharp and polished sword for flashing, and with a cloak and unburdened, and ready for slaughter, that he may go either to the right or to the left. Wherever, he says, it pleases your face, boldly enter, having me as your leader, me as your helper. I will applaud hand to hand, so that I may encourage you against my adversaries who rage against you, as if I were your supporter and instigator. Do not doubt, do not fear, and do not be afraid to suffer what Sennacherib has suffered: I am the Lord who has spoken, you are the minister of my will, fulfill my plan. We can, by way of anagoge, take up a sharp and ready sword for the slaughter of the devil, concerning whom the Apostle says: Deliver this kind of Satan unto the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved (I Cor. V, 5). And in another place: Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme (I Tim. I, 20). And it is written in the Psalms: He sent forth his wrath and indignation and distress, a mission by the agency of wicked angels (Ps. LXXVII, 49). Some think that this sword was in the hand of an angel when Jerusalem was struck under David (2 Kings 24). Others suspect that it is said of the same sword in the Gospel: I did not come to bring peace on earth, but a sword (Matthew 10:34); and to divide among themselves every affection of kinship, so that the wicked may fall and the holy may rise. But it is impious to believe this of the sword of the Savior, and rather this should be believed of the devil, who overturns the scepters of the Lord in the Church, who kills all in the people, and the leaders, and the guests of God; and then is approved by the Lord, when he overthrows Judas the traitor and his like (John 13). After he had eaten the morsel, Satan entered into him. And the sword of those who were killed doubled and tripled, in order to forgive the sin of Jerusalem, because it had taken upon itself its own double sins from the hand of the Lord. But the Lord rejoices and exults, and encourages the raging sword to go either to the right or to the left, and wherever its desire takes it, so that the evil may be killed and the good may remain, and fulfill what is written: What are chaff to wheat? The Lord says (Jeremiah 23:32).

<h2 id='tocuniq232'>(Vers. 18 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 18 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, set before yourself two ways, and let the sword of the king of Babylon come. From one land they will both go out, and by hand he will take a decision: he will cast lots at the head of the city's road. You shall set a road, so that the sword may come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah, and to Jerusalem, the fortified. For the king of Babylon stood at the crossroads, at the head of the two roads, seeking divination, mixing arrows. He questioned the idols, consulted the entrails. To his right, a divination was made concerning Jerusalem, to set up battering rams, to open the mouth in slaughter, to raise the voice in lamentation, to set up battering rams against the gates, to heap up a siege mound, to build fortifications. And it will be as if he is consulting in vain their oracle, imitating the rest of the sabbath, but he himself will remember the iniquity in order to capture it. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have brought your iniquities to memory and have revealed your transgressions, and your sins have appeared in all your thoughts; because of this, I say, you will be taken captive by the hand. I know that in this place, according to the Septuagint interpreters, I have read the diverse exposition of a certain law, Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, referring to the Gentile people. But to Judah and Jerusalem, to those who gather under the name of Christ, and to those who give dignity to his name, the king of confusion, the devil, stands at the head of every road and lies in wait in secret. And he fulfills that verse: 'They have placed a stumbling block in my path' (Ps. 139). And he stands at the crossroads, desiring to hold onto those who are his, or to acquire new servitude for himself. And he always goes to the right, namely, to those who are situated on the right side, in order to conquer them, to exult in their destruction, to take miserable Jerusalem by force and by the gathering of earthly works. And first of all, so that it seems that he is doing nothing, and striving in vain. But by recalling their iniquities, those who dwell in the Church, indeed even bring to mind the opposing powers with their evil works, they bring to light all the sins of the people and their thoughts, and for this reason they are captured, because they have heaped up old crimes with new ones. Another person may have said this: the truth of the history begun by us must be pursued. When, he said, the divine word had spoken to me: Prophesy, son of man, and speak to the sword and say: Sword, sword, and the rest that the prophecy of the sword contains; a second time the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Do you want, son of man, to know who this sword is, and to learn more clearly the person of the raging sword? Listen to what I say: set up two roads, so that through them the sword of the king of Babylon may come, who will indeed go by one route of the Chaldeans, but when he comes through the desert and wilderness to the crossroads of the land of Arabia, which is called the sons of Ammon, one road leads to Jerusalem on the right side, but the left leads to Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, which is the capital city and is now called Philadelphia: remember, he says, the annihilation that happened to the Assyrian king when 185,000 were killed in one night, he will fear to turn to the right and go against the heavily fortified Jerusalem; but he will stand at that junction, and according to the customs of his people, he will consult the oracle, to send his arrows into the quiver, and mix them, or label them with the names of each, to see whose arrow comes out, and which city he should besiege first. Now the Greeks call this kind of divination belomancy, or rhabdomancy. Therefore, he consulted the idols and examined the entrails. The divination pointed to his right, indicating that he should march against Jerusalem, besiege it, build ramparts, set up battering rams, construct fortifications, surround the city, open his mouth for slaughter, and stir up the roaring and howling of his exultant army. By doing this, he said, he would appear to the inhabitants of Jerusalem to consult an oracle in vain and, like someone spending his time on Sabbath leisure, to engage in play and accomplish nothing. But the king of Babylon, not relying on his own strength, but on the wickedness of the people, which he knows has offended God, and has added sins of the fathers to new offenses, and all their transgressions have been revealed; and for this reason he will not hesitate in victory, because he trusts in the wickedness of Jerusalem. These things, according to the Hebrew, from which the Septuagint diverge in many places not so much in meaning as in words.

<h2 id='tocuniq233'>(Vers. 25 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 25 onwards) But you, profane and wicked ruler of Israel, whose day has come at the appointed time of iniquity. Thus says the Lord God: Remove the turban and take off the crown. Is this not the one who exalted the lowly and humiliated the proud? I will bring upon it injustice, injustice, injustice, and this will not cease until the one comes to whom judgment belongs, and I will give it to him. Septuagint: And you, profane and unjust ruler of Israel, whose day has come, at the end of the time of iniquity. Thus says the Lord God: You have removed the diadem and placed the crown. This will not be the same. You have humbled the high and exalted the lowly. I will bring upon her iniquity, iniquity will I bring upon her: and she will not be like this until the one to whom it is due comes: and I will give it to him. Symmachus interpreted this passage as follows: But you, profane and unjust ruler of Israel, whose day comes at the appointed time of iniquity: Thus says the Lord God: She has removed the diadem and taken the crown: neither this nor that: she will raise up the lowly and humble the exalted. I will commit iniquity, iniquity, iniquity upon it. And this was not that one, whose judgment is, whom I am about to give. After the destruction of the city of Jerusalem and the captivity of the people, the speech is directed to the leader of Israel, whom no one doubts is signified by Zedekiah, in whom the reign of the kings of Israel from the lineage of David ended. The day, says he, has come upon you, which has been predetermined for a long time in you, and because of you the priesthood and kingdom of the people of Judah have come to an end. For indeed the cidaris is the distinguishing mark of the pontiff: the crown, that is, the diadem, the sign of the king. Is this not the cidaris, and this crown that did nothing by judgment; but for the imitation of the Babylonian king, whom he wanted to exalt, and whom he wanted to humble? Therefore, not once, nor twice according to the Septuagint, but three times I will put iniquity before you forever, which was not immediately taken into account by you, but until Christ comes, whose judgment it is, and the Father gives him the kingdom and the priesthood, or the Church gathered from the Gentiles: For the Father judges no one; but he has given all judgment to the Son (John 5:22). And in another place: God, he said, give your judgment to the king, and your justice to the son of the king (Ps. 72:1). This is the one to whom the power and eternal priesthood have been entrusted, of whom Jacob also spoke: The ruler will not fail from Judah, nor the leader from his thighs, until the one to whom it has been entrusted comes; and he will be the expectation of the nations (Gen. 49:10). In the place where we have interpreted: Is not this, beautifully translated by Symmachus, neither this, nor that. For he had said: Take away the crown, remove the diadem, he added, neither this nor that, that is, the kingdom will cease, and the priesthood. Hence those who were kings and priests until the coming of Christ, among whom one high priest Hyrcanus placed a diadem on his head, wanted in vain to claim both this and that, since the kingdom was not owed to him after Zedekiah, but to the one to whom it was entrusted, and who was the expectation of the Gentiles, about whom Malachi speaks: You, priests, who defile my name (Mal. 1, 6). And a little while later: My will is not in you, and I will not accept sacrifices from your hands. For from the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the nations, and in every place a clean offering is sacrificed and offered to my name. This clean offering, without the blood of goats, rams, and bulls (Ps. 49), is fulfilled in the coming of Christ, when he came as the desired one of the nations, and the sun of righteousness rose, in whose wings there is healing (Hagg. 2).


<h2 id='tocuniq234'>(Vers. 28 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 28 and following) And you, son of man, prophesy and say: Thus says the Lord God to the sons of Ammon and to their disgrace. And you shall say: Sword, sword, draw yourself out for slaughter: hone yourself to kill and to shine. Although they seem vain to you and their divinations are lies, so that you may be given over to the necks of the wicked wounded, whose appointed day has come in the time of iniquity. Return to your sheath, in the place where you were created: in the land of your birth I will judge you. And I will pour out my indignation upon you; I will blow upon you the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver you into the hands of brutish men, skillful to destroy. You shall be fuel for the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the land; you shall be forgotten, for I the Lord have spoken.” The sword of the king of Babylon has been at the head of the two roads, in the fork of the two ways, to use divination. He has shaken the arrows; he has consulted the household gods; he has looked at the liver. When it is conquered and captured, it is predicted that both his kingdom and priesthood shall perish forever. The rest belonged to the sons of Ammon, and the order of division itself demanded what had happened on the left path. Therefore, the prophet is commanded to speak to the sons of Ammon, and to their reproach, that they themselves are to be captured, and he directs the same sword speech to them: Oh sword, sword, which is ready for slaughter, which is sharpened, so that you may shine and kill: although idols may have responded to you, and everything that is answered by demons is empty, so that you may threaten the necks of the wounded, and fulfill what the Lord had threatened long ago; nevertheless, after completing your work, which you have done against the sons of Ammon, return to your sheath, that is, to Babylon, to the place where you were made and created: so that in the land of your birth I may judge you, and I will pour out my indignation upon you, and you shall be captured by the power of the Medes and Persians. What is said more fully in the book of Isaiah, in a vision against Babylon: Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them. And a little later: And Babylon, that glorious one among kingdoms, renowned for its pride among the Chaldeans, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, it shall never be inhabited until the end (Isa. XIII, 17 et seqq.). And because once he was speaking in the person of the sword about the king, or rather the kingdom of Babylon, it retains the metaphor. In the fire, he says, of my wrath I will blow upon you; to make you be consumed by fire and delivered into the hands of ignorant and foolish men, who do not have the skill to forge swords and sharpen them; so that you may no longer be sharpened, polished, and shine for killing; but be the food of fire, and let your blood, which you have shed before all who watch, overflow within you; and be consigned to eternal oblivion, and perish forever, for I the Lord have spoken, and what I have spoken, I have done.


<h2 id='tocuniq235'>(Chap. XXII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 22, Verses 1 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, do you not judge the city of blood, and show her all her abominations? And say: Thus says the Lord God: The city that sheds blood within herself, so that her time may come, and that has made idols against herself to defile herself. In your blood that was shed, you have sinned, and you have defiled yourself with your idols that you have made. You have brought near your days, and have come to the years of your punishment; therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mocking to all the countries. Those who are near, and those who are far from you, will triumph over you (or mock you), you sordid noble, great in your destruction. Behold the princes of Israel, each one in his own arm was in you to shed blood. They have dishonored father and mother in you (or cursed father and mother). They have slandered the stranger among you. They have oppressed the orphan and the widow (or oppressed). You have despised my sanctuaries (Vulg. you have despised and polluted), you have profaned my Sabbaths. There were detractors (or thieves) in you to shed blood, and they ate on the mountains in you. They committed a crime (or, as it is more significantly in Hebrew, a heinous act), in your midst. They uncovered the shame of their fathers in you, and they humiliated the impurity of menstruation in you. And each one committed an abomination with the wife of his neighbor, and the father-in-law defiled his daughter-in-law wickedly. He oppressed (or humiliated) his own sister, the daughter of his father, in you. They received gifts from you to shed blood. You took interest and excess, and greedily slandered your neighbors (or and I will complete the fulfillment of your evil in your oppression); you have forgotten me, says the Lord God. Behold, I will clap my hands over your greediness which you have done, and over the blood which was shed in your midst. Will your heart endure, or will your hands prevail in the days I will bring upon you? I, the Lord, have spoken and I will act. I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries, and I will remove your impurity from you. I will possess you in the sight of the nations. (or according to the first edition of Aquila and Theodotion: And I will defile you, or according to Symmachus: And I will wound you in the sight of the nations) And you will know that I am the Lord. And you, he said, son of man (I will use the familiar term for you), judge the city of blood, and show it all its abominations, so that it may know that it deserves its imminent captivity, and that it has brought on its own ruin through much bloodshed. First and foremost among its sins, you have worshiped idols instead of God; and you have also defiled with your own hands the time appointed for your years, which was long spoken of and delayed, in order to bring about repentance. But you, according to your hardened heart, treasure up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath (Romans II). Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mockery to all the lands around you, both near and far. They will triumph over you and mock you. Filthy, noble, great in destruction. Filthy because you have ceased to be clean. Noble in evil, for once you surpassed all cities in nobility. Great in destruction: the higher you were, the harder you fell. And meanwhile, without mentioning everything else, I will mention a few things that have happened to you. Your rulers, judging not with justice but with the strength and might of the arm, shed innocent blood in you. Others have treated their father and mother with disrespect, even cursing their parents, as Scripture says: 'Whoever curses his father or mother shall be put to death' (Exodus 21:17). They have oppressed the stranger and the foreigner among you, as if their suffering and exile from their homeland were not enough for them. They have saddened and oppressed the orphan and the widow among you: so that those whose entire estate is in the justice of the law, would not only be saddened, but oppressed by you. You have despised my sanctuaries and holy things, and you have defiled my sabbaths: so that you would not distinguish between the holy and the polluted, between the decreed day of religion and the rest of the sabbath for the worship of God, and the other days on which it is allowed by law to work and serve the needs of the flesh. The detractors, whether according to Symmachus and Theodotion, were deceitful, because it is said in Hebrew: Rachil, and they were murderers in you, to blaspheme God, or to do all things with deceit or violence. And the wise men devoured on high mountains, and with pride elevated against God, they committed wickedness or incest in your midst, such things as rarely happen in corners and secret places, when they are avoided by evil-conscious men, you have done openly. The following discourse explains what incest is: They have exposed the more modest parts of their father in you, they have unlawfully joined with their stepmother, and have defiled the impurity of menstruation within you, showing no regard for nature, nor granting any truce to indecency, clinging instead to the wife of their nearest kinsman. And what is even more wicked, the father-in-law has burned with desire for his daughter-in-law, and the brother has disregarded the rights of his sister: he violated his sister, not one born of the same mother, but rather the one born of the same father. They accepted gifts in order to shed innocent blood. They turned the necessity of the poor into profit, in order to receive interest and abundance; and because of greed, they slandered friends. 'But you, O Jerusalem, have done this,' he says, 'because you have forgotten me. For the memory of God excludes all crimes.' Therefore, I have taken on the appearance of an angry Lord, and I have clapped my hands against your greed and against the blood that was shed among you, so that you may understand and comprehend whether I can endure my anger with either mind or hands. For I have spoken, and I will do it: and after thou shalt be taken, Jerusalem, I will scatter thee into nations, and I will fan thee in the air, and thou shalt be moved to and fro in every wind: and my wrath shall be accomplished in thee, and my indignation shall rest in thee. And I will do, so that I may signify: and I will cause my indignation to rest in thee, and my wrath shall depart from thee, and I will be pacified, and will be angry no more. And my wrath shall rest in thee: and my indignation shall depart from thee, and I will be pacified, and will cease to be angry. And they shall know that I the Lord have spoken it, and have done it, saith the Lord God. But if we follow the interpretation of Symmachus and Theodotion, of whom one says, 'And I will wound you, or kill you,' and the other, 'I will defile you before the nations,' all things must be interpreted in a negative sense. Although this is contrary to this meaning, which was stated above, 'And I will cause your filthiness to cease from you.' For the ceasing of filthiness is the restoration of purity. I have discussed both editions equally, in order to avoid the extent of the books.


<h2 id='tocuniq236'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 17 seqq.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, the house of Israel has become like dross to me. All of them, copper, tin, iron, and lead, are in the midst of the furnace; they have become silver dross. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have all become like dross, behold, I will gather you in the midst of Jerusalem as a gathering of silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead in the midst of the furnace, to kindle a fire in it for melting. Thus I will gather in my fury and in my wrath and I will rest and melt you, and I will kindle you in the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in its midst, like silver melted in the midst of a furnace. So you shall be in its midst, and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have poured out my indignation upon you. The Hebrew word Sig (), Symmachus translates as dross, Aquila's first edition as grape stone and γίγαρτον, which signifies both grape seed and grape stalk. But the second translation of it, and the Septuagint's rendering, means a blending. Furthermore, it signifies dross, filth, and the waste of metals; so that subsequently, with the nearby captivity, or rather the impending destruction of the city, fire is applied: so that during the process of blending, pure silver remains, which had been mixed with and defiled by copper, tin, iron, and lead: three of which, copper, tin, and lead, are fusible substances, and are dissolved by fire. But truly, iron between the anvil and the hammer becomes soft and thin, and takes on various forms, according to the will of the craftsman. Just as, therefore, silver, which the aforementioned metals have tarnished, is put into the furnace, so that, with the impurities and foreign materials removed, it may remain pure, thus, he says, I will gather you in the midst of Jerusalem, and I will surround Babylon with siege, in order to kindle in you a fire for refining. And just as there the immense heat of flames is present, here hunger and pestilence will do the same: so that after I have gathered you and set you on fire with the fire of fury, then I will rest, and with the punishment of your contempt, I will restrain the pain. And I will do all this, so that after I have poured out my indignation upon you, the end of your torment may be known to me; and you shall know that I am the Lord, the judge of all and the avenger. And as for what is said to be a refiner, we read in many places, but especially in Malachi and Isaiah, of whom one says: 'Behold, the Lord will come like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap, and he will sit refining and purifying like gold and silver, and he will refine the sons of Levi.' (Mal. III, 1, 3). Moreover, the Lord will wash away the filth of the sons and daughters of Zion and cleanse the blood from their midst, with the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning (Isa. IV, 4). And I believe this to sound like what is said in the Psalms: Examine me, O Lord, and test me (Ps. XXV, 2). After which it is said: Burn my kidneys and my heart, so that all the harmful fluids of the loins may be dried up, along with their wicked deeds, and the coverings that have been placed (Ps. XXV, 2). What we understand about Jerusalem, let us understand also about the state of souls, which were created pure by God: they have received gold in sense and wisdom, and silver in speech and eloquence, so that they may express with words what they have conceived in their minds. We read of silver: The speech of the Lord is pure speech; silver tried in a furnace of earth, refined seven times.\nSimilarly, the seventy-seventh psalm mentions gold and silver, where it is written: If you sleep among the nations wilees, and the wings of a silver dove, and its back parts are in greenness, or in the color of gold.\nFor all the glory of the daughter of the king is within, which speaks in the Song of Songs: The king has brought me into his chamber. He who has slept and rested between two Testaments will immediately assume the silver wings of a dove, and with gold in the treasure of his heart, he will shine with radiant light. I believe this has the meaning that for sinners and those who have earned the offense of God, the sky is made of brass and the earth is made of iron, especially the land of Egypt, from which the Lord brought forth Israel, as if from a fiery furnace. In Zechariah, also, wickedness sits upon a talent of lead (Zech. V). And in the Song of Exodus it is said: They were submerged like lead in violent waters (Exod. XV, 10). For they were burdened with the weight of their sins, and they could say: Heavy burdens are weighing down on me (Ps. XXXVII, 6). However, just as the appearance of gold deceitfully imitates the likeness of adulterated copper, so does tin simulate the whiteness of silver, which the simple and rustic cannot easily discern. And it often happens that gold and silver, mixed with heretical wickedness, are separated by the fire of the Holy Spirit and the judgment of the Lord, and pure gold and silver remain, of which the prophet says: I gave them silver and gold, but they made Baal out of them (Hosea II, 8). To whom is it similar: 'I led them out with silver and gold, and there was no feeble one among their tribes' (Psalm 104, 37). Let the end of all punishments be to know that the Lord himself is God. We read about a tin stone, or a tin mass, in Zechariah (Zechariah 4), which we have interpreted in its proper place.

<h2 id='tocuniq237'>(Vers. 23 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 23 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, say to him: You are unclean land, not cleansed on the day of wrath. The conspiracy of the prophets within it, like a roaring lion seizing its prey: they have devoured souls, taken riches and precious things, multiplied widows within it. Its priests have despised my law and defiled my sanctuaries. They have not kept a distance between the holy and the profane, and they have not understood the difference between the unclean and the clean. They have turned their eyes away from my sabbaths, and I have been defiled among them. Her princes in the midst of her are like wolves tearing the prey to shed blood, and to destroy souls, and to get dishonest gain. And her prophets have daubed them without tempering the mortar, seeing vain things, and divining lies unto them, saying: Thus saith the Lord God: whereas the Lord hath not spoken. The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have done violence to the needy and poor, and have oppressed the stranger wrongfully. And I sought among them a man who would interpose a wall, and stand opposite me for the land, so that I would not destroy it, and I did not find one. So I poured out my indignation upon them, I consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I repaid their deeds upon their heads,’ says the Lord God. A diligent listener could inquire about the impurities that violate the purity of silver, and have been mixed with copper, lead, tin, and iron. Therefore, what is expressed there under the image of a city and a furnace, is proclaimed as under the likeness of land that is not irrigated and does not receive rain. We should understand those rains about which it is written: I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it (Isa. V, 6); we expect when a temporary and late rain is given to us, about which it is written: You will separate voluntary rain, O God, for your inheritance (Ps. LXVII, 10). But it is a day of fury, which each person procures for themselves with a multitude of sins. We desire to know what the scum of the city is, which is the hardness and foulness of the earth, full of thorns and briers. The conspiracy, he says, of the Prophets, or according to the LXX, the leaders in the midst of it having the likeness of a lion, about which Peter writes: Our adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about (I Peter V, 8). This lion and all its companions do not seek to devour bodies, but souls, and they receive rewards and judge everything by money. That this indeed happened to the people of the Jews at that time is beyond doubt. For the Lord brought evil upon them because of the priests, and the rulers, and the prophets. But in our Jerusalem we often see this: those who, according to the Seventy, devour souls in power, and accept payment to make many widows who have lost the Lord as their spouse. However, this is the faction and conspiracy of these prophets, that they may be each other's supporters and do all things for the sake of filthy gain. The priests who should be the leaders of the temple, from whose mouth the knowledge of the Law is sought, violate the sanctuaries, and there is no distinction between the holy and the profane except for money. They turn their eyes away from the Sabbath, and they do not recognize the rest of God which is in the knowledge of the Scriptures; neither do they say with the prophet: Open my eyes, and I will consider the wonders of your law (Psalm 118:18). Nor do they say what the Apostle says: But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord (2 Corinthians 3:18). Among such prophets and priests, the Lord's mediator is defiled, of whom it is written: But there stands among you one whom you do not know (John 1:26). Therefore, prophets or leaders are compared to lions. But the princes whom we understand to be of a lower rank imitate the rapaciousness of wolves, so that they shed not the blood of bodies, but of souls, and they greedily pursue gains, not at all satisfied with that: 'They who serve the altar, live by the altar' (1 Corinthians 9:13); but after they have approached the ministry of God, they gather the riches of Croesus. Even those prophets who foretell future events anointed them without moderation, as we have already said, of the prophesying prophets, who anointed a wall without the mixture of plaster, which is dissolved by rain. They see such things as empty, and not so much prophesy as they divine falsehood, saying to the miserable land: 'Thus says the Lord, the Lord promises this', when the Lord has not spoken to them. But the people of the land are not of God, but rather imitators of earthly works, rulers and priests, who by deceit and power do all things: not oppressing the rich, but rather the poor, of whom it is written: 'But the poor cannot endure a threat.' And: The redemption of a man's soul, by his own wealth (Prov. XIII, 8). They also oppressed the stranger and foreigner, who had not yet become a citizen of the Church, but only a listener, and who had the beginnings of faith, with slander: so that after they had gone through the sea and the dry land, they would make him a proselyte and make him a child of hell. Among such a multitude of vices and crimes, I sought for a man who could resist my anger, and who could stand against my fire and my burning, like Moses, and Aaron, and Samuel; but I could not find one. And he spoke to Moses, saying: Let me alone, that my wrath may be kindled against them, and that I may destroy them (Exodus 32:10). And because I could not find anyone who resisted and held me back, I poured out my indignation upon them, and consumed them, not without measure and judgment, but to repay their ways upon their own heads, attributing their own sins to them as authors, or certainly to the heads of the people, the leaders, princes, and prophets, of whom none dared to resist the angry Lord, and for whose sake the land remained barren and desolate, not deserving to receive the rain of the Lord.


<h2 id='tocuniq238'>(Chap. XXIII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 23, verses 1 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother. And they played the harlot in Egypt, in their youth they played the harlot. There their breasts were pressed and their virgin bosoms were broken (or, as it is in the Septuagint, There their breasts fell and there they were deflowered). Their names were Oholah the elder (or, the elder sister), and Oholibah her sister. And I took them (whether they were given to me) and they bore sons and daughters. And their names were Samaria Oolla and Jerusalem Ooliba. Therefore, Oolla prostituted herself with me and she went mad (or went away) to her lovers in Assyria, who approached her, dressed in purple, rulers and officials, all young men, choice horsemen. And she gave her fornications over them, all the elect sons of Assyria, and in all on whom she had been mad upon with her uncleanness (or inventions), she was defiled. Moreover, she did not leave her fornications which she had in Egypt. For they also had slept with her in her youth, and they broke the breasts of her puberty (or they also deflowered her): and they poured their fornication over her. Therefore, I handed her over to the hands of her lovers, to the hands of the sons of Assyria, on whose lust she had gone mad. They uncovered her shame; they took away her sons and daughters, and killed her with the sword. And she became a byword among women; judgments were executed upon her. The Scripture testifies that the twelve tribes of Israel, which were united in Egypt, later divided into two and ten tribes, called Judah and Israel, as recorded in the books of Kings and Chronicles. The tribe of Judah ruled from the line of David, with Rehoboam as the son of Solomon in Jerusalem, where there was a temple and priests, and a large part of the tribe of Levi. But in Samaria, Jeroboam the son of Nabat from the tribe of Ephraim and Joseph ruled over the ten tribes; of which Samaria is now called Oolla, which in our language means tabernacle: but Jerusalem is called Ooliba, which means my tabernacle in it. For indeed, even among the ten tribes, there was a tabernacle not of God, but of idols. For Jeroboam had set up golden calves in Dan and Bethel in order to turn the people away from the worship of God. Let us therefore speak about each. These two women, Samaria and Jerusalem, were daughters of the same mother from the lineage of Israel, and they committed adultery in Egypt during their youth. For they would not have received the Law when they were brought out of Egypt and gathered at Mount Sinai, which prohibited them from worshiping idols, unless they had worshiped Egyptian idols while in Egypt. However, the mother of both could be Chethaea, of whom we read above: Your father was Amorrhaeus, and your mother was Chethaea (Above, XVI, 3). But when it is said: Let each one remove the abominations of Egypt from his sight, it signifies that in Egypt the Israelites worshipped idols and fell there, whether their breasts of virginity were broken or not. And Samaria is said to be greater and older, either because of the multitude of the ten tribes, or because after the death of Moses from the tribe of Ephraim, Joshua the son of Nun led the people: hence we read that Jeroboam, who split them, was from the house of David (3 Kings, XII). And God had them, whether they were made by him, when they groaned from the works of Egypt, serving clay and brick. And afterwards they bore sons and daughters, either in the wilderness or in the promised land. And first Oolla, that is, Samaria, fornicated against God, when she went mad for the Assyrians, who were dressed in her hyacinth garments, not just any people, but leaders and magistrates, not those worn out by age, but all young men, chosen horsemen, from whom she followed idols and from whom she demanded help against the command of God. Those who came and defiled her, did not leave anything that she had done in her youth in Egypt. For even the Egyptians had sexual relations with her in her youth, of whom she worshiped their idols; and there, her virginity was taken and her breasts were broken. And there was such an abundance of fornication, that it is said that they did not fornicate with her, but rather poured out their own fornication upon her. Therefore, she was delivered to her lovers, Phul, Theglathphalassar, and Salmanasar, in whose lust she went mad, and they uncovered her shame, metaphorically, like that of a harlot woman (2 Kings 17 and 18, 1 Chronicles 5). However, the revelation of the city is that it is captured, and they took captive its sons and daughters, and they slaughtered it with the sword, so that it is butchered as an example for all women, and it is celebrated in a negative way by everyone's speech. Those who carried out judgments and vengeance in it, so that they left nothing of salvation in it; but to this day, ten tribes are held captive in the mountains and cities of the Medes, to which they were transferred. We have discussed more fully the allegorical meaning of Joseph, Ephraim, Samaria, Jezreel, and Israel, and how they are contrary to the house of David and Jerusalem, which signifies the Church. The psalm, which is the seventy-seventh, speaks of this: The sons of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle (Psalm 77:9). And again: He rejected the tabernacle of Joseph and chose the tribe of Judah (Ibid., 67). For God has chosen the house of confession, which is the Church, and rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, which signifies increase. They, neglecting the Law of God, added golden calves to their worship, and they are called Oolla, which means tabernacle, not of God, but of error and demons. And the elder and older sister, because of the multitude and captivity by the Assyrians, committed fornication against God, for she abandoned the truth of faith and went mad for the leaders of the heretics, who were clothed in hyacinth, promising her lofty and heavenly things; and the climbers, of whom it is said: These are in chariots, and on horses (Ps. XIX, 8), chosen sons of the Assyrians and leaders and magistrates, who promise themselves knowledge and eloquence. But he did this because he had the same fornications that he had in Egypt, that is, before he believed, and he still lived in the world, he also practiced them in heresy. And she was deflowered (or They were deflowered) by Assyrian men who persist in wickedness, whether as avengers. For our adversary, the devil himself, is an enemy and avenger (I Peter V). They shattered the breasts of Samaria; and they destroyed her virginity that she had in the Church. Therefore, they were delivered to their lovers, according to the Apostle who writes: I have delivered them to Satan, so that they may learn not to blaspheme (I Tim. I, 20). And: I have delivered them to the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved (I Cor. V, 5). They uncovered the shame of miserable Samaria, and they displayed all its turpitude, leading captive the sons and daughters who were born to it, endowed with knowledge and deceived the simple and inexperienced, and killed it with a spiritual sword. They are celebrated in speech throughout the whole world in a negative light, and they become infamous among all the teachings of the world, so that the depravity of that woman may serve as an example for all.


<h2 id='tocuniq239'>(Vers. 11 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 11 seqq.) When her sister Oholibah saw this, she became more wicked than her, and her desire for sexual immorality surpassed that of her sister. Shamelessly, she displayed her prostitution to the sons of Assyria, to their captains and leaders who came to her. She was dressed in various (or costly) garments, riding on horses with riders, all of them handsome young men. And I saw that both of them had defiled the same path, and they multiplied their sexual immorality. And when she saw the painted figures on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with colors, having their loins girded with belts, and their heads covered with painted turbans, in the likeness of the rulers (or of the most miserable) of the Babylonians and the land of the Chaldeans, where they were born, she was inflamed with lustful desire for them. And she sent messengers to them in Chaldea. And when the sons of Babylon came to her, to the bed of her prostitution, they defiled her with their harlotry, and she was defiled by them, and her soul turned away from them. And she uncovered her fornication and revealed her disgrace, and my soul withdrew from her as my soul withdrew from her sister. For she multiplied her fornication, remembering the days of her youth when she played the harlot in the land of Egypt. And she went crazy with desire for their lovers, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys and whose genitals are like the genitals of horses. And you visited the wickedness of your youth: when your breasts were conquered in Egypt, and the breasts of your puberty were broken. According to the letter, the interpretation is easy, that when Oholibah, that is, Jerusalem, in which was the tabernacle of God, saw the stripes of her sister, she was not warned by example to turn away her foot from error; but she increased her sister's prostitution. For she once made idols outside in Dan and Bethel: but she frequently worshiped the statue of Baal in the high places and in the temple of God, and fornicated with the Assyrians. But the idol of Baal, or Bel, and (to speak plainly) Belis, is the religion of the Assyrians, consecrated by Nino the son of Belis in honor of his father. And he shamelessly offered his prostitution to the Assyrians, to leaders and magistrates, who were clothed in various and multicolored garments, and to horsemen and young men who were distinguished in appearance by all. So that the prostitution of both sisters became one. And in this way Jerusalem increased its own prostitution, for seeing the images of the Chaldeans on the walls, she became crazed with desire and, deceived by their appearance and clothing, sent messengers to them, seeking help: who came and defiled her. And because pleasure is not perpetual, but quickly brings satiety: she, defiled and saturated with them, departed from their company. Therefore, even I, seeing her turpitudes and fornications made public to all, withdrew from her, so that I, who had surpassed the crimes of my sister, would also surpass her in the magnitude of punishments. Her audacity was of such great extent that she committed all the errors of her youth in a more serious age: and she indulged in Egyptian vices, even following the lusts of the Chaldeans. For he once went mad in the company of Egyptians, whose flesh resembles that of donkeys, and with such a copious flow of semen, and genitals so large, that they surpass even the deformity of horses. Nor did his wickedness cease in his youth: on the contrary, after she became mine, she returned to surpass her former lust in the desert and in the land of promise, where she was deflowered, and her breasts were broken, and all the adornment of her virginity was destroyed. Furthermore, according to tropology, it is difficult to understand how the Church conquers heretical desire unless perhaps we can say this: the servant who knows his master's will and does not do it will be beaten with many stripes (Luke 12:47); and that heretics commit unspeakable acts outside the ark, and perish in shipwreck: but those who follow true faith, if they imitate the vices of Assyria and Chaldea and follow the discolored images of sins, are worthy of greater torments. Shall we not send messengers to the Chaldeans, who interpret as if they were demons, when we open to them and offer them our breasts to be broken in the inner chamber of the mind, and having been satiated with pleasures, we pass from one to another; and not so much do we desire fornication as we desire the number of prostitutes, and we have come to such madness that after much time in the service of the Lord's day, we return to Egypt and do the things that we did in the world before we received the name of faith?


<h2 id='tocuniq240'>(Vers. 22 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 22ff.) Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will stir up against you your lovers from whom you turned in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side: the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and commanders all of them, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses. And they shall come against you from the north with chariots and wagons and with a host of peoples. They shall set themselves against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments. And I will give them judgment, and they shall judge you with their judgments, and I will put my zeal in you, which they shall exercise against you in fury. They shall cut off your nose and your ears, and what remains, they shall cut off with the sword. They shall take your sons and your daughters, and your last will be devoured by fire, and they shall strip you of your garments, and they shall take away the vessels of your glory. And they shall make your wickedness cease from you, and your prostitution from the land of Egypt. You shall not lift up your eyes to them, nor shall you remember Egypt anymore. LXX: Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will stir up your lovers against you, from whom your soul has turned away, and I will bring them against you from every side, the sons of Babylon and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and commanders all of them, officers and men of renown, mounted on horses. And they shall come against you from the north with chariots and wagons and a host of peoples. They shall set themselves against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet; and I will commit the judgement to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgements. And I will execute judgment in fury and anger upon them; then they shall know that I am the LORD, when I lay My vengeance upon them. Because you remembered the flesh of the Egyptians and imitated the filthiness of the unclean nation, which venerates the images of all beasts, therefore I will bring against you your lovers, with whom you were satisfied, and you departed from their covenant, so that as great as your love once was, you will be turned into such hatred. Sons, I say, of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, nobles, tyrants, and princes; for whom in Hebrew it is written, Phacud () and Sue () and Cue (), which the diverse Orientals understand, since we do not find such names either in the Book of Kings, or in the Chronicles, nor indeed in Jeremiah, who describes the captivity of Jerusalem, or in any place of the Holy Scripture. It is not surprising that the Septuagint itself used Hebrew names, since Symmachus and Theodotion also agree on the same words. They all say that the Assyrians, the horsemen, and the young men, in their distinguished form, are the leaders and magistrates, or the tristates, whom we have interpreted as the princes of princes. We read about them also in Exodus (Exod. XV, 4). The chosen ones are translated as ascensores tristatas (τριστάτας), for which Latin simplicity translates as ternos statores. But the name is sad among the Greeks, the second rank after royal dignity. About whom it is written: However, it did not reach the first three, who were the leaders of the cavalry and infantry and the tribunes ((or tributes)) (I Chronicles XII, II Kings XXIII): whom we call the magistrates of both military forces, and the prefects of the title of the annual tax. They all, he says, armed with breastplates, helmets, and shields, besieged you all around in their chariots and on their horses, and I will give them judgment, so that you will be judged by those whom you have left behind, and whose covenant you have made void: and they will judge you with their judgments as an adulteress. And I will set my zeal against you, which they will exercise with you in fury. For my zeal is among the enemies, even faith not being preserved. 'I will cut off your nose and your ears,' he says, 'like an adulteress caught in adultery, so that you may cease to please when disfigured. For just as all the beauty of the face consists in the beauty of the nose, and in the ears, from which depend the unions and the pearls in women, so the dignity of the king and the judges, which is marked in the mouth and the ears, will be cut off by their sword.' They will take your sons and daughters. 'Your sons,' he says, 'and your daughters, not mine, because they were conceived in adultery, and they will devour the rest with fire. And they will strip you of the garments with which I adorned you, and the vessels of your glory, which I granted to you, gold and silver, for use in the ceremonies of the temple, of which it is written: 'I gave them gold and silver, and they made them into Baal' (Hosea II, 8). But I will do all these things, so that your lost beauty and bewitched face may finally be at peace, and your wickedness and fornication, which you learned and practiced in Egypt, may cease. After you have lost your nose and ears, you will no longer dare to raise your eyes to the Chaldeans, nor show your ugliness to your former lovers. And you will no longer remember the lust of the Egyptians, whose indulgence in flesh you delighted in. All the things that are said about the punishment of the adulteress, and how she is disgraced because of adultery: so that she may no longer boast in her beauty, but be ashamed in her disgrace, which she has earned through the greatness of her pleasures. Whatever is said metaphorically about Jerusalem, and can be understood in reference to the soul, which, having been joined to the virtues and united to God, later adulterated them with vices and turned away from Him, and with all her crimes exposed, was uncovered, dishonored, and shown to all, so that she may desist from her wickedness to some extent: let her not boast in the dignity of her name, but rather be afraid because of her guilty conscience and remember Egypt, and dare not lift her eyes to heaven. And so his nose is cut off, and his ears are amputated, because he had turned the fragrance of good odor into a foul smell, and he had heard the judgment of blood, which we understand not only from smell and hearing, but also from sight, whereby, because they had made evil use of it, Samson and Zedekiah are deprived. Moreover, God made them deaf and dumb (Exod. IV, 11): lest their speech spread throughout the land, and every touch will be taken away from those who have completely lost their life. And let these things be done, so that everything may be purged by fire, and let the fornication of Egypt perish: nor can it any longer raise its eyes to evil.

(Verse 28 and following) For thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate, into the hands of those from whom your soul is sated. And they will deal with you in hatred, and they will take away all your labors, and they will leave you naked and full of shame, and the shame of your fornications will be revealed. Your wickedness and your fornications have done this to you, because you have prostituted yourself to the nations, among whom you have defiled yourself with their idols. You have walked in the way of your sister, and I will give her cup into your hand. Thus says the Lord God: You shall drink the deep and wide cup of your sister. You shall be a laughingstock and a mockery, a very large mock. You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of mourning and sadness, the cup of your sister Samaria. And you will drink it and gulp it down to the dregs, and you will devour its fragments, and you will tear your breasts (or as the Septuagint translated: I will take away her feasts and new moons); for I have spoken, says the Lord God (Vulgate adds God). Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, you yourself also bear your wickedness and your adulteries. It is profitable for Jerusalem to have enmity against the Assyrians and the Chaldeans, and to not remember Egypt; but rather, to be delivered into their hands for punishment, those who hated her: to whom it is not given before, unless their souls are satisfied with them, so that after repenting of their old sins, then they may be cleansed with punishments, and may destroy all the works which she acquired by her harlotry: and may see her nakedness and shame; and may know that the Lord did not do all these things for her, but rather her adulteries, by which she committed adultery among the nations whom she enumerated above, so that she would worship their idols. In the streets, she says, you have walked with your sister Samaria: therefore you must drink the cup of her sins, which you have followed. However, there are many examples of the cup, which is often received for punishments and torments, among which is this: The cup in the hand of the Lord is full of mixed wine, and He poured from this into that: but its dregs were not emptied, all the sinners of the earth will drink from it (Psalm 75:8, 9). And in Isaiah it is called the cup of ruin and the goblet of fury (Isaiah 51:17). And God spoke to Jeremiah, saying: Take the cup of wine from my hand, and you shall drink to all the nations, to whom I will send you. And they shall drink, and vomit, and become mad (Jerem. XXV, 15). Just as certain purgatives are given, so that the harmful humor that is in the body may be expelled: so the Lord also gives the most bitter cup of torments, so that he may take away from sinners whatever is of gall and bitterness, and restore them to their former health. And the cup itself will be deep and wide. Deep, in the magnitude of punishment; wide, in the length of captivity. But when, he says, you have become drunk and been seized by pain, and you drink the cup even to the dregs, and you have drunk so much that you devour even the fragments of the cup itself: then you will be disgusted by your former fornication, and you will tear the breasts that were broken in Egypt, and those that were subdued and bruised by your lovers: whether I take away all your feasts and new moons, so that instead of celebration and joy, you will have eternal lamentation and sorrow. Since you have done these things, and have forgotten about me, and have cast me behind your body, or backwards, because of the sins of the body, or behind the genitals, which indicate the filthiness of shame: Therefore, you are the gate of your own wickedness and impiety, namely the punishments that you have deserved because of your impiety and wickedness. This can be understood significantly in regard to Jerusalem, which drinks the cup of her sister Samaria to the last drop, and has drunk the dregs of her torments to the very bottom.


<h2 id='tocuniq242'>(Vers. 36, 37 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 36, 37 onwards) And the Lord said to me, saying: Son of man, do you judge Oholah and Oholibah and announce to them their crimes (or iniquities): for they are adulteresses (or have committed adultery), and there is blood on their hands, and they have committed adultery with their idols (or inventions): moreover, they have offered to devour (or have led) their sons whom they have borne to me through fire. But they have also done this to me, they have defiled my sanctuary on that day: and they have profaned my Sabbaths. And they sacrificed their sons to their idols, and entered my sanctuary on that day to defile it, and they did these things in the midst of my house. They sent messengers to men who were coming from afar, to whom they had sent a message. So behold, they have come, and you washed yourself (or, when they came, you immediately washed yourself): and you painted your eyes with antimony, and you adorned yourself with feminine beauty. You sat on a beautiful bed, and a table was set before you. You have placed my incense and my ointment upon her, and the voice of the multitude was rejoicing in her (or with a composed voice was she rejoicing); And indeed in her were brought together crowds of men, and they came from the wilderness (or drunk from the wilderness): they placed bracelets upon their hands, and most beautiful crowns upon their heads. And I said to her who was worn out with adultery: Now she will commit fornication in her own fornication even more. And they entered into it: as they would enter to a prostitute, so they entered to Oolla and Oolibah, wicked women (or to commit iniquity). Therefore, the righteous men (Vulgate inserts 'to them') shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of those who shed blood, for they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands. For thus says the Lord God: Bring upon them a multitude and deliver them to tumult and to plunder, and let them be stoned with the stones of the people, and let them be pierced with their swords; they shall kill their sons and daughters, and burn their houses with fire, and I will remove wickedness (or impiety) from the land, and all women shall learn not to commit according to their wickedness (or impiety). And they shall bring your wickedness (or impiety) upon you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols, and you shall know that I am the Lord God. As I have often mentioned, I have connected the small discrepancies in the Septuagint edition with the Hebrew text, avoiding annoyance to the reader. Therefore, it follows that one who separately described the adulteries of Samaria and Jerusalem should also announce their punishments. However, all things are said as if to adulteresses, and by way of recapitulation, their crimes are briefly presented so that the stoning of the people may justly follow according to the command of the Law towards adulteresses. (alternative reading: adulterers) Therefore, since they are adulterous, bring forth a just sentence. For they are committing adultery with idols, and there is blood on their hands, namely the blood of those they sacrificed to idols, so that they would consecrate the sons they had borne to me to demons. They did not do this outside or in the mountains and woods, as they often used to do; but in the end they defiled my temple, so that they would place a statue of Baal in it. And they profaned my Sabbaths, so that neither the place nor the time of worship would be observed among them. But they were not content with present adulteries alone, nor were they satisfied with sacrificing my sons to their idols or demons; but they also indulged in foreign pleasures, worshipping the images of the Assyrians and Chaldeans. And when they came, Oholibah, you filled the entire attire of an adulteress upon them, to wash your body, to line your eyes with antimony: to assume a feminine appearance, to sit on a bed prepared for lust, to set out feasts to restore the strength of your lovers broken by pleasure; my incense and the ointment which I had specially ordered to be made (Exodus 30), and to exterminate that soul from the people, which had wanted to do this for private use, you offered to idols; to gather a multitude of people, and to sing with every kind of music: so that you would please your lovers not only by sight, but also by hearing and smell, and all the senses, who came to you drunk: not having any urban elegance, but having the appearance of desert and solitude, resembling peasants and brigands. And you, wicked sisters, have fallen into such great madness of pleasures, that you would place your bracelets and necklaces on the hands and heads of your lovers, or even on yourselves, so that you may be defiled in full adornment. Therefore I say to you, either Jerusalem or Samaria, or both: You have burned your forehead, so that you may not be polluted in secret, and you avoid the gaze of your husbands or other men; but you are publicly prostituting yourselves like harlots, eagerly desiring to be polluted by those who enter to you like prostitutes. Therefore, I will deliver you to be punished by those to whom you have willingly submitted yourselves. For they are righteous men, who, at my command, torture adulterers and murderers. For thus says the Lord God: Gather, by the prompting of your voice, O prophet, a multitude of peoples against them, and first let all their possessions be plundered; then let them be stoned and pierced with swords, and let their sons and daughters be killed, and let their houses be burned. And all these things shall be done so that impiety may be eradicated from the earth, and all women and the entire province placed far away may learn to avoid similar punishments: so that after you have received what you deserve and have carried the crimes of your idols, then you may know that I am the Lord. However, all these things were said figuratively and under the guise of adulteresses against Samaria and Jerusalem, because they were handed over to the Assyrians and Chaldeans, led into captivity, and their cities were burned with fire: the people who worshipped the idols of demons instead of God were killed. These things can also be understood after the coming of Christ, because righteous men from the peoples of the nations themselves judge the Samaritans and the Jews by comparison with themselves, and hand them over to be devoured, to whom the Lord said (Matt. XXIII, 38): Your house shall be left to you desolate. And: When you see Jerusalem surrounded by an army, know that its desolation is near (Luke XXI, 22). For even until this day they are adulterated and are oppressed by stones from the whole world. Since they sent messengers to those who were far away, and could not say: I am a approaching God, and not a God from afar, says the Lord (Jeremiah XXIII, 23): and they prepared themselves for their beloved demons: and they turned all the worship and adornment which they had received from God as natural good, into the worship of demons, and they offered their works and adornment, which we understand as bracelets and a crown, to adulterous lovers, whose punishment is a source of fear for the nations, indeed for those among the nations who have believed, lest they suffer similar consequences if they do the same things that Samaria and Jerusalem did. Then, when they have received their crimes, the wickedness will be taken away from those by whom the veil that was placed before the face of Moses (Exod. XXXIV) has been taken away from their eyes, so that they may recognize that Jesus Christ Himself is the Lord, whom they denied to be the Son of God (II Cor. III).

<h2 id='tocuniq243'>(Chap. XXIV. Vers. 1 seq.)</h2>

(Chapter 24, Verse 1 onwards) Then in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 'Son of man, write down the name of this day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day. And speak a parable to the rebellious house and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD: Set on the pot, set it on and also pour water into it; put in it the pieces of meat, all the good pieces, the thigh and the shoulder; fill it with choice bones. Take the choicest of the flock; pile the logs under it, boil it well; let the bones be cooked in it.' Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Woe to the city of blood, the pot whose rust is in it, and its rust has not gone out of it! Empty it part by part; pour out its blood upon the bare rock; no lot has fallen upon it. For her blood is in the midst of her; she put it upon the bare rock; she did not pour it out upon the ground, to cover it with dust. I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered. Because of this, says the Lord God: Woe to the city of blood, whose pyramid I will make great. Gather the bones that I will set on fire, the flesh will be consumed, and the entire composition will be cooked, and the bones will decay. Also place it on empty coals, so that its bronze heats up and melts, and its pollution is melted in its midst, and its rust is consumed. It has been labored greatly, and its excessive rust has not gone out, nor through fire. Your filthiness is detestable, for I desired to cleanse you, but you are not cleansed from your impurities; nor will you be cleansed until I have made my indignation rest upon you. I, the Lord, have spoken: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not pass by, nor spare, nor have mercy. According to your ways and your doings I have judged you, says the Lord. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, saying: Son of man, write down the name of this day, for on this day the king of Babylon has exerted his strength against Jerusalem from this very day, and speak a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Set the pot, set it on, and also pour water into it; gather the pieces into it, every good piece, thigh and shoulder; fill it with choice bones. Take the choicest of the flock, and pile up the bones underneath it; let it boil well, and let the bones be cooked in the midst of it. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: O city of blood, the pot in which rust is, and rust has not come out of it: by its parts it has brought it forth; the lot has not fallen upon it, because its blood is in the midst of it. On a bare rock I have set it; I have not poured it out on the ground, that it may be covered with dust. That it may rise up in fury for vengeance, I have set its blood on the bare rock, that it may not be covered. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Woe to the city of bloodshed! I will also make the pile of wood great. I will kindle the fire, so that flesh may be consumed and bones may be burned. I will set the city on fire and burn it completely. Its copper will become hot to melt, and its impurity will be consumed in its midst, and its rust will be eliminated. Its rust will be humbled and there will be no more great rust. Its impurity and contamination have brought you low, because you have not been cleansed from your impurity. And what will happen if you are not cleansed beyond until I fulfill my fury in you? I, the Lord, have spoken, and it will come to pass; I will not delay, nor will I have pity, nor will I relent. According to your ways and according to your deeds I will judge you, says the Lord God. Therefore I will judge you according to your blood and according to your thoughts; you are unclean and vile, and exceedingly provocative. ** Most of these additions are from Theodotion, and the Hebrew word Zemma (), for which we have interpreted as abominable uncleanness. And that which has been added by them, which is not contained in Hebrew, and should be noted with an obelus: Therefore I will judge you according to your blood, and I will judge you according to your thoughts, unclean and infamous, and excessive to provoke. Let us then speak about each one. In the ninth year of the captivity of King Jehoiachin (for in the fifth year he began to prophesy) and in the tenth month of the same ninth year, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Ezekiel, who was in the region of Babylon, and He said to him: Son of man, write down this very day for yourself, and know that today the king of Babylon has begun to besiege Jerusalem in the region of Judah, and to fortify it with an army; and describe this siege by means of a parable and a proverb, which in this present place signifies a metaphor and a translation. He said, 'Put a bronze pot, that is, a cauldron, and fill it with water, and cut up the bodies of the fattest animals into pieces, both the thigh and the leg and the arm, and carefully separate the flesh from the bones, and after putting the meat in the cauldron, put the bones under or arrange them around the cauldron, and make layers, and piles of bones, so that the boiling of the cauldron may bubble up not once, but frequently, and the meat may be cooked thoroughly inside, and the bones may be solidified below by the fire.' But you, O prophet, wish to know who this pot is, or what kind of flesh or bone it may be? Speak these things, says the Lord God: Woe to the city of blood, that is Jerusalem, to the pot whose rust, that is excessive wickedness, is in it, and though fire is placed under it, its rust has not gone out from it. For they have persisted, even the captives and the crucified ones, in their former wickedness. Consume it in parts and individually, let no one remain safe. The fate did not fall upon her so that some would perish, and others would be saved, but a universal destruction came upon all. For her blood, that is, her murders, and the deaths of her sons, are in the midst of her. She poured out this blood upon the clearest rock, so that it would be evident to all, and the earth would not cover it with dust: for my indignation would not pass, but my vengeance would hasten upon the most exposed blood. For it is natural that if blood is poured onto the earth, the ground would absorb the moisture of the blood, or gradually be covered by the earth and dust. But when blood is spilled over a very clear rock with no cavity, it flows and occupies a wide seat. This indicates that it has committed not hidden, but public murders, according to what is said to Cain: The blood of your brother cries out to me (Gen. IV, 10): therefore say to the city, not of one blood, but of many bloods: Behold, I will make a great pyre in you, or I will raise a tower, which the common people call a bonfire, and I will burn not only soft and tender flesh in you, but also the hardest bones in such a way that nothing remains in you that is not consumed by fire. And when both the flesh and bones have been consumed and burned, place the empty cauldron on hot coals, so that the brass may also heat up and be consumed, and with the brass consumed, may its rust also perish, that is, may it be burned with the city's fire and may wickedness perish with the city. But what profit is there in having done what was commanded? Not even through fire could the rust and wickedness of the cauldron, and of the city, be removed; but it remains in that impure and abominable state: for this is what the token signifies. And he directed his anger against the city itself, that is, against the city itself. I wanted to cleanse you, but you have not cleansed yourself from your filth, and you will not be able to be cleansed until I have fully vented my anger upon you. I am the Lord, and my judgment cannot be ignored. The siege of the city is now upon you, and I will do what I have threatened: I will not pass by your crimes as I have often done in the past. I will not spare you any longer, and I will not be appeased even if you multiply your prayers. Instead, I will repay you for your ways and your inventions. Indeed, I will judge you according to your deeds and your thoughts, so that in this also I may show my mercy, like a physician who does not spare rotten flesh in order to save healthy limbs. He does not spare in order to spare; he is cruel in order to show pity; he does not consider the patient's pain, but the health of the wound, according to the Gospel saying that he would rather one member be lost than the whole body perish (Matthew 5). It should also be noted how from the beginning of the prophecy until the present day, when Jerusalem began to be besieged, the captivity comes in order. First the sword is drawn; then two paths are set, one leading to Jerusalem, for which the lot falls to Nebuchadnezzar; silver is melted in the city, as well as bronze, tin, lead, and iron; the land is not watered, but occupied by thorns: afterwards, under the name of the two sisters Oolla and Oolibah, the sins of Samaria and Jerusalem are told, how the former was captured, and the latter to be captured. At the end of the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Ezechiel and those with him were put into captivity, having surrendered themselves with king Jechoniah. It is shown on what day the city began to be besieged, and a representation of a pot is set up; just as the flesh and bones piled up in the pot are burned by fire, so the whole city will perish with its inhabitants, and none of those who are besieged will remain, but they will be consumed by hunger, sword, and pestilence, and the remaining part will be led captive to Babylon. Could this same prophecy also pertain to the time of the Lord's passion, for which Jerusalem was surrounded by an army and its children were killed, and Tito, the son of Vespasian, laid siege to it, and no one escaped for safety, and the temple was destroyed; and after fifty years, under Hadrian, the city was consumed by eternal fire? But when Ezekiel beheld this present captivity in Babylon, and Jeremiah sets forth in the beginning of his volume, 'What do you see, Jeremiah?' And he answering, said, A boiling pot, and its face from the face of the north. (Jeremiah 1:13). There are those who, according to tropology, transfer the whole passage to the end of the world (or age), and the number nine, which signifies punishment and sufferings in holy scripture, and always follows justice, they temper with the mercy of the tenth month and the tenth day. For this reason, punishments are inflicted on the sick, so that health may follow pain. Therefore, the world which is situated in evil (1 John 5:19) will be set ablaze by the divine fire of judgment; and the city of blood will be placed upon the coals of fire, so that what is written in Isaiah may be fulfilled: 'You have coals of fire, sit upon them; they shall be a help to you' (Isaiah 47:14). And this is difficult to understand, how both the coals and the bones will be consumed, with which even the Pharisees are filled, about whom the Lord speaks in the Gospel: 'Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, who are like whitewashed sepulchers; which inside are full of uncleanness and dead men's bones' (Matthew 23:27), unless it be said that the rust and filth of the world will not be consumed, but evil will remain even after the severity of judgment. It is easily solved, if we understand the Apostle's statement: God has concluded all under sin, that he may have mercy upon all (Galatians 3:22). For the creature is subject to vanity (Romans 8:28). And the blood that was shed on the face of all creation is presented, that the crimes of all may be revealed. But we can receive the purest rock, and the Lord Savior, who followed the people of Israel in the wilderness, of whom it is written: They drank of the spiritual rock that followed them: and that rock was Christ (1 Corinthians 10:4): that in him all things may be revealed; and that which is written may be fulfilled: There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed. And he says that the Lord does not have mercy, nor overlook the sins of the world; nor spare the wicked, nor be appeased, so that the ways of the wicked may perish, according to what is placed at the end of the first psalm: And the way of the wicked will perish.

Sigh in silence, you shall not mourn for the dead. Your turban shall be on your head, and your sandals shall be on your feet; you shall not cover your lips nor eat the bread of mourners. Therefore, I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening. And I did in the morning as I was commanded. And the people said to me: Why don't you tell us what these things mean, which you are doing? And I said to them: The word of the Lord came to me, saying: Speak to the house of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will defile my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and the longing of your soul, and your sons and daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword. And you will do as I have done: you will not cover your heads with a veil, and you will not eat the food of mourners. You will have crowns on your heads and sandals on your feet. You will not weep or cry, but you will waste away in your iniquities, and each one will groan to his brother. And Ezekiel will be a sign to you; according to all that he has done, so you will do. And you will know that I am the Lord God. And you, son of man, behold, on the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, and the desire of their eyes, their sons and daughters. In that day, when the one fleeing comes to you to announce it to you, on that day, I say, your mouth will be opened together with the one fleeing, and you will speak and not be silent any longer, and you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the Lord. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, behold, I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke (or in preparation); you shall not mourn or weep, and tears shall not come to you, the groaning of blood, the mourning of the kidneys. Your hair will be bound up on you, and your shoes on your feet; you will not console yourself on their lips, and you will not eat the bread of men. I spoke to the people in the morning, as I was commanded, and in the evening my wife died, and I did in the morning as I was commanded. And the people said to me: do you not tell us what these things are that you are doing? And I said to them, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Say to the house of Israel, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will defile my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and the souls of your beings whom you spare. Your sons and daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword, and you will do as I have done. You will not be comforted by their mouth, and you will not eat the bread of men, and your hair will be on your heads, and your shoes on your feet. You will not weep nor mourn, and you will be consumed by your iniquities, and each one will comfort his brother, and Jezechiel will be a sign to you. According to all that he has done, you will do. And when these things come, you will know that I am the Lord Adonai. And you, son of man, on the day when I take away their strength, the pride of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and their soul's delight, their sons and daughters. On that day the one who has been saved will come to you to announce it in your ears. On that day your mouth will be opened to the one who has escaped, and you will speak and not be silent anymore, and you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the Lord. Above the pots and pans, the burning of the olive oil, had shown the siege of the city, now taken and destroyed, and the whole people either killed by the sword, or led into captivity, the prophetic speech testifies. And first, according to our custom, let us lay the foundations of the history. Son, he said, behold, I will take away from the sight of your eyes whatever is desirable to you, and I will take it away in a stroke, or, as the Septuagint renders it, in preparation: so that you may prepare yourself for not doing those things which are accustomed to be done in mourning. Do not cry, nor will you weep, nor will flowing tears reveal the pain of your heart: but if perhaps you are overcome by excessive sorrow, keep your groaning silent, nor let it burst forth into words. You will not make a lamentation for the dead, or, as LXX suggests, groaning is the shedding of blood, lamentation is the affliction of the kidneys. By which he indicates that his wife is about to die. For immediately after he says: And my wife died in the evening (Prov. XIX); which properly pertains to the conjunction of the kidneys. For nothing is more lovable to a man than a good wife, who is provided by God for him and joined to him by the Lord's law, and with her alone his body becomes one. And what follows, 'Let your crown be bound around you, and let your shoes be on your feet,' signifies this: You shall have hair that is cut in mourning, and shoes on your feet, which mourners are accustomed to cast off. Hence, even David, fleeing from Absalom his son and repenting of the death of Uriah, walks with bare feet (1 Samuel 12:15, 18). The Hebrews say that the Babylonian teachers, who observe the precepts of the Law, write the Ten Commandments on small parchments and bind them around their heads, and these are what they are commanded to keep before their eyes and hang on their foreheads, so that they always see the precepts. And because Ezekiel was a priest, he should not at all remove the crown of glory from his head, but have it bound. This is what they said. But we, according to the Septuagint, understand the crown of hair to be the hair: although even their interpretation did not accurately express the meaning of the Hebrew language. And she said, 'You shall neither cover your face with a veil, nor eat the foods of mourners, which are accustomed to be made in mourning, to cover the face, and which the Greeks call περίδειπνα, let them receive from the comforters. I spoke,' she said, 'to the people in the morning, the things which the Lord had commanded me, and in the evening my wife, the desire of my eyes, and the mourning of my loins and blood, died. And immediately on the next day in the morning, I did all the things which had been commanded to me: and the people asked me why I had acted contrary to the custom of all.' To those who were inquiring about the causes of such great patience, I replied: The word of the Lord that was spoken to me, to speak to the people of Israel, commanded me to say these things: Behold, I, that is, will now defile my sanctuary, so that the temple may be burned and made open to all foreigners and profane people, and in which you had pride, that is, confidence and hope and desire for your salvation, and over which your souls were fearing siege; and I will also destroy with the sword the sons and daughters that famine and pestilence have made for you. Whatever I have done, you will do. When custom is observed in mourning, the pain is moderate; but when such a great necessity of evils comes upon us that the mourning is greater than all weeping, each person, troubled by their own need, does not groan over the miseries of others, however close they may be. 'You will do nothing,' he says, 'that used to be done in mourning: but with the city and temple set on fire, you will be astonished at the magnitude of the calamities. You will not be stunned, nor will you walk with bare feet, nor will you lament, nor will you cover your faces with garments, nor will you take food from those who would console you: but you will waste away, and you will be consumed by your injustices, and you will hardly have the freedom to groan, lest you offend the pride of the conquerors, if you are seen to weep in public; so that the prophet Ezekiel may be a portent to you, and that you may not do all the things that he did not do at the death of his wife, in the destruction of the city and temple. And yet more clearly: 'Oh,' he says, 'son of man, at the time when I take away from them their strength, the confidence and joy of the temple, as we have said, and the desire in which their souls find rest, and moreover their sons and daughters, as is implied in the preceding words, when I take away all these things from them, at that time, when someone comes to you fleeing from Jerusalem or who has escaped, saying that the city is laid waste, then you, who were previously silent and had no freedom to sigh, and who showed such great patience that even in the murder of your wife and the pain in your loins, you did not shed a tear, you will open your mouth and speak, not to the one who has come but with him, so that whatever you had foretold about the future, he may now report as fulfilled, and you will no longer keep silent; but you will accuse them and say that all these things have happened justly to them: so that you may be a sign to them, according to what is written in Zechariah: 'They are signs of men who will be prophets' (Zech. 3:8). And the Lord speaks elsewhere: 'I have spoken through the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and by the hands of the prophets I have been likened.' (Hosea 12:10) Let these things be said by way of history. Let us come to the spiritual interpretation (if it has not been thought too violent for the cautious prudence of the reader). That the Son of Man is called the Lord and Savior, there is no doubt, who in the last hour, that is, at the evening of this world, lost his former wife, and did not weep for her, nor did he cover his face with a veil, nor did he receive any consolation from men. And in the morning he foretold these things that would come, which were fulfilled in the evening, and again in the morning, in his second coming, he proved to be true what he had foretold would come: that the sanctuary of the Jews, and what they had desired in their eyes, and on which their souls trembled, had been polluted, and also that their sons and daughters had been slain by the Roman sword. But when it is said, 'You will have a crown on your heads and sandals on your feet,' we will refer that to the fact that they should never mourn or take on signs of mourning, for they have received the truth instead of shadows and have become Nazarenes. And each one will console their brother, just as God the Father strengthened Ezekiel to be a sign for them, foretelling things to come. And after Jerusalem has been destroyed and the temple burned, and the whole world has heard of this and the dispersion of Israel, which inhabits the ends of the earth, then the words of the Lord, when the work is complete, will have freedom. And with his sanctuary defiled, the Law fulfilled or destroyed according to the western interpretation, the glory of the Gospel will be revealed, and Israel will recognize that he is the Lord and God, who foretold these things in the morning and saw them fulfilled in the evening and at the consummation of the world, proving his coming.

Book Eight

What benefits our dictation of the prophets is the judgment of God and the conscience of those who, setting aside declamations and applause and the artistry of words, desire to know what their speech either narrates of the past, accuses of the present, or predicts of the future. In the meantime, it benefits us: for while we are doing this and thinking of nothing else, we undertake explanations in a manner of theft, and we compensate for the miseries of days with the study of nights. The mind is nourished and forgets the calamities of the world, which groans and labors in the extreme end and gives birth, until he who restrains is taken out of the way and the feet of the once iron statue are crushed by the fragility of clay fingers (2 Thessalonians 2). The world falls, and an upright neck does not bend. Wealth perishes, and greed never ceases. People hasten to gather, in order to occupy again what others have taken. Tears have dried up, all piety has been taken away. Many beg, few give. We are not ashamed, preferring poverty with a cheap cloak, to lie in the lap of Croesus's riches; and to guard with our treasures the famine and destruction of many, just as that rich man dressed in purple, who Scripture testifies did nothing else, for his plunder and injustices had no limit: He did not even order to give the scraps that are thrown to the dogs to Lazarus lying before his door and half-dead. Now, how many Lazarus's lie, and how many are protected by purple robes of different colors, which, when they are no longer for their own use, they preserve! This, virgin of Christ Eustochium, let it be spoken from the abundance of the heart, and let us say a little more freely than is fitting for our humility. But the eighth book in the book of Ezekiel, which contains the rebuke of the sons of Ammon and the other nations, and the prophecy of things to come, will have this beginning.


<h2 id='tocuniq246'>(Chap. XXV.)</h2>

Chapter 25: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face against the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against them. And you shall say to the sons of Ammon: Hear the word of the Lord God! Thus says the Lord God: Because you said, 'Aha!' over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was laid waste, and over the house of Judah when they went into exile, therefore behold, I am giving you to the people of the East for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in you and make their dwellings in you. They shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk. I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the land of the Ammonites a fold for flocks. Then you will know that I am the Lord. Because the Lord God says these things: Because you clapped your hands, and stomped your feet, and rejoiced with all your heart (or insulted with all your soul) over the land of Israel; therefore (Vulgate adds behold) I will stretch out my hand against you, and deliver you to be plundered by the nations, and I will kill you from the peoples, and I will destroy you from the lands, and I will crush you, and you will know that I am the Lord. When Jerusalem was captured or besieged, after it came to Babylon, whoever could (or had the power to) escape, and he reported that the city was about to be captured very soon, or that the temple had been destroyed, according to the custom of all the prophets against the other surrounding nations, who insulted the ruins of Jerusalem, and the burning of the temple, the prophetic message turns, firstly against the sons of Ammon, who had a metropolis called Rabbath, which today is named Philadelphia by King Ptolemy of Egypt, also known as Philadelphus, who held both Arabia and Judah. Son, he says, of man, set your face against the sons of Ammon, who are descended from Lot, and say to them: Thus says the Lord God (for these are not the words of a prophet, but of the Lord. Concerning the hardening of the face, we have argued more fully in this same prophecy): Because you have said, 'Aha, Aha,' or have insulted and rejoiced because my temple and sanctuary have been defiled by the invasion of enemies, and over the land of Israel, which has been devastated, and especially over the house of Judah, that is, the two tribes that are now in captivity: therefore I will give you over to the sons of Edom, whom we interpret as the Easterners. There is no doubt, Madianites, that they border the entire wilderness of the land of Arabia, who have herds of camels, and multitudes of sheep and goats, and they sustain themselves with these resources. This is also narrated in the book of Judges (Judg. VI) about what happened to the land of Israel when the Midianites came and devoured all their regions up to Gaza. Metaphorically, therefore, by the term Midianites, it signifies the Ishmaelites and Hagarites, who are now called Saracens, taking for themselves the false name of Sarah so that they may appear to be born of a noble and mistress lineage. Scripture also says about king Nebuchadnezzar and his entire army that they come and capture the city of Rabbath, which either has this name specifically or because of its greatness. For Rabbath is said to be the greatest. And so that we do not doubt that Nebuchadnezzar overthrew Arabia after Jerusalem was captured, Scripture testifies above: And thou, son of man, set thee two ways, Ammon and Jerusalem, and there shall come the sword of the king of Babylon. And again: At the head of the city's way he shall cast it, and thou shalt set up a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and to the fortified Jerusalem (Above, XXI, 19, 20). And again, thus says the Lord God to the sons of Ammon, and to their reproach (verse 28). Therefore, the sons of Kedem will come and set up their tents like shepherds, and they will pitch their tents. They will destroy your crops and drink the milk and abundance of the land, with herds of camels and all the peoples, so that the sons of Ammon will be in the dwelling place of cattle and understand the necessity of evil, that it is the Lord himself who foretold the future and commanded it to be. And this was not enough for the Ammonites, that they insulted and said, 'Hurrah, hurrah for the temple and sanctuary of the Lord, which was defiled by the entrance of various nations'; but such was the wickedness of their insults that the whole people clapped their hands and stamped their feet, and with all their heart cried out: because the land of Israel was desolate. Therefore, not by angels, nor by other ministries, but by the Lord himself, extending his hand to strike, will he hand it over to plunder, not to camels and sheep herds, but more clearly to the nations, so that it may be completely eradicated from the number of peoples, and perish, and be reduced to nothingness: and after it has been crushed, then it will understand that he himself is the Lord who judges all things, and has power over all lands. We can understand the sons of Ammon according to the tropology, who were born from Lot in the cave, both born in drunkenness and incest, all heretics, of whom the Scripture and the Apostle John say: They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would have remained with us (John 2:19). For they arose from inclination, for this is how Lot is translated into our language: For all have turned aside, together they have become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one (Psalm 14:3). Opposite to these, the prophetic face is set or hardened, in order to crush them with its severity, and it says to them: Because you have insulted my Church in the time of persecution, because my sanctuary was defiled by the fault of various people, either by those who served me, or by the cruelty of the enemies who persecuted me: and also the land of Israel, which saw the sense of God, is desolate of the choir of virtues; and how the children of the house of Judah, that is, those who confess God, in which true faith and right confession exist, were led into captivity and ceased serving the Lord: therefore, O all who insult, you will be handed over to the children of the East who have come from the true light, and you will be handed over as an inheritance, so that you too may learn to confess the Lord. And by way of translation it is said that the sons of the East will place their dwellings upon them, and pitch their tents, and drink milk, and eat fruit, and the city which was once full of pride will become a dwelling place for camels, so that they, having set aside the burden of sins, may enter through the eye of a needle (Matthew 19), and into the fold of the animals, which are guided by a good shepherd (John 10), so that when they have done this, mixed and handed over to the shepherds of the East, they may understand that he himself is the Lord. And again he reproached them, for insulting with excessive affection of the heart the ruins of the people of God, and for thinking that the land of Israel was completely deserted. For this they deserve the hand of God's avenger, as they had exceeded the limit of rejoicing and joy over the destruction of the house of Judah. They should by no means be delivered to the sons of the East, but be for plundering by all nations, and be killed and perish, and be crushed, and by no means be considered descendants of Abraham, but be believed to be for all nations. And then they shall know the magnitude of their evils, and their own contrition, and the killing of the people, that He Himself is the Lord. What we have understood in general about the Church can be understood about each of the saints, whose ruin the people of the world and the powers of the enemy rejoice in if they have lost their chastity for a long time: while the wicked think that they find comfort in their sins if they have more partners in crime and punishment: and no one does this, unless they are a son of Ammon, that is, a son of the people, who is born in a decline.


<h2 id='tocuniq247'>(Vers. 8 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 8 onwards) This is what the Lord God says: Because Moab and Seir have said, 'Look, just like all the other nations, the house of Judah is also ours,' therefore I will expose Moab's shoulder, including its cities, with the renowned land of Beth Jesimoth, Beelmeon, and Kariathaim. I will give it to the people of the East along with the Ammonites as their inheritance, so that the Ammonites will no longer be remembered among the nations. I will also execute judgments against Moab, and they will know that I am the Lord. LXX: Thus says the Lord God: Because Moab and Seir said, 'Behold, the house of Judah is like all the other nations.' Therefore, behold, I will open up the shoulder of Moab from the cities of its coastline, the choice land, the house of Beth Jasimuth, on the spring of the coastal city. I have given the sons of the East as an inheritance to the sons of Ammon, so that the sons of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations. And I will execute vengeance upon Moab, and they shall know that I am the Lord. What we have interpreted and added from the edition of Theodotion is not found in the Septuagint. But the Hebrews tell a ridiculous fable in this place. After the city was opened and the temple was unlocked, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Seir entered the temple and saw the Cherubim protecting the propitiatory, and they said: Just as all nations worship idols, so Judah also has idols of its own religion; and therefore, they say, the Lord is angry and has delivered them into captivity. But we shall say this, that they also insulted the house of Judah when it was captured by the Chaldeans, thinking that, as in the case of other nations, there was no divine help there, and therefore the kingdom of Judah and the city of Jerusalem, deprived of God's protection, fell under the power of Babylon. Therefore, not long afterwards, but at present, the Lord threatens that he will destroy or open his strong and fortified cities in Moab, so that even the victorious Babylonians might enter them, and the cities in Moab might cease to exist, and the famous cities in its borders and territories might be destroyed: among which he names Beth Jeshimoth, and Beelmeon, and Kiriathaim: for which, I don't know what reason, the Septuagint translators rendered them as the house of Beth Iasimuth, though this word signifies a deserted village; and Beelmeon is still today a very large town in Moab, which they translated as "over the spring," and Kiriathaim, a coastal city; and it is handed down, together with the sons of Ammon, the sons of the East, to the Babylonians, namely, according to that interpretation which we have presented against the sons of Ammon. And I will give, he says, Moab as an inheritance, that just as there is no more memory of the sons of Ammon among the nations, so I will also execute vengeance and judgment on Moab, so that they will know that I am the Lord, who delivered Judah because of sin, and I will be an avenger against the sons of Ammon and Moab. However, Moab, which is interpreted as 'from the father,' and Seir, which is turned into hairy and rough, despises and scorns the house of Judah, in which true confession resides, and thinks that it can be easily overthrown, just as the fortifications of other cities are overthrown. And the Lord threatens to open himself up, or to dissolve all the strength of the Moabites, so that they may cease to have cities and may not at all trust in the art of dialectic. But all those boundaries, which they call headlands for the purpose of deceiving the waves, shall be destroyed; and the famous and chosen land of Beth Jesimoth, which means the house of solitude and desert, and Beelmeon, which also means having a spring, or above a spring, and Cariathaim, which the 70 translated as a maritime city, shall perish. For although they may have the strength of warriors, and may proceed to battle with the art of fighting, and may march surrounded and fortified on every side: nevertheless, their famous land is not a home of habitation, but a home of solitude. And what they think they have, a source of knowledge, and a maritime city, which can withstand all the storms of the world, promising patience and fortitude to themselves: yet they will be converted there, so that they may be handed over to the sons of the East, the true light in Christ; just as the sons of Ammon were handed over, who trusted themselves in a heretical multitude. And let us consider the progress and, in the very act of punishment, the mercy of God, so that the sons of Ammon, the sons of the East, may be delivered into inheritance. And let no heresy be named among the nations. But let them come to know, at the end of things, through the judgments and punishments for their arrogance, that the Lord is the one who governs all. Now, in order to prove that the current place of the Moabites is above the pride of the philosophers, about whom it is said: 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart' (1 Corinthians 1:19), a few examples from the prophets need to be repeated. Amos speaks: Thus says the Lord: Against three crimes of Moab, and against four I will not revoke it, because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into ashes (Amos II, 1). Indeed, whatever is of perverse teachings in the world, whatever pertains to earthly knowledge, and is considered to be strong, is subverted by the art of dialectic and dissolved like fire into ashes and embers, in order to prove that which was thought to be the strongest is nothing. But Isaiah rebukes the pride of Moab, saying: We have heard the pride of Moab: he is exceedingly proud; his pride is taken away (Isa. XVI). Jeremiah also, prophesying against all the nations, speaks directly to Moab: Because you trusted in your fortifications (Jerem. XLVIII, 7). And shortly after: You will have confidence in your glory. And again: How do you say, We are mighty? And then: The day of Moab is near, and his malice is exceedingly swift (Ibid. 14, 10). And more plainly: Declare how the glorious staff is broken, the rod of majesty (Ibid., 20). And again: The horn of Moab is broken. But these things are said so that under the name of Moab, the foolishness of the world, exalting itself to heaven, may be shattered by pride.

<h2 id='tocuniq248'>(Vers. 12, 13, seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 12, 13, et seqq.) Thus says the Lord God: Because Edom has acted vengefully against the children of Judah and has incurred guilt by taking vengeance upon them, therefore thus says the Lord God: I will stretch out my hand against Edom and cut off from it man and beast. I will make it a desolation from Teman, and Dedan shall fall by the sword. I will execute my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath, and they shall know my vengeance, declares the Lord God. LXX: Thus says the Lord God: Because Edom acted revengefully against the house of Judah and took vengeance upon them with utmost hatred, therefore thus says the Lord God, I will stretch out my hand against Edom, and cut off from it man and beast, and I will make it desolate; from Teman even to Dedan they shall fall by the sword. And I will execute vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath, and they shall know my vengeance, says the Lord God. Above, the two proposed, for what they said about Moab and Seir, and later in silence about Seir, spoke only against Moab: now it refutes the problem that Seir, that is, Edom, has done. That Esau and Seir, and Edom, and Idumea, and Duma, are called one nation, no one should doubt who has knowledge of the Scriptures. And not to mention the other prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, who prophesied against Idumea, Duma, and Edom: Obadiah directed his entire prophecy against this nation, which we have discussed before as best we could. Therefore Seir is accused, who because he was hairy, received the name 'hairy', and Edom the bloodthirsty, who lost the birthright due to the cooking of a red lentil, and obtained the name from the dish. Also, Esau's actions are interpreted. And it should be known that in Hebrew, Idumaea is never written, but always Edom, which the Greek translation expressed as Idumaea. Therefore, it is not Idumaea (Edom), as Moab spoke, but he took revenge on the sons of Judah: he sinned, or retained the memory of the previous pain, in order to take revenge on them, from whom he was supplanted in the womb. Therefore not through angels, nor through any other: but the Lord himself, stretching out his hand over Idumea, took away from it man and beast, and reduced the cities thereof into a desert, that is, Themam, which we turn towards the south: and of the same city Dedan, there shall be no remains. And they shall know my vengeance and retribution, saith the Lord God: I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to my fury, and according to my wrath, and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord God. Those who act in Edom, or Idumea, according to my anger and fury, to fulfill my indignation, and through the hands of my people Israel, let my wrath rage against the enemy nation, and let them understand that my just vengeance was against the unjust retribution of Idumea, says the Lord Adonai. According to the allegory, this is the meaning that I perceive. Earthly and fleshly Idumea is called, which rises against the spirit, so that we do not do those things which are of the spirit, and it hastens to draw back the soul placed in its midst; and it wants to exact revenge, to which it was previously subjected, on the sons of Judah, and it remembers the ancient pain, which was not of its own power, and therefore sought revenge on those who turned away from the flesh and followed the spirit. Therefore, the Lord Himself, being the avenger of the children of Judah, has stretched out His hand over Edom and has taken away from it both man and beast, whatever it seems to possess of reason or simple faith, in order to reduce it to a wilderness. And He has slain with the sword all of Theman, which means failing, and Dedan, which also signifies kinship, which He has placed in the hand of His people Israel, so that Edom may be overthrown and may feel the anger and fury of the Lord, and may understand that His vengeance has accomplished this, in order to serve the house of Judah. This is that which the Apostle disputes about, writing: Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated (Rom. IX, 13). But Jacob is loved, because he supplants and surpasses the carnal and earthly, and deserves to receive his blessings. For first we live according to the flesh, and afterwards according to the spirit. First vices, then virtues, by which vices are overturned, because the heart of man is inclined towards evil from childhood, and the age of maturity condemns the errors of youth (Genesis VIII). And David also says: Remember not the sins of my youth, and my ignorances. (Ps. 24:7). And yet it should be known that Jacob received the first blessing, Esau the second. And what is said of him at the end, 'You shall be your brother's servant' (Gen. 27:40), signifies that after the flesh is subject to the spirit and united to it, it ceases to be flesh and passes from Edom to Judah.

<h2 id='tocuniq249'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Vers. 15, 16.) Thus says the Lord God: Because the Philistines acted in vengeance, and took revenge with wholehearted malice, and filled ancient enmities; therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will destroy the killers and annihilate the remnants of the coastal region. And I will inflict great vengeance upon them in furious rebukes, and they will know that I am the Lord when I execute my vengeance upon them. LXX: Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because the aliens have committed vengeance and have provoked wrath, insultingly, from the heart, in order to destroy forever; therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the aliens, and I will destroy or kill the Cretans, and I will destroy the remnants of the coastal region, and I will bring upon them great vengeance in the fury of wrath, and they shall know that I am the Lord God when I execute my vengeance upon them. After the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Seir, who themselves are also Edomites, and through Lot and Esau are linked to the people of Israel and the house of Judah by kinship, came to the Philistines, whom the Seventy Translators translated as ἀλλοφύλους, that is, foreigners, not by the general name of all the nations that are not of the Jewish race, but by the specific name of their own race, which is now called Palestine, with the letter P changed to Pi (π) according to the Greek custom, just as we celebrate the Hebrew Phase () in Greek and Latin as Pascha. The Philistines are interpreted as those who fall by the cup, who themselves were intoxicated by the golden cup of Babylon, and they rage and insult with their whole heart, remembering the ancient enmities against old Israel, from whom they were separated from God's people. And when the Lord says, 'Vengeance is mine, and I will repay' (Deuteronomy 32:35), they themselves take revenge by killing and fulfilling the old hatred. On account of this, they will feel the outstretched hand of the Lord above them, which will kill the killers. For this reason, the Cretans, not knowing what they wanted, interpreted the Seventy (LXX), together with Aquila and Symmachus, and Theodotion, the Hebrew word Chorethim (), as either murderers or murder. This was not only said in the present place, but also in Zephaniah where it is said against the Philistines: Gaza will be plundered, and Ashkelon will be laid waste, and Ashdod and Ekron will be uprooted. Woe to the inhabitants of the coast, the inhabitants of Crete, the word of the Lord is against you, O Canaan, land of foreigners, and I will destroy you from your dwelling place, and Crete will become a pasture for shepherds, and a resting place for sheep (Zeph. II, 4 ff.). And here, when the Seventy translated to Crete, the other translators rendered ὄλεθρον (Al. κάῤῥον) as 'interfection' or 'perdition'. About this, in the aforementioned prophet, with God's help, we have said what seemed to us. Hence, the two legions of David, one of which was called Phelethi and the other Cerethi (2 Kings 15), received the name Cherethim (Al. Cherethim), because they would kill and slaughter, that is, the name of the slain. And the Lord will destroy all the remaining parts of the maritime region, which is beaten by the salty (false) waves, and he will not inflict small but great punishments in his anger, so that his anger may have an end to mercy, and after he has taken revenge, rebuking with fury, then the Palestinians will know that he himself is the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq250'>(Chap. XXVI.)</h2>

(Chapter 26) And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, because Tyre (or Sidon) has said of Jerusalem: Aha, the gate of the peoples is broken, it is turned to me, I shall be filled, it has become desolate; therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, Tyre (or Sidon), and I will bring many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves. And they will break down the walls of Tyre, and destroy its towers, and I will sweep away its dust from it, and make it a shining rock. The drying up of the fishing nets will be in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken, says the Lord God, and it will be a plunder to the nations. Also, her daughters in the field will be killed by the sword, and they will know that I am the Lord. Accordingly, the order of prophecies is woven together. He spoke against the sons of Ammon and Moab and Seir, who are also Edomites, and against the Philistines who are on the coast, and who hold the same boundary on the shore of the sea. After the Philistines, the region of Phoenicia follows, whose metropolis is the city of Tyre, which is called Sor in Hebrew and Syriac. And because Jerusalem was captured, it also rejoiced and insulted, saying: The gates of the peoples are broken, I have the safest harbor, and when they are destroyed, all the multitude turns to me, which was ruled by its authority, and because it is deserted, therefore I will be filled, and whatever was full before will be turned into a wilderness. Therefore, because you have spoken these things and insulted the ruins of Jerusalem, which was destroyed by the judgement of God because of its sins, I will not come against you through messengers or through anyone else, but I myself will be against you, Tyre, and I will cause the Babylonians to rise up like the waves of the sea against you, along with many nations, with which the walls and towers of your city will be destroyed to the point where they will fall to the ground and its dust will be scraped off or blown in various directions, and it will be humiliated to the point where it will be compared to the shiniest rocks. And there will be such great desolation in the once most populous city that fishing nets will be spread out a For I, the Lord, have spoken, and my words cannot be made void, and I will deliver them to be plundered by the nations. Also her daughters, who are in the countryside or in the field, that is, on the coast of Phoenicia, cities and towns, villages and castles, will be killed by the sword: metaphorically, because he called them daughters, he puts the killing by the sword, so that they may know by the end of things that I am the Lord, who commanded these things to happen. According to the tropology, since the Hebrew word Sor is translated into distress, every soul that is occupied with disturbances can be called Sor, which, when she sees Jerusalem being overthrown by the judgment of God for her sins and vices, in which the temple and the vision of peace were, she exults and thinks that the once famous empire of the city is to be transferred to herself. And this is also accepted in conflicting doctrines and in worldly men, when they see a holy man fall through negligence and rejoice and exult, as if their own resurrection were the downfall of others. Therefore the Lord threatens that He Himself will fight against such men and cause many nations, like sea waves, to rise up against them, destroying in them everything that seems most fortified and strong, and thus overturning all their arguments, so that they are reduced to dust. He should also cause the nets and fishing equipment by which the multitude was previously deceived to cease, and to be spread out and dried in the deserted soil of the city, so that other fishermen may take their place, whom the Lord has sent to fish. Moreover, he should cause his daughters, who were previously kept as if in a bridal chamber and were not easily believed by anyone in mystical and more secret teachings, to go forth and be extended in public, and to be cut down with the sword of the Church, so that they may understand that He himself is the Lord, who both temporarily left Jerusalem on account of its sins and destroyed the defenses of Tyre on account of its insolence and joy.


<h2 id='tocuniq251'>(Vers. 6 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 6 onward.) For thus says the Lord: Behold, I will bring against Tyre (or against you, O Tyre) Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, from the north, the king of kings, with horses, and chariots, and horsemen, and a great gathering of people. He will kill your daughters in the field with the sword, and he will surround you with fortifications, and he will build up a siege mound against you, and he will lift up a shield against you, and he will temper vineyards, and rams (or spears), against your walls, and he will destroy your towers in his armor. The inundation of his horses will cover you with their dust; your walls will shake at the sound of the horsemen, chariots, and wheels. When he enters your gates, they will be broken down as if by the entrance of a ravaged city (or as if entering a city from the field). His horses will trample all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your noble statues will fall to the ground (or the wealth of your strength will be brought down to the ground). They will plunder your wealth, destroy your businesses, and tear down your walls. They will overthrow your magnificent houses and throw your stones, wood, and dust into the midst of the waters. I will silence the multitude of your singers and the sound of your harps will no longer be heard. And I will make you a very clear (or shining) rock. You will be the drying up of the snares, and you will not be built up any longer, because I have spoken, says the Lord God. I have joined together the two editions according to custom, and I have joined together from the side those things in which they disagree, providing brevity of volumes. Therefore, what he had said, I will make many nations ascend to you as the fluctuating sea ascends, and Tyre will be a plunder for the nations, then it makes it more evident that the Lord will bring King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon from the North, the king of kings, with horses and chariots, and with an infinite multitude of armies, who will first overturn the cities and fortresses subject to Tyre on the seashore, and afterwards will cause Tyre to be besieged, and he will attack it with an army, and with a wall, and with fortifications, and with ropes, and with battering rams and destroy the walls, and his cavalry will be such a multitude that the foundations of the city will be moved by the dust of the cavalry and the sound of the howling army, and the noise of the wheels and the neighing of the horses, and thus he will enter the city with the walls scattered, as if he were entering safely from the field, and there will be such security for the conquering army that the hooves of the horses will trample the streets of Tyre and all the people in the middle of the city will fall down, and the once noble statues or all the substance will fall to the ground, and none of the former riches will be preserved in the captured city, but even the noble houses will be destroyed along with the walls, and the cruelty of the victors will be so great that the remaining wood and stones that were burned will be thrown into the middle of the sea, and either Nebuchadnezzar or the Lord himself will cause all the joy of the city to cease, which used to resound in songs and psalms, and even the ground will be dried up. And what follows: You shall not be built up any more, seems to raise the question of how it is that we see today the most noble and beautiful city of Phoenicia, Tyre, which was not built thereafter. But how can they maintain that Tyre will suffer these things in the final time, if afterwards it is not to be built? But how can they preserve the person of Nebuchadnezzar, especially since we read in the following passages that Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre, and did not receive the reward of his labor, and therefore Egypt was delivered to him because he served the purposes of God in the siege of Tyre? They say that the Greeks and Phoenicians, especially Nicolaus of Damascus, and others among the Barbarians who contradict this history, have read histories and found nothing about the siege of the city of Tyre by the Chaldeans, even though we can prove that many things are said in the Scriptures that are not found in Greek volumes; and we should not acquiesce to their authority, whose treachery and lies we detest. Therefore, what is said, 'you shall be no more,' can be understood to mean that the queen of nations will no longer exist, nor will she have her own sovereignty, as she had under Hiram and other kings; but she will be subject either to the Chaldeans, or the Macedonians, or the Ptolemies, and finally to the Roman kings. But there is no doubt that by anagoge, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon who came from the North, is understood to be the devil, who, although he is a very harsh and adverse wind, is called by the name of the right hand, presuming for himself the dignity of the name. He is the king of kings and of all kingdoms, which he shows to the Lord, and he said to him: All these things have been given to me, and I will give them to you if you fall down and worship me (Matthew 4:9). He has horses and chariots, of which it is written: The deceitful horse is for salvation (Psalm 32:17). And: All those who mounted the horses fell asleep (Ps. LXXV). And in another place: He threw the horse and rider into the sea (Exod. XV, 1). This man kills the daughters of Tyre, souls placed in distress and in a certain prison of sin, in the wide field and countryside, and surrounds Tyre with his fortifications, so as to hold her captive, and no one from the kingdom of Babylon can escape his rule. He will destroy the walls and topple the towers, and whatever he had by way of doctrines, he will shake in terror with the onslaught of his horses, the sound of the riders' horses and chariots, and he will enter her gates without any hindrance, and the streets of the city: For wide and spacious is the way that leads to destruction (Matth. VII, 13), his horses' hooves will trample, and all the substance or noble statues, with which they fashioned false images for themselves, about which it is written: O Lord, you will scatter their images in your city (Ps. LXXII, 20), he will cast down to the ground, and with the walls destroyed, even the noble houses that he prepared for himself will be overthrown, in which he rejoiced, and he will come to such great desolation, that its stones and the wood with which he built the walls, and the cement he made, will be cast into the depths, and his songs and music, on which he relied in the wisdom of this world, and every sound of the lyres will no longer be heard, and his fishing will cease, and he will be made low, like the drying of reeds, and will no longer be rebuilt, because according to the judgment of the Lord, Nabuchodonosor has been utterly destroyed, as the Apostle also says: I have handed them over to Satan, so that they may learn not to blaspheme (I Tim. I, 20). The places are difficult, and the wise and diligent reader should forgive my effort. Or if he can find something better, I will adopt his opinion: provided he knows the leniency he will grant me, and that he will receive it from others.

<h2 id='tocuniq252'>(Vers. 15 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 and following) Thus says the Lord God to Tyre: Shall not the rumble of your downfall, and the groaning of your slain, when they are killed in your midst, shake the islands? And all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, and they will take off their robes and cast aside their embroidered garments; they will put on sackcloth and sit on the ground, and they will tremble with horror at you. They will raise a lament over you and say to you: How you have perished, you renowned city, you were mighty in the sea with your inhabitants, who were feared by all. Now the ships will be astonished on the day of your terror, and the islands in the sea will be troubled, because no one will go out from you. LXX: For thus says the Lord God, Sister. Will not your wounded ones groan at the sound of your downfall, when the sword is drawn in your midst? The islands will shake, and all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, and they will take off their crowns, and they will be stripped of their various garments. They will go insane with fury: they will sit on the ground, and they will fear their own destruction, and they will groan over you, and they will take up a lamentation for you, and they will say to you: How you have perished and been scattered in the sea, praised city, which was strong in the sea itself, and its inhabitants, who each gave their fear to all its inhabitants? And the islands will fear on the day of your downfall, and the islands will be troubled in the sea at your departure. First, let us unfold the words of the story itself, briefly opening the meaning of the statements. Thus says the Lord God to Tyre, which is called Sor in Hebrew: Will the islands not be moved on the day of your downfall, when Nebuchadnezzar attacks and you fall, and amid the groaning of the wounded or killed in your midst? And all the kings will descend from their seats or thrones, and the princes of the sea who govern various islands will take off their crowns from their heads, laying aside all the glory of ruling and their most precious garments shining with incredible variety, they will cast them away, and in the greatness of their astonishment they will turn into madness, and being humiliated, they will sit on the ground, and when they see you have fallen, they will fear the same fate for themselves; and they will consider nothing to be everlasting in the goods of the earth; but on the contrary, they will take up a mournful lament and sing a sorrowful song, saying: How you have perished, you who lived (or were praised) in the sea, illustrious city? For we read in the Greek, Latin, and Barbarian histories that Tyre was indeed an island, and that it had no entrance from the land. But later, according to some, it was thrown up with mounds by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of the Chaldeans, or as others affirm, by Alexander, the king of the Macedonians, and a place was prepared for its siege with machines and battering-rams, and the island became a peninsula. Therefore, oh Tyre, oh Sor, who once were the strongest of all islands, praised in the voices of all cities with your inhabitants, whom everyone feared, how suddenly have you fallen? Now the islands will be astonished, or will be afraid over you, and as it is better understood in Hebrew, the ships, on the day of your terror and ruin, and the islands will be troubled in the sea. From this it follows that it is advisable to read the lines above the ships, so that the islands are not placed in a second position; because no one will go out from you, or, as the Seventy translated, on the day of your departure: when you are led captive. These, in the meantime, may be considered as the foundations of a certain story: now let us strive to raise the spiritual pinnacle. Imagine someone, who for a long time preserved their modesty, flourished with many virtues, and then collapsed in some grave and mortal sin: will not all the islands be moved by the sound of their ruin and the destruction of their virtues? Indeed, those who are tossed by the salty and bitter waves of this world. And those who appeared as princes in the filth of this age will descend from their thrones of pride and, humbled, will remove the crowns from their heads, which seemed to possess good works, and they will cast off their various garments of virtue and be cloaked in astonishment or a kind of fear. They will sit on the ground and, astonished by their sudden fall, they will marvel. So much so that all will take up lamentation and mourning over the one who has fallen, and they will say: How have you perished, who were once saved? How you have fallen, you who once stood so tall, who were considered illustrious among all in the sea of this world, who were thought to be strong by everyone. And your inhabitants, that is, the most courageous thoughts, resisting all the fiery arrows of the devil, which were previously feared by all adversaries, have turned to astonishment. But even the ships, all the saints who cross the waves of this world, will be astonished when they see you fall. On the day of your terror and destruction, the islands will be troubled, lest they themselves suffer the same. For the ruins of others serve as examples for the righteous, as we all abide in this weak and feeble state, constantly wavering in this world, and victory is never certain and secure for us: for those who once stood will depart from you; or at your departure; at your end and completion. For we are judged not by the past, but by the present. And care must be taken, and always feared, that it may overthrow ancient glory and solid stability, the storms of a single hour.

<h2 id='tocuniq253'>(Vers. 19 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 19 onwards) Because this is what the Lord (the Vulgate adds God) says: When I make you a desolate city like cities that are uninhabited, and I bring an abyss upon you, and many waters cover you, and I bring you down with those who descend into the pit (or to those who descend into the grave) to the everlasting people, and I place you in the farthest land (or in the depths of the earth) like the ancient wildernesses, with those who are brought down into the pit (or descend into the grave), so that you will not be inhabited, and when I give glory in the land of the living (or so that you will not rise again in the land of the living), I will bring you to nothing (or I will give you destruction) and you will not be, and you will not be sought after (the Vulgate adds anymore) forever, says the Lord God. Join the things that were said with the ones before. When I will hand you over, O Tyre, a city forever desolate, just like other cities that are not inhabited at all, and if I bring upon you the abyss, and many waters cover you, or the infinite multitude of enemies, or certainly the one who speaks to the island and compares the frequency of adversaries in the city established on the island to the waves of the abyss: and if I drag you down with those who descend into the lake, or into the pit, to those who are in hell, of whom we also read in the Psalms: They will enter the lower parts of the earth: they will be delivered into the hands of the sword, the parts of foxes will be (Ps. LXII, 10, 11); to the everlasting people, where there is weeping of eyes, and gnashing of teeth, and I will place you in the last land, where the ancient dragon is established, and like the ancient desolations and deserted places, where there is no remembrance of good things, but eternal punishments, nor will I make you rise again in the land of the living, of which it is written: Blessed are the meek, for they shall possess the land (Matthew V, 4). And in another place: I will please the Lord in the land of the living (Psalm 115:9): then you will be reduced to nothing, or you will perish forever, and you will be no more, according to what is written in another psalm: Leave me, that I may be refreshed before I depart, and I shall be no more (Psalm 39:14). Not that he who is in eternal punishment ceases to exist, but because it is said in the holy scriptures that he who does not live for God does not subsist. Therefore, even Esther speaks against idols, saying: Do not yield your scepter to those who are not (Esther 14). Certainly there were those who begged that it not be handed over; but they were not of God, who had ceased to have virtues and to be alive to God. And this should be noted, that Tyre is sought by the one who comes to seek and save what was lost, and he seeks one stray sheep out of ninety-nine left in the mountains (Luke 19). Also, the woman who had lost one drachma seeks, finds, and calls her neighbors to share in her joy (ibid., 15). But if Tyre is not found, it is not the fault of the one searching, but of the one who has escaped the hand of the good shepherd. And furthermore, it says, 'You will be no more forever;' whether it is written in Hebrew as 'Lolam' or in Greek as 'αἰῶν,' it signifies one age, according to what Isaiah says, who after seventy years declares that Tyre will be restored to its former state. They say, however, that one age, that is, the span of human life, is calculated as seventy years, as the Psalmist says: 'The days of our years, in them are seventy years.' But for those in power, eighty years, whatever is beyond that, is labor and sorrow (Psalm 89:10). We have briefly spoken in a metaphorical sense about Tyre. This can also be understood as referring to those who, in the distress of this world, are led down to the underworld, covered by the abyss of punishment and the waves of torment, and dragged down to the depths of the earth. They are joined with those who are in the ancient desolation, and are led into the lake or eternal pit, so that they are no longer inhabited by the Holy Spirit. Concerning which it is written: When the ungodly falls into the depths of evil, he despises it (Prov. XVIII, 3). They will no longer exist on the land of the living, but will perish and be reduced to nothingness, ceasing to belong to God. These are the testimonies that those who claim the punishments of the wicked, not the sinners, are eternal abuse: those who have sought from God and have not been found, and have ceased to exist forever because they have lost Him who says: I am the life (John XIV, 6).


<h2 id='tocuniq254'>(Chap. XXVII.)</h2>

(Chapter 27.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Therefore, son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre and say to Tyre, which dwells at the entrance of the sea, to the merchant of the peoples to many islands (or from many islands). Thus says the Lord God: If I were to summarize the entire prophecy against Tyre or concerning the lamentation of Tyre in one discourse, it would be lengthy and the meaning would be obscure for the reader; since it is not possible to retain everything in the mind at once, especially regarding the discrepancies between the Hebrew and the Septuagint edition in this place, that is, what they have added or subtracted. Therefore, we will be content with our own interpretation, and wherever there is disagreement, we will unite from the side, leaving the perfect knowledge of all things to God: and we will briefly explain what seems to us in each case. The one who mourns is still a concern to the one he mourns for. Therefore, Samuel wept and mourned for Saul (2 Samuel 15). And the apostle Paul lamented and mourned for those who committed fornication and did not repent (2 Corinthians 12). And Jeremiah writes the Lamentations concerning the destruction of Jerusalem with four alphabets. Therefore, Tyre, or Tyre in entrance-ways, dwells according to the letter: either because it was once an island, or because it receives ships coming from the deep in its safest harbor, and it is a trading place for many nations, or from many islands. Indeed, this continues until today, so that the commerce of nearly all nations is carried out there. But following the interpretation that has been started, let us apply whatever is said about Tyre to the 'constriction,' that is, the narrowness of this world, which is situated in evil and is constricted and beaten by various disturbances as if by waves. This kind of merchants is also described in mystic language in the Psalm: Those who go down to the sea in ships, doing business on the great waters, they have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep (Ps. 107:23-24).

<h2 id='tocuniq255'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) O Tyre, you have said, 'I am of perfect beauty' (or you have said, 'I have surrounded myself with beauty') and situated in the heart of the sea. The first crime of Tyre is if it seems to have any good, to not attribute it to God, but to itself, and to value all the beauty that comes from diverse regions as its own accomplishment and virtue. For it has said, 'I am of perfect beauty' or 'I have surrounded myself with beauty,' although it is situated in the heart, that is, in the middle of the sea, and it moves like an island, and it is tossed and broken by the crashing waves. But as for the heart of the sea, it signifies the middle, and that prophetic speech demonstrates: Therefore we will not fear, when the earth is troubled, and the mountains are carried into the heart of the sea. Their waters have roared and been troubled. But our Lord is also said to descend into the heart of the earth, that is, into the middle, and to the underworld. But true and perfect beauty is found in no one but the body of Christ, which is interpreted as the Church, and is gathered by the virtues of many saints. And he himself speaks to the bride: You are all beautiful, my love, and there is no blemish in you (Canticles 4:7).

<h2 id='tocuniq256'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

(Verse 4, 5.) Your neighbors who built you have filled your beauty. They built you with Sanir fir trees and all the planks of the sea. They brought cedar from Lebanon to make harm to you. For what reason, I do not know, they translated it thus in the Septuagint: The sons of Beelim surrounded your beauty; the cedar of Sanir was built for you; they brought thin cypress planks from Lebanon to make harm to you with fir. For the sermon of Beelim is not found at all in this place among the Hebrews, but it is written in Gebulaic, which means 'your boundaries'. Also, in what they said, your sons were deceived by the ambiguity of the word and the similarity in the scripture, as the same letters are read differently, 'of masons' and 'of sons', Bonaich and Benaich. Therefore, O Tyre, you who said out of arrogance, 'I am of perfect beauty' or 'I have adorned myself with beauty', since you are situated in the midst of the sea, hear how great things have been bestowed upon you by the generosity of God. Your neighbors and bordering people, who are not from distant regions but from neighboring ones, have filled your decoration, and do you think that what is alien is yours? And he speaks as if tropically to a ship, signifying the beauty of the city and the abundance of all things, so that after he has described all the furniture of the ship, the mast, the masts, the oars, the sails, the prow, the keel, the ropes, the covers, the skins, and other things that the use of the best-equipped ships needs: then he announces that a storm and a south wind, by which the largest waves will be stirred up, will come to it, and it will be subject to shipwreck. Through these things, the destruction of the city of Tyre is signified by King Nebuchadnezzar, or, as many believe, by Alexander, the king of Macedon, who is said to have besieged and captured the city itself for six months after defeating Darius in Lycia. According to mystical interpretations, the planks of the Tyrian ship are cut from the fir or cedar trees of Sanir, from which it is woven and constructed, and its mast is made of cedar or cypress from Lebanon: fir or cedar, because of their lightness and the softness of the joints between the planks that hold and bite each other; or cedar, because it is a wood that does not rot. But Sanir is said to mean 'way of the torch'; or as we think more accurately, the tooth of the watchmen, because all the prosperity and illumination of a ship comes from true light. But Sanir is also the mountain itself which is called Hermon, which others call Sanior. Read the history. Lebanon means whiteness or whitening, which also contributes to grace coming from elsewhere.

<h2 id='tocuniq257'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Vers. 6.) They have fashioned oars for your ship from the oak trees of Bashan: they have made your benches out of Indian ivory, and your decks out of the islands of Italy. LXX: They have made your oars and your temples out of the oak trees of Bashan, and they have made for you wild houses out of ivory from the islands of the Kittim. What a beautiful ship it is, and its furnishings, that it has cedar oars, not just any, but from Bashan, and ivory benches, and precious goods are stored in the cellars or warehouses, from the islands of the Kittim, which we refer to as Italy: from that region which is closer to Greece, understanding all the parts of the Western islands. Let us therefore say, according to the spiritual interpretation, that the oars of the Tyrian ship are made from Bazan, of which it is also written in the Psalms: 'The Lord said, I will turn Bazan from the depths of the sea' (Ps. 68:23). Bazan in our language is interpreted as ignominy. Therefore, God converts those who were in the depths of the sea, and the ignominy of sins, and converts them into oars, so that they may navigate with the Apostles and reach the land and the shores; and they become benches of ivory when they mortify their bodies, or when they use their teeth for the praises of God, and storerooms or cellars of the islands of Kittim, which, according to the etymology of the Hebrew language, is translated as 'struck,' so that it may not be so much killed by the blows of the devil as approved. We can speak about the ivory and wild houses of the islands of the Chettiim, which the heretics try to build not in the house of God, but on a Tyrian ship. And they, having their own ivory of language, build temples of God that are contrary to the temple, and wild houses, dwellings of beasts, even though the Scripture says that groves, and woods, and forests should not be planted in the house of God (Deut. XII).

<h2 id='tocuniq258'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) Fine linen woven from Egypt was made into a veil for you, to be placed in a chest. Hyacinth and purple from the isles of Elisha became your covering. LXX: Fine linen woven with variety from Egypt was made into a bedspread for you, to surround you with glory, and to cover you with hyacinth and purple. Your coverings were made from the isles of Elisha. Because Tyre had said, 'I am perfect in beauty,' she is accused of receiving things from various regions, according to the Scripture: 'What do you have that you did not receive?' But if you have received it, why do you boast as if you have not received it? Therefore, it is described what each province should send, according to that passage from Virgil's Georgics, book I.

India sends ivory: the soft Sabaeans their frankincense: hard iron from the Chalybes, and men from Pontus skilled in beaver-traps, etc. In Egypt, linen is produced in great abundance, from which the sail of the Tyrian ship is woven, which is hung from the mast, and its covering, which provides shade for sailors and passengers in the heat and calm of the sun, is made of hyacinth and purple; these are from the Elisa Islands, which are so called from the Ionian Sea. Furthermore, next to the Septuagint, they weave in layers of linen, and they cover the Tyrian ship with veils, so that it may be more glorious with these coverings, and it may have a more beautiful appearance being surrounded by a garment. But linen is made from the earth, because it originates from the earth, and the hyacinth from the air, the purple from the sea from which it is produced, with the addition of double-dyed scarlet, with which the vestments of the Pontiff are woven, we often remind that they signify the four elements: earth, fire, air, and water, from which all things consist, which Tyre assumes for itself, not using them with gratitude as creatures of God, but saying: I am the perfect beauty: or, I have surrounded myself with beauty.


<h2 id='tocuniq259'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Vers. 8, 9.) The inhabitants of Sidon and Arad were your sailors. Your wise men, Tyre, became your captains. The elders of Biblos and their wise men provided sailors for the service of your various goods. All the ships of the sea and their sailors were in the service of your commerce. LXX: Your princes dwelled in Sidon and the men of Arad were your sailors. Your wise men, Sora, who were in you, they were your captains. The elders of Tyre and its wise men were in you: they strengthened your counsel, and all the ships of the sea, and their sailors became your servants in the west of the west. It was said above: Your neighbors who built you, have filled your beauty: before those who live far away come to them, he describes the aid of neighboring provinces. Your inhabitants, he says, or the princes of Sidon and Arad, which is a nearby island, your sailors. Your wise men, O Tyre, have become your governors. For the governing properly belongs to the wise, as Scripture says: 'Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.' (Proverbs 11:14) The elders or senior men of the Bible, and its wise men, provided sailors for your service, strengthened the counsel of Tyre, and provided various merchandise. And all the ships of the sea, with their sailors, were part of the trading people of Tyre, or in the far west. This, meanwhile, according to the letter. But according to mystical understanding, because Sidonians are interpreted as hunters, and Aradians, who lay down: we will say that Tyre is a glorious and most proud city, which, with the wind blowing, is to be destroyed afterwards, has citizens, or rather hunter princes, about whom it is written: Our soul has been taken like a sparrow from the trap of the hunters. For where we read hunters, in Hebrew it is written, of the Sidonians. These people come to the unwary souls, who are placed in high positions, in order to lead them to earthly things, and they become the steersmen, leading them to shipwrecks. But the wise men of Tyre, who are received in a bad way, through which they are wiser than the sons of light, themselves guide Tyre prepared for shipwreck. The elders of the Bible and its wise men provided sailors to Tyre for service, or they strengthened its counsel. The holy history tells that there were many seniors rejected by the Lord, and the juniors chosen as the symbol of the Synagogue and the Church. Senior Cain is added, and junior Abel is chosen (Genesis IV): Ishmael, the son of Abraham, is estranged from his father, and junior Isaac receives the inheritance (Genesis XXI). Among the sons of Isaac, senior Esau is a hunter and wanders in the forests, while junior Jacob simply dwells at home (Genesis XXV). And it is written in Malachi: Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated (Mal. I, 2). And rightly, according to the Apostle (Rom. IX, 13), they had done neither good nor evil in their mother's womb, so that one would be chosen and the other rejected, except that in the type, as we have said, the elder is repelled, and the younger assumed. All, he says, the ships of the sea and their sailors were in the people of the trading of Tyre, or in the furthest west. How is the Song of Songs called, and the age of ages, and the work of works; so that the greater song is compared to other songs, and the longer age to other ages, and the more useful work to other works: thus the West of the West is called, to signify the magnitude of the Western parts. And beautifully do the ships of the sea, and their sailors, and the rowers who assist the ship of Tyre, not go towards the East, nor towards the rising of the light, where the sun of justice is born, but towards the West of the West, where the light sets, and where the beginning of darkness is.

(Verse 10) The Persians, Lydians (commonly known as Lydia), and Libyans were in your army, your mighty warriors. They hung their shields and helmets on you for your adornment (or they themselves hung up their shields and helmets, giving glory to you). The Persians were the bravest, of whom Cyrus, their king, as prophesied by Isaiah (Isa. XLV), conquered Babylon after overthrowing Astyages, the king of the Medes. This is narrated in both sacred and secular history. Moreover, at that time, they were considered among the strongest nations, of whom King Croesus was captured by Cyrus himself, as Xenophon writes in great detail. And we read in the book of Chronicles (2 Chronicles 12) that Libya, along with the Troglodytes and Ethiopians, came against Jerusalem: because they were flourishing in those times, they are remembered as famous warriors, defenders of the city of Tyre, and they hung shields and helmets on the defenses of the walls to terrify the enemies. But spiritual understanding signifies that the Persians, who are interpreted as 'those who try' or 'those who have been tried'; and the Lydians, whom we understand to be 'those who are born'; and the Libyans, who are called Phut in Hebrew, and are translated as 'from the mouth' (from speech, not from bone); in vain they strive to defend Tyre with temptation, and are overcome, and serve the generation and lust, and only multiply empty words, not having the helmet of salvation, nor the shield of faith (Ephesians 6); but they only pretend glory and noise of words to adorn it.

(Verse 11.) The sons of Aradius with their army (or their own) were on your walls all around. But also the Pygmies who were in your towers hung their quivers (or your quivers) on your walls in a circle, they completed your beauty. LXX: The sons of Aradius, and your strength on your walls, were guardians all around in your towers. They hung their quivers on your battlements in a circle. They have completed your adornment. --The Word Gamadim (), the first edition of the Eagle, the Pygmies: Symmachus, the Medes: the Septuagint, the Guardians: Theodotus Gamadim, the Hebrew itself, have translated. We still see the island of Aradus, which is entirely a city, and the opposite town of Antaradus, which is adjacent to Tyre, and stretches along the coast of Phoenicia on the mainland up to this day: these are the guards of the city of Tyre and the custodians of its towers, and they have placed their quivers around them and filled their beauty, so that they are taught to be archers, whether they are pygmies, that is, warriors, and very ready for war, ἀπὸ τῆς πυγμῆς, which is translated into Greek as a contest. But if, on the other hand, they are called the deceitful ones of Aradius, everyone who claims to have knowledge of false names and carries in the quiver of his heart the fiery darts of the devil, with which he wounds and inflames the hearts of those who are deceived, should be called Aradius. For he desires to cast down those who strive to ascend to heights, and he completes the beauty of Tyre, of which it is written in Proverbs: Let not the desire for beauty deceive you, nor be captivated by your eyes (Prov. VI, 25). And again: Just as earrings in a pig's snout, so is beauty to a woman who is ill-tempered. (Ibid. XI, 22).

(Verse 12.) Your Carthaginian merchants have filled your marketplace with a multitude of riches, silver, iron, tin, and lead. Not only in the present place, but also in Isaiah, where it is written: Wail, ships of Carthage (Isaiah 23:14), the other interpreters have translated the Hebrew word as Tharsis, which is undoubtedly a colony of the Tyrians. They themselves from the western parts filled the Tyrian marketplace with silver, iron, tin, and lead. Tarsis in our language sounds like exploration of joy. However, we should not understand the explorers here in a positive sense, like the ones Moses sent to explore the promised land (Numbers 13), but rather in a negative sense, like the ones the Apostle says to avoid: because of false brothers brought in, who came in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ (Galatians 2, 4): and of whom Joseph speaks: You are spies: you have come to see the nakedness of the land (Genesis 42, 9). And understanding that their crime was not small, they began to investigate the matter through treacherous methods, they replied: 'Your slaves are not spies.' Therefore, these individuals multiply the markets of Tyre not with gold or precious stones, but with silver, iron, tin, and lead, possessing the elegance of speech and weapons for attack; and in tin, they counterfeit the appearance of silver; and in lead, they commit the most grave impiety, as described in the Book of Zechariah (Zech. 5), where a woman sits on a lead talent, and the Egyptians sink into the depths like lead. The discussion of each metal is long, but brevity must be studied.

(Vers. 13, 14.) Greece, Tubal, and Meshech themselves brought slaves and bronze vessels to your people. From the house of Togarmah they brought horses and horsemen, and mules to your market. Also, Greece and its surroundings, your merchants brought souls of men and bronze vessels to your market. From the house of Togarmah, they brought horses, horsemen, and mules to your trading post. Jones says that the Hebrews called Javan, and Tubal, that is, the Eastern Iberians, or those from the Western part of Hispania, who are called by this name from the river Iberus, and Meshech, whom we understand to be the Cappadocians, of which their metropolis, which later was named Caesarea by Augustus Caesar, is still called in their language Mazaca. They made valuable trade for Tyre, bringing slaves and bronze vessels from Corinth to Tyre, and horses, horsemen, and mules from the house of Togarmah, that is, from Phrygia, which once had a great abundance of those. The Hebrews say that Greece, that is, Javan, means both 'is' and 'is not', which properly refers to secular wisdom. If they find something right, they call it 'is'; if they find it to be in the opposite direction, they call it 'is not'. They discuss many things themselves about the blessings of nature and about duties, self-control, and the despising of riches, which the Stoics properly claim for themselves. And they seem to make the souls of the people whom they deceive profitable. They have bronze vessels, which they present to the people of Tyre, that they may supplant them with the opinion of false teaching. Also, from the house of Thogorma, which means stranger and foreigner, horses will be brought to the market and fair, and both horsemen and mules, of which it is written: A deceitful horse for safety (Ps. 32:17). And in another place: All who mount horses have slumbered (Ps. 76:7). And in the Psalms: Do not be like a horse or a mule, without understanding (Ps. 32:9). Therefore, Doeg the accuser and slayer of the priests was the chief of many (2 Sam. 22), and these are from the house of foreigners and strangers, who do not eat the flesh of lambs, of which it is written: A stranger and a hired servant shall not eat of it (Exod. 12:43); so that all the markets of Tyre may be filled with these goods.


Your sons, O Dadan, are your merchants. For some, interpreting the Seventy, have translated the sons of the Rhodians as, perhaps, by a similarity of the first letters, instead of Dadan, they read Radan, which is itself the largest of the Cyclades, and once was a most powerful city in the Ionian Sea, glorious in naval warfare, and the safest harbor for all merchants. And because the Rhodians are turned into our language, it is now said tropologically of those who perceive the truth of judgment but do not do it, as the apostle said: Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are that judges. For in judging another, you condemn yourself. For you do the same things that you judge (Rom. II, 1). But it is better to give the name of Dadan to another place, as it is in Hebrew and among other interpreters.

<h2 id='tocuniq264'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Vers. 15, 16.) Many islands have traded with your merchandise: they have exchanged ivory and ebony for your price. Your merchant, Syrus, because of the multitude of your works, has presented pearls, purple, embroidered garments, fine linen, silk, and scarlet in your market. LXX: They have multiplied your merchandise with islands: you were repaying your wages with elephant tusks and those who were being brought in. Your business has been purchased by many of your customers: They traded in aphec, stacten, and polymita from Tharsis and Ramoth and Chodchod in your market. The Hebrew text differs greatly from the Septuagint edition in this particular passage; therefore, a few things must be said according to each. So that we don't get too caught up in Tyrian merchandise, let's move on to the remaining prophecies. The sons of Dadan, Tyrian merchants, have multiplied their business in many islands, so that they traded elephant tusks with those who came for their commerce, and they had men in the markets because of the multitude of trade. But they had in Aphech what is added in Theodotion's edition to the Seventy: for which Symmachus translates, 'polymita.' Also, Stacte, for which all others interpret 'purple,' which is called Argaman in Hebrew: and varieties from Tharsis, for which in Hebrew it is called Bus, which is translated by all as 'byssus.' However, Tharsis is not found anywhere in this place. And they gave 'ramoth' and 'chodchod' in your markets; which is found thus in Hebrew, except that instead of 'ramoth,' Aquila interprets it as 'silk,' or 'fine.' All the interpreters indeed have accurately translated it in the way it is placed in Hebrew (). Therefore, according to the Septuagint, the sons of the Rhodians, the merchants of Tyre, increased his trade from many islands: according to the Hebrew (text), after the sons of Dadan, his merchants also enlarged their trade with the islands of various nations, bringing ivory from India and precious black lignum vitae, and exchanged (them) with other Tyrian goods. Syrus was also a Tyrian trader: for which reason in Hebrew it is written Aram (), in place of which the Seventy interpreters have rendered it Adam, and Res and Daleth, as above, being deceived by the similarity. However, to this day the innate ardor for trading remains in the Syrians, who with a desire for profit travel throughout the world, and have such a madness for commerce that, now that the Roman world has been conquered, they seek riches among swords and the deaths of the unfortunate, and flee poverty with dangers. There are such types of men in Tyre who trade in multicolored fabrics, purple, and embroidered cloth. They also offer linen and silk, and present precious goods in their market. Regarding purple, which everyone has interpreted, the Septuagint translates it as 'stacten,' which means 'drop.' However, I have not been able to find the meaning of 'chodchod' up until now. The Hebrews say that all precious goods are signified by this name, or that it is a certain type of precious merchandise that the Roman language does not mention, or simply a common term used by sellers. But from many islands, to move on to the mystical sense, which are beaten by the salty and bitter waves of this world, merchants of Dedan bring ivory teeth, promising the whiteness of eloquence; about whom it is written: Out of ivory palaces, from which the daughters of kings have delighted you in your glory (Ps. LIV, 9). But they are not white, nor do they imitate the bride, of whom it is said: Who is this that comes up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved (Cant. VIII, 5)? But the Ethiopians of black color, who cannot change their blackness, as Jeremiah says: Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? (Jer. XIII, 21) . And also the Syrian, that is, Aram, which means high, and swells with pride, is a merchant of Tyre, and in the multitude of the works of the Tyrians carries the knowledge of false names, promising many varieties, and the sweet smell of the best ointment, and the purple of royal dignity, and the chequered work of dialectic art, and fine linen, for which the Septuagint have rendered Tharsis, being devoted to the works of the earth: and silk, for which in Hebrew it is written, Ramoth, which means vision of death. For all earthly works hasten towards destruction; and chodchod, whatever that is which is understood, proposing it in the markets of Tyre. But among these goods which are said to be brought by its merchants and islands, either the region of India should be understood, or that of the Idumaeans and vast solitude, as some estimate, and it signifies a connection, so that we may recognize the likeness of divine teachings in heretics.

<h2 id='tocuniq265'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) Judah and the land of Israel themselves, your merchants, offered to you in your markets, as the first fruits: balsam and honey, and oil, and resin. LXX: Judah and the sons of Israel, these are your merchants in the wheat trade and in ointments: they gave you first honey and oil, and resin in your markets. The Hebrew word 'Phanag' (פַּנַּג) was translated by Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion in the way that it is written in Hebrew: for which the LXX translated 'ointment', we translate 'balsam'. It is said, however, that the land of Judaea, which is now called Palestine, abounds in provisions, such as grain, balsam, honey, oil, and resin, which are carried from Judaea and Israel to the market of Tyre. And when the literal meaning is clear, according to the spiritual sense, we say that the land of confession, and the understanding of God that pertains to the Church, should not carry to Tyre the first wheat, which, when it falls to the ground, multiplies and is taken as the word of God: For man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God (Deut. 8:3). Then the balsam that grows in the vineyards of En-gedi, or the ointment, of which it is written: 'Like the ointment on the head, that ran down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron.' (Psalm 133:2). And the honey about which Solomon speaks: 'Thou hast found honey, eat what is sufficient for thee; lest thou be filled therewith and vomit it.' (Proverbs 25:16), for excessive satisfaction turns honey into wormwood. Also the oil with which the lamp in the tabernacle of God is lit, lest that prophetic saying be applied to us: 'Thou didst sell the oil in Egypt.' (Hosea 12:1). But if it is in Egypt and in Tyre, it will turn to the opposite, and it will be said of it, 'The oil of the sinner will not anoint my head' (Ps. CXL, 5). But resin is also gentle, suitable for bodies, and is taken as medicine. Hence it is written in Jeremiah: Is there not resin in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the healing of the daughter of my people not gone up? (Jer. VIII, 22). Jacob also had this resin, which he sent to his son Joseph with honey, balm, nuts, and frankincense (Gen. XLIII). The Ishmaelites who bought Joseph from the land of Israel were carrying these things to Egypt: resin, balm, honey, and oil, as well as frankincense from Gilead (Genesis 37). To better understand what wheat, balsam, honey, and oil, as well as resin, were used for in the market of Tyre, let us listen to the words of the Lord, who said: Do not give what is holy to the dogs; do not cast your pearls before swine (Matthew 7:6). And to the Canaanite woman who was praying for her daughter, saying: My daughter is cruelly tormented by a demon, the Lord replied: It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs (Matthew 15:22, 26). But because it had gone out from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and was approaching the land of Israel, that which she had requested was obtained.

<h2 id='tocuniq266'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) Your Damascene merchant in the multitude of your works: in the abundance of different goods: in rich wine, in the finest wool. LXX: Your Damascene merchant in the multitude of your works, from the abundance of all your strength: wine from Helbon, and wool from Miletus. Regarding the rich wine, which Symmachus, Aquila, and Theodotion interpreted, and in the Hebrew text itself, it says, wine from Helbon. And again, when we settled ourselves in the best colored wool, both the Eagle and Theodotius transferred to the wool market of Soor. And it is significant that among the other trade of Tyre, the finest wine and the best wool were brought to its market from Damascus, which we still see today. But if Damascus is interpreted as drinking blood, and the true tradition of the Hebrews is that the field where Abel was killed by the fratricide Cain (Gen. IV) was in Damascus, from which the place derives its notable name, then rightly Paul went to Damascus after the killing of Stephen, the first martyr in Christ, in order to lead the believers in Christ as prisoners to Jerusalem. And by the mercy of God, who made the blind see and the sighted blind, he lost the eyes of the flesh so that he could receive the eyes of the mind. And scales fell from his eyes, with which he had lost the light of truth, so that he could go to the street that is called Straight and find Ananias, which is interpreted in our language as obedient (Acts IX). Therefore, from this land, which is called 'Cursed is the ground that opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood' (Gen. IV, 11), the Tyrians gather at the market, and there is rich wine and shining wool: either wine from Chelbon, which means milky. Seventy are for the best-colored wool, from Miletus, or Tyre, they say. Miletus is not found in Hebrew, but because the finest wool is brought from there, they have interpreted 'Soor' as Miletus. From this it is clear that Tyre feeds on the milk of infancy and does not have its own clothing, but rather obtains it from elsewhere and from various provinces. The interpretation of Damascus as 'the blood of Cilicia' and 'the blood of a kiss' does not fit the current context. Frequently, Hebrew names are interpreted in various ways due to the diversity of accents and the change of letters and vowels, especially those that have their own peculiarities among them.


<h2 id='tocuniq267'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) Both Greece and Mozel (also known as Moscow) have put forward wrought iron during your markets. Stacte and calamus are in your business dealings. The Septuagint version adds the following about Dan, Javan, and Mozel in your markets. Wrought iron is made by skilled craftsmen, and the wheel is part of your trade. The name Dan was taken from the patriarch and the tribe, and it refers to the place where the tribe lived. Today, that place is called Paneas, which was once known as Caesarea Philippi. And so the Jordan River obtained its name, from Jor, which means 'river', and Dan, which flows from Lebanon. Javan, on the other hand, represents Greece, which as we have said, both is and is not. Symmachus also translates Mozel as carrying, so the meaning is: Dan and Greece have brought iron goods to your markets, and so on. Aquila, however, translates Mozel as Uzal. From these regions, it is believed that iron, stacte, and reed are exported to the Tyrian markets. Let us declare that Greece, that is, Javan, possesses expertly crafted iron and is very ready for war, boasting that it can express everything with judgment and reason through the art of dialectic. It promises a vocal sound that can be interpreted on paper and the pure scent of stacte, whether it be the crafted iron or the wheel that turns with the arrangement of words, and it possesses the flow of speech.

<h2 id='tocuniq268'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) The merchants of Dedan, dedicated to sitting on carpets. LXX: The merchants of Dadan, with chosen animals for chariots. The Hebrew and the Septuagint differ greatly in this place, except for the name of the region which is near Dedan and Dadan. There is indeed a great difference between sitting on carpets and riding in chariots with chosen animals, and there is no doubt that chariots and horses would be viewed negatively if they were earthly. Furthermore, both Elijah and Elisha are taken up to heaven in a chariot, and Elisha calls Elijah father, charioteer, and chariot of Israel (2 Kings 2:12). And Gehazi's eyes are opened to see the chariots on the mountain and the horses prepared for the Lord's session, without any riders (Ibid. 6). In the tapestries, the beauty of words is shown; in them, the merchants of Dedan ride and rest, having assembled for the market of Tyre.


<h2 id='tocuniq269'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21.) Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, they themselves the merchants of your hand, came to you with lambs and rams and goats. For the lambs, rams, and goats, they interpreted seventy camels and rams and lambs. But Arabia and the princes of Kedar (which today is the land of the Saracens, as is fully proven in the words of Jeremiah, who writes against Kedar) abound in these animals, namely lambs and rams and goats, and they increase the commerce of Tyre with this importation (Jeremiah 49). But also a very fertile region of the camels is due to the breadth of pastures, and the temperate air which this animal enjoys. Arabia is interpreted as 'evening', and Cedar as 'darkness'. Concerning which regions, it is said in the Psalms: 'I have dwelt with them that hate peace: when I spake unto them, they fought against me without a cause.' (Psalm 120:7). These regions supply the city of Tyre with camels, burdened with the weight of heavy sins, either lambs or rams or goats, which they sacrifice on their altars, which they have fashioned from a wicked and rebellious heart. But even in this same passage, we read in the vision of the shepherds that rams disturb the purest waters, and push the sheep with their sides, and fight with their horns (Ezekiel 34); also goats, which are accustomed to stand on the left, and lambs that pretend to be a lamb (Matthew 25); of whom it is written: Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world (John 1:29). But Isaiah writes favorably about camels (Isaiah 60), from Midian, which is interpreted as the judgement of the Lord, coming to Jerusalem, and Ephah, and rams from Nebaioth, and Sheba bringing gold and frankincense: the last two of which are also offered to the Lord by the Magi (Matthew 2). And so, camels with the burden of sins can enter the narrow and tight path that leads to life (Matthew VII and XIX).

<h2 id='tocuniq270'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) Sellers of Sheba and Reama (or Rema), your own merchants with all the choicest spices, and precious stone, and gold which they have set forth in your market. In the Psalms where it is written, 'The kings of the Arabs and Sheba shall offer gifts to you' (Ps. 72:10), in Hebrew it has, 'The kings of Sheba and Sheba shall offer gifts to you,' of which one Sheba is written with the letter Sin, the other with Samech, which is similar to our letter S. Therefore, since Saba is interpreted as a conversion, it must be said that in this present passage it does not signify conversion, but rather aversion, from which the gifts of Tyre are brought with all kinds of aromas and the best odors, and with precious stone and gold, all of which are offered for sale in the markets of Tyre. For they themselves fabricate the best odor and precious stone with which they strive to build up their own perversity in the Churches, and they promise gold in the sense, and all these things are perverse. For nothing is received for free, nor is anything given for free, but all things are bought, as when the kings of the Arabs and Saba offer gifts to Christ for free. These are the ones who do everything for the sake of shameful gain: and they received these gifts from Him who says in the Gospel: 'All these things were given to me, and I will give them to you if you fall down and worship me' (Matthew 4:9). Reama, or according to the Septuagint Rhegma, I could not find in any other place in the Scriptures, nor could I find what region it is or what it signifies; except that it is clear, and from what is connected, that Saba is a neighboring region to this province.


<h2 id='tocuniq271'>(Vers. 23, 24.)</h2>

(Verse 23, 24.) Aran, and Channe, and Eden, your traders were from Saba, Assur, Chelmad, your sellers: these traders of yours had various wrappings of hyacinth and precious gems, which were wrapped and tied with ropes. LXX: Charran, and Chana, and Edne, these were your traders: Sabba, Assur, and Chalman, your merchants, bringing merchandise + in Machalim, and in Galima ** hyacinth and + polymita ** precious treasures tied with ropes. And these are the names of the various places. The addition made by Theodotion to the Septuagint was interpreted by Symmachus as 'precious coverings' in Machalim and in Galima. We have also added Polymita, which Theodotion interpreted in various ways, by Aquila and Symmachus. These precious garments were carried by merchants in such valuable coverings that they were fastened with hyacinth ropes. Aran, or as the Septuagint says, Charran, means 'holes' in our language. Channe means 'preparation'. Eden means 'delights'. As for Edne, which is not found in the Hebrew, we do not know its meaning, and we should not seek the etymology of a fabricated name. Therefore, in the negotiation, the Tyrians rely on the fleshy senses that are indicated in the forums. The whole preparation of the people of the world is to believe that they are the only delights if they increase the commerce of the Tyrian city. We have mentioned about Sheba earlier. Assur, which means 'leading', is transferred to vineyards: undoubtedly, the Sodomites who come to the Tyrian market direct, even accuse with punishments, and correct what has been depraved, according to what is said in the Psalms: 'That you may destroy the enemy and the avenger' (Psalm 8:3). And they have a variety of household items, distinguished by an incredible variety, which are bound by hyacinth wrappings; whether their treasures are bound by ropes, which they have stored up for themselves on earth, according to what is written: Everyone is bound by the ropes of their own sins (Prov. 5:22). And they did not have free trade, but they bound everything to the chains of sin. Let us refer the hyacinth wrappings, because of their similarity in color, to the airy powers, which lavish their treasures in the markets of the world.


They also had cedar in your negotiations. The ships of the sea (or as it is contained in Hebrew, Tharsis), your princes in your negotiation. For cedar, the Seventy translated it as cypress. And because we have spoken above about both, it is superfluous to increase the reader's disgust.

(Verse 25) And you were filled, and greatly glorified (or burdened) in the heart of the sea. Nothing, he says, was lacking to you concerning the riches of the islands. However, this glorification was a burden for the possessor, for you cannot bear riches in moderation, even though poverty often serves as a temptation (Prov. 30). Thus, Solomon asks for only what is necessary; he equally detests wealth and poverty, so that pride does not creep in with the former and impatience and falsehood with the latter.

(Verse 26) Your rowers have brought you into many waters. Above the rowers, we read about the Tyrians of the city of Sidon, and the Aradians, of whom the former are interpreted as hunters and the latter as passers-by. Indeed, they hunt the souls of those whom, amidst the waves of this world, they lead according to their own judgment and do not raise up to lofty heights, but plunge them into the depths. They do not imitate those who, sailing until the morning watch, broke the raging waves of the sea and deserved to receive the Lord and Savior. And immediately, with such a guide and companion, they arrived at the harbor of rest. About which is more fully written in the Gospel.

The south wind tossed you in the heart of the sea (Matthew 14). All the riches of Tyre, scattered by the blowing south wind. They are significantly called Cadim, which is interpreted in Greek as καύσων; we can translate it as a burning wind. Concerning this wind, the holy David said: The sun shall not harm you by day, nor the moon by night (Psalm 121:6). Jacob was burned by this wind, yet not consumed, as he speaks: By day the heat consumed me, and the frost by night (Genesis 31:40). Those also who were hired from the first hour endured the heat and burning of the whole day, and yet they receive a denarius, because they were scorched and not defiled. Hence the bride says in the Song of Songs: I am black, but beautiful, because the sun has looked upon me (Cant. I, 4): or, as it is better expressed in Hebrew, the sun has made me pale.

Your riches and treasures, and your abundant wealth. Many read it this way: In the heart of the sea are your riches and treasures, and your abundant wealth; so that all the riches and treasures of Tyre, and all its substance, are set in the heart of the sea, and are overwhelmed by the waves of time, and its inhabitants have nothing stable and lasting, with that Gospel fulfilled: 'Fool, tonight they will take your soul from you, and whose will be what you have prepared?' (Luke XII, 20). And to that apostle: Those who want to become rich, fall into temptation and many snares, and are dragged into the abyss (I Tim. VI, 9). The story is clear; therefore, we join together brief sentences with almost single verses. For the speech is already hastening towards the end of the book.

Your sailors (or rowers), and your pilots, who held your goods and led your people: and your warriors who were in you, with all your multitude that is in your midst, will fall in the heart of the sea on the day of your ruin. We read about the sailors or rowers of the city of Tyre, the Sidonians, and the Aradians, about whom it has already been said; and according to the Septuagint edition, the counselors of Byblos, which is called Gebal in Hebrew: and also its warriors, Persians, Lydians, and Libyans, who will all fall and be shown to be nothing, when Tyre falls and all its glory comes to an end in ruins. However, the multitude which the Seventy translated as 'commixtionis', except for the leaders, signifies the common people; who without the name of positions, are crushed with similar judgement. And the prophecy is mixed between the city and the ship, so that from one you may understand the other: and yet both pertain to the end of the age, and to a shipwreck.

<h2 id='tocuniq275'>(Vers. 28, 29.)</h2>

(Verse 28, 29) From the sound of the shouting of your helmsmen, the fleets will be thrown into confusion, and all who held the oar will come down from their ships. The sailors, and all the helmsmen of the sea, the shipmasters and the rowers, will stand on land, and they will wail loudly over you, and cry out bitterly. They will throw dust on their heads, and cover themselves with ashes (or spread ashes on themselves). And what follows: They will shave their heads because of you, and put on sackcloth; they will weep for you with bitter mourning, and take up a lamentation over you. In the Septuagint it is not found, but it is added in the Theodotian Edition. When Tyre falls, its governors will be troubled, and they will descend from their ships, and oarsmen and sailors and rowers, and all the governors of the sea, tossed by the waves, will finally stand on solid ground; and they will lament with a loud voice over it, which they previously enriched with their merchandise, and they will signify the bitterness of their minds with a clamor: and they will also throw dust or dirt on their heads, repenting of their earthly deeds. And they shall be sprinkled with ashes or calves, according to the Law (Num. XX), in order to be purified: or certainly they shall lay ashes upon themselves, according to that which is said to Jerusalem: Scatter the earth upon thy head, and lay ash beneath thee, and make lamentation (Jerem. VI, 16). And in the Gospel it is written: If these signs had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have done penance long ago in sackcloth and ashes (Luc. X, 13). And the Psalmist says: I have eaten ashes like bread (Psal. CI, 10). And they shave their head over Tyre, and they make baldness, which usually happens in mourning, at that time when the magnitude of sorrow has excluded all joy. But the apostles' hair was numbered, because they had consecrated their hair like the Nazarenes to the Lord (Matthew 10; Luke 6). And as long as Samson had hair, he possessed strength, but when his hair was cut off, he was captured by the Philistines (Judges 16). But when it is said, and they shall gird themselves with sackcloth, the old lust of the loins is condemned, so that those who lived in pleasures may afterwards live in austerity and hardness, repenting. The people of Nineveh had sackcloth. And again, it is said to Jerusalem: 'Wail to me like a bride wearing sackcloth, grieving for her husband as a virgin.' And they will mourn for you, it says, with bitter weeping. For it is better to enter the house of mourning than the house of feasting, so that they may mourn for Tyre and sing a mournful song, as the following Scripture adds. But in order to know the progress of those who mourn the falling, and who dwelled before in the heart of the sea, let the prophets teach us by their example: they themselves are commanded to mourn for Tyre, so that, after the time of repentance is fulfilled, it may be restored to its former state, and, taking up the lyre, may sound forth for the Lord. Read Isaiah. Some, though ridiculous (but still worth reading), interpret governors as bishops of heretics, counselors as priests, helmsmen as archdeacons, rowers and sailors as deacons, and carriers refer to the whole people. If they had added the devil as the shipmaster, they would have completed the tragedy. All of them will wail together and cry bitterly, and they will repent after they sense the shipwreck of their own ship and stand on land, and they will lose all the splendor of the false name of knowledge. And instead of joy and happiness, they will mark repentance with bitterness in their hearts.


<h2 id='tocuniq276'>(Vers. 33 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 33 and following) What is like Tyre, that has become silent (or has been silenced) in the middle of the sea? (Which is not found in the Septuagint.) Who, in the outcome of your dealings (or what reward you received) from the sea, enriched many peoples? In the abundance of your wealth, and with the multitude of your people, you made many kings wealthy. Now you are broken by the sea (or in the sea) in the depths of the waters, your wealth (or your trading) and all your multitude, which was in your midst, have fallen. All the inhabitants of the islands were astonished (or crushed) over you, and all their kings were struck (or turned mad) by the tempest, they changed their countenance (or wept). The merchants of the nations (or peoples) hissed at you, you were brought down to nothingness (or made into ruins), and you will no longer exist (Vulg. remains silent) forever (or for eternity). Captains, sailors, helmsmen, and passengers, in the mourning of Tyre, will remember these things, which so silenced other cities that they had no confidence to speak; and they heard that Gospel saying, Be silent, and be dumb (Mark 4:39). And concerning the Psalms: But to the sinner God said, Why do you declare my justices, and take my covenant in thy mouth? (Ps. XLVI, 16) How rich has Tyre become with so many goods! And why have you sought so much with such great labor, that you gather perishable things through days and nights of shipwreck? Indeed, you have filled many peoples and enriched kings with your wealth, of whom it is written: The kings of the earth stood, and the princes met together against the Lord and against his Christ (Psalm II, 2). But now you are crushed in the sea, and in the depths of the waters, just as it is written about Pharaoh: The chariots of Pharaoh and his army he has cast into the sea (Exodus XV, 4). He was submerged in the deep like a stone, and he could say: I have come into the deep of the sea, and the tempest has submerged me (Psalm XIV, 4). All the islands, or the inhabitants of the islands, that are battered by the waves of this world, will be astonished at you, and their kings, struck by the storm, will sense their own demise. They will imitate the voice of the snake, hissing and saying: You have been reduced to nothing, or you have been made into destruction; so that you have not had the nature of destruction, but the will. And you will not be. But if he had said this until now, a great question would arise, how it was not, which we now see as built. But from what follows, 'Forever', it shows the time of one age, which is reckoned to be around 70 years in the circle of a man's life. Whether you will not be to God, as the Apostle says: 'He calls things that are not as though they were' (Rom. 4:17). And the prophet Isaiah: 'Behold, they shall be confounded and ashamed, all your adversaries.' (Isaiah 41:11). For they will be as if they were not (Isa. XLI, 11): And Esther according to the Seventy Interpreters: Do not give your scepter to those who are not (Esther XIV, 11). And in the psalm: Let me be refreshed before I go away, and I shall be no more (Ps. XXXV, 14). We have already mentioned in what sense these testimonies should be understood. However, all these things can be referred to the person of heretics, who, in the contrition of Tyre and the shipwreck, feel their error and, placed in the midst of the sea, desire to free their souls and mourn the ill-gotten riches, with which they have enriched many kings, namely their patriarchs, and the common people, whose wealth will be destroyed in the midst of the sea. The inhabitants of all the islands (if, however, we want to interpret what has been said in a positive way) will also be astonished at the destruction of Tyre, and the kings of all the islands, being as it were struck by a storm, will change their faces, or at least show the grief of their hearts with weeping and tears, and they will testify to the magnitude of their astonishment with wonder and hissing, declaring how she has become nothing and perished, she who promised salvation to many nations. And furthermore, it will not be, at any certain time, that we interpret αἰῶνα as meaning 'age'; but forever, because the same word signifies both.

<h2 id='tocuniq277'>Book Nine</h2>

Book Nine

It followed, daughter Eustochium, that I would include the prophecy of Tyre and the prince of Tyre in one volume, combining both the places and the prophecies without separating them according to the order of the books. But because there are many things that are said and they exceed the limit of prolixity, therefore the explanation has been extended into the ninth book, which we believe will reach the end with your prayers and those of all the saints, so that we may also discuss what is written about Pharaoh and all of Egypt in the book of Ezekiel. The same things are also to be divided by us into ten books, so that the measurement of the volumes among themselves may be preserved, and the labor of the one dictating, writing, and reading may have rest in parts.

<h2 id='tocuniq278'>(Chap. XXVIII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 28, Verse 1 onwards) 'The word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre: Thus says the Lord God: Because your heart is lifted up, and you have said, 'I am a god, I sit in the seat of gods, in the heart of the seas,' yet you are a man, and not a god, though you set your heart as the heart of a god. Behold, you are wiser than Daniel! There is no secret that is hidden from you. By your wisdom and your understanding you have gained wealth for yourself and have acquired gold and silver in your treasuries.' In the abundance of your wisdom, and in your trading, you have multiplied strength for yourself, and your heart has been lifted up in your power. Therefore, thus says the Lord (God adds): because your heart has been lifted up as the heart of God, therefore, behold, I will bring upon you the most strong of the nations, and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and they shall defile your splendor. They shall kill you, and deliver you up, and you shall die the death of the slain in the heart of the sea. Are you saying, 'I am God,' in the presence of those who are about to kill you, even though you are a man and not God, and they will kill you with the hands of foreigners? You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of strangers, for I have spoken, declares the Lord God. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, say to the prince of Tyre: Thus says the Lord God: Because your heart is proud, and you have said, 'I am a god, I sit in the seat of the gods, in the heart of the seas,' yet you are but a man, and no god, though you make your heart like the heart of a god— are you wiser than Daniel? The wise have not taught you their discipline: have you made for yourself strength and made gold and silver in your treasuries, or in your abundant knowledge have you multiplied your strength and your power? Your heart is lifted up in your strength, therefore thus says the Lord God: Because you have given your heart as the heart of God, behold, I will bring upon you foreign pestilential people from the nations, and they will unsheath their swords against you because of the splendor of your knowledge, and they will humble your splendor in destruction. They will lead you away, and they will dispose of you, and you will die the death of the wounded in the heart of the sea. Will you say, 'I am God,' when you face those who kill you? You are a man, not God, in the midst of your attackers. You will die at the hands of foreigners, uncircumcised in heart, because I have spoken, declares the Lord God.' Wherever YHWH is placed in the Septuagint, the first name, YHWH, is the proper name of God and is unspeakable. The second name, Adonai, is the common name found frequently in humans. However, just as the city of Tyre is depicted as a ship, first in its wealth and then in its destruction and mourning, so too is a prophetic discourse addressed to the ruler of Tyre. It is stated that he became proud and did not make good use of the wealth he possessed, and as a result suffered sadness and lamentation, experiencing great misfortune. Therefore, the first things to be said must be explained. It is written in Isaiah (Isa. 14) concerning the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, that he equated himself with God's power and became so arrogant that he dared to say, 'I will ascend above the stars of heaven and I will be like the Most High.' And hurled from his throne, he deserved to hear: How did Lucifer fall, he who rose in the morning? And of Pharaoh in the same prophet: The rivers are mine, and I made them (Isaiah 29:9). And of the prince of Tyre, who in his pride arrogantly said: I am a god, and I sit on the throne of God, or I dwell in the habitation of God, even though he is a man and not God. Although these words may seem to exceed the powers of human frailty, and not to be the words of men but of raving demons, we must take them as hyperbole, in that they have swelled to such an extent and have not known their measure, that in the midst of the swelling of worldly happiness and the power of the kingdom, men have not known themselves and have claimed eternal dominion for themselves. Although under the guise of princes, kings, and individual cities, or provinces, opposing powers may be demonstrated, about which the Apostle Paul writes: For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms (Ephesians 6:12). And in another place: We speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing (1 Corinthians 2:6). And again, discussing wisdom, he says, which none of the rulers of this world knew. For if they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory (I Cor. II, 8). Also, in the prophecy of Daniel, it is clearly written that the Prince of the Israelite people is Michael, and the prince of Greece, and the prince of Persia (Dan. X). And Moses explicitly writes in the Song of Deuteronomy: When the Most High divided the nations, and scattered the sons of Adam, he established the boundaries of the nations, according to the number of the angels of God (Deut. XXXII, 8); or as it is better in Hebrew: according to the number of the sons of Israel. And so it happened that the people of the Lord, his portion, Jacob, became the inheritance of Israel. And we should not be surprised that on the opposite side the worst kings precede the best kings, David, Solomon, Josiah, and the patriarchs, and prophets, as a foreshadowing of the Lord and Savior. Therefore, according to both understandings, let us discuss the arrogant kings and apostate princes equally, which are written. He says, therefore (or, as said by Alexander, since you are a man, and being surrounded by the frailty of human flesh and swollen with pride, you think that you can dwell on the throne of God in the heavens, even though you are held in the narrowness of the middle of the sea and on the islands. And also, because you boast of your wisdom to such an extent that the men of your kingdom challenge Solomon with riddles: Are you wiser than Daniel, who by the grace of God conquered all the magicians and soothsayers, and is now the wisest in Babylon? Or, to put it another way: Even if you are wiser than Daniel, who is acknowledged to be the wisest of all, and even if you desire to compare yourself to God in the magnitude of wealth and power: you will still be captured by your enemies, and with the destruction of your city, you will be struck by many wounds. And you will no longer say, 'I am God,' but, having learned through your downfall, you will recognize that you are a human, not God. But if we wish to call the prince of Tyre the same power to whom the city itself, or the province, was given by God, let us accept that testimony. I said, 'You are gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High. But you will die like men, and fall like one of the princes' (Psalm 82:7). For power was given to them to govern the provinces, like judges appointed by the Emperor. However, they, forgetting their honor and being driven by a tyrannical mindset, rose up against their king and Lord. Dispersed throughout the whole world, they took on the names of idols and, filled with pride, fell into the judgment and snare of the devil. About this, Jesus spoke in the Gospel: I saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven (Luke 10:18).

<h2 id='tocuniq279'>(Vers. 11 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 11 seqq.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, raise a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him: Thus says the Lord God: You were the signet of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering: carnelian, topaz, and jasper, chrysolite, onyx, and beryl, sapphire, carbuncle, and emerald. Gold was the workmanship of your settings and your engravings; on the day that you were created they were prepared. You, Cherub, stretched out and protecting, I placed you on the holy mountain of God. You walked among the fiery stones; you were perfect in your ways from the day of your creation until iniquity was found in you. Your heart was filled with iniquity in the multitude of your trading, and you sinned. Therefore, I cast you out from the mountain of God and destroyed you, O Cherub protecting amidst the fiery stones. Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor. Therefore, I cast you down to the ground. I set you before kings, that they might gaze at you. In the multitude of your iniquities and the injustice of your trading, you have defiled your sanctification. Therefore, I will bring forth fire from your midst that will consume you, and I will turn you into ashes upon the earth in the sight of all who see you. All who see you among the nations will be astonished at you. You have become nothing and will be no more forever. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, take up a lamentation over the prince of Tyre and say to him: Thus says the Lord God: You were the seal of likeness, full of wisdom and adorned with the crown of beauty; you were in the delights of the paradise of God. You are surrounded by every good gemstone: sardius and topaz, and emerald, and carbuncle, and sapphire, and jasper, and silver, and gold, and ligure, and agate, and amethyst, and chrysolite, and beryl, and onyx, and you have filled your treasuries with gold and your storehouses with silver. From the day you were created, you were prepared with the anointed Cherub from God, and dwelling in the tabernacle, I have given you on the holy mountain of God. You have become in the midst of fiery stones. You were blameless in your days, from the day you were created; until iniquities were found in you, you filled your storehouses with iniquity from the abundance of your trade, and you sinned and were wounded by the mountain of God, and the cherub who overshadowed you led you out of the midst of the fiery stones. Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; your wisdom was corrupted by your splendor. Because of your many sins, I cast you to the ground; I made you a spectacle before kings, that you might be dishonored. Because of the multitude of your sins and the iniquities of your trade, you have defiled your holy places. And I will bring forth fire in your midst; it will devour you. And I will make you like ashes on the earth in the sight of all who see you, and all who know you among the nations will be dismayed over you. You have become a ruin, and you will never be again. For we have declared what the prince of Tyre is and how he has fallen because of his pride, let us know his lamentations over his former glory. First, let it be agreed what it was, so that he may regret having lost what he had. 'You,' he says, 'are the seal of likeness;' according to that, which John the Evangelist rightly says about the Savior: 'For this God has sealed, the Father' (John 6:27). And about men: 'He has sealed, because God is true' (John 3:33). And in the Psalms: 'The light of your face, O Lord, has been sealed upon us' (Psalm 4:7). And in another place: 'Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet appeared what we shall be.' We know that when he appears, we shall be like him. (1 John 3:2) That is why it is said to God: Who will be like you? (Psalm 35:10) For similarity is one thing, equality is another. Therefore, the most savage heresy is the one that confesses only the Father's similarity in Christ and takes away his nature. But we not only say similarity in the Son, but also equality. That is why the Jews persecuted him: because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also made himself equal to God. (John 5) But where there is equality, there is the same nature and one substance. This is what the Apostle speaks of regarding similarity: My little children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you (Galatians 4:19), so that you may receive, namely, his likeness, which you have lost through your own fault. And because in Latin codices the word for sign or seal is read as "resignaculum", expressing word for word the Greek word κακοζήλως, which is interpreted according to the Septuagint translation as ἀποσφράγισμα, that is, seal or sign. Some people understand it in this way, that the seal of God and the image which was as if expressed in the softest wax, the king of Tyre erased and lost, so that he made a reseal, not having the image and likeness of God, according to which the first man was created, as God says: Let us make man in our image and likeness (Genesis 1:26). And it should be noted that the image was only made then, and the likeness is fulfilled in Christ's baptism. And accordingly, to her to whom it has been said: You are a likeness of the seal, is joined, full of wisdom, perfect in beauty, or, a crown of glory. For where the likeness of God is, there is also the fullness of wisdom, and perfect beauty, or as a crown adorned with different flowers, and composed of virtues, which the diligent increases by his own efforts, while the industry nourishes the good of nature, and the negligent diminishes it, according to what is said in Proverbs under the figure of a beautiful and ill-mannered woman: As a ring of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman without discretion (Prov. XI, 22). It follows: In the delights of the paradise of God, you were: for which reason it is called Eden in Hebrew, which also the history of Genesis narrates. Eden, however, is translated into delights. And beautifully it is named paradise of God to distinguish it, so as to show that there is a contrary paradise not of God, among those who change the truth into lying (Rom. 1), and boast of having a paradise. By this speech he demonstrates, that the one of whom it is written is by no means a human being, but a contrary fortitude, which formerly dwelt in God's paradise: although the Jews estimate prophetically, by that metaphor which is called hyperbole, that it refers to King Hiram of Tyre. But to whom is it said: You were in the delights of the paradise of God, or you have become, it shows what he had, or what he lost. Moreover, what is joined to the habitation of paradise, every precious stone is your covering, or your binding, and encirclement, jasper, topaz, and jasper, chrysolite, and onyx, and beryl, sapphire, and carbuncle, and emerald, or, as in the LXX, in a different order and with other names, twelve stones are contained, this must be observed, not every precious stone surrounded the king of Tyre, or covered, and as Symmachus translated, bound and confined: but every stone that the prince of Tyre had was precious. Moreover, there are many precious stones that Scripture does not mention in this place, such as chalcedony, sardonyx, chrysoprase, hyacinth, crystal, and the most precious pearl. Even Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion differ greatly from each other in this place, not only in order, but also in number and names. In the Book of Revelation, where the city of Jerusalem is described as built with living stones, there is a slight change in order towards the end, and the same stones are set in its foundations, so that its gates are inscribed with the light of crystal (Rev. 21). But also in the breastplate of the high priest, through the four rows in the Rational (Exod. 28), the same stones are described, and on his shoulders two onyx stones, on which are written the names of the twelve patriarchs, which the true high priest, of whom it is written: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek (Ps. 110:4), carries on his breast, carries on his shoulders, in order to represent the number of the twelve stones of the apostles; and in the two sacraments of both Testaments, one of which John the Evangelist leaned on his breast, in order to drink from the streams of wisdom, and could say: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God (John 1:1-2). These are living stones, from which the Church is built, and about which the Apostle Peter writes: If you have believed, because the Lord is sweet: approaching him, the living stone, indeed rejected by men, but chosen and honored by God, and you yourselves, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices pleasing to God through Jesus Christ. For the Scripture says (Isa. XXVIII, 16): Behold, I am laying in Zion a cornerstone, chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame (I Pet. II, 3 et seqq.). Moreover, the vessel of election is united by equal votes, saying: Upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, the corner stone being Christ Jesus Our Lord: in whom all the building, being framed together, groweth up into an holy temple in the Lord (Eph. II, 10). These are the stones of which we read in another place: And the holy stones are rolled over the earth, like wheels (Zach. IX, 16), touching but little the ground, and hastening with their rolling to the heavenly places. Of which the Scripture also speaks: Behold, I will prepare thy carbuncle stone, and thy foundations sapphire, and I will make thy bulwarks jasper, and thy gates crystal, and thy walls precious stones: and all thy children shall be taught of God, and in much peace thy children shall be, and thou shalt be built in justice (Isa. 54:11-13). Concerning which, we have explained in the interpretations of the same prophet. The twentieth Psalm sings of stones of this kind: The king shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord; and in thy salvation he shall greatly rejoice. Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden from him the will of his lips. For thou hast prevented him with blessings of sweetness: thou hast set on his head a crown of precious stones (Psalm XX. 1 seq.). These are the pearls of the prophets and apostles, which, in comparison with Christ, are all sold in the Gospel (Matthew XIV), that the most precious pearl may be bought, and the stone of which Zacharias writes, which has seven eyes, that is, the seven graces of the Holy Spirit (Zach. III and IV). Read Isaiah. And it is placed by the apostle Paul as the foundation of the Church, upon which gold, silver, and precious stones are built (I Cor. III): the colors, natures, and efficacies of each of which are not to be discussed in this time; but they desire a separate volume: so that in Ezekiel, and in Exodus, and in Revelation, and in Isaiah, all the stones and orders of stones compared to each other make a great question for both the reader and the discussant. Super quibus et vir sanctus Epiphanius episcopus proprium volumen mihi praesens tradidit. Et XXXVII liber Plinii Secundi, Naturalis Historiae, post multiplicem omnium rerum scientiam, de gemmis et lapidibus disputat. Ad quorum notitiam diligens à nobis mittendus est lector. Porro Symmachi interpretatio, istum principem Tyri, quasi pretiosissimum monile lapidibus scribit esse distinctum. Denique auri tympanum vocat, in quo infixi sint lapides. And according to the Hebrew, it follows: Gold is the work of your adornment, and your holes are prepared on the day you were buried. For this reason, the Septuagint says: You filled your treasuries and storehouses with gold, reflecting the understanding and intention that his thoughts have revealed in divine sacraments, and he has gathered for himself spiritual riches, about which the Lord commanded: Store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither rust nor moth destroys, nor thieves dig and steal. For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be. This is the hidden treasure, of which he also speaks in the Gospel: The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man having found, hid it, and for joy thereof goeth, and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. But the apothecae, or storehouses, are those of which it is written elsewhere: Blessed shall be thy barns and rich thy tables. After this, it is said, according to the Hebrew: 'You are the stretched out and protecting Cherub, with the ark of God and the propitiatory beneath it,' or, according to the Septuagint, that he himself, anointed and created, was with the Cherub. From this it is shown that this does not pertain to a human prince of the city of Tyre, but rather to the once holy and eminent strength that was placed as prince of the city of Tyre. And I have set you, he says, on the holy mountain of God; without a doubt, this signifies paradise, to which Paul the Apostle says he was caught up after the third heaven (1 Corinthians 12). But the cherub, of the male gender, is called in the singular number: and in the plural number they are called cherubim, which are interpreted as a multitude of knowledge. God rests and sits upon them, and uses this chariot, as the prophet says: You who sits upon the cherubim, manifest yourself (Ps. 79:2). And in another place: He ascended upon the cherubim, and flew; he flew upon the wings of the wind (Ps. 18:11). This cherub, or creature with cherub, extended and protecting the sacraments, is placed on the holy mountain of God, as we have often said. And the Apostle Paul speaks, if anyone receives the Epistle to the Hebrews: You have come to Mount Zion and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to thousands of angels (Heb. XII, 22). Or certainly the holy mountain of God, as we have said, is to be understood as a paradise. He also walked among fiery stones, of which it is written: He makes His angels spirits, and His ministers a burning fire (Ps. CIII, 4). And not only God, who is called consuming fire, consumes hay, wood, and straw (Deut. IV): but also the angels, who are called fiery stones, and fervent in spirit. Hence the Lord says: I came to cast fire upon the earth, and what do I desire but that it be kindled (Luke XII). And what follows: You are perfect in your ways from the day of your creation (in the Septuagint: You were blameless in your days, from the day you were created), until iniquity was found in you, shows that every creature, created good by God, had perfect virtue, and that even the prince of Tyre was blameless, so that sin is not a part of nature, but of will. Until iniquity was found in you. Iniquity invented by God, which was kept enclosed in the treasure chests of your heart through pride and the abuse of power that you had received. Also, the inner chambers, or storehouses, of his wickedness were filled with a multitude of his dealings. For while he sought after many things and was not satisfied with the knowledge he had gained, nor with the power he had been given, he filled the storehouses and inner chambers of his heart so that, being satiated and made fat, he kicked against his Creator. For Jacob ate, and was satisfied, and the beloved one rebelled, becoming fat and sleek, and enlarged, and forsaking the God who made him (Deut. XXXII, 15). And from the heart come evil thoughts (Matth. XV, 19): because of which God says: You have sinned, and I have cast you out from the mountain of God, or you have been wounded by the mountain of God, which we who read are compelled to fear. For if the Cherub extended and protecting, placed on the holy mountain of God, and in the midst of fiery stones, perfect and immaculate, filled his interior with iniquity because of the abundance of trade, and sinned, and was cast out from the mountain of God, that is, from the dwelling of paradise, or wounded by the mountain of God, which clearly refers to Christ, or certainly wounded by the mountain of God, established and dwelling in himself, he is pricked in conscience by evil, while he realizes himself unworthy of the habitation of the mountain: what, then, is to be said of us? Therefore he says to him: 'And I have destroyed you, Cherub, protecting you from the midst of burning stones, so that you would not remain among the burning stones, but perish. O Cherub himself, or Cherubim, who protected you, I have brought you out from the midst of burning stones, according to what is also written about Adam: He drove out Adam, and stationed him (or Cherubim) opposite the paradise of delights (Gen. III, 24). And he gives the reasons why he was brought out, or cast out, from the midst of burning stones.' For your heart has been lifted up in your beauty, thinking that what is God's is yours. Therefore, the apostle says that he received a thorn in the flesh and an angel of Satan to buffet him, so that he would not be exalted by the greatness of his revelations and fall into the judgment of the devil (2 Corinthians 12). And so, your doctrine is corrupted, he says, along with your beauty, or you have lost your wisdom in your beauty. While you desire to be more than what you were created to be and to know more than what you have received from God, you have even lost what you had, and deformity and foolishness have possessed you instead of beauty and knowledge. Therefore, you have been cast down to the earth, you who once dwelled on the mountain of God. About which Isaiah writes: How has Lucifer fallen, who used to rise in the morning (Isa. XIV, 12)? And the Savior in the Gospel says: I saw, he said, Satan falling like lightning from heaven (Luke X). This is also what Jeremiah speaks to Jerusalem. How has the Lord darkened the daughter of Zion in His anger: He has cast down from heaven to earth the glory of Israel (Lamentations II, 1)? But you have been cast down in the sight of all kings, to terrify them by your example, either of good kings, whose heart is in the hand of God (Prov. XXI), or of evil ones, whose kingdoms the devil showed to the Savior (Matt. IV): who encountered the Babylonian king, saying: And you have been captured like us, and considered among us. Therefore, he defiled his sanctification which he had when he dwelt on the mountain and conversed among the burning stones. It follows: I will bring fire in the midst of you which shall devour you. This fire was kindled in the heart of the king of Tyre by him whose arrows are kindled, as it is written: All those who commit adultery are like an oven, their hearts (Hosea). About this fire, Isaiah also speaks: Walk in the light of your fire, and in the flame you have kindled (Isaiah 50), so that when you go out, it may devour the possessor, according to what is written in the same Isaiah: It consumed like the grass the fuel (Isaiah 5). On that day the mountains and hills and forests will be extinguished, and it will devour from soul to flesh. This fire, which is called alien, Nadab and Abihu offered to the altar of the Lord, and for this reason they were consumed by divine fire (Leviticus 10). Hence Moses says: This is the word that the Lord spoke: In those who approach me, I will sanctify myself. But the sanctification of God is the punishment of sinners. After this it is said: And I will turn you into ashes, so that all that you have built will be consumed by the fire of your guilty conscience. When you should have rested on the Sabbath, and should not have done any servile work, you gathered wood on the Sabbath so that you would have something to fuel the fire in your heart. He will also destroy all evil works, reducing them to ashes, so that the harmful fire may be completely extinguished, so that all may see and marvel at the destruction of the king of Tyre, and that it has become nothing, not for many centuries, but in one instant, or certainly forever, so that what is written may be fulfilled: I will not spare you, and I will not have pity. The Hebrews, among their other fables and genealogies and endless questions, are accustomed to understand these words against Hiram, king of Tyre, when they say that from Solomon to Ezekiel there are many years, which it is obvious that men did not live at that time: and thus they pronounce, as if the prophet spoke to him ironically: Are you the seal of the likeness of God, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty? You are adorned with all precious stones, you are a cherub, or created with a cherub: whereas in reality you have sinned, and you will be dissolved into ashes. And they add to their story a miracle, that contrary to Scripture, indeed without the authority of Scripture, they say that Hiram lived for a thousand years. But how violent this interpretation is, a prudent reader understands without our judgment.

<h2 id='tocuniq280'>(Vers. 20 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 20 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face against Sidon and prophesy against it, and say: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, Sidon, and I will be glorified in you. And they shall know that I am the Lord when I execute judgments in her and am sanctified in her. And I will send pestilence upon her and blood in her streets, and the slain shall fall in her midst, by the sword all around, and they shall know that I am the Lord. And there will no longer be a stumbling block of bitterness and a thorn inflicting pain in every direction for the house of Israel (or those who have insulted them). And they will know that I am the Lord their God. Thus says the Lord God: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples (or from the nations) among whom they are scattered, I will be sanctified in them before the nations. And they will dwell in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob, and they will dwell there securely (or in hope). And they will build houses and plant vineyards, and they will dwell confidently (or in hope) when I execute judgments on all who oppose them (or have insulted them) on every side. And they will know that I am the Lord their God. And what follows, according to the Septuagint: And you, the God of their fathers, is not found in Hebrew. Furthermore, after Tyre, the speech turns to Sidon; for both cities are part of the same province. And in the Gospel, Tyre and Sidon are mentioned together: If the miracles which were done in you were done in Tyre and Sidon (Matthew 11:21). Therefore, even the Canaanite woman, whose daughter was possessed by a demon, because she came from the region of Tyre and Sidon, obtained what she had asked for (ibid., 15). But the divine word predicts that it will be taken captive by the Babylonians, and it will know the weight of its evils, that He Himself is the Lord: when He has judged it, and has been sanctified in it, and has consumed it with hunger and pestilence, and with the sword: so that it falls in its streets, and no longer becomes a stumbling block to the people of God, nor does it frequently attack them. But when this has been done, the people of Israel, whom He had dispersed into various nations, will return to their own land, and they will be sanctified in them, not for evil, as in Sidon, but for good, when He has shown mercy to them, and they will dwell in the land which He gave to their father Jacob, and they will dwell securely, and in the Lord they will trust, and they will build houses, and plant vineyards, when He has fulfilled His promises to them: and then they will know that He Himself is the Lord, whose promises are most firm. Many refer to the time of Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, when the people of Israel returned and lived in the land of Judah. Others, however, hope for its fulfillment in the last time and in a thousand years. Moreover, according to spiritual understanding, this seems to have a symbolic meaning for us. Sidonians are interpreted as hunters, about whom it is also written in the Psalms: Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the snare of the hunters (Psalm 124:7). And in Proverbs: The eye of a harlot is the snare of a sinner (Prov. XXIII, 27). But there are also hunters on the good side, of whom Jeremiah writes: Behold, I will send fishermen and hunters, who will hunt you down from every hill and mountain (Jerem. XVI, 16): whom the Lord also sends to fish, and makes them fishers of men (Matth. IV). Hence the village of Peter and Andrew is called by this name: For Bethsaida in our language means 'the house of hunters'. Against these wretched hunters, the word of God is directed, and the prophet is commanded to set his face against Sidon and not waver in the wind of doctrine, but stand firm in the truth and destroy his hunters. So what is it that the Lord threatens against Sidon? Behold, I myself will come to you and be glorified in you when I destroy you, and all who live will know that I am the Lord when I repay you according to what you deserve. And I will send pestilence and blood into your streets. And rightly are they called streets of Sidon: for it is a wide and spacious road that leads to death (Matt. 7). And the slain will fall, those who stood evilly by the sword in a circle: by that sword which the Lord came to send upon the earth, so that He may separate what is improperly joined, and so that those who remain may know that He Himself is the Lord. And when they have ceased, there will no longer be any stumbling block of bitterness, nor a thorn that pierces and wounds the people of God. But all these things are said against the opposing powers, that they may be destroyed in the end time, and there may be eternal security when the Lord gathers the house of Israel, those who perceive God with understanding. And he will be sanctified in them, and that which is written will be fulfilled: Be holy, for I am holy (Leviticus 19:2). And they will dwell in their own land, as we read elsewhere: I believe in seeing the good things of the Lord in the land of the living (Psalm 16:13). What Jacob gave, who had supplanted his brother earlier, and earned the primacy for himself. And they will dwell in it securely, either in hope, and they will build houses, plant vineyards, and dwell confidently in hope, according to what is read in Isaiah: Those who have been weaned from milk, those who have been taken away from the breast, expect tribulation upon tribulation, and hope upon hope (Isa. 60). But they will build houses, as also built in the Gospel, who established foundations not on sand, but on rock (Matt. 7). Of which it is written: Unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who build it (Ps. 127:1). And in Exodus, according to the Septuagint: Because the midwives feared the Lord, they built houses for themselves (Exod. 1:21), and many such things. But when the Lord executes judgment against those who oppose or inflict insults on Israel, all creatures will know that He is the Lord, whose judgments are true and justified in themselves.


<h2 id='tocuniq281'>(Chap. XXIX.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chap. XXIX.—Vers. 1, 2.) In the tenth year (or according to the LXX, the twelfth), in the tenth month (or, according to the Hebrew, the twelfth), on the first (or one) day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt, and say: Thus says the Lord God. After Sidon, which is also situated on the coast of Phoenicia, the word of the Lord came to the prophet in the tenth year of the captivity of King Jehoiachin, in the twelfth month, and on the first day of the month, that he should set his face and strengthen himself against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and speak concerning him, and concerning all Egypt, against all of Egypt province. And prophesy regarding what will happen to them. But if we must say something about the numbers, which place does one hold among ten days: hence, at the beginning of Genesis, it is not said: There was evening and morning, the first day, but one day (Gen.1), in order to teach that the same day is always repeated: the tenth number holds the same order among ten decades, which is a hundred, and this number is taken up by the sacrificial lamb, so that it is sacrificed on the fourteenth day, and in this way it continues through its decades, with the order of its numbers proceeding to a thousand and ten thousand, and one hundred thousand, and beyond. But after the tenth year, the twelfth month is placed, so that the perfect number of twelve apostles and prophets (who are contained in one volume) may be shown. Moreover, according to the Septuagint, the tenth month, which is called Tebeth in Hebrew (), and in Egypt týbi, is called January by the Romans, because among them it is the door of the year: with all heat removed, it contains the beginning of winter cold. Let it suffice to have spoken about numbers. Moreover, that must be especially sought after, whether the Pharaoh referred to in Exodus, and Isaiah, and Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, and many other places, and in the Song of Songs is the same person or different individuals. And it seems to me that this word does not refer to a single person, but rather signifies the royal dignity among the Egyptians, like how the Romans called their emperors and kings from the first Caesar, Gaius Caesar, and the second, his adopted son Octavian, who was later named Augustus. And among the Syrians, there was Antiochus, among the Persians, there were the Arsacid kings, among the Philistines, Abimelech, and after Alexander, in Egypt, there were the Ptolemies until Cleopatra, who, when defeated at Actium, made Egypt a Roman province. Therefore, in the present time, the word of the Lord is directed against every king of Egypt, who is interpreted as the destroyer, the slayer and maimer, cutting and dividing all things with a sword. This is to be understood in a mystical sense referring to the power to which Egypt is subject. For no man would dare to say: 'The rivers are mine, and I have made them,' nor would the great dragon be called, sitting in the midst of its rivers; but Egypt is called Mizraim in Hebrew, and it is translated into our language as afflicting and troubling, narrowing down and oppressing those who are subject to it, and not lifting its eyes to heaven but, according to the Gospel and the example of that woman whom the devil had bent double for eighteen years, always sinking down to earthly things (Luke 13).' Let us therefore see what is the threat against Pharaoh and all of Egypt.

<h2 id='tocuniq282'>(Vers. 3 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 3 onwards) Behold, I am coming to you, Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, the great dragon, who lies (or sits) in the midst of your rivers, and you say: The river is mine, and I have made it for myself (or them). And I will put a bit (or a snare) in your jaws, and I will stick the fish of your rivers to your scales (or feathers), and I will draw you out of the midst of your rivers; and all your fish will cling to your scales (or feathers). And I will cast (or put) you out swiftly (or into the desert), and all the fish of your river will fall upon the face of the land (or your field). You shall not be gathered together, nor shall you be assembled; I have given you to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the air to be devoured. And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord; because you have become (or were) a staff (or reed) of the house of Israel, when they took (or he took) you with their hand ((Vulgate is silent on his hand)), and you were broken, and you bruised their every shoulder, and those leaning on you were shattered, and you broke (or shattered) all their loins. We combine both editions of brevity, where they do not differ much from each other. Otherwise, when there is a great difference, we present both. However, it speaks against Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, and under his figure it speaks to great power, to which Egypt is given to govern, and nevertheless it boasts against its Creator, claiming dominion over the land for itself, and entrusting itself to be worshipped by the Egyptian nations. And it speaks according to the location of the province, as if to a king, relying on the flood of the Nile and not greatly desiring rains from the sky, and thinking itself to be the author of itself, or of the rivers, that is, the canals and streams of the Nile made by itself. No, he said, I will not send an Angel, but, O great dragon, who lie and dwell in the middle of your rivers, I myself will come to you for punishment. For you have dared to say: The Nile river is mine, and I am its creator: or, I have made the river by which all Egypt is watered. And when I come, I will put a bridle in your jaws: or I will bind your mouth with reins, with which you boasted so mightily, and I will make all your allies and leaders, whom you call fish, cling to your feathers or scales, so that you are dragged out of the river and thrown out or cast down. For you have exalted yourself excessively in the desert. And you shall fall on the face of the field, or of your land, because Egypt is a flat province. Your body will not be gathered, nor will you be gathered, that is, you will not be buried, but I will give you to be devoured by beasts and birds of the sky, so that when the inhabitants of Egypt see these judgments executed upon you, they may know that I am the Lord. But these things shall happen to you because you have deceived my people Israel with your false aid, so that they would not trust in their God and Creator, but in you. You were a reed staff to them, according to Isaiah (Isa. XXX), or an empty rod, and a very fragile reed, which, when they leaned on it, proved to be useless, so that when they leaned on it, it would break and tear their shoulder, and the hand with which they held on. And while they trusted in you, all the loins of those who fell to the ground would be broken, and those who received help from you would be wounded. But these things are said metaphorically as if to the king of Egypt, because even the province itself was not an adversary to Israel, but while it made great promises, it would separate them from God's help. But according to the anagoge, we often read about the opposing power of the dragon. Therefore, Pharaoh is called the scatterer, because he separates and disconnects from God, and Egypt, that is, Egypt (), is turned into a tribulation and affliction for those whom it can subjugate. This dragon is a transgressor, of whom Job speaks very fully (Job 41). And in the Psalms it is written: You have broken the heads of the dragon, and have given him as food to the people of Ethiopia (Psalm 74:14). And the great dragon is said to be compared to the smaller dragons, of which it is sung in the psalm: You have broken the heads of the dragons in the waters (Ibid.). And in another place: This great and spacious sea with hands. There are reptiles there without number: small animals with large ones, there the ships will pass: This dragon which you have formed to mock him (Ibid., CIII, 25 seqq.). As it is said in another place: He is the king of all that are in the waters, and the beginning of the representation of the Lord, who was made to be mocked by his angels (Job. XLI, 24, sec. LXX). But he sits, or lies down, in the midst of his rivers, not of one river, but of many, which we receive in various heresies, through which he flowed into Egypt of this age, and watered the souls of the deceived, not with rain from heaven, but with turbid waters from the earth, which Jeremiah does not forbid to drink, saying: What to you and the ways of Egypt, that you drink the water of Geon (Jerem. XI, 18) ? For which it is written in Hebrew Sior (), which word is translated into turbid and muddy waters. But so that we may understand what the rivers of the Egyptian dragon are, we will be able to know from their opposites. The Lord speaks of his rivers: Whoever believes in me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water (John 7:37). And to the Samaritan woman: Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life (John 4:13-14). These are the rivers coming from heaven, of which David sings: The stream of the river makes the city of God glad (Psalm 46:4): undoubtedly it signifies the Church. Therefore, let us consider what is the punishment or penalty of the dragon. It follows: And I will put a bit or a noose in your jaws. This is similar to what Job says: You will draw out the dragon with a fishhook, and put a bridle around his nose. He trusts that the Jordan will enter into his mouth; he will receive it in his eye. However, a hook will pierce his nose, and a ring will be in his lips (Job 40:19). The Lord puts a bit in the jaws of this dragon, and pierces his lips and binds them with a ring. This happens when He silences him through Ecclesiastical men who are well-versed in the Holy Scriptures, and all the teachings of wickedness are dissolved. And the fish of its rivers agglutinate with its own wings, or scales, with which the heretics, through pride, hasten to high things, so that they themselves, bound together with the dragon, may become one body with it, and may be united to it either in the fellowship of error, or in the likeness of punishment: just as one who cleaves to the Lord is one spirit (I Cor. VI, 17). And indeed, the Egyptian dragon does not have one river, but many rivers, with which it waters humble and lowly Egypt, which has nothing in itself of mountains: nor the waters of Siloam, which flow silently, but turbid and muddy (Isa. VIII). And the Lord will remove him from the midst of his rivers, so that he does not incubate over them, nor sit upon them: and all the fish will adhere to his scales, according to the quality of his vices, throughout the body of the dragon, either to the head, or to the belly, or to the tail, and to the extremities sticking to it: so that when the dragon is removed, the fish also, which adhere to him, be likewise removed. And I will cast you, he says, into the desert, so that you will never find anyone to deceive. Surely, I will cast you down from the summit of your pride, and I will cast you down swiftly, according to the words of the Apostle: 'The God of peace will quickly crush Satan beneath your feet' (Rom. XVI, 20); so that the dragon, broken and cast down, the fish of that river may also be cast down, and the author of crimes may fall, who previously thought he could stand and run throughout the whole world. Let him fall upon the face of his own land, to which he was precipitated from heaven, so that he may no longer be gathered or congregated in the heretical Churches, nor buried among those who believed in him when they have been freed from him, but let him be given over to be devoured by the beasts of the earth and the birds of the sky. Regarding the beasts, it is written: 'Do not give the soul confessing to you to the beasts' (Psalm 73:19). And the birds of the sky, which eat the seed along the path, are interpreted to be the devils by the Savior (Matthew 13). For not only the prince of evil, but also his disciples are called devils, according to what is said of Judas: 'Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?' (John 6:71). The birds of the sky are called birds because they promise themselves things that are lofty, so that after the dragon with its fish is cast down and handed over to be devoured by the beasts of the earth, which have no gentleness in themselves, and by those who are blown about by every wind of doctrine (Ephesians 4), then all the inhabitants of this world may understand that he himself is the Lord. But the whole reason for punishments is that Israel sought help in vain, and it was a rod or reed staff, empty and void, having nothing of fullness in itself, because it could not say: But we all received from his fullness (John 1:16); when the Scripture commands: You shall not appear before the Lord your God empty or void (Exodus 23:15). And that we should not seek help from Egypt, Scripture elsewhere testifies: Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help (Isaiah 31:1). He taunts King Hezekiah with a reed staff like this and Rabsaces in vain, saying: Behold, you trust in a reed staff and in this broken staff, over Egypt: on whom if anyone leans, it enters his hand. Thus is Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to all who trust in him. And indeed, he lied about the righteous king, mentioning these things, who is interpreted as 'multus poculo'. For he was intoxicated with the golden cup of Babylon, and therefore he fed his own people to the Lord who they confess. But here the pharaoh is reproached because he made the house of Israel to trust in a rod or reed, which promised them vain and fragile help, quickly to be broken. But that we may know what the reed rod is, on which the house of Israel ought not to trust, we may understand from the opposite rod and staff of the Lord, of which it is said to the Lord:  Thy rod and thy staff, they have comforted me  (Psalm 23:4). Aaron also had this rod, which devoured the Egyptian serpents, and when he struck the banks of the Nile, mosquitoes were generated in the whole of Egypt (Exodus VII, VIII). Moses also, according to the Septuagint, extended this rod and raised it to the heavens, and the Lord brought a south wind upon the land all that day and all that night, and in the morning the wind lifted locusts and brought them upon all the land of Egypt. I think that this rod is also mentioned in the Book of Numbers, that it blossomed and bore nuts or almonds (Numbers XVII). The Apostle had this when he said: What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod? (I Cor. IV, 21). And those who celebrated the Passover held staffs in their hands, without which they could not support the weakness of the human body and eat the flesh of the lamb. This is the rod from the root of Jesse, upon which the seven spirits rested. But not like Pharaoh, nor like the staff of Egypt and the reed rod that deceives those who grasp it and tears their shoulders, that is, their strength. And whoever leans on it, his loins are loosened and he cannot stand; nor can he celebrate Passover, girded with his loins. This is fitting for those whose hearts and kidneys God examines.

<h2 id='tocuniq283'>(Vers. 8 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 8 and following) Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and will cut off from you man and beast. And the land of Egypt shall become a desolation (or destruction) and a wilderness: and they shall know that I am the Lord: because he (or you) said, My river is mine, and I have made it (or My rivers are mine, and I have made them). Therefore behold, I am against you and against your rivers: and I will make the land of Egypt desolate, cut off by the sword from Migdol to Syene (or from Migdol to Syene and beyond) to the border of Ethiopia. The foot of man shall not pass through it, nor shall the foot of beast tread upon it; it shall not be inhabited for forty years. And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated countries, and her cities shall be desolate for forty years. And I will scatter (or disperse) the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries. For thus says the Lord God: After the end of forty years, I will gather Egypt (or the Egyptians) from the peoples (or nations) among whom they were scattered. And I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and I will place them in the land of Phatures, in the land of their birth (or in the land from which they were taken). And there they shall be in a humble kingdom (or principality), among the other kingdoms it shall be the most humble (or lowest). And they shall no longer be elevated above the nations, and I will diminish them so that they will not rule over the nations (or so that there are not many among the nations). And they shall no longer be a confidence (or hope) to the house of Israel, teaching iniquity in order to flee and follow them (or in order to remember the iniquity and follow them). And they shall know that I am the Lord God. You were a reed staff to the house of Israel, and not only were you broken in his hand, but according to Isaiah (Isa. XXXVI), you pierced his hand, and now you have torn his shoulder, and you yourself are broken, and you have loosened the loins of those who leaned on you. Therefore, I will bring the sword of the enemies upon you, and I will devastate both men and animals, and the land of Egypt will be reduced to desolation, and the Egyptians will know for the second time that I am the Lord. But I will not be content with this; but because he burst forth into such great blasphemy, that he said his own rivers were gods, and all the abundance of Egypt: therefore I will take away him who said he was the Creator, and the rivers which he had boasted were created by him, and I will reduce the land of Egypt to a long wilderness, and it will be destroyed by the sword, from the tower of Syene to the borders of Ethiopia. They called the tower, which in Hebrew is called Magdal (), 'the tower of the LXX,' so that they would write Μαγδαλὸν. However, the tower of Syene still stands today, a fortress subject to Roman rule, where the cataracts of the Nile are located, and up to which place our sea is navigable. Therefore, he says that the whole of Egypt must be depopulated until the borders of Ethiopia, where the outermost region of Egypt is joined, so that the chief priests may not cross into Egypt, nor may any animals be found there, and it may not be inhabited for forty years. For Egypt is spared, and because the Israelites were once guests there, the punishment is of shorter duration. Tyre celebrated its sabbaths for seventy years, and thus it was restored to its former state. The captivity of Judah and the destruction of the temple lasted for seventy years, until the reign of Cyrus, king of Persia. For the mighty will endure mighty torments (Wisdom 6:7). And when it says, 'I will make the land of Egypt a desolation, in the midst of desolated countries,' it refers to the Philistines, Edomites, Moabites, and all the other regions against which the prophecy of the prophets was given. Then he will scatter or disperse the Egyptians into nations, and will scatter them into lands. Because the Lord is merciful and compassionate, patient and full of mercy, after forty years the restoration of Egypt will occur, and all the captivity will be brought back to the ancient land, and will be placed in the metropolis city, which is called Phaturos, where it originated and from where it set forth: but only in such a way that it loses its ancient pride for its own benefit, and becomes a humble kingdom, or rather the humblest of all nations: so that it does not elevate itself above other peoples, nor have dominion over them; but reduced to a small number, it will by no means deceive the house of Israel with its confidence, nor teach them wickedness; whether it brings them to remembrance of their wickedness, that they sought the aid of Egypt by abandoning the help of God. And all these things will happen so that the Egyptians may know on the third day that He Himself is the Lord. We have briefly explained these matters, laying the foundations of history. Now the cloud of allegory must be discussed, and we will try to avoid both brevity and the lengthiness of this explanation. This is a discourse about the dragon, who said: 'The rivers are mine, and I made them.' (Above, same.) May the Lord Himself bring a sword upon him, as it is written in Isaiah: 'My sword is intoxicated in the sky; now it will descend to the earth to destroy humans and animals from it.' (Isaiah 34:5) Whatever the dragon seems to possess, whether of reason or simplicity, should be destroyed, not absolutely, but by the dragon itself, so that the dragons may perish and God may live, and the land of Egypt may become a wasteland, according to the higher understanding, whatever the dragon may perish by, and after its destruction, be reduced to solitude, ceasing to have the worst guest. And then shall men and beasts know, and the earth, being ruined, that He is the Lord, in that sense in which it is written in the seventy-seventh Psalm: When He slew them, then they sought Him (Ps. LXXVII, 34). For everyone who seeks, finds. It is indeed an act of God's mercy that the abundance of this world perishes, and the rivers of Egypt are dried up, and even their land becomes a desert, and the purpose of the Lord is scattered from the Tower of Syene, which means a circle, so that it may not have any righteousness in itself, even to the land of the Ethiopians, who are called the humble ones, so that every pride that had exalted itself against the knowledge of God may be destroyed and humbled for its own salvation. Neither the foot of man, that is, anything rational, passes through Egypt, nor does the foot of an animal walk in it: so that it does not hold even the simple ones, whom Pharaoh desired to keep in Egypt after dismissing the people, Moses objecting, and desiring that even the animals be liberated from the captivity of Egypt. And it shall not be inhabited for forty years, which number is always one of affliction and punishment. Hence Moses, and Elijah, and the Savior himself, fasted for forty days and nights, and the people were in the wilderness for forty years, so that afterwards they would be freed in Gilgal, having been circumcised, from the reproach and shame of Egypt (Exod. XXXIV; III Reg. IX; Matth. IV; Num. XIV). In the sacrament of this number, the prophet of the tribe of Judah also slept on the right side for forty days, and it was announced that the people would serve in Egypt for four hundred years (Gen. 7). They make forty decades, or four hundreds. The rains of the flood last for forty days and bring shipwreck to the world. For it was just that the one who offends God by loving and cherishing the four elements of the world, which are said to constitute everything, should be punished in that very number. And Israel, who sinned on the Sabbath, would endure the punishment of seventy years, which is the punishment of seven decades. And the barren land of Egypt is given, and its cities in the midst of the lands and of the subverted cities, which are not built of stones, but of mud and straw, so that Egypt, which was joined together poorly, may be dispersed and scattered into the lands, and so that the wheat may be separated from the straw, and when the completion of forty years is reached, there may be restitution of Egypt, and its captivity may be brought back, and it may be placed in the land of Phatures, which is interpreted as trampled bread; where that bread which said, 'I am the bread that came down from heaven' (John 6:5), was trampled upon by heretical wickedness: so that when they come to the Church, they may dwell in trampled bread, and may not be lifted up in pride, but may be in a humble kingdom. And also, when they are restored to their previous state, they should humble themselves, because they lived in Egypt and built brick cities, and among many kingdoms they should be humble in the Church, and they should know whom they have sinned against, and Egypt should no longer be exalted above the Churches throughout the divided world, but should be reduced to a few, and only a few should remain among the nations, according to what is written: Give them, O Lord. What will you give them? Give them a barren womb and dried-up breasts (Hosea 9:4), so that they may not rejoice and exalt themselves in the multitude of deceivers, but be reduced to a few: For many are called, but few are chosen (Matthew 20). And let them no longer deceive the house of Israel, that is, the Church; nor promise them vain hope and confidence, teaching iniquity, so that they may avoid the discipline of the Church and pursue Egyptian pleasures. But these things will happen so that the Egyptians may know for the third time that He Himself is the Lord. This, it seems to me, is said for this reason: that the first knowledge of the Egyptians is in the flesh, the second in the soul, the third in the spirit. First, upon the earth; second, after the completion of the conversation of this world; third, after the resurrection.

<h2 id='tocuniq284'>(Vers. 17 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 17 onwards) And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre; every head was made bald, and every shoulder was rubbed bare; yet he had no wages, nor his army, for Tyre, for the service that he had served against it. Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will give Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon the land of Egypt; and he shall take its multitude, and take its spoil, and take its prey; and it shall be the wages for his army. I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor that he has performed for me, says the Lord God. On that day the horn of the house of Israel will sprout, and I will give you an open mouth in the midst of them, and they will know that I am the Lord. It is asked how after the tenth year of the previous discourse, immediately the twenty-seventh year is placed, and in the following years the twelfth and the thirteenth, and in the final description of the temple, the twenty-fifth. But the solution is easy. Because both the prophecy about Egypt and the previous one, and the one that is now being spoken, are covered, although they have been made at different times: yet they are joined together because they prophesy about one province. And we often read in Jeremiah, that times are described in a preposterous order. For the deeds of Zedekiah are reported first, and then those of Joachim who came before him. But in the Psalms, because it is a lyric poem, the order of the events is not sought. So let us speak first according to the letter. When Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre, and because it was surrounded by the sea, he could not join the rams, machines, and vineyards to the walls, he ordered an infinite multitude of the army to carry rocks and mounds, and when the middle sea, or rather the narrow strait, was filled, he made the neighboring shore an uninterrupted island. When the Tyrians saw that the city was now completely finished and that the foundations of the walls were being shaken by the battering of the rams, they loaded onto ships whatever precious things they had in gold, silver, clothing, and various furnishings that the nobility possessed, and carried them to the islands, so that after capturing the city, Nebuchadnezzar found nothing worthy of his hard work. And because he had obeyed God's will in this matter, after a few years of captivity in Tyre, Egypt was given to him; and Tyrus was much more cruel to Egypt. For she was attacking Jerusalem; this one was promising empty assistance. Indeed, it is one thing to deceive weakness with hope: it is another thing to fight against the people of God. Therefore, this is what Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, says: in the siege of Tyre, he made his army serve me, so that I may fulfill my will. Every head is shaved, and every shoulder is made hairless, carrying baskets of earth and stones with which shoulders are shaved, and the head is shaved; and yet neither he nor his army found anything worthy in Tyre. And when he served me in this way, and fulfilled my will against Tyre, therefore I will give him the land of Egypt. Some say that this was accomplished under Nebuchadnezzar; others say under Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, who devastated Egypt as far as Ethiopia, to the extent of killing the sacred bull Apis and destroying all their statues. For this reason, they believe that he was turned mad by the chance of a horse and killed himself with his own dagger. Herodotus recounts this history in great detail, describing all of Egypt through its villages, castles, and towns, and revealing the origin of the Nile and the people of that land, as well as the measurement of the land around to the desert of Ethiopia and the shores of the Great Sea, bordering Libya and Arabia. But the cause of the Lord's anger against Egypt is that it deceived His people by not allowing them to hope in God and by provoking Him to anger. On that day when Egypt is captured, the horn of the house of Israel will sprout: undoubtedly indicating a royal lineage. Some refer this to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, who was descended from the line of David through Jeconiah, while others refer it to the ultimate time, when they believe that Elijah will come. But we, by understanding the Lord's horn to be Christ, interpret the present history. And when, he says, this has been accomplished first, then your mouth will be opened, and your prophecy will not hang on uncertain promises, but it will be seen accomplished in action: so that all who hear may know that I am the Lord, of whom it has been said and done. These things, according to the letter, indeed according to the truth, have been spoken as prophecies. Furthermore, from the fact that Nebuchadnezzar received a reward for his good work, we also understand that even the Gentiles, if they do something good, are not overlooked by God's judgment without a reward. Therefore, through Jeremiah, Nebuchadnezzar is called the dove of God because he served the will of God against the sinful people. 'And I will bring my servant Nebuchadnezzar' (Jeremiah 25).' From this, it is clear that we are condemned in comparison to the Gentiles if they follow the natural law, which we also neglect even though it is written. Paul the Apostle discusses this matter at length in his letter to the Romans. And lest we seem to overlook anything according to spiritual understanding, we inquire where we find this number, that is, the twenty-seventh. In the book of Genesis, Scripture testifies (Gen. VII) that in the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the waters of the flood came upon the earth, and after seven months of the same year, which is near the Sabbath, and on the twenty-seventh day of the seventh month, the waters of the flood ceased, and Noah's ark settled on the mountains of Ararat, which are interpreted as Armenia. From this we understand that the number is average and can be applied to both, when in this and the anger of God begins from the flood, and his mercy is shown in the seventh month on the same day. And because among the Hebrews the month, which with us is measured by the Kalends, Nones, and Ides, is calculated according to the course of the moon: whence also in the Greek language it has received the name μήνη, that is, moon, it is said that on the twenty-seventh day of the moon there remained little light, so that his anger may not be without mercy. But when the whole orb of the moon is filled up, then both Easter is celebrated and all the greatest solemnities. Which we have set down strictly, so that we may know that in this number, both good and evil are contained equally. Good for Nebuchadnezzar, to whom his labor is rewarded; evil for the Egyptians, whose destruction is announced.

(Chapter 30, Verses 1 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, prophesy and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Howl ye, woe, woe to the day: For the day is near, yea the day of the Lord is near, a day of cloud, the time of the nations shall be. And the sword shall come upon Egypt: and there shall be dread in Ethiopia, when the wounded shall fall in Egypt, and the multitude thereof shall be taken away, and the foundations thereof shall be destroyed. Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the rest of the people, and Chub, and the children of the land of the covenant, shall fall with them by the sword. Thus says the Lord God: The supports of Egypt shall fall, and the pride of her power shall come down; from Migdol to Syene they shall fall within her by the sword, says the Lord God. And they shall be desolate in the midst of the desolate countries, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are laid waste. And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed. In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the confident Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, surely it is coming. Thus says the Lord God: I will make the multitude of Egypt cease by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He and his people with him, the most ruthless of nations, shall be brought to destroy the land. They shall draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain. I will make the rivers dry and sell the land into the hand of the wicked; I will make the land desolate and all that is in it, by the hand of foreigners. I, the Lord, have spoken. Thus says the Lord God: I will destroy the idols and put an end to the idols in Memphis. There will no longer be a ruler in the land of Egypt, and I will bring terror to the land of Egypt. I will destroy the land of Pathros and bring fire to Taphnis. I will bring judgment upon Alexandria and pour out my anger upon the stronghold of Egypt, Pelusium. I will kill the multitude of Alexandria and bring fire to Egypt. Pelusium will suffer like a woman in labor, and Alexandria will be laid waste, with daily distress in Memphis. The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastus (or Bugastus) will fall by the sword, and the captives themselves will be led away. And in Taphnis the day will darken, when I shatter the scepters of Egypt and the pride of its power fails in it. It will be covered by clouds, and its daughters will be led into captivity. And I will execute judgments on Egypt, and they will know that I am the Lord. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, prophesy and say: Thus says the Lord God: Woe to the day! For the day is near, the day of the Lord is near; it will be a day of clouds, the end of the nations. And the sword shall come upon the Egyptians, and there will be turmoil in Ethiopia. And those wounded shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away its multitude, and its foundations shall be destroyed. Persians, and Cretans, and Lydians, and Libyans, and all the mixed peoples, and from the sons of my covenant they shall fall by the sword. Thus says the Lord God. And the supports of Egypt shall be cut down, and the pride of its strength shall come down from Migdol to Syene. They shall fall by the sword in it, says the Lord God. And it shall be desolated in the midst of the desolated regions, and its cities shall be in the midst of deserted cities, and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I bring fire upon Egypt, and all who support it are destroyed. In that day, messengers shall go forth from my presence, hastening to destroy the hope of Ethiopia, and there shall be great turmoil among them on the day of Egypt, for behold, it is coming. Thus says the Lord God. And I will destroy the multitude of Egyptians by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon himself, and his people with him, sent from the nations to destroy the land. And they will unsheath all their swords against Egypt, and the land will be filled with the wounded. And I will make their rivers desolate, and I will deliver the land into the hands of the wicked, and I will destroy the land and its abundance in the hands of foreigners. I, the Lord, have spoken. For thus says the Lord God: And I will destroy the abominations, and I will cause the officials of Memphis to fail, and the princes of the land of Egypt, and they will exist no longer. And I will bring terror to the land of Egypt, and I will destroy the land of Pathros, and I will bring fire upon Tahpanhes, and I will execute vengeance in Diospolis, and I will pour out my fury upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt, and I will destroy the multitude of Memphis. And I will set fire to Egypt, and there will be a great commotion in Sais, and there will be a division in Diospolis, and the waters will be scattered. The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastis will fall by the sword, and the women will be taken captive, and in Taphnis the day will become dark when I break the scepters of Egypt there, and the strength of its power will be destroyed, and a cloud will cover it, and its daughters will be taken captive, and I will bring judgment on Egypt, and they will know that I am the Lord. After the twenty-seventh year of the captivity of King Joachim, we return to the present time when he began to prophesy against Egypt, that is, in the tenth year and the tenth month, on the eleventh day of the month. And the Lord commanded him to speak to all nations, and especially to Egypt. So what is it that he speaks? Howl, woe, woe to the day, for the day is near and the day of the Lord is approaching. It is not a bright shining sun, but a day covered with clouds, bringing a storm upon Babylon. And when the sword begins to devastate Egypt, there will be fear in Ethiopia, which is near Egypt, lest the Babylonian blade reach her even to herself. For the wounded will fall in Egypt, and its multitude will be taken away, and all its foundations will be destroyed, so that if someone from Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and from other various peoples is found in Egypt, and Chub, which Symmachus translates as Arabia, and from the sons of the covenant with the land, that is, from the people of the Jews, let them fall with that sword. For which nations, seventy were appointed: the Persians, and the Cretans, and the Lydians, and the Libyans, and all the mixed peoples, and the children of my covenant with the sword they will fall. And in order that we may know that all these nations were in aid of Egypt, the following speech demonstrates: And those supporting Egypt will collapse, that is, its allies, and all the pride of its empire, or the insult of its strength will be destroyed and deposed from the tower of Syene, which we said was located at the farthest borders of Egypt, or from Magdalo to Syene, as the seventy translated: all the cities of Egypt will be deserted, so that they may know the Lord, when the fire of the Chaldeans has devastated everything, and all his helpers have been worn down, and messengers have arrived near Aquila and Theodotion Siim, which Symmachus translated, hastening: we turn to the ships; for this is how we have received it from the Hebrews: so that all of Ethiopia's confidence may be crushed, and when the neighboring province has been laid waste, fear may grip the nearest. But in order that we may know who that sword is, which devastates Egypt and terrifies Ethiopia, it follows more clearly: And I will cause the multitude of Egypt to cease in the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who shall not only come, but shall come with many accompanying nations, so that all of Egypt shall be filled with the blood of the slain, and the wrath of the Lord shall be so great that the channels of the rivers, that is, the canals of the Nile, shall be dried up to the ground, and the land shall be deserted in the hand of the pestilence, or the multitude of the worst men of Egypt. For my words cannot be in vain, and there will be such indignation that the images of Egypt will be dispersed and the idols of Memphis, which is still the capital of Egyptian superstition, will cease to exist, whether it be the nobles and leaders of Memphis or the whole land of Egypt. But such terror will possess all of Egypt that the whole land of Phatures will perish and fire will devastate Taphnis, or as the Septuagint translates it, Tanin. And he said, 'I will establish law courts in Alexandria, which is called so today. But it had the former name 'No', which Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion translated as it is in Hebrew. For this, I do not know why, the Seventy, wishing something, said 'Diospolis', which is a small city of Egypt. But we have placed 'No' for Alexandria, by anticipation, which is called 'prolepsis' in Greek, according to that Virgilian phrase (Aeneid, book IV):

And I will pour out my indignation upon Sais, which we have turned into Pelusium, and it is called the strength of Egypt, because it has the safest harbor, and the sea trade is exercised there to the greatest extent. Hence the poet calls it 'lentil of Pelusium' (Virgil, Georgics I), not because this type of legume is produced there, or primarily there; but because it is brought from Thebes and all of Egypt through the Nile river to that place in large quantities. And he said, 'I will destroy the multitude of Alexandria, which is again situated in Hebrew No, not in Diospolis, but in Memphis, they transferred it to LXX. And to show that the city was populous at that time, he said, 'I will destroy the multitude of No (); and I will give fire, that is, the king of Babylon in Egypt, who will lay waste everything like fire. Sain, that is, Pelusium, will groan like a woman in labor: or it will be disturbed by turmoil; and in Alexandria, that is, in No, there will be a rupture, and the waters will be dispersed, for which they transferred it back to LXX Diospolis. However, it is the custom of the Egyptians, because of the flooding of the Nile, to build high embankments along the banks of the Nile. If these embankments are breached due to the negligence of the caretakers or the excessive magnitude of the water, the surrounding fields are not irrigated by water, but are instead overwhelmed and ravaged. This signifies that Egypt should be occupied by the Chaldean army in the same way that it is usually covered and corrupted by the overflowing waters of the Nile. Because of the flooding of the waters, and the breaking and breaching of the dikes, it is written in Hebrew: 'And there shall be daily distress in Memphis, where the Nile is divided, and where the temple of Apis is, and the oracles give their answers, there let daily distresses occur. The young men of Heliopolis, which in Hebrew is called On, and of Bubastis, another city, shall fall by the sword, so that the cities themselves, that is, their inhabitants or women, shall be taken into captivity, who are of the sex that is subject to harm.' But in Taphnis, which is the royal city, the scepters of Egypt, that is, the entire royal race, will be destroyed. And when its power, with the killing of the princes, is ended, then the day will darken, and all things will be filled with darkness and shadows, so that the city itself is covered in a cloud of sorrow and mourning, and its daughters, that is, the remaining towns, will be led into captivity. After I have executed judgments in Egypt and demonstrated that I am the judge of all, then the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord. We have described these elements as if for little children, so that they may be able to reach the reading of prose or poetry through letters, syllables, names, and the context of words. Now let us undertake anthropology and demonstrate, in a short like a painted picture, the very wide sea of discussion. The Word of the Lord, who was always in the Father, became a prophet, and He calls him not by his own name but the Son of Man. This is always understood in a good sense in the Holy Scriptures, specifically in the singular number, as in this same prophet, and in Daniel, and in the Gospel. Furthermore, the plural number is read in the opposite sense, as in this example: Sons of men, their teeth are weapons and arrows, and their tongue is a sharp sword (Psalm 56:5). And again: Sons of men, how long will you have heavy hearts? (Psalm 4:3). For the lion roars, and who will not be afraid? The Lord has spoken, and who will not prophesy? (Amos 3:8). Woe, woe to the day, says the Lord. For the day is near, and it approaches, says the Lord. It will be a day of clouds, a time or end of nations. Duplex consummatio est, aut generaliter omnium, quando finis advenerit, aut specialiter singulorum, quando tempus mortis institerit. Juxta autem dicitur, quia aeternitati comparatum, omne tempus breve est. Unde et Jacob centum et triginta annos quibus dixerat: pauci, inquit, et pessimi sunt dies mei  (Gen. XLVII, 9) . Et Psalmista de universi generis humani fragilitate disputans, ait: Dies nostri quasi  umbra pertransierunt  (Ps. CXLIII, 4) . Considering this, we will not be lifted up by power, nor will we be incubating with wealth, nor will we rejoice in happiness, knowing that all things must quickly be taken away. And the beautiful day of the Lord is said to be when the conversation of the entire world will be destroyed, and with error removed, the truth will appear as one, and the days of clouds and mist. For no one, fearless and uncertain, awaits the judge without fear of judgment. And the time or end of the nations will not only be of the Egyptian nation, but of all nations, so that it may be made clear that prophesy applies to all nations. Following, a flaming sword will come to Egypt, a versatile sword, divine word, that will divide the good from the evil and consume the wicked with its fire. But in Egypt of this age, there will be fear in Ethiopia, those who stray through Egypt in the night of error and dwell in darkness, and whose darkness does not easily or at all turn to light. And those who have stood in wickedness will fall wounded in Egypt. And the multitude of Egypt will be taken away. For wide and spacious is the path that leads to death (Matthew 7:13). And its foundations will be destroyed, so that nothing of Egypt's former firmness remains: but with the desolate and worse foundations, let the foundation of Christ be laid, on which the Church will be built. For every plant that the heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted (Matthew 7). Hence Jeremiah is commanded to destroy what has been built, in order to build better things (Jeremiah 1). The Ethiopians, Libyans, and Lydians, or according to the Seventy, the Persians, Cretans, Lydians, Libyans, and Chub, that is, the Arabs, and all the remaining common people, whom the Seventy translated as hybrids and mixtures. All of these, due to the diversity of vices and the interpretation of names that we have placed in the vision of Tyre, we can understand as different nations. Hence, the Apostle says: You, he says, who are called Uncircumcision, Gentiles in the flesh (Ephesians 2:11). For never would He have said that the nations are flesh and that others are spirit, as in another place: 'Behold Israel according to the flesh.' Hence it must be provided with special care that we do not turn back in our hearts to Egypt, from which we once have come forth, and that we do not find ourselves among the other nations and perish by the sword. As it is said in what follows: 'The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastus shall fall by the sword.' This will happen especially when the sons of the earth of the covenant or Testament of Mine are struck with the sword, of whom it is written: 'Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, who trust in horses and chariots.' (Isa. 31:1) But if the people of other nations are slaughtered in Egypt, how much more will the sons of the earth, the covenant and Testament of God, be contemptuous of the bread of Angels, the pumpkins, onions, garlic, and cucumbers of Egypt (Num. XI) . Then the supports and props of Egypt, which sustained it in wickedness, will fall, along with the clever arguments of dialecticians and the tricks of philosophers. Also, the contemptuous and proud empire will be destroyed, those who speak arrogantly and consider Ecclesiastical simplicity meaningless. For indeed, from the tower of Syene to those things which are at the furthest boundaries of Egypt, adjoining Ethiopia and the Blemmys: where the Nile is unnavigable and the clamor of cataracts, and everything is impassable and full of serpents and poisonous animals. But if, as we said above, 'Magdala' sounds forth magnificence and 'Syene' a circle, it is clear that the riches of Egypt and its insolent power and magnificence, that is, boasting and exaltation, perish by force even to the circle of Egypt, where nothing is stable; rather, it turns in an uncertain course and reaches ruin. Then the cities of Egypt will be scattered, and the land will be deserted, and no assembly will remain, having any firmness, so that at the end of things they may know that He Himself is the Lord, when He sends fire into Egypt, which the Lord desires to burn, like hay, wood, and straw, which have been built upon the foundation of Christ, and all helpers of perverse doctrines will be crushed. From this it is to be understood that the knowledge of a false name, and those of whom it is written: Scatter the nations that desire war (Ps. LXVII, 32), are called partners and helpers of Egypt. On that day, they say, those messengers will go forth from the face of God, of whom it is written in the Gospel: Their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven (Matthew 18:20). And in the parable of the sower, the reapers are angels, that is, those who are messengers, are sent to gather all scandals and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth (Ibid. 13). And they will hasten to fulfill the command in order to deter or crush the confidence of Ethiopia, who have reached the highest peak of wickedness, so that Ethiopia may be crushed in the overthrow of Egypt, and may fear, because it is the day of the Lord's vengeance and vindication, when the darkness of sinners will flee and the light of virtues will remain. And he says, 'I will make the multitude of Egypt cease in the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to whom they were delivered to be punished. For he is the enemy and avenger who also received a reward, because he served in the conquest of Tyre, the multitude of Egypt, so that many in Egypt may cease who have always been there. But if anyone opposes, how can it be said in Deuteronomy: Your fathers descended to Egypt with seventy souls, but now you have become as numerous as the stars of heaven (Deut. X, 22): it is easily solved.' For He did not establish an example of the earthly multitude, but of the heavenly, which shines with virtues and is full of light, above which the bravest of nations, bring brought by the Lord, are proclaimed, so that they may scatter the earth, on behalf of whom the Seventy interpreters of plagues were sent. Which I do not know how it is consistent with those who are brought by the Lord, unless perhaps according to that example, the sending in of the very worst angels (Psalm 77:19): who will unsheath their swords upon Egypt, and will fill the land with the slain or the wounded, so that they may feel themselves to have been killed and wounded, and to such an extent Egypt is destroyed and has fallen into nothingness, that all the rivers of eloquence by which the errors of the Egyptians were washed away, with reeds and a pen, should dry up and be handed over into the hands of the worst, who may torment them, and the fullness of the land of Egypt, which had grown in evil, may be blotted out in the hands of foreign gods. For neither good, but wicked angels are put in charge of torments. It is necessary for them to know that the Lord has spoken. This is frequently assumed so that those who hear may know that these are not the words of prophets, but of the Lord, whose commandments cannot be nullified. It follows: And I will destroy the idols, which are abominations. The Seventy translated it: And I will cause the idols or the chief men of Memphis to cease, and the leader or prince in the land of Egypt will no longer exist. For it is the very character of the most merciful Lord to overthrow what is falsely constructed, so that no likeness which feigns the image of truth may remain in Egypt. Let the nobles of Memphis also perish, which is interpreted from the mouth; concerning which all the idols have been set up, so that with their heads cut off and the masters of the idols destroyed, there may be no ruler in Egypt, and all Egypt may be filled with terror and destruction. Concerning its cities, it is said: And I will destroy the land of Pathros, and I will bring fire upon Taphnehes, or upon Tanis, and I will execute judgments in No, which the Seventy translated as Diospolis; and I will pour out my indignation upon Zoan, the stronghold of Egypt. Phatures is interpreted as the crushing of bread; Taphnis, a humble command; Diospolis, for which the name Noah is given in Hebrew, is rest. Sain, temptation: by these names, the various gatherings of heretics and all forms of lies are revealed: those who trample upon the bread of the Church and despise it, and follow a humble commandment that does not lead to heavenly things, and indulge in pleasures, and are at rest; such as the rich purple-clad man we read about in the Gospel (Luke 16); and they serve the tempters: one of whom sought from the Lord the power to tempt Job. The Lord will destroy and burn all these things, and He will pour out His indignation over them, and He will scatter the strength of Egypt, so that they are reduced to nothing and no longer trouble the people of God, and make them rely on their own help; so that, having forsaken the truth, they may seek falsehood, and be wounded by their own support, just as one is injured by a reed staff. After this, it is said: 'And I will kill or destroy the multitude of Memphis, for which in Hebrew is called No, which the same Seventy translators have rendered as Diospolis, which means 'rest'.' For there are many who seek rest, and desire to lie on ivory beds, and to eat suckling lambs. Or, according to the Seventy, who are translated as Mempheos, there are many who talk in riddles: Take the splinter out of your eye, when they themselves have a beam in their own. And there is fire given in Egypt, which consumes verbosity and luxuries with its ardor. All temptation will grieve, and in Diospolis, which is again not put in Hebrew as No, there will be a tearing apart; so that waters may be poured out and every wicked assembly may be scattered, and may perish here and there. And according to the Hebrew in Memphis, there will be daily distress, as they will give an account for every idle word, so that they may understand that nothing of their Lord's judgment will pass by. The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastus will also fall by the sword. Heliopolis is called On in Hebrew, which means sorrow. But Bubastus, according to the Egyptian language, is an experience of the mouth. All of these who were unable to bear the pain of the world, but sought after the delights of Diospolis, and trusted in their flowery words and debated against other doctrines, will have the victories of their speech cut down by the sword of God's word; and those who are not young men, but are called women due to the weakness of their minds, will be led captive. Whether the cities themselves, with their boastful sorrows and jaws, will be led into captivity. And in Taphnis, he says, the day will turn black. Taphnae, according to interpretation, means yielding to the jaw, and it is understood to refer to the devil: those who yield to him will lose the light of truth, and they will transform day into night, and they will feel that the scepters of Egypt and all authority have been shattered in Taphnis, so that its contemptible strength or the pride of its power may fail, and the rays of the sun's justice may be blinded in a cloud, and not women, but daughters will be led into captivity; and the Lord will bring about not one judgment, but many judgments in Egypt. For just as there are many dwelling places for the righteous with the Father, so too there are different judgments for the punishments of Egypt, so that when all these things have been done, the Egyptians may recognize that He Himself is the Lord, whose true judgments are justified in themselves.

(Verse 20 and following) And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month (Vulgate adds 'of the month'), in the seventh month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and behold it is not bound up, to be healed, that it may be tied with bandages, and clothed with strips (or to receive a healing plaster): and having taken hold of strength, he might hold the sword. Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and I will break his strong arm, and shall cause the sword to fall out of his hand, and I will scatter (or scatter abroad) Egypt among the nations, and disperse them (or winnow them) into the lands (Vulgate: 'countries'). And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and I will place my sword in his hand, and he will break the arms of Pharaoh, and they will groan with the groans of the slain before him. (or as it is in the Septuagint: And he will bring a sword over Egypt, and he will plunder its spoils, and take its plunder. It follows:) And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh will fall, and they will know that I am the Lord, when I give my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he extends it over the land of Egypt, and I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and disperse them into the lands, and they will know that I am the Lord. He returns to the order of prophecy; for after the twenty-seventh year he now places the eleventh. This question is also addressed in the previous passages. For when the word of the Lord was spoken against Tyre in the eleventh year, which was mentioned earlier, in the subsequent passages He speaks to Pharaoh in the tenth year. And again, He places the twenty-seventh year, as we have said, and now the eleventh. Leaving aside the other things that are contained in the order of the Psalms: the question is, how is the third Psalm placed before these Psalms in which David changed his appearance before Abimelech, and about Doeg the Edomite, and when he was found in the cave, and the fiftieth of penitence, in whose title it is shown that he came to Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, although these previous Psalms come before the third, in which it is noted that he fled from the face of his son Absalom. But in the Psalms the response is simple, for it is a lyric poem, and in such a work the order of history is not sought; rather, it is the songs of individual events. But in history, it must be said that those things which have been said about one thing at different times should not be divided by speech, but concluded by the narrative of one place. For example, so that those things which have been said about Egypt at different times may be known in one order of reading. When we have said these things, nevertheless the question remains: Why in this same place was the word of the Lord to Pharaoh first spoken in the eleventh year, and later in the twenty-seventh, and then in the tenth year, when certainly according to the order, the eleventh year should have been first, the twenty-seventh second, and the tenth year third, and each prophecy should have been designated by year? To which we can respond: O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are his judgments and how unsearchable are his ways! (Romans 11:33). And in another place: Who can search out the depths of knowledge? (Sirach 1:2-3). However, we can say this, that the order of history is not observed in the prophets, at least not in all cases, for they do not narrate the past, but they foretell the future, according to the will of the Holy Spirit. But in history, the books of Moses, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Esther, Samuel, Malachi, Chronicles, and Ezra, together with Nehemiah, do not contain a chronological account. Let it suffice to say this about the order of years. Now let us examine the prophecies against Pharaoh or concerning Pharaoh. It is said that God broke his arm and it was not bound up or healed, nor did he receive any ointment, according to what is written: 'There is no ointment to be applied, nor oil, nor bandages' (Isaiah 1, sec. 70). But if it had happened that, with courage regained, he could hold the sword and proceed to war. Therefore, God, who is merciful and compassionate, once again shattered his arm or arms, so that the sword may completely fall from his hand, and be scattered among the people of Egypt, and be dispersed among the nations. But in your arm, receive strength and courage, as the Scripture says: 'Break the arm of the sinner and the evildoer' (Psalm 9:15). This arm is broken in our adversaries, when they pursue us, but cannot overcome us. And for the salvation of the servants of God against Pharaoh, the king of Babylon often rises up to oppress the powerful oppressor, and the wicked are handed over to the more wicked, with God strengthening the arms of the worst, so that the one who is set free may know that He is the Lord. Indeed, it is an achievement of virtue to know that He is the Lord. On the contrary, we can say: The sons of Eli, the sons of pestilence, not knowing God (1 Samuel 2:22). And concerning the good kings who did what was right in the sight of God, it is written that they may know the Lord. But that which is said in the Septuagint: 'I will break his strong and appointed arms', which in Greek is said 'τεταγμένα', has been corrupted by the fault of copyists. For they interpreted it not as 'τεταγμένα', but as 'τεταμένα', which means not appointed, but stretched out. For this reason, according to their custom, other interpreters have put 'exalted' instead.

<h2 id='tocuniq287'>Book Ten</h2>

Book Ten

I wish, as I have already said, to explain the prophecies against a particular province or king in the same books, and not at all to divide the reader's understanding. But what should I do with its length, which, unless it is divided into parts, exceeds the size of a volume; and an infinite mass is both burdensome to the one dictating and to the one reading? Therefore, after the discourse against Egypt and its lamentation, and the king of Egypt, whose arm is neither wrapped nor restored to its former health, we have spoken in the last part of the ninth book, we pass on to the beginning of the tenth book against the same Pharaoh king of Egypt, who is compared to the king of Assyria, and after a very long prophecy, a lamentation is taken up concerning the same, and then against all Egypt. In these discourses, O virgin of Christ, Eustochium, raise your hands with Moses so that the fruit of our victory may be the result of your prayers. For it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy (Rom. IX, 16), who speaks to the prophet: Open your mouth and I will fill it (Ps. LXXX, 11); the prophet responds to the Lord: I have opened my mouth and have drawn in my breath (Ps. CXVIII, 331); where he wills, he breathes. But where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty (John, III, 8; II Cor. III, 17), the liberty with which the Lord has bestowed upon us. How in vain the Jews boasted, saying: We are the seed of Abraham and have never been slaves to anyone (John 8:33), subject to many vices and sins, and ignorant of that saying: Whoever is overcome by someone, to him he is also a slave (2 Peter 2:19).

<h2 id='tocuniq288'>(Chap. XXXI.)</h2>

(Chapter 31.) And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his people: Whom are you like in your greatness? Behold, Assyria was like a cedar (or cypress) in Lebanon, beautiful in branches and dense with foliage, towering in height, and its top was among the thick foliage (or in the midst of clouds). The waters nourished him: the abyss lifted him up; his rivers flowed round about his roots, and he sent forth his channels to all the trees of the region. Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the region, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches were elevated above many waters. And when he had stretched forth his shadow, all the fowls of the air made their nests in his branches: and under his branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all the multitude of nations. And it was most beautiful in its magnificence, and in the spreading (or multitude) of its shrubs (or branches): for its roots were near the waters. The cedars (or cypresses) were not taller than it in the paradise of God, and the firs (or pines) did not reach its summit, and the plane trees (or firs) were not equal (or similar) to its foliage (or branches). Every tree of the paradise of God (or in the paradise of God) was not like it and its beauty, because I made it beautiful (Vulg. made him beautiful), and with many thick branches, and all the trees of delight (or pleasure) that were in the paradise (Vulg. adds of God) envied it. Therefore thus says the Lord God: Because it has exalted itself to the height, and has set its top among the thick clouds, and its heart is proud of its height, I will give it into the hand of a mighty one of the nations. He shall surely deal with it as its wickedness deserves. I have cast it out for its wickedness. Foreigners, the most ruthless of nations, have cut it down and left it. On the mountains and in all the valleys its branches have fallen, and its boughs have been broken in all the ravines of the land, and all the peoples of the earth have gone away from its shadow and left it. In its ruins all the birds of the sky made their homes or found rest, and all the beasts of the field dwelt among its branches. Therefore, all the watered trees will not be lifted up to their full height, nor will they set their lofty tops among the thickly leaved trees or in the clouds. Nor will all those irrigated by water stand tall, for they have all been delivered to death, to the farthest depths of the earth, in the midst of the sons of men, to those who descend to the pit. Thus says the Lord God: on the day when he descended to the underworld, I proclaimed mourning (or the abyss mourned for him): I covered him with the abyss, and I held back its rivers and restrained its many waters. Lebanon was shattered (or darkened) over him, and all the trees of the field withered (or failed). At the sound of his downfall, nations were shaken (or trembled), when I brought him (or her) down to the underworld with those who descend (or descend) into the pit; and on the weak earth the splendid and magnificent trees of delight (or luxury) in Lebanon were consoled: and all were watered by the waters. For they themselves, whether with her or with him, went down to the underworld to the slain or wounded with a sword, and the arm or seed of each dwelled beneath her shadow, perished in the midst of the nations or their own lives. To whom have you likened yourself, O illustrious one, and sublime among the trees of pleasure! Behold, you are brought down with the trees of pleasure to the lowest earth, you will sleep in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those who were slain by the sword. So Pharaoh and all his crowd, says the Lord God. I combined both editions in the usual way, however, where they disagreed the most, so as not to increase the size of the books with a double proposition. And first it must be understood that whatever is said about the future Assyrian king is mentioned in the Septuagint as if already fulfilled, and thus it speaks of the tree or the prince of the Assyrians, so that both the masculine and feminine genders are understood to refer to one person, while the tree is related to the Assyrian and the Assyrian is called the tree. And there is no mention in the present discourse of the Babylonian king, lest it seem to provoke the anger of the lords and rulers against the captive people placed in Chaldea, but it is said of the king of the Assyrians, who at that time had already been captured by the Chaldeans, and all the strength of the Assyrians was subject to the Babylonian yoke. Therefore, the ten tribes, that is, Israel, are captured by the Assyrians; but the Chaldeans overpower the two tribes, that is, Judah and Benjamin, and they overthrow the city of Jerusalem. Therefore, in order to speak against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and his people, God used the following divine words in the beginning: 'To whom have you become similar in your greatness? Behold, Assyria is like a cedar in Lebanon, and so on.' And the meaning is: Do not be surprised if you are to be defeated and destroyed by the Babylonians, and if your empire is to be destroyed, and if all the wealth of Egypt is to be destroyed, since Assyria, much stronger than you, was destroyed by the same Chaldeans who conquered you. And he described the power of the king of Assyria under the figure of a cedar tree, according to the Hebrew, the Septuagint, and the Cypress, which was planted on Mount Lebanon, which is beautiful with branches and dense with foliage, and it reaches up to the clouds, and it grew so much because it was irrigated not by water, but by the abyss, that is, by very abundant waters. For the abyss is the multitude of the sound of waters: so that all birds have made their nests in its branches, and all the beasts of the field have given birth under its foliage. And so that we would not doubt what were the flying creatures of the sky, and what were the beasts of the woods, he explained more clearly: And under its shade dwelled a multitude of diverse peoples. Cedars, he said, and cypresses, firs or pines, and plane trees or cypresses were not equal to its branches. And so that he would not speak separately about all the trees, he said, all the trees of the paradise of God are not likened to it, and to its beauty. Through these things, some understand that it is not spoken about the Assyrian king, but about an opposing strength, which is said to be generated in the speech of Tyre among the Cherubim, and distinguished by precious stones, and afterwards to have fallen to earthly matters because of his own fault, who is also called Lucifer when he is falling in Isaiah (Isaiah XIV), and is signified in the Gospel by the Lord: I saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven (Luke X, 12). But we should understand all these things as hyperbolic statements made in history, that Assyria had such great power, and it oppressed all nations so that it compared itself to the strength of angels. However, everything metaphorically is said to be under the highest cedar or cypress, referring to Assyria, and the killing of it is called its destruction. And what follows: I have given it into the hand of the mightiest nations, it calls the king of Babylon, so that what conquered Assyria, it understands was not its own strength, but of divine power. According to him, I expelled her because of her impiety, so that secretly she might warn Babylon that it should not be cruel or oppress the people of God, who have been handed over to her, lest she suffer the same fate as Assyria, which was cruel and impious. And strangers will cut her down, the most cruel of nations; or, according to the Septuagint, the pestilent: which he would never say (or rather, wanted to say) while he was in Chaldea, so as not to arouse them against his nation. She is also cast upon the mountains, and her branches fall swiftly in the valleys, and they are shattered against the rocks, and she is abandoned by all the peoples, that is, by the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field, and she will come to such destruction that all the trees that were considered tall in comparison to the tree of Assyria will be raised up by her example and lifted up on high; and they will no longer stand at their height, but they will be cut down along with her in fear. And what was said through the translation becomes clearer. All, he says, were handed over (understood: kings to death) to the deepest land (that is, to the underworld), in the midst of the sons of men (by no means among the trees) to those who descend into the lake. There is no doubt that it signifies the underworld. After the cutting down of the Assyrian tree, or on the day when the Assyrian descends to the underworld, and the Lord inflicted mourning (or commanded mourning), again through the translation he speaks about him being covered by the abyss, according to what is written: 'I went down to the depths of the sea, and the storm engulfed me' (Psalm 68:3); and all the rivers, that is, all the nations, ceased to flow beyond him, and he was grieved, or darkened over it, that is, the tree, or him, that is, the Assyrian, Lebanon. So that we may not think that the tree has speech, it follows: I moved the nations by the sound of its falling. For what great ruin of one tree can there be, that all nations are moved by its sound? 'When I brought it down to the underworld,' he says, 'according to the letter, a tree cannot be brought down to the underworld with others who were descending into the pit, that is, to the underworld.' And the lowest parts of the earth, namely the heart of the earth, were consoled, because all the trees of pleasure, or delights, which in Hebrew is called Eden, were there, signifying delightful and excellent groves and forests that were in Lebanon and were watered by streams. For even the trees themselves, along with him, that is, the Assyrian, descend into the underworld, to the dead or wounded by the sword. The trees are not wounded by swords, but they are cut down, and they do not descend into the underworld. And the arm, he says, or the offspring (since in Hebrew the word 'Zara' means both), will rest in its shade among the nations, not of forests but of peoples. In the end, there is an apostrophe to the Assyrian himself, or to Pharaoh. To whom have you been compared, O illustrious and sublime among the trees of pleasure? None was your equal, they say, but you surpassed all kings in power. And yet, when you were led with the other kings, who were in your company to the farthest lands, that is, to the depths below, as Scripture says: They shall go to the ends of the earth, they shall be delivered into the hand of the sword, they shall be the portion of foxes. (Ps. LXII, 10, 11). In the midst, it is said, you will lie with the uncircumcised, with those who have been slain by the sword. He showed what were the trees, what cedar, or cypress, wounded by swords, and lying with the uncircumcised. And yet he would join the extremities to the preceding ones, because he had said above: To whom are you like in your greatness: behold the Assyrian as a cedar in Lebanon, fair in branches and leaves, and the rest, now it is brought forth: Thus is Pharaoh, and all his multitude, says the Lord. How, he says, is the Assyrian, the cedar and cypress, fallen by the Babylonian, thrown down: thus Pharaoh and his people, that is the very tree and its branches, will be thrown down by the Babylonian. In the meantime, let these things be said according to history, which most people understand will happen at the end of the world, and let the king of Pharaoh, that is, the power to which Egypt is subject, be compared to the most powerful king of the Assyrians, that is, the antichrist: if he falls, surely the other rulers of these darknesses and the princes of the world will fall more easily. Let us therefore briefly touch on each one, so that we do not so much discuss and explain obscure things, but rather seem to have given material to those who desire to explain. And first it must be discussed why, in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel, saying: Son of man, speak to Pharaoh of Egypt and his multitude. When speaking to Pharaoh, in the eleventh year the word of the Lord was spoken, for it had not yet come to the twelfth year, which is the number of full and complete power. Hence, there are also twelve sons of Jacob (Genesis 35), from whom later the twelve names of the prophets are contained in one volume. And there are twelve Apostles (Luke 6), of whom one, Judas the traitor, is replaced by Matthias. And the daughter of the synagogue official, who is twelve years old, is raised by the Lord (Mark 5). The woman with the issue of blood is also healed in the twelfth year. But because Pharaoh is rebuked and mourned later, therefore the third month and the eleventh day of the twelfth year are linked together. Hence, in the subsequent twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord comes to Ezekiel, saying: Son of man, lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him. For the one who mourns, mourns in order to understand how many goods he has lost; and yet, because Pharaoh was there, and his arm had not yet been bound, nor had he regained his former strength: therefore, in the twelfth year and month, there are still twenty-nine days remaining, in order to complete the number of twelve years. Therefore, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to the Prophet, and he was commanded to speak to the king of Egypt and his people. It is remarkable that the four interpreters did not say 'people' but 'multitude'. For many are called, but few are chosen (Matthew 22:14). And in the law it is written: 'You shall not be with the multitude in evil.' And it is said to the king of Egypt: 'To whom have you likened yourself in greatness or in height?' For he himself will be exalted and subject to this sentence: 'Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled' (Luke 14:11). But let him not be like him in height, who has been like a cedar or a cypress in Lebanon, beautiful with branches and leafy; and raised his head in height, even to the clouds, to which, according to David, the truth of God reaches (Psalm 36), and to which they are commanded not to rain upon Israel. Beauty is also praised, which, when turned by wicked will into ugliness, so that it can be said of him: The Lord will break the cedars of Lebanon: and he himself, being exalted on the highest mountains of Lebanon, the higher he had been, would fall even more forcefully. The holy Scripture, desiring to demonstrate his majesty, calls him the great cedar, which was nourished by waters, not the waters of Siloam that flow silently, but the waters of Rasin and the waters of Egypt, of which it is written: Why do you want to drink the waters of Geon, or Sion? which is said to sound the turbid waters. The abyss also exalted him above which at the beginning of the world darkness was carried (Gen. I), and to which in the Gospel the demons beg not to be sent (Luke VIII). The rivers of the same abyss were around its roots, of which it is said: What do you have with the ways of the Assyrians, to drink the waters of the rivers (Jer. II, 18)? And in another place: Behold, the Lord will bring upon you strong and abundant river water, the king of the Assyrians and all his glory (Isa. VIII, 7). The abyss also sent forth its streams to all the trees of the region, in order to irrigate not only the prince of this world, but also his companions. Therefore, it was elevated and grew above all the tallest trees, and its bushes multiplied, and it possessed the empire of the whole world, saying: 'All these things have been handed over to me' (Matthew 4:9). And its branches were elevated, because they were watered by the abyss. It spread out and extended its shade, in order to subject everyone to its dominion. All the birds of the sky made their nests in its branches. For everyone who sins is born of the devil, and is counted among its branches. But those birds made their nests in its branches, which, according to the Gospel, devour the seed by the wayside. Either because all have sinned and are in need of God's mercy, as it is said: All have turned aside, they have become altogether useless. Therefore, they made their nests in its branches. It follows: And under its branches all the beasts of the forest, who have lost Christ's gentleness, were born, and under its shade dwelt a multitude of nations, so that there was no one who was not covered by its shade, except for him who said: Behold, the prince of this world is coming: and he will find nothing in me (John 14:30). For by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death (Romans 5:12); and thus death passed unto all men, in whom all have sinned, and in Adam all die, and we all have sinned, and we are in need of the glory of God (1 Corinthians 15). And yet, even within this dwelling, there is a diverse condition. Some dwell in its branches like birds, boasting knowledge of philosophy and the teachings of heretics. Others are like wild beasts, fierce and cruel. Others are like a multitude of many nations, symbolizing a mixture of different vices and sins. Now, Assur was most beautiful in its size and in the spreading of its foliage, for its roots were nourished by many waters. It was so tall in the garden of God that no cedar or cypress could surpass it, nor could fir trees and pine trees match its height, nor were plane trees equal in foliage to it. Therefore, no tree of the plants in paradise was equal to it, because every wood of the paradise of God is not similar to it and its beauty. For they were not raised up by pride, but they knew their humility, nor did they attempt to claim the likeness of God in their sacrilegious mind. And what follows: And all the trees of delight that were in paradise envied it, we shall explain as follows: The trees of paradise envied the abundance of its branches: For many are called, but few are chosen (Matt. XX, 16). And; The broad and spacious way that leads to death (Ibid. VII, 13) . For he desires to have as many for salvation as Assur had for destruction. Therefore, because Assur was exalted in height; and he gave his flourishing and dense height, even to the highest clouds, and his heart was lifted up to say: I will be like the Most High (Isa. XIV, 14) , therefore he was delivered into the hand of the strongest of nations: which we understand as another detestable power, to which he is delivered for punishment: for he himself is an enemy and avenger; so that Assur may be understood as Antichrist, and the strongest of nations to which he is delivered, Satan, according to the saying of the Apostle: Whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme (I Tim. II, 20) : Who will perform for him whatever has been commanded to him by the Lord. But this cypress was expelled from the paradise of God because of its impiety; and strangers and cruel, or pestilent, people will cut it down among the nations, so that what is written may be fulfilled: The fool, when scourged, will become wiser (Proverbs 19:25). And again: The axe is already laid to the root of the trees (Matthew 3:10); those who cut it down on the mountains, so that it may fall in its pride. However, in all the valleys, its branches will fall, so that all those who were in its company are led down to Tartarus, and they will leave its shadow and abandon it, so that the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth, which were previously under it and protected by its shadow, will then share in its punishment. And when they see the other trees of the forest, or of Paradise, they will not be elevated in pride, nor consider themselves to be anything, nor will they regard the abundance of their own water as riches: because all the branches and birds of the sky, and the animals of the earth, which were under the dominion of Assyria, will be brought down in death to the lowest earth. Of which it is written: In his sight all who go down to the earth will fall (Psalm 21:30). And in another place: They shall go to the outermost parts of the earth (Ps. LXII, 10): and they shall in no wise be with the Angels, but with the sons of men, who descend into the lake, or into the eternal pit. But when he shall descend to the outermost parts of the earth, and a part of the foxes shall be from whom he will be torn: then there shall be mourning either of all his companions, or of the holy fortitudes, which will grieve for him having descended to the underworld. Hence the Lord says: I have covered him in the deep, whose waters he had been nourished by before; and I have stopped his rivers, that is, the depths, and I have restrained many waters, so that they would not irrigate him, but rather oppress him. Lebanon was grieved over him, in which he had been exalted, and all the trees of the field were shaken, fearing a similar destruction. From the sound of its downfall, nations were moved, so that no one would be ignorant of its ruin and descent to the underworld with its companions. And all the trees of pleasure, that is, of paradise, received consolation, while they saw evil punished with evils, and good restored to the good. But these trees of Lebanon are watered by the streams of the Lord, in which that fallen tree had also been watered. Whether all the trees that were once good and irrigated by waters, and dwelt in the height of Lebanon, will receive consolation when they see their prince endure similar torments. For they themselves will descend to hell, to the dead killed by the sword of the Lord, and all the might of the trees will dwell under its shadow, that is, in punishment, amidst all the nations that will be held captive in the prisons of hell. After this, the discourse turns to Pharaoh himself, to whom it was said in the beginning, to whom have you been likened in your greatness? And he said to him: To whom have you been compared, O renowned and lofty one, among the trees of pleasure? Surely to the Assyrian who fell. And you were renowned and lofty among the trees of Eden, which is to say, of delights and paradise. And behold, you have been brought down like the Assyrian, with all the trees that were once in delight, to the lowest earth and to the underworld, and you will not sleep in peace, but in torment amidst the uncircumcised, that is, the unclean, and with those who have fallen by the sword of the Lord. And so that we may know who is the one to whom he said: O illustrious and lofty among the trees of pleasure, he puts it more clearly: He is Pharaoh, and all his multitude. Or according to the Septuagint, it is thus Pharaoh, and all his multitude, so that just as the Assyrian was cut down and fell, so may the Egyptian be overthrown.

<h2 id='tocuniq289'>(Chap. XXXII.—Vers. 1 seq.)</h2>

(Chapter XXXII, verse 1 and following) And it was in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month (or tenth), on one day (the Vulgate is silent on the day) of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him: You are like a lion among the nations, and like a dragon in the sea; you stirred up your horns in your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and trampled their (or your) rivers. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: I will spread my net over you in the multitude of many peoples, and I will draw you up in my dragnet (or I will draw you up with a hook). And I will throw you down on the ground; on the surface of the field I will cast you (or your fields will be filled). And I will make all the birds of the sky dwell upon you, and I will satiate all the beasts of the earth with you, and I will give your flesh over the mountains, and I will fill the hills (Vulgate adds yours) (or valleys) with your filth (or your blood) and I will irrigate the land (or the land will be irrigated) with the stench (Vulgate feces; alternative odor) of your blood (or your dung) over the mountains, and the valleys will be filled from you. And when you are extinguished, I will cover the sky and make its stars darken: I will hide the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light. I will make all the luminaries of the heavens mourn over you: and I will bring darkness upon your land, says the Lord God. And I will provoke the hearts of many peoples when I bring your destruction upon the nations and lands that you do not know. And the people will be astonished, and their kings will be greatly terrified when my sword begins to fly against them, and they will be suddenly dismayed, each for his own life, on the day of your downfall. Because thus says the Lord God: The sword of the king of Babylon will come upon you. I will cast down your multitude (or your strength) with the swords of warriors (or giants): all these nations are invincible (or pestilent from all nations), and they will destroy (or lay waste) the pride (or injury) of Egypt, and his multitude (or all his strength) will be scattered (or crushed). And I will destroy all its livestock that were upon many waters (or from many waters): and the foot of man shall no longer disturb them, nor shall the hoof of beasts trouble (or trample) them. Then I will make their waters very pure (or so that their waters may finally rest), and I will bring their rivers like oil (or so that oil may flow), says the Lord God, when I make the land of Egypt desolate (or destroyed). But the land will be deserted from its abundance (or with abundance) when I strike (or scatter) all its inhabitants: and they will know that I am the Lord. The daughters of the nations will lament for him, and they will lament for him over Egypt and its multitude (or over all its strength), says the Lord God. We mix both editions, but only in those places where they differ. Otherwise, where there is only one meaning, we follow the Hebrew text. In many copies, according to the Septuagint, the twelfth year and tenth month are stated; according to other interpreters, the tenth year and twelfth month, either because Jerusalem has already been captured and Pharaoh's joy is taken away from him, due to the impending evils; or certainly it is to be captured and Israel should mourn more for its own miseries than rejoice in the captivity of others. And meanwhile, briefly laying down some foundational history, let us examine what the Hebrews understand in this place. Pharaoh is compared to a lion, not of one people, but of many peoples; or to a sea serpent, who possesses the land and the waters and was raised in pride by the irrigation of the rivers, which is called a horn, and by the multitude of his army, he could disturb all the waters as he passed through them: therefore, it is said that his net is spread out over his multitude, to catch him with its fishing net or hook, and to throw or extend him on the ground, who had been wrapped in many coils like a snake, so that he could be devoured by all the birds of the sky. And when not only the birds but all the beasts of the earth have torn him apart, his remaining flesh will fill the mountains, valleys, and fields, so that everything teems with worms. This, however, is metaphorical, indicating that after the birds of the sky and the beasts have been satiated with his flesh, that is, his army, and the rest of the multitude is turned into worms and putrefaction. Then it says, the heavens will be enveloped in darkness: the sun, moon, and other celestial bodies will not give their light, but everything will turn black over you: nothing joyful will be for you, and for your destruction all the peoples and all their kings will be terrified in great horror, seeing my sword flying here and there and sparing no one, and in your ruin they will fear a similar ruin. But so that you may know who this sword is, listen more clearly: The sword of the king of Babylon will come to you: with the swords of the mighty, or the giants, I will cast down all your multitude. These giants are invincible nations, which were held by the army of the king of Babylon. They will devastate or destroy the pride of Egypt, and all its multitude: and nothing will remain in Egypt, but both men and brute animals will be taken away together. And there will be such a solitude in Egypt that neither the foot of a man, nor the hoof of a beast, nor the water of its rivers shall be disturbed, but all shall be calm; and the waters of its rivers shall flow like pure and shining oil, with no one passing through them, nor disturbing their flow. And this shall happen because of the solitude of Egypt, which shall be turned into a desert by its own multitude: when its inhabitants are struck by the Lord, so that those who remain may understand that he is the Lord. Therefore Pharaoh lamented, and the daughters of the nations lamented him in a circle. Not only over him, but also over his multitude, which, being devastated by the Lord, was destroyed. Let it suffice to have hastily said these things in a simple letter, let us come to spiritual understanding. And I do not believe that we need to labor greatly to know who Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is, since we will explain more fully above, namely that power to which Egypt is entrusted; either one province, or Egypt of the whole world, which is not established like a lion, but is assimilated to the lion of the nations by its own fault. For when a man is in honor, he does not understand; he is compared to senseless beasts, and becomes like them. (Psalm 49:20) Concerning this, Peter also speaks of the lion: Our adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. (1 Peter 5:8) And in the ninth psalm, it is written: He lies in wait secretly like a lion in his den; he lies in wait to catch the poor. And in Jeremiah, the Holy Spirit says: A lion from the forest has struck them down. (Jeremiah 5:6). But the dragon is called the devil (for which the Eagle has interpreted as Leviathan, explaining the name of the dragon), as I have taught with many testimonies, who said: My are the rivers, and I made them. Therefore, this dragon, with his rivers, as if with horns, scattered many nations: which we can understand concerning Marcion, Valentinus, Arius, Eunomius, and the other leaders of heresies, who imitate the ecclesiastical men, saying to the Lord and Savior: In you we will scatter our enemies with a horn (Ps. 43:6); and they do not scatter for salvation, to be lifted from earth to heaven, but to be thrown down into the depths. Finally, it follows: And you were disturbing the waters with your feet; according to the words of the Apostle: But he who troubles you, will bear judgment (Gal. V, 10). For he does not want to drink the waters of Siloam, which flow silently (Isa. VIII), but the turbid and muddy waters of Egypt, which were pure and flowing in their own order before they were trampled by the feet of the dragon; but after they were disturbed by his feet, they lost their course. For heretics do not use the testimonies of the Scriptures that agree with themselves, but rather confuse everything. And because he is an enemy and avenger, not only does the Egyptian dragon disturb alien waters with his feet, but he tramples his own rivers so as not to spare those whom he has once brought under his power. The righteous, desiring to avoid this, prays: Let not the foot of pride come upon me (Ps. 35:12). And in another place, being trampled, he asks not to be trampled again: Have mercy on me, O Lord, for man has trampled upon me (Ps. 55:1). But the enemy is a man who is a devil, about whom another psalm speaks, 'Let not man be magnified over the earth.' Therefore, thus says the Lord God: I will spread my net over you, in the multitude of many peoples (Ps. IX, 18). The net of the Lord, woven together by the reason of the old and new Testament, is sent upon the dragon, who dwells in the multitude of peoples, and always delights in the tumult and multitude of peoples, so that he may draw him in his snare or in his hook. This is the net that is cast into the sea of this world, and it draws in many other fish to be chosen, and others to be cast away (Matt. XIII). Or this is the hook, of which it is written in Job: Thou shalt take the dragon by the hook, and encircle his nostrils with a bridle (Job XL, 19); for which Aquila interpreted: Thou shalt draw out Leviathan with a hook, and bind his tongue with cords. Now the dragon, or Leviathan, is drawn out of the sea by the hook or net of the Lord, to be cast away, or extended upon the earth, and all its coils, in which it concealed its snares, shall be uncovered and brought forth in public, and cast down to the earth, and he who had placed his mouth in heaven shall lie down, and boast of being like the Most High. From this it follows: And I will make all the birds of the sky dwell or settle upon you, and I will satisfy all the beasts of the earth with you, according to what is written: You have given him as food to the peoples of Ethiopia (Ps. 73:14). Those that are called birds or beasts of the earth (Matt. 13; Luke 8). Birds, which, as we have said, snatch the seed along the path. Beasts of the earth, which can be referred to heretics and pagans, given to vice. But what follows: And I will give your flesh upon the mountains, and fill your hills with your gore; or, I will fill the valleys with your blood, has this meaning: that we understand the deceitful people, the cruelty of the pagans, both the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth, and that we return the mountains to the leaders of heresies, such as Valentinus and Marcion, and the hills to their successors who are filled with the gore of the dragon; or the valleys, which are filled with the blood of the dragon, to the lowest of the believers. But certainly there are opposing powers in the mountains that roam in the air, and valleys that penetrate the depths, and they are bound by eternal torments. Furthermore, what is said, 'And I will water the land with the stench of your blood over the mountains,' or, 'The land will be watered with your excrement over the mountains, and the valleys will be filled with you,' signifies that every pride and the arrogant swelling of heretical pride is filled not so much with vital and pure blood, but with putrid and foul-smelling blood, according to what is written: 'Make them like the dung of the earth' (Ps. LXXXII, 11). About whom the saint is freed from the Lord: He raises up the needy from the earth, and lifts up the poor from the dung heap. To seat him with princes, with the princes of his people. (Ps. CXII, 7, 8). However, the valleys in the depths, as we have said, signify either hell or the humble sense of the heretics due to pleasure and earthly wealth that make everything. But what is joined: And I will cover the heavens when you are extinguished, and I will make its stars black: I will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon will not shed its light, all the luminaries of heaven will mourn, or I will make them dark over you, and I will give darkness over your land, says the Lord God, if we follow the letter, it cannot be fully understood. For when Pharaoh, or the serpent sun, and the moon, and the stars did not give their light, and the heavens were covered in darkness, according to that poetic (Virgil, Georgics I):

And the impious have feared the eternal darkness. Therefore, this must be said, that with the extinguishing of Pharaoh, who transformed himself into an Angel of light, about whom it is written elsewhere: The light of the wicked will be extinguished (Job XVIII), the heavens or the highest heavens will be covered in darkness. Of which even Paul speaks: For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the Principalities and Powers, against the rulers of this world of darkness (Ephesians VI, 12). And the Lord will cause his stars, or the dragon, or the heavens, to darken. On which also Jude the Apostle writes: Wandering stars, for whom the gloom of darkness is kept forever (Jude XIII). The sun is also covered by a cloud, the sun of iniquity, which is contrary to the sun of justice, but by a cloud, even by the Lord and Savior Himself, who descended into Egypt upon a light cloud (Isaiah 19), not weighed down by any burden of sins, or by the prophets and Apostles, of whom we read: 'I will command the clouds, that they rain no rain upon it' (Isaiah 5:6). And in the Psalms: 'Your truth reaches unto the clouds' (Psalm 36:6). But when the sun of iniquity is obscured, the moon, which we understand to be the Church of heretics, and which was thought to receive its light from the sun of iniquity, will not give its light, nor will it deceive believers with the false knowledge of its name. Moreover, all the lights and everything that appears to be in heretics' doctrine will be extinguished, the dragon being destroyed, and dried up, they will mourn, the prince being lost, so that the Lord himself may cover the land of the heretics with darkness, namely ignorance of the truth, so that the blind may lead the blind into the pit, and the inhabitants of the earth may be cast into outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. After this it is said: And I will provoke the heart of many peoples, when I bring your contrition, or your captivity, among the nations upon the earth which you do not know, so that those who previously served Pharaoh may be angry against him, seeing his captivity brought to another land, which the dragon did not know to exist. Nor should we doubt that those lands are good, which Pharaoh does not know, namely when the captivity of Pharaoh is changed by another captivity, of which it is said to the Savior: Ascending on high, he led captivity captive: he received (or, according to the Apostle (Ephes. IV, 8), gave) gifts to men (Psal. LXVII, 19). And I will cause many peoples to marvel at you, he says, so that those who previously admired Pharaoh's power may afterwards marvel at his downfall from his own height. The kings of the nations will also fear him excessively, whose kingdoms the devil shows to the Lord and of whom it is said in the psalm: The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes gathered together in one (Ps. II, 2). This, however, will happen when the sword of the Lord begins to fly over their faces, understood as the kings or the peoples. The sword of the Lord, moreover, is to be understood as the living word of God, powerful and sharp on both sides, which flies and runs, and wounds the eyes of those who see it and terrifies their faces, so that, amazed by the downfall of Pharaoh, they see themselves thrown down in it. And indeed, the sword of the Lord, about which it is written: Behold, this one is set for the fall and rising again of many (Luke 2:34), raises up those who are lying down, and by humility, transforms those who are badly erected. But the sword of the king of Babylon will come upon the Egyptian dragon, so that, like the swords of the mighty or giants, the Lord may cast down the multitude of those who followed the king of Egypt. Inexorable, he says, or pestilent from the nations, all of these, so that they may be handed over to worse evils for punishment, about which it is written: He sent among them the anger of his wrath, fury, and affliction, by sending evil angels (Psalm 78:49). And the Apostle says: 'Whom I have delivered up to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme, but rather to be saved in the day of judgment by the destruction of the flesh' (I Tim. I, 20). But when through such ministers the pride of Egypt has been cast down and its multitude scattered, all the beasts that were upon many waters will perish, and the foot of man will no longer disturb them. For if blessed is he who sows upon the waters, where the ox and the ass tread (Isa. XXXII); on the other hand, unhappy is he who can retain only the simple things and is thus unable to reach his own error, so that the foot of man does not tread upon them, as if they did not even seem to have the sign of wisdom and reason, the waters of Egypt within themselves. Moreover, the hoof of the cattle will not disturb them so as to make them muddy and turbid from being clear and bright. Then the waters, which had been disturbed by the dominion of the dragon, will be restored not by another, but by the Lord Himself: so that their rivers flow like oil, and they become the nourishment of true light. However, these things will happen when the Lord has made the land of Egypt desolate, and has destroyed its multitude, and all its inhabitants have been struck, so that they may know by this event that He Himself is the Lord. But what is joined: it is a lament, and the daughters of the nations shall lament over Egypt, and over its multitude they shall lament, says the Lord God; it is clear to the souls of all nations, which were previously oppressed, whether the nations that did not dwell in Egypt at all, but lived in the land of the living, to lament the slain dragon, and all its multitude: not in hope of salvation, but because he, through his own fault and pride, has been cast down into eternal punishment of such great power.


<h2 id='tocuniq290'>(Vers. 17, seq.)</h2>

(Verse 17 onwards) 'And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying: Son of man, mourn for the multitude of Egypt, and bring her down, even her and the daughters of the mighty nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. Wherein art thou fairer than any woman? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised. Among them that are slain with the sword, they shall fall: the sword is given: draw her and all her multitudes.' The most powerful of the strong ones from the middle of the underworld will speak to him, who descended with his helpers (or his own) and slept with the uncircumcised and those killed by the sword. There Assur and all his multitude, around his tomb, all the slain and those who fell by the sword, whose tombs were given in the furthest depths, and his multitude became a circle around his tomb, all the slain and fallen by the sword who once caused fear in the land of the living. There Aela and all his multitude around his tomb: all these were killed and fell by the sword, who came down uncircumcised to the nethermost parts of the earth: who caused their terror in the land of the living, and bore their shame with those who descend into the pit. In the midst of the slayers his bed was set in all his people: his tomb is round about him. All these uncircumcised, slain by the sword. For they had (Vulgate: they had given) their terror on the land of the living, and they carried their disgrace with those who descend into the pit; they were placed in the midst of the slain. There are Mosoch and Thubal, and all his multitude, around his grave. All these are uncircumcised, and fallen by the sword, who had given their terror on the land of the living. And they shall not sleep with the mighty, and with the fallen, and with the uncircumcised, who have descended to the underworld with their weapons, and have placed their swords under their heads; and their iniquities shall be upon their bones, because they have become terror among the land of the living. And so you will be crushed among the uncircumcised, and you will sleep with the slain by the sword. There Edom and its kings, and all its princes who have been given with their armies, are laid with the slain by the sword, and they sleep with the uncircumcised, and with those who descend into the pit. There are all the princes of the north, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain; they are ashamed and confounded because of their strength; they sleep uncircumcised with the slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who descend into the pit. Pharaoh saw them and consoled himself over his entire multitude, which was killed by the sword, Pharaoh and all his army, says the Lord God. For I have given (or I have caused) my terror in the land of the living, and he slept among the uncircumcised with those killed by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord God.» This passage differs greatly in the Septuagint edition, both in order and translation, and some additions from Theodotion are included in it. Where it was necessary, we also included the text itself, not sparing in length and serving the diligence of the eager reader.

70. And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth month: the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, lament over the multitude of Egypt, and bring down her daughters to the nations of the dead in the depths of the earth, to those who descend into the pit (Moreover, under the asterisks it is added: + Descend from the most beautiful water; + and sleep with the uncircumcised ** Again it follows in order): In the midst of the slain by the sword they shall fall with him, and all his strength shall sleep, and the giants shall say to you, descend, you who are better, descend, and sleep with the uncircumcised in the midst of the slain by the sword. There Asshur, and all his congregation. (And that which follows: * There all the wounded were given, * and his grave in the depths of the pit, * and his congregation is not found in Hebrew, but was added by the Seventy. Again it is said): Around his tomb all the wounded who had fallen by the sword. (And again from Theodotion's Edition it is added under asterisks: + Those who gave his tombs on the sides of the lake; + and his congregation was made around his tomb. + All these wounded and falling by the sword. After these things the Seventy placed): Those who gave their fear in the land of the living. There Aelam, and all his strength, are around his tomb, all wounded, and falling by the sword: and those who descend uncircumcised into the depths of the earth, who brought their terror upon the land of the living, and received their torment with those who descended into the pit among the wounded. There Mosoch and Thubal were given, and all their strength around his tomb, all his wounded, all uncircumcised and wounded by the sword, who brought their terror upon the land of the living, and did not sleep with the giants who fell from eternity: who descended to hell with the weapons they used in battle, and placed their swords under their heads, and their iniquities became part of their bones, for they terrified the giants in their lifetime. And you will be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and you will lie with those who are slain by the sword. There Edom and its kings, and all the princes of Assyria, who gave strength to it, lie with the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword; they lie with those who go down to the pit. There are all the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain; in shame they lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and bear their disgrace with those who go down to the pit. Pharaoh will see them and will find comfort in all their strength: Pharaoh wounded by the sword, and all his strength, says the Lord God. Because I have put his fear upon the land of the living, and he will sleep in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those who are wounded by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord God. I am not unaware that such a discrepancy between two editions will be displeasing to the delicate reader. But what can I do about my slanderers, who, if I subtract anything from the translation of the Septuagint interpreters, accuse me of sacrilege and shout without fear of the Lord, especially since they disagree with the truth of faith and follow the errors of the Manichaeans, stirring up the souls of the unlearned by pointing out anything that may have changed in ancient customs, desiring to err willingly rather than learn anything true from a rival. And meanwhile, according to the story, the meaning is clear. For in that same twelfth year, and in the same, as we think, month, but not on the same day as above, but on the fifteenth day, not against Pharaoh, but against the strength or multitude of Egypt, a lamentation is taken up, which is taken away from its pride with all its daughters, or with the strong nations to the farthest land, that is, to the depths of hell, and it is said to the king of Egypt: How much better are you, that you deserve to escape death? For when Assur, and Elam, that is, the Persians, and Mosoch, who are called Cappadocians, and Thubal, whom some understand to be Iberians, others Italians: also the Edomites, and the rulers of the North, and the Sidonians with all their armies, who by their aid have struck horror into all nations, are dead, and have been slain by the sword, and have placed their swords under their heads, which expression must be understood emphatically, will you alone be able to endure the same? But rather, when you see such a great multitude of sleeping souls with you in the underworld, and your tomb surrounded by the memories of once mighty princes, you will find comfort, considering the lighter torments to be of less consequence in the company of many. For now, let it suffice to have expressed these things briefly according to the simple meaning. Now, let us, with the same brevity as the difficulty of explanation allows, delve into spiritual understanding and the highest wisdom. Above, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the Lord came to the Prophet. But in the first of these [months], that is, on the Kalends, the beginning of the month is: on the fifteenth, when the whole orb of the moon is filled, and if it is the first month, it is the first day of unleavened bread; but if it is the seventh, it is the day of setting up the booths (which are the greatest of the solemnities among the Hebrews). Indeed, there is mourning over the strength of Egypt, so that it ceases to be strong in evil: and it receives weakness, and when it is weaker, then it becomes stronger. For the fortitude of Egypt, in Hebrew it has multitude. For wide and spacious is the road that leads to death, and many enter through it (Matthew VII, 13): as it is said to Israel on the contrary: But you are few among all nations (Deuteronomy XXVIII): for virtue is always rare, and the path that leads to life is narrow and confined, and few are those who enter through it. But what is mourned for Egypt, and her dead daughters, according to the Septuagint, or strong nations are led to the farthest land in the lake, or in the deepest pit, the souls dwelling in Egypt of this age are signified, who have lost him who says: I am the life (John XIV, 6): and dead from sins, they are dragged down to the underworld by the weight of their sins, as the sinner says: For my iniquities have gone over my head, and like a heavy burden they have pressed heavily upon me (Psalm XXXVII, 5). These are the things about which it is written in another place: They will go down into the depths of the earth, they will be handed over into the hands of the sword, they will become the prey of foxes (Ps. LXII, 10). For he who digs a pit will fall into it (Eccli. XXVII, 29; Ps. VII, 16). And so we also read: He opened a pit and dug it, and fell into the hole he made. And what follows: How beautiful you are, descend and sleep with the uncircumcised, is properly addressed to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, or as it is added in the Septuagint from Theodotion, to Egypt itself: Descend from the most beautiful water, and sleep with the uncircumcised. What specifically pertains to him, who is reborn in the baptism of Christ, and hearing with the Church: Who is this that ascends, leaning upon her brother (Song of Solomon, 8:5)? Afterwards, either through fornication or other filthy sins, he is cast out of the Church, and it is said to him: Come down from the most beautiful water, and sleep with the uncircumcised, that is, with the unclean, according to that sense which the Apostle establishes: We are the circumcision (Philippians 3:3), who serve in the spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. Hi all in the midst of the wounded, or slain, shall fall with Pharaoh, by that sword which the Lord is coming to send upon the earth. For as the sword of Christ separates the good from the evil, saying: I came not to send peace upon earth, but the sword (Matth. X, 34): so the sword of heretics cuts off ((Al. slaughters)) all peoples, and leads the wounded down to hell. These are very powerful and rebellious giants, who raise their mouth high and the more they exalt themselves in pride, the more they are brought down to the depths of the pit and to the very last part of the inferno, all of whom have been killed by the sword. And so that Pharao or all the strength of Egypt might know, which was dragged down to the infernal, which allies he had in punishments, the following speech demonstrates: There Assyria, and all his multitude, or his assembly. For the prince of heretics is the devil, whose true assembly is a synagoga, of which it is said in the Apocalypse: But Synagogas of Satan (Apoc. II, 9). But I think the following verses, which are marked with an obelus, should be passed over, and it should be said what is contained in the Hebrew: In their circuit, their tombs, namely of those deceived by him. All who were wounded or killed by the sword, and therefore fell, their tombs are given in the depths of the lake. But that the lake is called Infernus is clearly shown by that Psalm in which the penitent speaks: I am likened to those who descend into the lake (Psalm 27:1). We should by no means understand it as the Latin word for lake, which in Greek is called λίμνη, as in the Lake of Tiberias, Lake Como, and Lake Benacus, and many others, but those which we do not usually call cisterns. The Scripture testifies that sinners and all heretics dig up the lakes, because they cool the waters and take away all heat, and as far as my memory serves me, no saint has dug up a lake, that is, a cistern. But all sinners, including King Uzziah who had leprosy and fell by his own pride, about whom it is written that he was a man lying in the works of the earth, and built many towers of pride in the corners, and dug up lakes (2 Chronicles 26). On the contrary, it is said: Drink water from your own vessels, and from your own fountains (Prov. V, 15). And again: Let your fountain be your own. Therefore the Lord speaks: They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and dug up cisterns, which can hold no water (Jer. III, 13). It follows: And her multitude has become all around her grave. All these surround Assyria, and there is a great multitude of them, who are all wounded and slain, and falling by the sword. For none of them can withstand Moses, nor can they hear: You who stand in the house of the Lord (Psalm 134:2); but all were wounded and killed, and those who once struck fear into the hearts of the living, now fear those who were entrusted with the Churches, lest they make the people of the living into the people of the dead, and deceive even the innocent. Hence Paul also said: But I fear that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ (2 Corinthians 11:3). But here this fear is mitigated by the hope of the Lord, as Ecclesiasticus says: The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life, from whom shall I tremble? (Psalm 26:1-2). After this it is said: There is Aelam (or Assyria) and all its multitude around his tomb, undoubtedly the Assyrians. Aelam is translated into our language as their ascent. For all those who, despising the humility of Christ, have embraced the pride of the devil and consider themselves to be something in the knowledge of a false name, are to be called Aelamites, who surround the king's tomb of the Assyrians and are killed and wounded with the sword. And although they may set their mouth on high, yet they descended unclean and uncircumcised to the uttermost parts of the earth, so that the higher they were exalted, the more forcibly they fell. These have set their terror not once, but a second time in the land of the living. For who among the Church is secure from the terror of these Alemites, and has not lost someone from his flock? And indeed the Church of Christ is aptly called the land of the living, so that the assemblies of heretics may be thought of as the land of the dead in contrast. And they carried, he says, the disgrace and torment with them into the lake, and into the depths of hell: their resting place is in the midst of the slain, namely those whom they have cut down with their sword, and they are surrounded by such peoples. These peoples are the peoples of the Assyrian king, and although they boast of being circumcised: nevertheless they were uncircumcised and were killed by the sword, and for the third time they have given terror and fear to the land of the living. Where they brought their torment and punishment in their midst, those whom they deceived with their frauds. There also, that is, near Assyria, are Mosoch and Thubal, and all his multitude around his tomb: all uncircumcised and slain, falling by the sword, who had put their fear in the land of the living. For Mosoch and Thubal, Symmachus and Theodotius interpreted their abode, so as to show the dwelling places of heretics, rather eternal pits, to be the punishments of the Assyrian king. Masochism is interpreted as madness: Thubal, conversion, not from evil to good, but from good to evil; or it can be understood as a universal madness that causes all heretics to go insane and intentionally turn towards worse things. (Romans 12). It is not surprising that they are insane and prone to evil, as they are allies of the Egyptian king who rejoices in numbers. All of these have been killed by the sword, those who had instilled fear, not once, not twice, but three times among the living, as we have mentioned before. It follows: And they do not sleep with the strong, or with the fallen giants, and not with the uncircumcised, who descended to the underworld with their weapons; and they placed their swords under their heads; and their wickedness was in their bones; for the terror of the strong was made in the land of the living. These, he says, who had been the leaders of the heretics, have reached such a pinnacle of evil and torment that they do not deserve to suffer similar punishments even with the strong and giants, who fell from the beginning. Who, in no way repenting of their own error, descended into the underworld with their weapons, rebelling against God and His Church; carrying weapons with them, of which it is written: The teeth of the sons of men are their weapons and arrows (Psalms 56:5); and they placed, it is said, their swords under their heads, resting in their minds to destroy; and embracing the darts of their judgments as the highest victory; to the extent that their iniquities were in their bones, that is, possessing the strongest inventions and doctrines of their own error. Because the strong became terrified in their lives, both in the land of the living. This is said in the fourth (section), that the strongest, those who had knowledge of the Scriptures, and those who were from the region of the living, would be terrified by their wickedness, as they descend to hell with their weapons, and they place their swords under their heads, and their iniquities reach even to their bones. After this, it is written: And so you will crush (them) in the midst of the uncircumcised ones (Rom. XVI, 20), which is said either to Pharaoh, or to the strength, or to the multitude of Egypt, and that she herself may be crushed, according to what is written: But may God quickly crush Satan under your feet. And you shall sleep, he says, with those killed by the sword, in eternal sleep. There, with the Assyrian and with the Egyptian multitude, there will be Idumea and its kings, all who served earthly works or delighted in bloodshed. For indeed Idumea sounds earthy and bloody. All the kings and all the rulers of whom the Apostle often speaks (Phil. III), who were devoted to earthly works and daily shed the blood of those whom they deceived with their deceit, slept with the uncircumcised and unclean, and with those who descended into the pit, of whom we have spoken above. In that very county they will be, and the princes of the North, from whom evil is kindled upon the earth. And by whom, either in Jeremiah (Jer. 1) or in this same prophet (Above XXII), that pot full of flesh and bones is kindled. And not only the princes of the North, but all the rulers of Assyria, for which in Hebrew it is more accurately stated, all the Sidonians, whom we translate as hunters, according to what is written: Our soul is like a bird escaped from the snare of the hunters (Ps. 123:7), for which in Hebrew it is stated, the Sidonians. Those from Sidon, or hunters, who will be led trembling to the underworld, once relying on their own strength, will sleep impure, and will carry their own confusion or torment, having the everlasting remorse of a guilty conscience, so that their fire may not be extinguished (Isaiah 66), and their worm may not die (Mark 9). When Pharaoh sees all of them, he will be comforted, either still possessing his former malice and seeing many partners in his punishment, or certainly he was comforted, seeing them also being confounded in their torments and terrors over his entire multitude that was killed by the sword, namely of Pharaoh, or of all his allies, especially the king of Assyria, and Meeshech and Tubal and the Edomites, and the princes of the north, and the Sidonians. For they had instilled their terror in the land of the living. And it is said in the fifth place, that we should beware and flee from all nations of this kind, which have deceived us in all senses and are known to be dreadful, and can only be avoided if we guard our hearts with all diligence. He slept, it is said, and Pharaoh himself along with his allies were slain by the sword. His allies, a multitude, went along a wide and spacious path to eternal punishments.


<h2 id='tocuniq291'>(Chap. XXXIII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter XXXIII, Verse 1 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, speak to the children of your people and say to them: When I bring a sword upon a land and the people of the land take one man from among them and make him their watchman, and he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people, then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet and does not take warning, if the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. He heard the sound (or voice) of the trumpet, and did not pay attention, his blood shall be upon himself: but if he takes heed, he shall save his soul. But if the watchman sees the sword coming, and does not blow the trumpet; and the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at the watchman's hand. And you, son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. Therefore hear from my mouth the word, and proclaim it to them from me. If I say to the wicked, wicked one, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked person shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity, but you will have delivered your soul. Once again, the word of the Lord came to the prophet, who had been silent for some time because neither the prophet nor human frailty can bear a constant and continuous prophecy. And he speaks the same things that are contained in the previous verses. Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel, and you will hear a word from my mouth, and you will warn them from me. If I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' and you have not warned him, nor spoken to warn the wicked to turn from his wicked way and live, the wicked shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. And even if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness and his evil ways, he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul. If you carefully consider, you will understand that they are indeed similar, but not the same, as they disagree in many things. And in all Holy Scriptures we must observe this, where there seems to be a similarity in the sentiment, not all things are said in the same way: but many things are either subtracted or added, and there is a reason for the discrepancy between the words of individuals. And meanwhile, before we come to deeper matters, a brief statement must be explained. If a watchman is appointed among the people to announce the coming sword of the Lord's wrath, and if, when he announces it, the people refuse to listen, the watchman will be free, and the one who is oppressed by the sword will bear the guilt of his own blood: but if he hears and saves himself. But if the watchman does not blow the trumpet, and the ignorant people do not observe the approaching sword, the people will indeed die in their iniquity, but I will require the blood of the dying from the hand of the watchman. And in order for the prophet Ezekiel to know that the general dispute concerned him in particular, He said to him, 'And you, son of man, have not been appointed as a watchman for the land and the people of the land, as I have already said, but you have been appointed as a watchman for the house of Israel. Therefore, if when I say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' you do not speak to warn him, that he may turn from his wicked way to save his life, his blood shall be upon you. But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul.' But if you announce and command the wicked to turn away from their worst ways, and they refuse to do so: they will indeed die in their iniquity; but you will deliver your soul from the death brought on by negligence. From these words we learn that a person, no matter how wicked and impious, can be saved from their wickedness if they hear the words of the teacher and repent. The teacher also faces a danger if they refuse to teach, either out of fear or despair of the sinner's fate. The teacher is guilty of shedding the blood of the one who could have been saved and rescued from death if the teacher had not remained silent, and in both cases the free will of the person is preserved, as it is up to the teacher to choose whether to speak or remain silent, and up to the listener to choose whether to listen, act and be saved, or to ignore and perish through their own disdain. And immediately it does not follow that because the prophet predicts, what he predicted will come. For he does not predict so that it may come, but so that it may not come. And because God speaks, it is not necessary for what he threatens to happen, but he threatens so that the one to whom he threatens may be converted to repentance, and what is future does not happen if the words of the Lord are despised. However, we can discuss this passage in three ways: as the land that appoints a watchman for itself, either according to the literal sense, that is, the land of Judea, or according to the spiritual interpretation, the Church, which often chooses a watchman for the last things of its people, namely the one whom the Apostle, writing to the Corinthians, takes as a judge (1 Corinthians 15), or certainly the soul of the believer, which sets its mind and reason above the people and crowd of its thoughts, so that it does not accept all the incentives of thoughts, but judges and discerns what should be followed by itself and what should be avoided. A watchman of the land of Judea, either a king, or a prophet: a watchman of the Church, either a bishop, or a presbyter, because he is chosen by the people, and knowing the reading of the Scriptures, and foreseeing what is to come, he announces to the people and corrects the wrongdoer. Therefore, it is greatly to be feared that we approach this office unworthy and chosen by the people, giving ourselves to neglect and idleness: and what is worse, serving pleasures, the belly, and laziness, we think that we have received honor, not ministry. For indeed the Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister (Matthew 20:28); and he washed the disciples' feet (John 13), to show that all filth and vices must be washed and purged from the masters in the disciples. Let us not immediately answer what profit is it to teach, if the hearer is unwilling to do what you have taught? For each one is judged according to his own mind and duty. If you have not spoken, he, if he has disregarded listening. Salomon speaks about negligent magistrates: Hidden wisdom and hidden treasure, what is the use for both? What does this signify in the Gospel (Mark 9) as well, that whoever scandalizes one of the least of the Church, it is expedient for him to be tied around his neck with a millstone of a donkey and be cast into the deep, rather than being placed on a high watchtower where he can harm many.

<h2 id='tocuniq292'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Versed 10ff.) Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them: 'Our transgressions and sins are upon us, and we waste away because of them. How then can we live?' Say to them: 'As surely as I live, declares the Lord God, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, O house of Israel?' And you, son of man, say to your people: 'The righteousness of the righteous man will not save him when he disobeys, and the wickedness of the wicked man will not cause him to stumble when he turns from it. The righteous man cannot live by his righteousness when he sins.' Even if I say to the just, that he shall surely live; and relying on his justice he commits iniquity, all his justices shall be forgotten, and in his iniquity which he has wrought, he shall die. But if I shall say to the wicked: Thou shalt surely die; and he does penance for his sin, and does judgment and justice, and if he restore the pledge, and render what he had robbed, and walk in the commandments of life, and do no unjust thing, he shall surely live, and shall not die. All sins ((Vulg. adds of him)), which he has committed, shall not be imputed to him: for judgment and justice he has done, he shall live: And the children of your people have said: The way of the Lord is not equal, whereas their way is unjust. When the just turns himself away from his justice, and commits iniquity, he shall die therein: in the same manner, when the wicked turns himself away from his wickedness, and does judgment and justice, he shall live therein. And you say: The way of the Lord is not right. Each one I will judge according to his ways, o house of Israel. If we read negligentl, the same prophecy seems to us which is said above, in which it is said: Do I desire the death of the wicked, saith the Lord God, and not that he should be converted from his ways, and live? (Ezek. XVIII, 23). And in the end of the same prophecy: Return ye, and turn yourselves from all your impieties, and there shall not be iniquity that may be your ruin (Ibid., 8). For there, indeed, a conversation is had with those who desire to do penance and to expiate their sins with justice, so that they may convert with confidence and perform penance with a full heart. But here, He speaks to those who, due to the magnitude of their sins, or rather their impieties, despair of salvation and say: Our iniquities and sins are upon us, and we waste away in them. How then can we live? And the meaning is: Since death has once been proposed to us and no medicine can restore health to our wounds, why must we labor and be consumed in vain, and not transact this present life in despair, so that at least we may enjoy it, since we have lost the future life? To whom God responds, that he does not want the death of the wicked, but that they should turn back and live. And he addresses a apostrophe to the despairing wicked: Turn away from your wicked ways. And so that we may know who the wicked are to whom he speaks, the following discourse demonstrates: Why should you die, O house of Israel? However, life and death in this context do not signify the common life or death shared with animals according to the natural law, but rather that which is written, I will please the Lord in the land of the living (Psalm 114:9); and, The soul that sins shall die. And with a special warning, because he was speaking to the house of Israel, he proceeds to a general discussion: that even if the just do not save their past righteousness, if they are engaged in new sins, and even if sinners or wicked people do not lose their old sins, if they correct their previous mistakes with righteous actions, God does not judge in both cases based on the past, but on the present. If I say, he says, to the righteous, you shall live, and I promise him the rewards of righteousness, and he, relying on that, sins, all his previous righteousness will be forgotten, and he will die in his present unrighteousness. My opinion has not changed, for I cannot give to the same sinner what I promised to the righteous. And if I, being a sinner and wicked, pronounce and say: Yet three days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown; and he shall repent of his sins, and amend his old error with good works, so that he may do justice and righteousness, restore the pledge, and give back the plunder, and walk in the commandments of life, and not do anything unjust: should not the life, which is Christ, live and never die, since the punishment of the sinner should not punish the righteous? This is what the divine word speaks to Jeremiah when he goes down to the potter's house and hears either the promises or the threats of God, in order to either provoke people to salvation or deter them from sin (Jer. XVIII). Hence those who say that the way of the Lord is not just are argued against because their opinion is unjust, possessed of a very evil eye, and not at all new, but of those who have passed judgment in the past. To all of whom it is shown that the sinner should not despair of salvation if he repents; nor should the righteous person place confidence in his righteousness if he negligently loses what he had earnestly sought after. We pass over those things which are clearly stated, so that we may dwell on those which are more obscure, in which the present prophecy differs from the past, and in which it speaks similar things, the comparison of both can indicate. Moreover, what it means to pass judgment and to be just, to restore a pledge, to repay robbery, to walk in the commandments of life, and other things, we have spoken of in this same prophet above.

<h2 id='tocuniq293'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verse 21, 22.) And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the tenth month (the Vulgate is silent on the month), on the fifth day of the month of our transmigration (or captivity), that the one who had fled (or been saved) from Jerusalem came to me, saying, 'The city has been devastated (or captured).' But the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening before the one who had fled came; and He opened my mouth until the morning, and I no longer remained silent with my mouth open. In the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah, in the fifth month, the city of Jerusalem was captured. This prophecy, however, in the twelfth year, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month of captivity or exile, when Jehoiachin was captured, shows that one year, four months, and twenty-five days after the capture of Jerusalem, a citizen of Jerusalem came to Babylon to announce the captured and devastated city. But one day before he came, who was to narrate this, in the evening the hand of the Lord came upon the prophet Ezekiel, who opened his mouth which had been closed for a long time, and whatever he was going to say, this happened before he could speak: nor did he remain silent any longer, seeing his prophecy fulfilled by action, and without doubt the people who were in Babylon, or those who were taken captive by prophetic prediction. For then the mouth of the prophet is opened, when what he had previously announced, he shows by action: and he proclaims with total freedom, things that are not yet to come, but either present or already past. This according to the literal sense. However, according to the anagoge, if Ezekiel is interpreted as the strength of God: but Christ is the power and wisdom of God (I Cor. I, 24), this must be understood that with the capture and overthrow of Jerusalem, whoever could escape the perfidy of the Jews, such as the apostles and the remnants that were saved, he himself declares to Christ that all the ceremonies of the Jews have been overthrown, which some people still think should be observed today, not hearing the Apostle's words: You have fallen from grace, you who are trying to be justified by the Law (Galat. V, 4). And therefore, the defenders of the synagogues in the churches of Christ, what do they proclaim? Therefore, after Jerusalem was captured and destroyed, the mouth of the Lord was opened through the apostles and the apostolic men, who can say: My mouth is open to you, O Corinthians; and: A great and effective door has opened to me (2 Corinthians 6:11). And this: I opened my mouth and drew in the breath (Psalm CXVIII, 131), which will never be silent, nor be heard with Israel: Listen, Israel, and be silent: but it will resound throughout the whole world, and will reveal the Gospel of Christ to the Gentiles. Therefore, according to this meaning, the twelfth year is referred to the twelve tribes, and the tenth month to the time of the Jewish propitiation, which is called ἱλασμός in Greek: and the fifth day of the month to the carnal senses, which all, captured by Jerusalem, and with the succession of the Gospel, have been shown to have been destroyed and passed away: and in the evening, that is, at the end of the world, the hand of the Lord was accomplished for the true Ezekiel, who had sung of the future ruins of the city through the prophets, and showed them to have been fulfilled in the morning.


<h2 id='tocuniq294'>(Vers. 23 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 23 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, those who dwell in these ruined places in the land of Israel speak, saying: Abraham was one, and he possessed the land; but we are many, the land has been given to us as a possession. Therefore, you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: You who eat with blood and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood, shall you inherit the land? You have stood with your swords, you have committed abominations, and each of you has defiled his neighbor's wife, and you will possess the land by inheritance? This you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: As I live, surely those who dwell in the ruins shall fall by the sword, and the one who is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in strongholds and caves shall die by pestilence. And I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and the pride of its strength shall cease, and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that no one will pass through. And they shall know that I am the Lord when I make their land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations that they have committed. And you, son of man, the children of your people speak of you beside the walls and in the doors of the houses, and they say to one another, each to his brother, 'Come, and hear what is the word that comes forth from the Lord.' And they come to you as the people usually come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them, for they show my words of their mouth in song, and their heart follows their covetousness. Indeed, you are to them like a very lovely song that is sung with a beautiful and sweet sound, and they hear your words but do not do them. And when this comes to pass, behold, it comes; they shall know that a prophet has been among them. Firstly, it must be understood that approximately eight verses prior to the place which we have established: Those who partake in blood, and lift up your eyes to your impurities, until the place where it is written: These things you shall say to them, thus says the Lord God, are not found in the Septuagint, which, along with many others, have neglected these things, or as they have been interpreted by them, gradually removed from the writings due to error. And our Latin, or rather, envious Christians, or to say it more plainly, heirs of the Grunnian faction, bark against us, because we discourse according to the Hebrew: as if food were being imposed unwillingly, and not feasts being prepared for those who receive them with thanksgiving. Certainly, if they don't trust me, let them read other editions, Aquila's, Symmachus's, and Theodotion's; let them interrogate the Hebrews from different provinces, not just one place, so they don't boast that they have been bought by me; and when they see that all agree with my error or ignorance, then let them understand that they are too wise and desire to sleep rather than to learn; and let them live in the seventy cells of the Alexandrian lighthouse, so they don't lose their sails from the ships and don't sigh for damages to the ropes. Now let us discuss what we have proposed. After Jerusalem was captured and the temple destroyed, the poor of the land, of whom Jeremiah writes, were left alone in Jerusalem to cultivate vineyards and fields and to dwell in the ruins of the burned city. And although they should have repented for the reasons for their captivity, they deceived themselves with empty hope, saying: Our father Abraham was one, and yet he possessed this land as an inheritance, not because he himself possessed it, but because his descendants received the land of promise. If, therefore, he alone was multiplied into so many peoples, we who are left behind in the land of Judea, and dwell in desolate and ruined cities, will certainly be multiplied much more, so that we may possess more than he possessed alone. To this the Lord responded: Abraham possessed the land of promise by faith. For Abraham believed in God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness (Genesis 15:8). However, these people, who are occupied with disbelief and wickedness, even if they are many, will not be able to possess. At the same time he lists the six kinds of sins that offend God, namely, those who eat in blood, and lift up your eyes to uncleanness, that is, to your idols, and pour out blood, that is, perpetrate murder: Could you, doing these things, be able to hold the land by inheritance? Nor are you content with this end of wickedness, but you stand daily in your swords, ready for killing, and imitating Esau, who stood, and lived in his sword, you do incredible abominations, namely, the shameful lusts of indecency, and each one defiles the wife of his neighbor; that you may be more wicked in that, that you have defiled the wife of your friend and neighbor. And when you do these things, do you think you will inherit the land? Therefore, answer them, O prophet, and reveal this sentence about them from my words. I swear by myself that those who dwell in ruins and walls will fall by the sword, and those who are in the fields or the plain will be devoured by beasts, and those who are in fortified places or caves cannot escape the wrath of God but will die of hunger and pestilence. And I will make the land of Judah into a desert, and its proud strength will fail, which once was its strength. But God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble (James 4:6). Even the mountains and everything will be deserted, and it will become such a great solitude that no one will pass through them, and then those who remained will no longer trust in their multitude, but will realize the magnitude of the solitude and know that I am the Lord, who made the land a desert because of all the abominations they have done. Let these words be spoken against those who, after Jerusalem was captured and the entire region of the Jews devastated, dwelt in ruins and in deserted cities and villages. Now let us turn to tropology, and according to our custom, let us engage in a broad discussion rather than a mere dissertation. Every heretic dwells in walls and deserts, and believes himself to possess the land of Israel, and says: If Abraham, by his faith alone, came into such great blessedness that his descendants were multiplied like the sand of the sea and like the stars of heaven, how much more will we, who are many, possess the land of Israel, that is, those who see God, and the confession of the Lord's Day? To whom the Lord replied: He deservedly possessed the land of faith; but your infidelity, or rather blasphemy, will not be able to possess the land of Israel, that is, the Church. For first you eat in blood, shedding their blood whom you scandalize. Then you lift your eyes to your impurities or abominations, which you have fixed in your mind: when you ought to imitate the ecclesiastical man, and say: To you I lift up my eyes, you who dwell in heaven (Ps. CXXII, 1). Thirdly, you shed blood, not giving life to those whom you have deceived, but killing them. It is not enough for you to have done these three things, but you stand with your swords, that is, you persevere in the wickedness of your opinions, and you are ready for murder, and you commit abominations, doing those things in your beds which are shameful to speak of, and you defile the wife of your neighbor, namely, the ecclesiastical conversation, eagerly snatching away those who are daily deceived from the embrace of Christ. And when you have done these things, do you think you will possess the land of Israel as an inheritance? To whom God speaks, that whoever dwells in the ruinous assemblies of heretics will fall by the sword of Ecclesiasticus, concerning which it is written: 'Double-edged swords are in their hands' (Ps. 149:6). And in the Gospel: 'I did not come to bring peace, but a sword' (Matthew 10). And the servant who indulges in luxury and idleness will be divided, that is, he will be struck with a sword, and his portion will be placed with the unbelievers' (Luke 12). And whoever is in the field or in the countryside, will be handed over to beasts for devouring, which the prophet, desiring to avoid them, prays: Do not hand over to beasts the soul confessing to you (Ps. LXXIII, 19). But whoever is in strongholds and fortified places, of which it is written: The righteous ascends strong cities, and destroys their fortifications, in which the wicked trusted (Prov. XXI, 22); and he resides in caves, of which it is said: It is written, My Father's house will be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves (Matt. XXI, 33): this person will die of the hunger of the word of the Lord, and of pestilence, and all the land of heretics will be turned into a desert, so that their pride is broken and the mountains are turned into a desert, which promised themselves the height of knowledge. Those mountains are called Israel, for under the name of Christ they deceive and overthrow everyone; no one will be able to pass through them, nor will anyone be able to say what Moses said: 'When I pass by, I will see this great vision' (Exodus 3:1). For the inhabitants of these perverse mountains are not strangers or visitors, but rather residents. And when they have suffered these things, then they will know that He is the Lord who has made their land a desert because of the abominations they have committed. It follows: On the same day and at the same time, that is, in the twelfth year, the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, when he who had fled from Jerusalem came and when the prophet spoke to those who were in the land of Judah, and they promised themselves the hope of eternal possession, and the prophet commands him to say to the people who reside in Babylon and live with him, and to accuse them of deceitful plots who desire to hear the words of the prophet, not for the salvation of their souls, but for the pleasure of their ears. These people were sitting near the walls and at the doorways of houses, not at all desiring to enter into the understanding of the prophets; but they encourage one another and say: Come, let us hear what word is coming forth from the Lord; and thus they come as a people who enter the Church of God, and sit before you, my people, who claim to be mine, and do not want to do what they have heard. They seem to me to be like those who are entertained by theatrical songs: they listen to either tragedies or comedies, and there they revel with delight: so that when they have gone out from you, they repeat and sing them, and deceive themselves with sweet sounds. And they will listen, he says, to your words and not do them. Such are many in the Churches today, who say: Come let us hear him and him, rolling his words with marvelous eloquence of his preaching: they stir up applause, and shout, and wave their hands, and those things which they had neglected in their actions, once they realize that he has come (for it is necessary that what the prophet of God pronounces in his word should come to pass), then they will begin to approve and know that all the things they had heard were not the words of a man, but of the Lord, who spoke through the prophet and the man of the church.

Book Eleven

The eleventh book of explanations on the book of Ezekiel will contain a prophecy against Gog and Magog in the final part of itself, and it will come up to the beginning of the city located on the mountain and the temple situated in it. If, with the help of the Lord and His speaking of its mysteries, I am able to bring it to a conclusion, it will be a long time and I will have much doubt whether I should put my hands on the spiritual temple or openly confess my ignorance, especially since there is great silence both among the Jews and among us regarding its interpretation. Some think that it should be built in the future, while others, with good intentions but lacking knowledge, believe that the things spoken of are spiritual but do not know how they should be explained. And in the meantime, so that the concern of the present work may hold us, know, O virgin of Christ Eustochium, that you must pray for us. In a very difficult prophecy, I briefly remind you that our not-so-noble man, writing to the Emperor, said about this nation: That Gog is a Goth; it is not for me, but for those who think so, to discuss how all the things written about it can be reconciled.

<h2 id='tocuniq296'>(Chap. XXXIV.)</h2>

(Chapter 34.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds (or to the shepherds) of Israel, prophesy, and say to the shepherds: Thus says the Lord God: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves. (Or: O shepherds of Israel, do the shepherds not feed themselves?) Do not the flocks feed on the shepherds? (Or do the sheep not feed the shepherds?) You have eaten the curds, and you have clothed yourselves with the wool, and you have slaughtered the fat animals, but you have not fed my flock. You did not strengthen what was weak (or comforted); and you did not heal what was sick; you did not bind up what was broken, and you did not bring back what was cast away (or wandering); you did not seek what was lost; but with severity you commanded them, and with power (or what happened to be, you afflicted them with labor). And my sheep were scattered because there was no shepherd (or shepherds), and they became a prey to all the beasts of the field, and they were scattered. My flocks (or sheep) had wandered upon all the mountains, and upon every high hill, and were scattered upon the face of the whole earth; and there was none to seek them, there was no one, I say, to seek (or bring back) them. Therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: As I live, says the Lord God, forasmuch as my flocks (or sheep) have been made a prey, and my sheep have been devoured by every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd (or shepherds), for my shepherds sought not after my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and did not feed my flocks. Therefore, shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: thus says the Lord God: Behold, I myself will require my flock from their hand, and I will make them cease to shepherd my flock any longer; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves (or the sheep) any longer, and I will deliver my flock (or sheep) from their mouth, and they shall no longer be food for them. For thus says the Lord God: Behold, I myself will search for my sheep and will seek them out. As a shepherd seeks out his flock when he is among his dispersed sheep (or when there is darkness and clouds among his separated sheep), so will I seek out my sheep and will deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness. And I will bring them (whether female or male) from the peoples (or from the nations), and I will gather them (whether female or male) from the lands (or from the regions), and I will bring them (whether female or male) into their own land, and I will feed them (whether female or male) on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the inhabited places of the land. In the most fertile pastures I will feed them (whether female or male), and they will be grazing their (or their sheep's) pastures on the high mountains of Israel: there they will rest in green grass, and in rich pastures they will graze on the mountains of Israel. I will feed my sheep, and I will make them lie down (or rest), says the Lord God. I will seek what was lost, and I will bring back what was cast away (or wandered): and I will bind up what was broken, and I will strengthen (or comfort) what was weak: and I will watch over the fat and strong ones, and I will feed them with judgment (or justice). But you, my flock (or sheep), this says the Lord God: Behold, I judge between the sheep, and between rams and goats. Was it not enough for you to graze on good pastures? Moreover, you trampled the remnants of your pastures with your feet, and when you drank the purest water, you disturbed the rest with your feet. And my sheep, which were trampled by your feet, were fed, and those feet of yours that disturbed, they drank. Therefore, thus says the Lord God to them: Behold, I myself will judge between the fat livestock and the lean (or between the strong and the weak livestock): because you pushed with your sides and shoulders, and with your horns you scattered all the weak animals until they were scattered outside. I will save my flock, and it will no longer be plundered, and I will judge between sheep and sheep (or between ram and ram). And I will raise up over them (here and elsewhere) (or over them) one shepherd who will feed them (or him), my servant David: he will feed them (or him): and he will be their shepherd. But I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among them. I, the Lord, have spoken. And I will make a covenant (or testament) of peace with them, and I will cause the most harmful beasts to cease from the earth, and those who dwell in the wilderness will sleep safely in the woods. And I will place them around my hill as a blessing, and I will bring rain in its season, and the rains will be a blessing. And the trees of the field will yield their fruit, and the land will give its increase, and they will dwell in their land without fear (or in the hope of peace), and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I break the yoke and deliver them from the hand of those who have enslaved them. And they will no longer be plundered by the nations, nor will the beasts of the earth devour them, but they will dwell securely (or in hope) without any fear. And I will raise up for them a renowned offspring (or a peaceable plantation), and they will no longer be cut off (or destroyed) by famine in the land, nor bear the reproach of the nations anymore. And they will know that I am the Lord their God, for I am with them, and they are my people, the house of Israel, declares the Lord God. But you, my flock, are men, the flock of my pasture (or sheep), and I am the Lord your God, says the Lord God. I have often advised to mix both editions, in order to magnify the greatness of the books, in those parts only, which do not differ much from themselves in translation. After the capture of Jerusalem, after he announced in Babylon that he had fled, he spoke about those who dwelt in the ruined Jerusalem, and then about those who were placed in captivity but nevertheless persisted in evil, unwilling to hear the words of the prophets: now he directs his speech to the shepherds, that is, to the leaders, whose fault the sheep, that is, the people, were scattered. And this should be noted, that from the twelfth year, tenth month, fifth day of the month of transmigration, or captivity of Jechoniah, and those who were captured with him, until the twenty-fifth year, when the temple is built on the mountain of the city, and the incredible sacraments of the Church are revealed, there is no middle year, and no specific time is mentioned; but it is simply said: The word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, speak to those and to them, that we may understand everything that is read in thirteen years, at different times; and yet certain intervals of time are not specified among them. But the word is directed to the shepherds of Israel, whom we must understand as either kings, or princes, scribes and Pharisees, and teachers of the Jewish people. Or certainly in the Gospel people, the bishops, presbyters, and deacons: or according to mystical understanding, the Angels of the individual Churches, to whom John wrote in his Apocalypse (Apoc. I), and whose Angels daily see the face of God (Matthew XV). And it is said first: Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who, although they should feed the Lord's flock and provide for its salvation, hasten to satisfy their own luxury. Therefore, great caution must be taken, and those precepts must be observed: Do not seek to become a judge, lest you may not be able to remove injustices (Eccli. VII, 6). And again: The greater you are, the more you should humble yourself, and in the sight of the Lord you will find favor (Ibid. III, 29). And again: They have made you a leader, do not be exalted, but be among them as one of them (Eccli. XXXII, 1). Thus the Apostle says that he is like a little child and a nursing infant among the disciples (I Cor. III). And that which follows: You were eating milk, and were clothed with wool, speaks metaphorically of the shepherds to the princes, of whom it is written elsewhere: Who devour my people like bread (Ps. LII, 5). Understand all food in milk: in wool, the various variety of garments. But when it is said: And you killed the fat, it speaks of the rich in the people, whom the wicked princes are said to slay in the churches, while they preach to them, and dare not rebuke their vices. Concerning whom the prophet also says: 'My people, who call you blessed, deceive you and undermine the path of your feet' (Isaiah 3:12). Concerning whom also James speaks (James 2:3), that when they enter, they are honored with precious clothing and a gold ring, and to the holy poor it is said: 'But you, sit on a stool, or on the ground, or stand.' They do not strengthen or consolidate what is weak. And Paul also speaks: Receive the weak (Rom. XIV, 1). And: receive the weak in faith. And: Many among you are weak and sick. To whom divine speech is sent, about which it is written in the Psalms: He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions (Ps. CV, 10). And he says that what is broken is not bound: not considering mortal wounds in the people, such as adultery, murder, sacrilege. And they do not bring back what has been rejected or what they have seen to be in error, allowing them to be deceived by heretics. And they do not seek what has been lost, not desiring to save those who are perishing, but rather to devour those who are in the Churches: but they command them with severity and with power, which properly belongs to the superciliousness of the bishops, namely, those who disgrace the dignity of their name by their actions and assume pride in humility, so that they consider themselves to have gained honor, not burden: and they strive to oppress anyone in the Church whom they see as powerful and as having the word of God. Where in the Septuagint it is written: And what was by chance, you afflicted with labor. And the people of God was dispersed, either by vices or by the error of heretics: because there was no good shepherd who would lay down his life for the sheep: but all were mercenaries, who only considered their own profit from the flocks, and when they saw a wolf, they fled. By their negligence, the flock of the Lord is devoured by the beasts of the field, of which it is written: You have set darkness, and it became night: in it all the beasts of the field shall pass, the lion's whelps roaring, that they may snatch and seek food from God (Ps. 103:20-21). And they are scattered and wander on all the mountains, which rise up against the knowledge of God, and on every lofty hill, which through heretical pride despise the simplicity of the Church. And they are scattered over the whole face of the earth, seeking earthly things, not heavenly. And there was no one who would seek or lead them back, because they are occupied with pleasures and do not care for the losses of the Lord's flock. Therefore, the word of the Lord is addressed to the wicked shepherds, because they have done these things that I have explained above, and which are enumerated a second time: Behold, I myself will come to the shepherds and seek my flock from their hand, for it is expedient that the millstone of the donkey be tied around their neck (Matthew 18), rather than they cause the least scandal to my people. And this will be their punishment or rather the greatest punishment, that they shall no longer pasture my flock: lest under the excuse of feeding the sheep they feed on themselves, and gather riches: And I will deliver my people from their mouth. I will require, says the Lord, from their hand, and I will deliver from their mouth what is devoured by greedy jaws. But when He shall require the sheep, He will visit them as if they were sick and emaciated, and scattered by the negligence of the shepherds: and He will deliver from all places in the day of the cloud and darkness, of which also Joel speaks: The day of the Lord is near, and it is the day of darkness and gloom, and the day of clouds and mist (Joel. II, 1, 2). Then they shall be brought out from the lands, to be brought into their own land, which is the land of the living: and he himself shall feed them in the mountains of Israel, of which David speaks: I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains, from whence shall come my help (Ps. CXX, 1). And not only in the mountains, but in the rivers, and in all the seats of the earth, in fertile pastures, and on the high mountain, of which Isaiah and Micah prophesy more fully (Isa. II; Mic. IV, VII): or in the high mountains of Israel. There they will rest in green pastures, and they will say: The Lord feeds me, and nothing will be lacking to me; he has placed me there in the place of pasture. He has led me forth above the waters of refreshment (Ps. 22:1-2). And they will be fed in the richest pastures on the mountains of Israel. It is an endless promise and hope of blessedness, when the Lord himself promises, saying: I will feed my sheep, and I will never commit them to evil shepherds, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord God, so that they may rest in the bosom of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Then what was lost among the peoples of the nations will be sought after, and what had wandered in the persuasion of heretics will be brought back, and what was broken will be bound up, and what was crushed and weak will be strengthened, so that what is written may be fulfilled: He heals their infirmities and binds up their wounds (Psalm 147:3). For a broken and humbled heart, God will not despise (Psalm 51:19). Therefore, even the holy one says: Heal me, O Lord, for my bones are troubled (Psalm 6:2). And in the thirty-seventh Psalm (Verse 4) the penitent says: There is no peace in my bones because of the face of my sins: and what is fat, he says, I will keep: lest it be devoured by beasts. And he will feed his sheep in judgment, knowing to which sheep what pastures are owed. For there are many mansions with the Father (John XIV). And: The Father does not judge anyone: but he has given all judgment to the Son (Ibid., V). But these things he spoke against the shepherds: now he speaks to the sheep, that is, to the people: and to the flock of both kinds of livestock, that is, the sheep and the goats: and not only to the sheep and goats, but also to the rams and the bucks, who are the leaders in the flocks, to whom he says: Was it not enough for you to feed on the good pastures of the Scriptures? But in addition, you were trampling on the remnants of your pastures with your feet. And while you were drinking the purest waters of God's teachings, you were disturbing the remaining waters with your feet, so that my people would eat and drink trampled pastures and tainted waters because of your fault, which in itself was good but became corrupted and violated. Indeed, this is what all heretics do, they pick apart the words of the Scriptures and, to the best of their ability, stain them. But even the ecclesiastical men who do not preserve the truth of the doctrines, but instead fabricate them from their own hearts, and hold their presumption as a teacher, are held captive by a similar error. When they persuade the people that the things they invent are true, and when they incite applause and cheers in a theatrical manner, they become forgetful of their own ignorance, and with raised eyebrows, weighing their words, and brandishing them, they assume the authority of teachers for themselves. Let us therefore see what judgment there is between one flock and another: and by what judgment the good and true shepherd, who has received all judgment from the Father, may judge them. Behold, he says, I myself judge between the fat flock and the lean, or between the strong and the weak. For the strong push and butt the weak with their sides and shoulders, and they fan them with their horns, not knowing that the bull should be punished by the law of the horn (Exodus 21). But they keep pushing on the sides, and they fan with their horns until they scatter and drive the sheep outside. For the pride of the ancestors and the injustice of the leaders, they are frequently driven out of the Church, so that they may be scattered by the Lord, whom He Himself saved. But the Lord will not let them continue to plunder, and He will judge between sheep and sheep: not between the names of dignitaries, by which the leaders swell with pride; but between man and man, according to what each servant of the Lord is. Then He will raise up one shepherd, who says in the Gospel: I am the good shepherd (John 10:11); His servant David according to what form of a servant He deigned to assume (Philippians 2); who is interpreted as 'mighty by hand'. He Himself will pasture them, and the Lord will be their God, either the Son and the Father, or certainly the shepherd according to assumed flesh: But the Lord, and God, according to the Word which was in the beginning with God. That David, as the rational animal advances in the flock, will by no means be called a shepherd, but rather a prince among them, about whom it is written: But there is one among you whom you do not know (John 1:26). Then he will make a covenant of peace with them, not of war or discord, for his dwelling place is in peace (Psalm 75), but the peace of Christ, which surpasses all understanding (Philippians 4), who says: My peace I give to you: my peace I leave with you (John 14, 27). And he will cause the most harmful creatures to cease from the earth, vices, or disturbances, by which human souls are tormented: or opposing powers, by which they are attacked. And those who dwell in the wilderness shall sleep securely in the forests. For the Lord will reveal the hidden places of the woods, and in His temple all shall declare glory (Ps. 28:9). And with the beasts driven away and the land reduced to solitude, those who sleep securely shall say: The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear (Ps. 26:1)? And He will place them, who sleep securely, around His mountain or hill, and they shall receive blessings. Then he will give rain in its season, and there will be rain of blessings, which he promises in the blessings of Deuteronomy (Deut. XXVIII). And he will give, it is said, the tree of life, of which it is written in Genesis (Genes. II): and the tree of wisdom, of which it is said, It is a tree of life to all who take hold of it (Prov. III, 18). And he will give its fruit, when the earth also gives its fruit: whether it be the trees of the regions, a great multitude of the saints. And the earth will give its fruit: for truth has arisen from the earth (Ps. 84, 12). And they shall be in their land without fear, or in the hope of peace, in the land of the living, in the land of the meek, of whom it is written: Blessed are the meek; for they shall possess the land (Matt. 5, 4): so that they may know by the happiness of all things that He is the Lord: when He has broken the chains, or the iron circle of their yoke, with which they were oppressed as if by a most severe power, and has freed them from the hand of those who held them in power or afflicted them with servitude. For everyone is a slave of whoever conquers them. And they will no longer be a prey to demonic nations; nor will the beasts of the earth devour those of whom we have spoken: but they will dwell confidently without any fear, according to the above explanation. And I will raise up for them a named offspring, or a planting of peace, which is spoken of in the Gospel: I am the true vine (John 15:1). And they will no longer be diminished by hunger on the earth. Therefore, hunger is on earth: the hunger to hear the word of God, which, under a good shepherd and a named branch, and celebrated in the speech of all, and the planting of peace, will never be on earth; nor will they be subjected any longer to the reproaches of the nations, saying: Where is their God (Psalm 113, 10)? And after all this, it is known that not only is He the Lord, as He Himself had said before, but with the addition that He is the Lord of all and truly their God, with those who says in the Gospel to the Apostles: Behold, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world (Matthew 28, 20). But when He Himself shall be their Lord God, then they shall also be His people, not anyone, but those who have merited to be called the house of Israel. And so that we may not think that all that has been said pertains to shepherds and goats and rams, He solves the riddle, or rather the metaphor, and states more plainly: But you are My sheep, and you, men, are the sheep of My pasture. Therefore, every divine word is for human beings, to whom He says: I am the Lord your God, says the Lord God.


<h2 id='tocuniq297'>(Chap. XXXV.)</h2>

(Chapter 35) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it, and say to it, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you a desolation and a waste. I will demolish your cities and make you a solitude, and you shall be deserted, and you shall know that I am the Lord; because you have been an everlasting enemy and have delivered the children of Israel into the hand of the sword (or deceitfully sat against the house of Israel in the hand of the sword) in the time of their affliction, in the time of extreme wickedness. Therefore, I live," says the Lord God, "because I will deliver you to bloodshed (or because you have sinned in blood) and blood will pursue you: and when you hate blood, blood will pursue you. And I will make Mount Seir a desolation and a wasteland, and I will remove from it going and returning (or men and animals). And I will fill its mountains with the slain (or the wounded): they will fall with the sword in your hills, and in your valleys, and in the torrents of the slain. I will deliver you to everlasting desolations, and your cities shall not be inhabited: and you shall know (or shall know) that I am the Lord (Vulgate adds God): because you have said: Two nations and two lands (or regions) shall be mine, and I will possess them by inheritance, when the Lord was there. Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord God: because you have done according to your wrath (or enmity), and according to your zeal, which you have shown, having hatred towards them, and I will make myself known to you (Vulgate through them) when I judge you, and you shall know that I am the Lord. I have heard all your insults (or the voice of your blasphemies) that you have spoken (or because you have spoken) against the mountains of Israel, saying, 'They are deserted and given to us to devour,' and you have risen up (or have exalted yourself) against me with your mouth (or you have spoken magnificently against me with your mouth), and you have slandered me (or you have shouted against me) with your words; I have heard it. Thus says the Lord God: While all the earth rejoices, I will make you a desolation; just as you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will do to you. You shall be desolate, Mount Seir, and all of Edom shall know that I am the Lord. But that which is added in the LXX, 'and they shall be consumed,' is not found in the Hebrew. If the word of God always dwelt in the hearts of the prophets and had constant residence there, Ezekiel would not so frequently have said, 'And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying.' But because of human frailty and the necessities of this life, it sometimes departed from them. Therefore, John the Baptist speaks: 'He who sent me to baptize, said to me, "Upon whomsoever you shall see the Spirit descending as a dove and abiding on him, he is the one."' (John 1:33). For it would never be proper in Christ what is added and remains in Him, unless sometimes it would depart from others. Otherwise God speaks to Moses: I will take from the spirit which is in you (Num. XI, 17): which surely he would not have, unless it descended to him from the Lord. However, the prophecy of this entire chapter is against Mount Seir, namely the sons of Esau and Edom, who are called Idumeans in the Greek and our language, because in the time of necessity and distress, when Judah was being captured by the Babylonians, they insulted them and believed that the land was given to them to possess, and not only did they not accept their brothers, namely the sons of Jacob, but they persecuted them and attacked them with the sword. Where Symmachus interpreted more clearly, You have hated your blood, and blood will pursue you. But it is prophesied that he himself will be captured and reduced to eternal solitudes, and at the end of things he will recognize that God is the judge, because he has said: Two nations and two regions are mine; either the Edomites and the Jews, or certainly the Jews and Israel, namely two and ten tribes. And you have spoken of the mountains of Israel, saying: Deserts have been given to us to devour, not considering that this blasphemy would overflow against God. From which it follows: All the earth rejoices, I will lead you into solitude. And the meaning is: when all the land of Judaea will receive its former state, you will remain in eternal solitude. And what is added is: Just as you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was dispersed, I will do the same to you. In the Septuagint it is not found, but it was added under asterisks from the edition of Theodotion. But all the wrath of God advances there against Mount Seir, so that when it is dispersed, he himself and all of Idumea may know that he is the Lord. I have spoken these things hastily, according to historical context and meaning rather than literal words. I will now move on to the anagoge and briefly touch on a few points for the sake of brevity. 'Put,' he says, 'or turn your face towards Mount Seir.' And significantly, he says 'turn,' from one prophecy to another prophecy. However, he is not referring to the physical face, but rather the face of the soul, as the Apostle also says: 'But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord' (2 Corinthians 3:18). However, the mountain of Seir, which is interpreted as rough and hairy, represents the opposing strength that presided over the nation of the sons of Esau, and rose up against the people of Judah, that is, the confession and true faith. But if an astute reader objects, how can Seir, that is, rough and hairy, be understood in a negative sense, since even Elijah is called a hairy man (2 Kings 1)? I will respond briefly: it is written about Esau that he was red and like a hairy skin (Genesis 25), but about Elijah that he was only a hairy man. Esau, who is bloodthirsty and cruel, is compared to a rough animal skin, a symbol of human works and of death itself; while Elijah represents manliness. Therefore, both his dwelling in solitude and his austere way of life not only showed him to be a man, but also a very strong man. On the other hand, Jacob, who had supplanted Esau and taken his birthright (Genesis, 25), is called light and polished because he simply lived at home and was not a hunter like the giant, Nimrod. Let us see then what God commands to be said to the mountain, or against the mountain of Seir. Behold, I will come to you, Mount Seir, I will not send Angels, nor will I use other ministers, but I myself will come to you, and I will extend my hand over you, and I will assume the appearance of one who strikes, and I will make you desolate and deserted, as one who dwelt wickedly, and you had many partners in your impiety, so much so that you built cities and claimed them as your own dominion: now desolated together with your cities, which Jeremiah is commanded to destroy and dig up (Jer. 51), in that you will make progress by building good cities in their place, so that you may know that I am the Lord, whom you could not know before the desolation of your land. However, the root cause of sin is that you have been an eternal enemy. Hence, the psalm says: Be angry, but do not sin (Psalm 4:5), so that we may quickly reconcile with our enemies and change hatred into love. However, not such is Mount Seir, which encompasses eternal enmities or besieges the children of Israel deceitfully with a sword in hand. From this we understand that whoever takes up the sword against the children of God, acts deceitfully, and besieges them, shall be handed over to the power of the sword, just as Mount Seir did in a time of extreme wickedness, when the days were evil and the world was filled with evil. And with the increase of wickedness, the love of many grows cold. But there is another sin of the mountain of Seir: that, because it hated the blood of the just, which it desired to spill in every persecution, it suffers persecution from the same blood. Therefore, the souls under the altar of the saints cry out and beg for vengeance from the Lord for their bloodshed. And they are taken away from the mountain of Seir, going and returning, that is, every inhabitant, whether humans or animals that are saved in the Church, of whom it is written: You will save humans and animals, Lord. (Psalm 35:5). That in the mountain of Seir both those who seem to have some reason, and those who are content with simple faith, should perish at God's command. And its mountains are filled with the wounded and slain. And not only the mountains, which have reached the summit of impiety, but also the hills, that is, the lesser disciples of the mountain of Seir, and the valleys that are in the depths, or the torrents, which have muddy waters, collected from here and there, coming from pride, or, according to the Septuagint, the fields, which are in the middle between the hills and the valleys. All the slain will fall by the sword of the Lord, and His outstretched hand and striking, so that they may be reduced to everlasting desolation; and if there were cities, that is, assemblies of evil dwelling, let them perish themselves and cease to have agreement in a bad way, and let their languages be divided (Genesis 11), so that they may not be able to build a tower of blasphemy against God; and being reduced to solitude and desert, let them know that He is the Lord. It is not enough that you have spoken so much about Mount Seir, as the previous discourse narrated; but you have also spoken this out of pride: 'There are two peoples and two lands or regions that belong to me, namely Idumea and Judaea, and I will possess the heretics and the Ecclesiastics alike.' And you said this when the Lord was there, who governed His people. Therefore the Lord swears and says: 'As I live,' says the Lord God, 'I will make myself known to you when I strike and judge you, in accordance with your anger with which you raged against the people of God, and with your zeal with which you persecuted the family of Christ, hating those whom you desired to possess. Then you will know that it was I who made known your reproaches and blasphemies, and not someone else, for I myself have heard what you have said against the mountains of Israel, saying: 'They have been given to us as a desolation to devour.' We must accept the mountains of Israel, Moses, the prophets, and the apostles, whom the heretics and the leader of the heretics, the devil, think they have been handed over to devour: when either rarely or not at all is found in the Church, who is able to fight for the mountains of the Lord, and defend their tearing apart with his voice. And you have risen up, he says, against me with your mouth, whether you have spoken magnificently, not as you think against the mountains, but through them against me, and you have either asked or shouted against me. For all your prayers, O Mount Seir, and companions of Mount Seir, of which it was said above (above, the same): I will fill his mountains and hills, and valleys, and fields, or torrents, they were against us: not prayers and supplications, as you think to God, but shouts, vociferations, and blasphemies. Therefore, the Lord threatens and says: Just as you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, when it was scattered and torn by your persecutions and dispersed throughout the whole world: so I will do to you. For the whole earth of the living rejoices, and the land of the saints, and all those converted to the service of God, you will be scattered, O rough mountain, O hairy mountain, and all Idumea, devoted indeed to earthly works and to bloodshed and slaughter, so that then you may know that I myself am the Lord, who have spoken elsewhere: I am the Lord your God.

<h2 id='tocuniq298'>(Chap. XXXVI.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter XXXVI. — Verses 1 and following) \"But you, son of man, prophesy over the mountains of Israel and say, 'Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord: Thus says the Lord God, because the enemy has said of you, 'Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession,' therefore prophesy, and say, 'Thus says the Lord God: Because you have been desolate and crushed on all sides (or because you have been scattered from those around you), and have become a possession (or inheritance) for the rest of the nations, and you have risen up on the lips of the tongue, and have become a reproach to the people (or nations).'\ Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus says the Lord God to the mountains and hills, to the rivers, valleys, and desolate walls (or scattered), and to the deserted and depopulated cities that have been mocked (or trampled) by (Al. and) the rest of the nations all around. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because I have spoken in the fire of my zeal against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who (Vulg. who) have given my land to themselves as an inheritance with joy (Al. with the sword), and with the whole heart, and with all their soul, and have expelled it to ravage (or with hatred despising souls, to overthrow them in devastation). Therefore he says (( Vulg. he is silent, says)), prophesy over the land of Israel, and you shall say to the mountains and hills, the ridges and valleys, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I in my zeal, and in my fury, have spoken, because you have endured the confusion (or reproaches) of the nations. Therefore thus says the Lord God (or Adonai the Lord): I have raised (or will raise) my hand, that the nations which are around you, they themselves shall bear their confusion (or disgrace). But you, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people Israel, for they are about to come. For behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown. And I will multiply people on you, the whole house of Israel, all of it. The cities shall be inhabited and the waste places rebuilt. And I will fill you with people and animals, and they shall multiply and be fruitful. And I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times, and will do more good to you than ever before. Then you will know that I am the Lord. And I will bring forth (or generate) upon you, my people Israel, and they will possess you (or you), and you will be (or you will be) for an inheritance, and you will no longer be added, so that you may be without them (or and you will no longer add, so that they may make you childless). Thus says the Lord God: Because they have said of you (or to you), you are a devourer of men, and a choker of your nation: therefore you will no longer eat men, and you will no longer kill your nation, says the Lord God: nor will I cause the confusion (or shame) of nations to be heard in you (or in you) any longer, and you will not bear the reproach of peoples (or you will not bear), and you will no longer lose your nation (or your nation will no longer be without children), says the Lord God. Above is the description of the prophet's appearance, or rather his turning towards the mountain of Seir. Here the son of man speaks to the mountains, or rather to the mountains of Israel, who are commanded to hear the word of God. And to briefly delay the allegory, the overall meaning of the prophecies concerning the mountains of Israel is this: Because the enemy, that is, the mountain of Seir, has insulted you and believed that he would possess you forever, and the once high places of the Lord are now deserted and have passed into his inheritance, and not only did he say this, but he also possessed you for a considerable time, to the extent that he spoke arrogantly against you, which brought reproach upon you from all nations. Therefore, thus says the Lord God, not only to the mountain of Seir, but also to its mountains and hills, streams, valleys, deserts, and ruins, and to the abandoned cities: because he has spoken with the fire of his zeal, not only against all the nations, but especially against Edom, which, he says, has held my land in possession along with the other nations, and has possessed it with the sword, and has possessed it with all their heart, in order to drive out its inhabitants and lay waste to the land. Therefore, speak, says the prophet, concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and hills, and hills (which the Seventy interpreted as 'valleys,' which we understand as wooded areas) and valleys. Thus says the Lord God: in my zeal and fury, I will be the avenger of your reproach, and I will raise my hand, so that the nations that are around you may bear their disgrace and confusion: but you, O mountains of Israel, will bear fruit according to your former state, and produce shoots and, according to the Seventy, bring forth grapes, with which my people Israel will be satisfied. That which you may not think will happen after a long time is near, imminent, and will come. And lest this seem difficult to you, I myself will come to you, and those who had departed from you will return to you, so that you may regain your former culture and all things may be fulfilled, so that there may be many people among you, and cities, which were previously destroyed, may be inhabited. And not only will I multiply people, but also animals will multiply and increase, and I will make you dwell as in the beginning, when Moses, leading the two and a half tribes across the Jordan (Numbers 32), and under Joshua, son of Nun, the other nine and a half tribes possessed the land of Judah (Joshua 1 and 13): and I will give you much greater possessions than you had in the beginning before you experienced various captivities. And when I have done this to you, then you will know that I am the Lord. And you, O land of Israel, will be full and abundant, a possession for my people, who will inherit you. You will no longer be without children. But when your inhabitants multiply, O mountains of Israel, then your enemies will no longer accuse you of devouring men and of being a land without children. Instead, you will multiply and your descendants will be numerous. You will neither hear, he said, any longer, nor will you endure the confusion of the nations, nor will you lose your people, so that you may eventually endure captivity, because the Lord has spoken. We will say these things loosely in the Jewish manner, which they expect in the thousand-year kingdom, when they assert that the city of Jerusalem is to be rebuilt, and the temple, which is described at the end of this volume, and the happiness of all things, some of which they believe were fulfilled under Zerubbabel. But how can this be fulfilled, what is said: 'And I will make you dwell as in the beginning, and I will give you greater blessings than you had in the beginning?' For under Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, only a few of the people were brought back, and they themselves were obedient to the Medes and Persians, and subsequently served the Macedonians, Egyptians, and Romans, and even to this day they serve various kings of different nations, such as Titus and Vespasian. Therefore, this prophecy at the end cannot possibly be fulfilled: 'And you will no longer bear the reproach of the nations, and you will not lose your people anymore.' And because it is now lengthy against the Jewish doctrine, and the blessedness serving the stomach and throat of the Jews, who desire all earthly things, and say: Let us eat and drink, of which the Apostle also speaks: Food for the stomach and the stomach for food: but God will destroy both it and them (I Cor. VI, 13), let us now briefly explain: let us now pass on to spiritual understanding, according to which we have also interpreted the extreme parts of Isaiah. For we do not expect Jerusalem to be adorned and golden from heaven, according to the Jewish fables which they call 'second books', nor will we suffer the injury of circumcision, nor will we offer sacrifices of bulls and rams, nor will we sleep in the idleness of the Sabbath. Many of our people, especially in Tertullian's book titled 'On the Hope of the Faithful', and in Lactantius' seventh volume of 'Institutions', and in the frequent explanations of Bishop Victorinus of Pettau, and recently in our own Severus' dialogue called 'The Rooster', have also said this. And that I may mention the Greeks, and unite the first and the last, Irenaeus and Apollinarius. Therefore, we will say that the mountains of Israel are the prophets and apostles, who hear the word of God, and to whom the enemy devil insulted, saying: 'Well done, once lofty mountains, about which it is written: The mountains are round about it, and the Lord is round about His people' (Ps. 124:2), have been given to me as a possession, when they were desolated by the narrowness of persecution, and trodden down round about, and have become an inheritance to the rest of the nations, and have been blasphemed by all. Therefore the Lord speaks, having trampled upon the mountains and desolated them, not only the mountains but also the lower parts and through every step on the land of Judea, that is, on the mountain of the Church which is written: A city set on a mountain cannot be hidden (Matthew 5:14); and on the hills and torrents, whose faith is increased in the winter of persecutions and in the storm of trials. Also on these valleys, which have been brought low by humility, and on the deserted Churches and walls, and on the whole world, on the gatherings of Churches that have been abandoned, such as the persecution that took place throughout the world under Diocletian and Maximian, by which Churches were proscribed and devastated: when all the nations of the Gentiles and the heretical nations mocked the Church, because it spoke in the fire of its zeal and especially against Edom, which wanted to carry the image of the earthly, having cast aside the image of the heavenly (1 Corinthians 15). For they indeed have taken the land of God as their inheritance, and with their whole heart and soul they have persecuted the Church of the Lord, and they have cast it out from its seats, and have laid it waste. But what has it profited the nations, what has it benefited the heretical peoples to insult the land of the Lord: when the Lord speaks to it, and to its hills, and mountains, and wooded places, which were flourishing with the beauty of paradise: and to the hills of which we have spoken above, he has spoken in his zeal and fury: and he lifts his hand against the adversaries, who have persecuted the Church, to bring about their confusion and disgrace? Then, with the persecutors killed and peace restored to the Church, the mountains of Israel, namely the Apostles and Apostolic men, will bring forth their trees and extend their branches, and they will produce grapes to be trodden in the winepress of the Lord, from which new wine is poured, which will intoxicate the peoples of the believers, and the wine that brings joy to the heart of man will be pressed out (Psalm 103): so that all the fruits of the mountains, from which the bread that comes down from heaven is made, may be eaten by the people of the God of Israel. And let us not despair in persecutions, it is added: The time is near for it to come. For he will come, coming indeed, and will not delay (Hab. 2:3). From there he promises his coming to the mountains, and to those who have endured in tribulations, and he promises that after the heat of persecution the earth, previously gleaned by the ploughshare of Christ, will be cultivated, and will receive every seed of virtue, from which men will be born and multiplied, and all the house of Israel. And when the cities, that is, the churches of the believers, were inhabited again by returning crowds, not only the men who were knowledgeable in the Scriptures will be there, but also the animals, and the simple believers will multiply and grow, and the churches will be inhabited as in the beginning, that is, before the persecution arose, and they will flourish with greater blessings than they had from the beginning, crowned by the victories of the martyrs. And then they will know that He is the Lord, who restores His people to their former state, which possesses the Churches, and that the Churches themselves are the inheritance of the Churches, and no longer without children, whom He had lost in persecution. Hence the prophet is commanded to speak to the land of the gentle, the land of the living, or to the mountains of Israel, and to say: You shall no longer suffer the reproach of persecutors, nor will they insult your slaughtered people, like sheep for slaughter. With peace being restored, all reproaches will cease, and you will no longer endure confusion and disgrace among various wanderings, but you will have your nation and your people, for the truth of the promise, spoken by the Lord, has been confirmed.

<h2 id='tocuniq299'>(Vers. 16 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 16 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, the house of Israel have dwelt (or dwells) in their own land, and they have defiled it with their ways and their idols: according to the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity, their way has become before me. And I poured out my indignation (or fury) upon them, for the blood they have shed upon the land: they have defiled it with their idols, and I scattered them among the nations, and dispersed them in the lands (or regions) according to their ways, and judged them for their inventions (or sins), and they entered into the nations to which they came, and defiled my holy name, when it was said of them, This is the people of the Lord, and they have come out of his land. And I spared my holy name (that is, I spared them for the sake of my holy name) which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came. Therefore, say to the house of Israel, thus says the Lord God: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to whom you came. And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the Lord, declares the Lord God, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes. Indeed, I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and bring you into your own land. I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit in your midst (or give it to you), and I will make you walk in my precepts (or my justifications), and keep my judgments, and do (or make) them ((Vulg. is silent on them)). And you shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers, and you shall be to me a people, and I will be to you a God. And I will save you ((Al. I will save you)) from all your defilements (or impurities), and I will call forth grain, and multiply it, and I will not give (or give) you famine, and I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the produce of the field, so that you will no longer bear the reproach of famine among the nations. And you shall remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good, and your iniquities, and your abominations. And I will not do for your sake, saith the Lord God, let it be known unto you. Be ye confounded, and ashamed at your own ways, O house of Israel. Thus saith the Lord God: In the day that I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities, and shall cause the cities to be inhabited, and shall repair the ruinous places, And the desolate land shall be tilled, which before was waste in the sight of all that passed by, They shall say: This land that was untilled (or desolate) is become as a garden of pleasure; and the cities that were uninhabitable, and deserted, and ruined, are now fenced, and inhabited. And the nations shall know that those who were left all around you,   who were scattered, I the Lord have rebuilt. I have replanted what was desolate.   I the Lord have spoken and I will do it. Thus says the Lord God:   In this I will be found by the house of Israel,   and I will act for them. I will multiply them like a flock of people,   like a holy flock, like the flock of Jerusalem in its appointed feasts.   The cities shall be inhabited again,   and the waste places rebuilt with flocks of people.   Then they shall know that I am the Lord. The things that are said are clear, and the whole sense of the mountains of Israel, which were previously desert, and afterwards restored, is now more clearly revealed. And God explains why He handed over the people of Israel to captivity, and promises, due to His mercy, to bring them back to the land of Judah and to give them much greater things than He had taken away. Some Jews refer this to the times of Zerubbabel, when, with Cyrus, the king of the Persians releasing their captivity, many were brought back from the tribe of Judah and Benjamin to Judah. But others refer it to a kingdom of a thousand years, when under Christ, whom they suppose to be coming, the city of Jerusalem is to be built, and the temple to be constructed, concerning which temple we shall speak in the interpretation of the last part of the book. Meanwhile, let us pass briefly through the remaining portion of this chapter, and consider what seems to be said to us according to the understanding of the Church. The house of Israel, that is, the people of the Jews, once dwelt in their land, that is, in the land of Judah, when they were brought out of Egypt. But they defiled it with their ways and pursuits, or their idols, and they became so polluted that they were compared to the filth of a menstruating woman. Because of this, God poured out his indignation upon them, for the blood of the prophets and the righteous, which they had shed on the earth, as the Savior says in the Gospel: Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you (Matthew 23:37). And again (Verse 35): Amen, amen I say to you: the blood of Abel, the just, shall be required of this generation from the blood of Zacharias, the son of Barachias, whom you killed between the altar and the temple. Amen, I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation. Therefore, behold I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes, and some of them you will put to death and crucify, and some you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city, that upon you may come all the just blood that hath been shed upon the earth, from the blood of Abel the just, even unto the blood of Zacharias the son of Barachias, whom you killed between the altar and the temple. Amen I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered together thy children, as the hen doth gather her chickens under her wings, and thou wouldst not? Behold, your house shall be left to you, desolate! For I say to you, you shall not see me henceforth till you say: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! When I saw this, he said, not for their sake, but for the sake of my holy name (for I am the Creator of all), I spared them and sanctified them, and I restored them to their former glory, so that I might pour out clean water of saving Baptism upon those who believe and have turned away from error, and cleanse them from their abominations and from all the errors in which they were occupied, and give them a new heart to believe in the Son of God and a new spirit, of which David speaks: Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me (Ps. 50:21). And it is to be considered that a new heart and a new spirit are given through the effusion and sprinkling of water. When, however, a new heart and a new spirit are given, then all hardness, which is compared to stone, will be removed from the Jewish heart, so that the heart may be a fleshy, soft, and tender one, which can receive the spirit of God within itself and be inscribed with saving words. Then they will walk in the precepts of the Lord and keep His judgments, and they will dwell in the land of confession, which He had given to their fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to all the holy ones and prophets, and they will become the people of God, and the Lord will be their God, as is proven in the present time. And when they are saved, the Lord will call the grain and multiply it. For unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone (John 12:24). And they will not endure hunger (Amos 8:11): not hunger for bread and thirst for water, but hunger for hearing the word of God, which he who came from the Father, having received all substance, scattered: when in the necessity of hunger, he fed on the pods of swine (Luke 15). Then the fruit of the tree, that is, wisdom, will be multiplied, of which it is written: The tree of life is to all who seek it (Prov. III, 18): and the produce of the field will be like Jacob, whose scent was like the scent of a full field, to whom the Lord blessed (Genes. XXVII, 27). They will no longer bear the reproach of famine among the nations, which the unbelief of the Jews suffers to this day: but after they have attained blessedness, they will imitate the Apostle who says: I am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God (I Cor. XV, 9). And they will remember their worst ways and their non-good pursuits, by which they offended God. And their iniquities and their crimes, by which they previously erred, will displease them. But the Lord will attribute all these things, not for the sake of those who perished by their own error, but for the sake of his holy name. Therefore, he provokes the house of Israel to be confused and ashamed about their past vices, and to understand their Creator. But after he will have cleansed the people of the believers from their iniquities, and he will have made the cities of the Church to be inhabited, and he will have restored the ruined things that had fallen in the synagogues, and the land of confession will have been cultivated with the ceremonies of God, which once seemed desolate to all the saints who pass by the works of earthly conversation: then all will say: How does the land of Judah, which once was uncultivated, now have the likeness of the paradise of God; and the cities of Judah, which were deserted and abandoned, and buried by their unbelief, now stand upright and fortified in confession, and in the name of the Lord and Savior? So that every creature may know, and the multitudes of Angels, which surround the land of Israel, that the Lord has built up the desolate cities and planted the barren regions, and that He has fulfilled what He had promised through the prophets. And this will not be the extent of His generosity towards the people He has saved, but He will provide even greater things. For indeed, He will be found by the house of Israel, who had been sought for a long time and was not found. And after he finds him, he will multiply them like sheep: not of brute animals, but of sheep of men, which are full of reason and confession, like holy sheep and flocks of Jerusalem, in which the worship of God proper and the vision of peace is, in its solemnities when we eat the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth (1 Cor. 5), and we feed on the flesh of the Lamb and drink its blood, and in the seven weeks, and in the tabernacles of this present age we celebrate the Lord's Day festivals, so that the once desolate cities may become full of flocks of men, and by this means they may know that he himself is the Lord, who has provided all things. According to the truth of history, or rather according to the faith of prophecy, it suffices to say briefly how the people of Israel are restored to their original state, and how the remnant of the people of Judah, as the Apostle Paul teaches (Rom. IX, 11), are saved in the Apostle and in all those who initially believed from the Jews and continue to return to the Church even today. Now, the same sense must be opened in this brief tropology. Whoever is from the house of Israel and perceives the peace of Christ, which surpasses all understanding, dwells in his own land, that is, the Church, or in the temporary dwelling of the flesh, which has been given to him by God. But if he pollutes both lands with his wicked ways, and is compared to the impurity of a menstruating woman: God will pour out his indignation upon him, for the blood, either his own or those whom he has scandalized, and will pour it out upon the land, and with perverse thoughts he pollutes it. Then he will be scattered among the nations, to be leveled with the unbelievers, and will be tossed about on the earth like chaff, to be separated from the grain of the Church, and judged according to his ways. But if they have not perceived their sin in this way, but have defiled His holy name, then all those among whom they have lived will say: Behold the people of God, behold those who have come forth from their land, or rather have been cast out. But if they repent and I am sanctified in their midst, then all the multitude of the nations will know that I will remove them from the lands where they were dispersed and bring them back to the land of the Church, and I will pour out upon them not the waters of saving Baptism, but the waters of teaching and the word of God; and I will cleanse them from all their uncleannesses, and from all the idols and errors which they had secretly conceived in their hearts. And I will give them a new heart, which they had lost through sin, and I will renew a right spirit within their hearts. And I will remove the stony heart, that is, the unbelieving heart; and I will give them a fleshy heart, soft and tender; that they may receive the commandments of God; so that they may walk in my commandments, and observe my judgments; which they had previously neglected, and they shall dwell in the land which I had given to their fathers, namely, the masters and teachers; and once again, they shall be the people of God, and the Lord shall be turned to them as God, whom they had previously offended. Then they will be saved from all their sins, and their grain will multiply, from which heavenly bread is made; and they will no longer suffer from hunger for the word of God; and the tree of wisdom will multiply in them, and their hearts will be filled with offspring. They will no longer be a reproach among the nations; but after God has shown them mercy, they will remember their wicked ways and know where they have been, and they will be disgusted by their iniquities. What the Lord says is not for them, but for his own mercy. Therefore, he encourages those who are straying to be confounded and ashamed in their ways, and to be restored to the cities of the Church, which will be inhabited by them again and all that have fallen in them will be rebuilt. And they will return to the ancient ceremonies, and the once deserted land, which appeared desolate to its inhabitants and to passing strangers, will return to its former state; and all will marvel and say: This uncultivated land, this deserted land, in which all virtues once perished, has now become like a garden of pleasure and a paradise of God; and the once deserted cities, which did not have God as their guest, and were deprived of the Holy Spirit, and were buried in unbelief, will be fortified by the faith of Christ, so that all around may know that the Lord has built up scattered souls, and has planted and nurtured in them the trees of all virtues; and he himself has fulfilled the things he promised in his words. And again the prophetic word exhorts the repentant, that even when they have returned to the Church, they should always seek the Lord, and find Him: so that the flocks of the Lord may multiply with the multitude of those who return: not of horses and brute animals, but of flocks of men, who are full of faith and reason, the holy flocks, the flocks of the city of Jerusalem, on all the solemnities, which they have received through the mercy of God; so that when the multitude of such flocks has filled the cities of the Lord, then all may know that He is the Lord.


<h2 id='tocuniq300'>(Chap. XXXVII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 37, verses 1 onwards) The hand of the Lord was upon me, and He brought me out in the Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. And He led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry. And He said to me, 'Son of man, can these bones live?' And I answered, 'O Lord God, you know.' Then He said to me, 'Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, 'O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord.' And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and the noise came, and behold a commotion: and the bones came together, each one to its joint. And I saw, and behold there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and skin was stretched out over them, but there was no spirit in them. And he said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit: Thus saith the Lord God: Come, spirit, from the four winds, and blow upon these slain, and let them live again. And I prophesied as He commanded me, and the spirit entered into them and they came to life: a vast army. Then he said to me: Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say: Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off. Therefore, prophesy and say to them: This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them, my people; I will bring you back to the land of Israel. Then you, my people, will know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves and bring you up from them. I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I am the Lord; I have spoken and I will do it, declares the Lord God. LXX: And the hand of the Lord came upon me, and he brought me in the Spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the plain, and it was full of human bones, and he led me round about them, on every side: and behold there were very many upon the face of the plain, and they were very dry. And he said to me: Son of man, dost thou think these bones shall live? And I answered: O Lord God, thou knowest. And he said to me: Prophesy concerning these bones; and say to them: Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will send spirit into you, and you shall live. And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to grow over you, and will cover you with skin: and I will give you spirit, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord. And I prophesied as he commanded me: and the voice came to pass, while I prophesied, that behold a commotion, and the bones came together, each one to its joint. And I saw, and behold sinews came upon them, and flesh grew and skin covered them above, but there was no spirit in them. And he said to me: Prophesy, son of man, prophesy upon the spirit, and say to the spirit: Thus says the Lord God: Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. And I prophesied as I had been commanded, and the spirit entered into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, a very great assembly. Then the Lord spoke to me, saying: Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are completely cut off. Therefore, prophesy and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people, and I will bring you into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves, and bring you up from your graves, O my people. I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the Lord; I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the Lord God. The vision is famous and celebrated by the reading of all the Church of Christ: for this reason, I have included both editions in their entirety, lest any slander against us be made by the Hebrews, if at least in words there may be some discrepancy. For they are accustomed to laugh at us, raise their eyebrows, and belch forth their knowledge of the Scriptures, if I may not say the disagreement of meanings (which, if it exists, is rightly condemned), if they can demonstrate any dissonance of words in our codices. Therefore, those who believe in the resurrection, which is believed by both Jews and Christians to be the word of God, often say the following: 'The hand of the Lord has come upon the prophet,' meaning the Lord, who is also the Savior, through whom the Father has done all things. For everything was made by him, and without him was made nothing that was made.' And he said, 'The spirit of the Lord took me, and the hand of the Lord was upon me.' And he was taken in the spirit, not in the body, but outside the body, and he was placed, or sent, in the midst of a field that was full of human bones. And he did not have rest there, but he caused all the bones, which were not covered by the earth but were lying on the field, to circle around. And there were not only many bones, but many bones excessively dry and parched due to the old age of time, and they did not have any moisture in them. And when the divine speaker asked him whether he thought these bones could live, he responded: Lord God, you know, who have full knowledge of the future. And the Lord said to him: Prophesy over the bones, whether over these bones, and you shall say to them: Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. It is remarkable how he spoke to dry bones, which before nerves, flesh, and skin, and the life-giving spirit of God, could hear his word. And first, the bones are bound together with the ligaments of the nerves, then they are filled with flesh, and the skin is stretched over them for beauty, which covers the ugliness of the exposed flesh; and then they receive breath, which makes them alive, and after they have lived, then they know that He is the Lord. So, as the prophet had commanded, there was immediately a commotion, and the bones were joined together in their proper framework, bound with nerves, filled with flesh, covered with skin: and there lay human bodies without breath. Therefore, the prophet prophesies to the spirit, and says: Thus says the Lord God: Come, O spirit, from the four winds; come, that is, from the four corners of the world, so that just as in the first creation of man God breathed into his face and he became a living soul (Genesis 2:7), so in the second creation, that is, the resurrection of the dead, being breathed upon by the spirit, they may be brought to life again; for when the spirit entered the human bodies, immediately they lived, and stood upon their feet. Therefore, the resurrection of the dead is also called a gathering, or the Church, many (Psalms CIII, 30), and as it is said in Hebrew, a great army; and it is fulfilled at a certain time: 'Send forth your spirit, and they shall be created, and you shall renew the face of the earth.' But when it is said: 'And he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel,' it seems to raise a question, because it is not speaking of the general resurrection, but specifically of the resurrection of the house of Israel, which says: 'Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off from our own land,' or we have completely despaired. In response to those saying these things, Ezekiel is compelled to prophesy for the third time, and he says to the dry bones: 'Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will open your graves.' In which it is asked: If he opens the tombs, how did he say above: There were indeed very many on the face of the plain, and very dry. And I will bring you up from your tombs, my people, according to that which is written in the Gospel: The hour is coming; when those who are in the tombs will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who have done good will come forth unto the resurrection of life (John 5:28-29). And again: Those who hear will live (ibid.). And if, as some think, the divine discourse speaks of the general resurrection, why was it necessary to say specifically: And I will bring you into the land of Israel, when the dead in every corner of the earth must rise from the places where they were buried? And when, he says, I shall bring you out of your graves and give you my spirit, and you shall live, then I will make you rest upon your own land, so that after you have rested in the land of Israel, then you may know that I am the Lord, who has fulfilled my promises with deeds. Therefore, when they understand these things about the general resurrection, that which seems to raise the question: 'These bones are the whole house of Israel,' they refer to the resurrection of the saints, about which the Apostle John also speaks in the Apocalypse: 'Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over such the second death has no power' (Rev. 20:6): that is to say, there is a different resurrection for the saints and for the sinners. And in the first Psalm it says: The wicked will not rise in judgment, nor sinners in the council of the righteous. But the land of Israel, which the Lord promises to those who rise, they confirm to be the same, as it is written: Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. (Matthew 5:4) And: I will please the Lord in the land of the living. (Psalm 116:9) These things are spoken by those who think that Ezekiel wrote about the general resurrection, as we have said. But those who interpret them in this way should not envy us, because by interpreting this passage differently, we seem to deny the resurrection. For we know that much stronger testimonies, in which there is no doubt, are found in the holy Scriptures, such as that of Job: 'You will raise up my flesh, which supports these things' (Job 19). And in Daniel: 'Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt' (Dan. 12:2). And in the Gospel: Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell (Matthew 10:28). And the Apostle Paul: But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you (Romans 8:11), and many others. From which it is clear that we do not deny the resurrection, but we do not contend for these unwritten things about the resurrection. And through the parable of the resurrection, it is prophesied about the restoration of Israel, which was captive in Babylon at that time. We will not immediately give occasion to the heretics if we deny that these things are understood about the common resurrection. For the likeness of the resurrection would never be set forth to signify the restoration of the Israelite people unless the resurrection itself stood, and the future was believed: because no one confirms uncertain things about things that do not exist. And our whole assertion tends toward that, which seems incredulous, that a future resurrection is promised to dry bones and those worn down by much antiquity; and yet what is promised will indeed happen; in the same way, the restoration of the Israelite people, who were led into captivity and dispersed throughout the whole world, seems indeed incredible to those who do not know the power of God, but it is, however, future: for I, says the Lord, have spoken, and I will do as I have promised. And in the previous prophecy, in which the ancient state of the mountains of Israel is promised, the Lord says to them: And I will turn to you, and you shall be plowed and sown, and you shall receive seed, and I will multiply men in you, and all the house of Israel (above verse 9, 10); and again, that the house of Israel will dwell in their own land, which was once uncultivated, and will become like a garden of delight, and the deserted and destitute cities will be fortified; and the house of Israel will multiply in them, like a flock of sheep, and the other things that follow pertain to the same meaning, which is now expressed figuratively and metaphorically as dry bones, having no moisture of life, with the fulfillment of what is written in the Gospel: The things that are impossible with men, are possible with God (Matthew 19:26). But all these things confirm the Jews, either under Zerubbabel, as I said before, when a great commotion took place; and the kingdom of the Chaldeans was translated into the Medes and the Persians: or at the coming of their Christ, whom they suppose is to come. But we spiritually commemorate the completion after the cross of the Lord and Savior; and this happens daily, especially to those who, like Lazarus, bound by the bands of their sins, are raised up at the voice of the Lord (John 11); and truly they are the house of Israel, once desolate and without hope of salvation: but as the spirit of grace enters into them and the Lord stretches out his hand, they are liberated from the depths of Hell: and those who previously said, 'Lord God, you know these things,' afterwards hear, being freed: 'O you of little faith, why did you doubt?' (Matthew 14:31).


<h2 id='tocuniq301'>(Vers. 15, seq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 and following) \"And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, take for yourself one piece of wood and write on it 'Judah' and the children of Israel, his companions, and take another piece of wood and write on it 'Joseph, the wood of Ephraim,' and all the house of Israel, his companions. And join them one to another for yourself into one piece of wood; and they will be in unity in your hand. But when the children of your people speak to you, saying: Will you not tell us what these things mean to you? You shall speak to them: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will take the wood of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his associates; and I will join them with the wood of Judah, and make them one wood, and they shall be one in my hand. And the wood on which you have written shall be visible to their eyes. And you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations to which they have gone, and I will gather them together from all sides, and bring them to their own land. And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king over them all, and they shall have no more princes; And there will no longer be two nations, nor will they be divided into two kingdoms anymore; nor will they defile themselves anymore with their idols, and with abominations, and with all their iniquities, and I will save them from all their dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them, and they will be my people, and I will be their God. And my servant David will be their king over them, and there will be one shepherd for all of them, they will walk in my judgments, and they will keep my commandments, and they will do them. And they shall dwell upon the land which I gave to my servant Jacob: wherein your fathers dwelt, and they shall dwell therein, they and their children, and their children's children, forever: and my servant David shall be their prince forever. And I will make a covenant of peace with them: it shall be an everlasting covenant with them, and I will establish them, and multiply them, and I will put my sanctuary in the midst of them forever. And my tabernacle will be among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people. And the nations shall know that I am the Lord, the sanctifier of Israel, when my sanctification is in their midst forever. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, take for yourself one staff, and write on it Judah, and the children of Israel who are associated with him, and take another staff for yourself, and write on it Joseph, the staff of Ephraim, and all the children of Israel who are associated with him, and join them together for yourself into one staff, that they may be joined together, and they will be in your hand. And it shall come to pass, when the children of Israel shall speak unto thee, saying, Shew us what thou meanest by these? That thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand. And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes. And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land: And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all. And they shall no longer be divided into two nations or two kingdoms, so that they will not defile themselves with their idols, their abominations, and all their transgressions. And I will deliver them from all their iniquities, in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them, and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. And my servant David shall be their prince in their midst, and there shall be one shepherd for all of them, because they shall walk in my commandments and keep my statutes and do them. And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to my servant Jacob, where their fathers dwelt. And they shall dwell in it, they and their children, and their children's children, forever. And my servant David shall be their prince forever. And I will make with them a covenant of peace, an everlasting covenant. And I will give them and multiply them, and I will set my sanctuary in their midst forever. And my tabernacle shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And the nations shall know that I am the Lord, who sanctify you, when my sanctuary is in their midst forever.\" The history of the Kings (3 Kings 12) tells that under Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, the twelve tribes were divided, and two, namely Judah and Benjamin, followed Rehoboam, who reigned in Jerusalem, and his kingdom was called Judah. But the other ten tribes, who said, \"We have no share in David, nor inheritance in the son of Jesse,\" submitted their necks and served Jeroboam, the son of Nebat from the tribe of Ephraim, who was the son of Joseph. They were mostly called by the ancient name Israel, and for a long time the kingdom of Judah and Israel had conflicts with each other, and obeyed their own kings (4 Kings 25). The first ten tribes were captured by the Assyrians, and after some time those called Judah were taken captive by the Chaldeans into Babylon, and the tribe of Judah was restored to the ancient land after seventy years. But the ten tribes called Israel still serve as captives in the mountains and cities of the Medes to this day (4 Kings 25). Therefore, the present prophecy from the mouth of the Lord promises that both kingdoms should be joined together, that is, the kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel, and the Ephraim branch, which is descended from the line of Joseph, with the remaining tribes that are associated with it, should be removed, and joined to the branch of Judah, so that they are not called Judah and Israel, but are called Judah by one name: and under the figure of the prophet who precedes in the type of the Lord and Savior, they should hold not with two hands, but with one hand of Christ. For he says that he will assume the children of Israel from among the nations to which they were taken captive, and he will bring them back to the land and mountains of Israel, of which we read above. And one nation will be called, and it will be ruled by the authority of one king, so that they will no longer be polluted by idols and their abominations. But when they are freed from the seats of captivity, in which they have sinned, they must be cleansed of all vices and they will become the people of God, so that the Lord will be their God. And my servant David shall reign over them, says the Lord (Luke 1). And the Angel speaks about him in the Gospel, that he will reign over the house of Jacob, and his kingdom shall have no end. And his mercy shall be so great that he shall be called not only king, but also shepherd, because he softens the proud name of ruler with the name of shepherd. And after they have become one nation and have dwelt in the land of Israel and the mountains, they shall walk in all the judgments of the Lord and keep His commandments. And they shall dwell not in any other land, but in the land that He gave to His servant Jacob, where their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the rest of the saints, dwell. And not only they themselves shall dwell, but also their sons and grandsons, according to that saying of Virgil (Aeneid, Book IV).

And those who are born of them, and those who will be born from them, may they dwell not for a short time, but forever. But you want to know, he says, who this king and shepherd is? He is the one of whom I have spoken before, my servant David. Though he was in the form of God, he did not consider it robbery to be equal with God; but he emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, and became obedient to the Father even unto death, death on a cross (Philippians 2:6 seq.). And when they are under such a king, I will establish a covenant of peace with them. Not like in the Old Testament of battles and wars, but a covenant of peace that surpasses all understanding, of which the Savior speaks to the Apostles: 'Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you' (John 14:27). And the prophet says: 'His dwelling place shall be in peace' (Psalm 76:2). When He establishes and strengthens them in the Church, so that they can say: 'He set my feet upon a rock' (Psalm 40:3), then they will multiply either in number of believers or in the increase of virtues. And I will give, he says, my sanctification, or sanctuary among them forever, which the Jews interpret as the temple, which was built under Zerubbabel. But how can this be fulfilled, which is said forever, when that temple which was built by Zerubbabel and later restored, was burned by Roman fire? All of these things are to be referred to the Church and to the times of the Savior, when his tabernacle was placed in the Church: where our God was made, and we became his people. And the progress of all is, that they may know that He Himself is the Lord, and He Himself sanctifies Israel, not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit: when His sanctification was made among the believers forever. And when the Lord rejected the tribe of Ephraim, and chose the tribe of Judah, and in the Psalms we read, in which it is written: And He rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and He did not choose the tribe of Ephraim; but He chose the tribe of Judah (Psalm 78:67, 68), of which it is written: The prince shall not fail from Judah, nor the leader from his thighs, until He comes to whom it is reserved: and He shall be the expectation of the nations (Genesis 49:10). Truly, in the coming of the Lord and Savior, the two rods, as it is written in Hebrew, the two pieces of wood are joined together as a scepter, and in the baptism of Christ, they are separated and united: so that they may become one new man and one nation, no longer polluted by idols and abominations; but through the cleansing of the world, they may be the people of God, and Christ may reign over them, and they may dwell upon the gentle earth, the land of the living, which He had given to His servant Jacob, who supplanted the people of Israel in the womb of his mother. But if we wish, according to the prophecy of Hosea, which is directed almost entirely to the ten tribes, that is, to Joseph and Ephraim, and Samaria, and Israel, to understand the false knowledge of the name, and the various crowds of heretics, we will say this, that at the end of time when the fullness of the Gentiles has entered, and all Israel has been saved (Rom. XI), then even the adversaries of the people, who fought against the house of Judah and the confession of the Church, will surrender to the faith of the Church, and leaving behind all errors and the princes of this world who are destroyed, and their patriarchs who led them into the abyss of blasphemy, they will rise and abandon their idols and their abominations, which they themselves fabricated in their hearts, and they will pass from all their seats, in which they sinned, to the faith of the Church, and they will be cleansed, and they will be the people of Christ, and He will be their God: all of which I know more fully were said by the prophet Hosea. But if Judaizing Jews and Christians want to refer these things to a thousand years in the future, they are compelled by necessity to undertake all the things that those who are saved must do when they dwell in the land of Israel: to build Jerusalem, to construct the temple, to perform all the ceremonies of the Law, to observe the Sabbath, to accept circumcision, to eat and drink, and to consider an abundance of wealth as the highest bliss and ultimate value, even though the Apostle says: Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will destroy both this and them (I Cor. VI, 13). However, just as in the type of the resurrection the higher prophetic discourse demonstrated the resurrection of the Jewish people, not carnal but spiritual, so this prophecy pertains not at all to the flesh but to the happiness of the soul, and to the faith of Christ, by which we are cleansed in baptism, whose kingdom is forever, so that we do not expect things to come which have already passed, and which we know to be happening every day.

<h2 id='tocuniq302'>(Chap. XXXVIII.)</h2>

(Chapter XXXVIII.) \"And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face against Gog, the land of Magog, the prince of the head (or head of) Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him. And you shall say to him: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, prince of the head (or head of) Meshech and Tubal. And I will turn you around, and put hooks into your jaws, and bring you out, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all clothed in armor, a great multitude, with bucklers and shields, wielding swords (or bucklers and helmets, and swords): Persians, Ethiopians, and Libyans, all with shields and helmets; Gomer and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah from the far north, and all his troops, and many peoples with you.\ Prepare and equip yourself, and your entire multitude which has gathered to you, and be a commandment to them (or you will be to me a custodian). After many days you will be visited: in the last years you will come to a land which has turned (or perverted) from the sword: and it has been gathered from many peoples to the mountain (or land) of Israel, who have been continuously deserted: this has been brought out from the peoples and they will confidently dwell (or have dwelt) in it. But when the storms come and the clouds cover the earth, you and all your armies, and many peoples (or nations) with you, will ascend. Thus says the Lord God: On that day, thoughts will arise in your heart, etc., and you will devise a wicked plan, and say: I will ascend to the land (or above the land) without a wall (or abject): I will go to those who dwell securely (or in peace): all ((Vulgate adds these)) dwell without a wall, bars and gates are not for them: to plunder spoils, and seize prey: to lay your hand upon those who were forsaken, and later restored, and upon the people who are gathered from the nations, who have begun to possess and inhabit the belly button of the earth. The people of Sheba and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish (or the Carthaginians and all the lion-like cities) will say to you: Have you come to gather spoils? Look, you have gathered your multitude to take silver and gold, and to take away possessions and spoil endless treasures. Therefore, prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog: Thus says the Lord God: Will you not know (or arise) on that day when my people Israel dwell confidently (or in peace)? And you will come from your place on the sides (or from the far north), you and many peoples with you, all mounted on horses, a great gathering and a mighty army. And you will come up over my people Israel like a cloud, to cover the land. In the latter days you will come (or he will come) and I will bring you against my land, so that all the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you in their sight, O Gog. Thus says the Lord God: So you are the one of whom I spoke in the days of old by the hand of my servants, the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days and years (or times), that I would bring you against them? And it shall come to pass in that day, in the day of the coming of Gog against the land of Israel, says the Lord God, that my fury will arise in my anger. And in my zeal, in the fire of my wrath, I have spoken, because on that day there will be a great commotion over the land of Israel, and the fish of the sea, and the birds of the sky, and the beasts of the field (or the countryside), and every creeping creature that moves on the earth will be shaken. And all the men who are on the face of the earth will be overturned (or split) and the mountains will be overturned (or torn down), and the hedges (or valleys) will fall, and every wall on the land will collapse. And I will summon against him on all my mountains a sword (or every terror of the sword), says the Lord God. The sword of each (or every) man will be directed against his brother. And I will judge him with pestilence (or death), and blood, and severe rain and immense stones (or hailstones). I will rain fire and sulfur on him, and on his army (or on all those who are with him), and on many peoples who are with him. And I will be magnified, and sanctified, and I will be known in the sight (or eyes) of many nations, and they will know that I am the Lord.\" The foundations of the first history must be laid, and it must be known that this final discourse of the Lord is to the prophet Ezekiel. For after this we can find nothing similar, except that which is written in the twenty-fifth year of the transmigration of Jehoiachin: The hand of the Lord was upon me, and he brought me there, that is, to the land of Israel, when the building of the temple is described, and the order of its ceremonies is narrated. Then it is to be noted that the face of the prophet is set or hardened against the land of Gog, or the land of Magog. For it requires firmness and much consideration of countenance, so that we may understand the things that are spoken, according to the saying of the Apostle: But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord (1 Corinthians 3:18). Therefore, the Jews and those of us who follow Jewish customs believe that the Gentiles mentioned as Gog are the Scythians, who are savage and countless in number, stretching from beyond the Caucasus mountains and the Maeotis swamp to near the Caspian Sea and as far as India. And they believe that after a thousand years, these nations stirred up by the devil will come to the land of Israel to fight against the saints, gathering many other peoples with them. First, Mosoch, whom Josephus interprets as Cappadocians, then Tubal, whom the same interprets as Iberians, or Spaniards, Hebrews suspect to be Italians, having with them in their army Persians, Ethiopians, and Libyans: also Gomer and Thogorma, whom they interpret as Gauls and Phrygians: also the Sabaeans and Dedan, and the Carthaginians, or Tharsis, and this is what John also puts in his Apocalypse: 'And when the thousand years are finished, Satan will be released from his prison, and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city.' And fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them: and the devil, that seduced them, was cast into the pool of fire and brimstone, where both the beast and the false prophet shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever (Rev. 20:9-10). They do not understand that the entire volume of John, which is titled Revelation, is mystical, and that we need revelation in order to be able to say with the prophet: Open my eyes, and I will behold wondrous things out of thy law (Ps. 119:18). But others, forsaking earthly sensibilities and harmful Judaic and elderly fables (I Tim. IV), and content with themselves, delve into the depths, ascend too high, and invent much worse things, in order to describe wars of the devil and all his host in the heavenly Jerusalem, and they interpret spiritual wickedness in celestial matters under the guise of the topologies of individual nations. We, conceding all these things to the judgment of the reader, will strive not so much to condemn foreign ideas as to affirm the ecclesiastical explanation. In the Greek language, a gift is called δόμα, and in Latin it is called tectum. Furthermore, Magog is interpreted as being uncovered. Therefore, all pride and false knowledge of name, which raises itself against the knowledge of truth, is demonstrated by these names. These are the roofs, about which Isaiah speaks in a vision against the Valley of Zion: What has happened to you now, since you have all gone up to empty roofs? (Isa. XXII, 1) And we will interpret the roofs as the leaders of heretics: and we will call those who have received their teachings from the roofs. And beautifully after many mystical prophecies in this volume, the final prophecy is against Gog and Magog. For if it is the time of judgment, according to Peter, that it begins with the house of God, and according to this same Ezekiel, who says: 'And begin with My holy ones' (above IX, 6), and the last enemy will be destroyed, death (1 Peter IV): in Isaiah also the first discourse is against Judah, in which the confession of the Lord is, and the last against the quadrupeds that are in the desert (Isaiah II): rightly here too the final discourse is against Gog and Magog, who attack the city of God, which the flow of the river delights (Psalm XLV). And what Isaiah says: 'I am the first city which is attacked' (Isaiah XXVII, 10). And concerning which it is written in the Gospel: A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid (Matthew 5:14). And more fully in the Psalm: Jerusalem is built as a city that is at unity in itself (Psalm 122:3). The mountains are round about it; and the LORD is round about his people (Psalm 125:2). Furthermore, in the army of Gog, or Magog, who according to the Septuagint, Symmachus, and Theodotion, is chief of Ros, Mosoch, and Thubal: the first nation is interpreted by Aquila as the head, which we also follow, so that the sense is: The prince of the head of Mosoch and Thubal. And indeed, neither in Genesis, nor in any other place in Scripture, nor even in Josephus, who in his first book of Antiquities explains the names of all the Hebrew nations, could we find this nation. From this it is clear that 'ros' does not mean nation, but head. It should also be briefly noted that in Ezekiel, Gog is said to be the prince of the land of Magog. And in the Apocalypse, it is mentioned that Gog and Magog are nations that come forth from the four corners of the earth. And just as Jacob, who was later called Israel, received the name of all the Hebrew people, and Aram received the name of Syria, and Mesraim received the name of Egypt, whose names are written in Genesis: so too, all those who are subject to the prince Gog are called Magog. However, Mosoch is interpreted as madness, and Thubal as everything or all. Therefore, the prince and the head of arrogant madness and of all evils are called Gog and Magog, according to what is written: The world is set in the evil one (1 John 5:19). These hostile and opposing nations of the saints come forth from the corners of the earth, deviating from the straight line and the arrangement of God's camp, as is recounted in Numbers, and not realizing this testimony: Many will come from the east and the west, from the north and the south, and will recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of God (Matthew 8:11). And in another place: I will say to the North, give up; and to the South, do not withhold. Bring my sons from far away, and my daughters from the end of the earth, everyone who is called by my name (Isa. XLIII, 6). But not such the corners of the earth from which Gog and Magog come forth: next to these corners stands the harlot in Proverbs (Prov. XXIII), who, passing by, hastens to deceive foolish young men through the streets, that is, through the broad and spacious road that leads to death. The scribes and Pharisees also pray in the corners of the streets, so that they may be seen by men, who have received their reward (Matthew 6). So what is the curse against Gog? I will turn you around and put a bit in your jaws. First, I will make you waver from your opinion and be converted. And I will put a bit in your jaws, as it is written: 'With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws, who come not near Thee' (Psalm 32:9); so that the untamed and unruly horse, who falls down precipices, may be subject to the bridle of the Lord: to whom the prophet says: 'Ride upon thy horses, and thy riding shall be salvation' (Habakkuk 3:8). And it is said of Job, through a cloud and whirlwind: You have surrounded the horse with strength (Job. XXXIX, 19). Such were the horses and horsemen; whose multitude John saw in heaven (Apoc. VI). Therefore, he says to Gog: I will lead out, or gather you, and all the army, or your strength. He who is led out and gathered from dispersion is brought back to salvation, according to what is promised in the law: If your dispersion shall be from the top of the sky to its summit, from there I will gather you (Deut. XXX, 3). They also have horses and cavalry clad in armor, who imitate the apostle's equipment and boast of having the breastplate of righteousness (Ephesians 6): the multitude is excessive, and all seize the shield and sword against the Church, and they are the most savage and hostile nations, including the Persians, Ethiopians, and Libyans: their wars against the people of God are recounted in the Holy Scriptures. Also Gomer and the house of Thogorma, who come from the sides of the North, which is a very cold wind and is called the East wind, and the whole strength of Magog, and all the peoples who are subject to him, will come with him to battle. To whom it is said ironically: prepare yourself, make ready, and gather to yourself all your multitude that obeys your commands; and know that after many days you shall be visited, according to what is written: I will visit their iniquities with a rod and their sins with stripes (Psalm 88:33). In the last days, he says, you will come. Hence John also says: My little children, it is the last hour (1 John 2:18). And the people of the nations are hired at the eleventh hour to work in the vineyard (Matthew 20), to whose land, that is, the land of mildness, and the land of the saints, which brings forth one hundred, and sixty, and thirty fruits, Gog has come to conquer, which has turned away, or turned its back, from the sword. For it is written: Scatter, O Lord, the nations that desire war (Psalm 68:32). And it shall come to pass that, when the people and nations have been gathered together, and the error of the nations has been despised, it shall come to the mountains of Israel, namely the patriarchs and prophets, who once wandered in the desert without the law and commandments of God. To whom it is afterwards said: 'More are the children of the desolate, than of her that hath a husband.' (Isa. LIV, 1) These are the deserted and waterless places, in which the devil could not find a place, because they were called to salvation, and afterwards he, having taken seven other, more wicked spirits, returned to his house, namely to the people of Israel. (Matth. XI) These things, he says, are spoken of the people, understood as the earth; or, it is spoken of the nations, so that it may be understood as the people of believers who dwelt in peace and trusted in the Lord. But Gog, together with all his army, will come up like a storm and like a cloud, to cover the land of the believers. For what heretics, whose leader is the devil, do not come against the Church like a storm, and in a cloud of their words, they hasten to oppress and cover the simple believers? Therefore it is said to him: As much as it is within you, you will cover all things and all your armies, and many peoples with you. Gog, ascending proudly, does not have voluntary rain, nor temporary and late rain, which would rejoice the dry fields, but rather storm and darkness, so that it may confuse everything with darkness and error. Therefore, the Lord God speaks these words to him: At that time, that is, in the last days, evil thoughts will arise in your heart, and you will ponder a wicked plan, as the Scripture says: If the spirit of the one having power desires to rise against you, do not leave your place (Ecclesiastes 10:4). On the other hand, God ascends into the holy heart, about which it is written: He established his ascents in his heart (Ps. 83:6). And Gog says: I will ascend to the land without a wall, or a projecting one, that is, which is deprived of God's help, and not fortified by dialectical argumentation; I will come to those who are at rest and dwell securely, that is, in peace. For our King is peaceful, and his place is in peace (Psalm 75). All, he says, dwell without a wall, and there are no bars or gates for them. This prince of heretics speaks, having no defenses of the Church; nor secular wisdom, which is foolishness before God, in order to plunder the spoils and invade the prey of the Church, and lay his hand upon those who were deserted when they did not have knowledge of God; and then, restored through Christ, come to the Father, to whom he speaks in the Gospel: Father, I have revealed your name to men (John 17:6). And so that we may know that the people who were deserted and then restored signify the Christian people, it follows: And over the people who are gathered from the nations (Psalm 74:12). The people who began to possess the inheritance of Christ and to be inhabitants of the navel of the earth, of which it is written: He has worked salvation in the midst of the earth. For truth has risen from the earth (Ibid. LXXXIV, 1); who says in the Gospel: I am the way and the life, and the truth (John XIV, 6). While he was thinking and saying this, and eagerly trying to snatch the possession of the Church, the nations that had been converted from their ancient error to salvation, Sabah and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, Carthage, or the sea, who seek merchandise in the waves of this world through good works, and all their cities, whether lions or lion cubs as it is contained in Hebrew, will speak to him what follows. But as for the cubs of lions, which are called Caphir in Hebrew (), both the Seventy and Theodotio translate as 'villas', it is a clear mistake. For if you write it with the letter chi, it is called a lion cub; but if you write it with ce, which is called Coph in Hebrew, it is called a field and a village. Hence, Capharnaum is said to be a beautiful field. Therefore, Saba and Dedan will say, and the merchants of Tharsis, and all the holy ones who are called lion cubs, or certainly the villages and dwellings of the believers: O Gog, do you come for this reason, to seize the spoils of the Church, and therefore have you gathered a multitude, so that the possession of Christ may become your inheritance? Or do you think that the silver and gold, which is understood in speech and meaning, will be possessed by the Church, so that you may take away all the furnishings and all the wealth, and plunder the countless spoils gathered by the victories of Christ? Therefore, O Prophet Ezekiel, who is called the son of man in the type of Christ, speak to Gog and say to him: Thus says the Lord God, when the error of the whole world is removed, my people Israel, who discern God with their minds, will dwell confidently in the Church, either in peace. Then you will know, whether you rise up or come from your place. However, the following discourse shows the place of heretical wickedness: From the sides of the North, which endeavors to cool down all the heat of believers. And many people will come with him, all riders on horses, of whom it is written: He threw horse and rider into the sea (Exodus 15:1): a great multitude and a powerful army, with whom he ascends, saying, 'Upon my people Israel, you shall come like a cloud and cover my land, as it is written: In the last days, you shall be, when the Gospel preaching: and I will bring you upon my land. For heresies must exist, so that those who are approved may be made manifest (1 Corinthians 11:19), and by God's will the devil, the fighter, and all perversions of doctrine have been abandoned: so that all nations may know and understand me, when I am sanctified in you in their eyes, o Gog, that is, when they understand me as their judge through your punishments. And he addresses Gog himself; Are you not the one of whom I spoke in ancient times, through the hands of my servants the prophets of Israel? Namely, Moses, who said in the book of Numbers, specifically in the Septuagint: A man will come forth from his seed, and he will rule over many nations, and his kingdom will be exalted, and his kingdom will grow (Num. 24:7). Moreover, according to the Hebrew text, I found it written as follows: Therefore, his king Agag (translated as Gog in the Latin Vulgate) will be removed, and his kingdom will be taken away, because the kingdom of Israel was destroyed by Agag, the king of Amalek, during the time of Saul. And in another place: He will cleanse the land of his people (Joel 3). Joel also describes the gathering of people in the valley of Josaphat, which is the judgement of God. And Isaiah and all the prophets, in whose hands the word of the Lord is made manifest through good works. So when my wrath and fury come upon the land of Israel, my indignation will rise against you, and my zeal for my people. In the fire of my anger, I have spoken, to consume all the wickedness of your actions. At that time, he says, there will be a great upheaval upon the land of Israel. For with the Devil unleashed, frequent persecution against the Church will occur: and when it has been suppressed and overcome by God's help, then the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the animals of the field, and all reptiles that move upon the land, and all the men who are upon the face of the earth will be shaken. This is clearly demonstrated concerning the inhabitants of the Church: some are like fish of the sea, others like birds of the sky, others like animals of the field and all creeping things that move on the earth, others like those who retain human dignity and dwell upon the face of the earth. And as for the diversity of character, which is designated by various names, the Apostle writes to the Corinthians that there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies after the resurrection, and that one body is of a fish, another of a bird, another of animals, another of creeping things, and another of humans who have retained their original name. In the actions of the apostles, that linen cloth, which is shown to the third Apostle Peter with four principles (Acts X), also signifies the diversity of believers, which is also contained in the Ark of the flood. Then, indeed, the mountains will be overturned by the face of the Lord, and by the sight of His majesty, which were rising up against the knowledge of God; and the hedges or valleys, which were sunk to the lowest depths by the lowliness of their understanding, or certainly the fortifications, which promise something, in order to imitate the Church of God, of whose hedges it is said: 'He who breaks a hedge, a snake will bite him' (Sirach X, 8). And all the walls will fall to the ground. For when the strength of Ecclesiastical discourse appears, all the fortifications of the heretics will fall. And I will call, he says, him against them, that is, the leader of the heretics Gog, a sword in all his mountains, so that the leaders of his army may be defeated by the sword of the Lord. Then heresy will fight against heresy, their struggle is our victory. And I will judge him, saith the Lord, with death, or with plague, and blood, and severe rain, and immense stones, or hailstones. But Gog is judged with his own death, and with the blood which he shed, and with the severe rain, by the words of learned and perfect men, and with immense stones, which bury him with testimonies of the Scriptures, or with hailstones, which make his heat grow cold: For all who commit adultery, their hearts are like an oven. (Hosea 7:4). I will rain fire and sulfur upon him, whereby the punishment of eternal judgment is shown. And not only above him who was the author of wickedness, but even above his entire army and multitude, and above many nations who are with him. For heretics have many accomplices, indeed the devil himself, their prince, is surrounded by an infinite number. With every error removed, and with the leaders of the heretics punished and destroyed, the Lord is magnified and sanctified among the believers, and is known in the eyes of many nations who have believed in his faith; and both from the blessedness of his followers and from the punishment of his adversaries, it is understood and known that he is the Lord. We have interpreted these things as best as we could, obeying that precept: Neither shall you turn aside to the right hand, nor to the left, but shall walk in the royal way (Deut. XXVIII, 14). But if someone criticizes our work, let them either propose better things for us to follow, or if they have nothing to say, let them leave perfect knowledge of God behind; as long as they understand that we have no power, but the judgment of our mind.

<h2 id='tocuniq303'>(Chap. XXXIX.—Vers. 1 seq.)</h2>

(Chapter 39, Verse 1 onwards) \"But you, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say: 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshek and Tubal. I will turn you around and drag you along. I will bring you from the far north and send you against the mountains of Israel. Then I will strike your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand. On the mountains of Israel you will fall, you and all your troops and the nations with you.' I have given you as food to the wild animals, birds, and all flying creatures, and to the animals of the earth. You will fall on the face of the field (or the plain): for I have spoken, says the Lord God. And I will send fire on Magog, and on those who dwell securely on the islands (or the coastlands): and they will know that I am the Lord. And I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel, and I will not allow my holy name to be profaned (or polluted) anymore; and the nations will know that I am the holy Lord of Israel. Behold, it comes, and it will happen (or you will know that it will be), says the Lord (Vulgate adds God): this is the day of which I spoke. And the inhabitants of the cities (Vulgate: of the cities) of Israel will go out and burn weapons, shields, spears (or bucklers and thrusting spears), bows and arrows, staffs of the hands (Vulgate: of the hands), and spears (or lances): and they will set them on fire for seven years. And they will not gather (or take) wood from the fields (or the plains), nor cut down from the forests: for they will burn the weapons with fire, and those who had been their plunder will plunder them; and they will loot their looters, says the Lord God. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of the travelers east of the sea, which will cause those passing by to marvel. (Or the πολυάνδριον of those who come to the sea, and they will build around the mouth of the valley; and there Gog and all his multitude will be buried; and the valley (or Ge ) will be called the multitude of Gog. And the house of Israel will bury them there, to cleanse the land (or so that the land will be cleansed) for seven months. But the whole population of the earth will bury them (Vulg. they are silent) and there will be a day named for them, in which I have been glorified, says the Lord God. And they will continuously appoint men, traversing (or encircling) the earth, who will bury and seek out those who remain (Vulg. remained) upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it. But after seven months they will begin to search. And they will go around exploring the earth: and when they see the bone of a man, they will set up a marker next to it, until the embalmers in the Valley (or Ge ) of the multitude of Gog bury it. The name of the city is Amona (or Polyandrion): and the earth will be cleansed (or will be cleansed). And these are the heirs of the Jewish tradition and the disciples of endless fables, who contend that after a thousand years of reign, Gog, the prince of Ros, Mosoch, and Thubal will be killed in the borders of Israel; and they will be devoured by all the birds and beasts: and the inhabitants of the cities of Israel will not use wood for seven years, but instead will use the weapons of Gog, namely shields and spears, arrows and clubs or poles: but Gog himself will be buried in a valley called Ge in Hebrew, and his tomb will be called polyandrion; where, indeed, a multitude of men will be buried. But he must be buried for seven months from the house of Israel, so that the land may be cleansed. And a glorious day will come when Gog is killed, and those who diligently search for and bury the bones must be appointed, so that nothing remains unburied on the land. After the months have passed, or rather after seven months have passed, a great expanse of land must be traversed; and wherever they see a human bone, they must mark it with a nearby sign, so that it can be buried later by those in charge of this task. And the city must be named Amona, which is called πολυάνδριον in Greek, meaning a multitude of buried men; and thus the land will be cleansed. They said this to him. But we, starting the explanation, will discuss each thing that we proposed, keeping the meaning. Gog himself has his own Trinity: Ros, Mosoch, and Thubal; head, namely, and insanity, and everything; so that there is no vice that does not consist in the possession of Gog. This [person] will be educated, whether revolving or being touched, and whether suckled or caressed: so that, hoping for victory, he may be led to battle to be killed. And he will ascend from the sides, or from the farthest parts of the North, from where evil is ignited upon all the earth (Jeremiah 1). And he shall be led by the same over the mountains of Israel, whom we must understand to be the apostles and apostolic men and ecclesiastics, so that after he has been led to the mountains of Israel, the bow in his left hand and the arrows held in his right hand may be struck. And he himself, in order to kill those whom he has deceived, imitates having weapons in both his left and right hands, through good and bad reputation. These are the arrows and javelins of which the Psalmist speaks: For behold sinners have bent the bow, they have prepared their arrows in a quiver, to shoot in the dark at the upright of heart (Psalm 10:2). The fiery darts of the devil must be extinguished by the shield of faith (Ephesians 6). Moreover, Gog, who had ascended over the mountains of Israel, will fall and be cast down on those same mountains with all his army and all his troops. And he will be food for the wild beasts, birds, and all the flying creatures and beasts of the earth, namely the adversarial powers that devour the seed along the way and the bloodthirsty beasts. For just as it is written about the dragon, 'You have given him as food to the peoples of Ethiopia' (Psalm 73:14), so those deceived by heretics are food for demons. But Gog, whether in the breadth of the field or in the cultivated land, which is cared for by the farmers of God. For it cannot be that the words of the Lord are in vain. Then fire will be sent upon Magog, that is, upon those who have accepted the teachings of Gog, and upon those who are beaten by the waves of the world like the likeness of islands, and think that they should be secure. That fire of which the Lord speaks: I came to send fire upon the earth; and how I wish that it should burn! (Luke XII, 49); that all may know and understand that I am the Lord, and that the name of my holiness may be made known among my people, who are in no way deceived by the authority of Gog: nor is my name defiled in heretics by the occasion of false knowledge; and that the nations, which are around, may know that I am the Lord. But what follows is said about the judgment of Christ: Behold, he is coming, and it shall be done, the Lord says: He who is coming will come, and he will not delay (Hab. 2:3). And this is the day of punishment and vengeance, of which the Lord spoke through all the prophets. And the inhabitants of the cities of Israel will go out, the people who believe: but by the cities of Israel we understand the Churches of the right faith. And they will set on fire and burn the weapons, of which it is also written in another place: He will break the bow, and shatter the weapons, and burn the shields and spears with fire (Ps. 43:10), shields and spears, bows and arrows, staves of their hands, with which they celebrated the perverted Passover: lances or poles, with which they inflicted wide and incurable wounds of false doctrines: shields, bows and arrows, of which it has been said above. And what follows: And seven years later they will perish by fire, as is explained in Exodus and Leviticus (Exod. XXI; Levit. XXV), in which the Law prescribes that in the seventh year of release, when freedom is restored to the Hebrew slaves and all debts are paid, and the ancient possession is returned to the masters, and rest is given to the land, and all produce is forgiven to the poor, so that in the sacred and perfect number of seven years the armor of the heretics may disappear, and the men of the Church may not cut wood from the fields and regions, and the forests and woods of the nations, which they most desire to save rather than to destroy; but from the heretics whom they have conquered, with shields, spears, arrows, staves, and lances. For they also have various weapons to attack the Church of Christ, which must be ignited by learned men with the fire of the Holy Spirit; namely, the ecclesiastical word, which whoever possesses can say: Was not our heart burning within us while He was opening the Scriptures to us? (Luke 24:32) We cannot have full peace and confidence of habitation unless we plunder all the belongings of our adversaries, so that all may perish and be turned to ashes; and let us plunder those who had previously plundered us, and let us devastate those who had previously devastated the Church. In Hebrw, in the clear light of preaching, he says, 'I will give Gog a named place, a tomb in Israel; according to the Hebrew, a valley of travelers to the east of the sea, which astonishes passers-by. The meaning of this statement is that the tomb of Gog will not be in the mountains, but in the low valleys and in rugged places, which are called Ge in Hebrew. The heretics, although they are in the West, claim that these places are in the East, in order to deceive travelers, namely those who pass through this world and are not residents but strangers, saying that prophetic verse: I am a stranger and a sojourner, like all my fathers (Ps. 38:12).' For who among those passing by, of whom it is written: 'And those who pass by did not say, the blessing of the Lord be upon you' (Ps. 128:8), does not marvel and stand amazed when he sees the valley of travelers, which appears as a valley to travelers but as a mountain to its inhabitants? This is according to the Hebrew. However, the Septuagint translated it as the polyandrion of those who come to the sea; and they shall build around the entrance of the valley. For it is the labor of those who go out from the cities of Israel to close and enclose every entrance and exit of heretical corruption from those who come to the sea, and they delighted in its bitterness, and with the crashing waves and the cruelty of shipwreck, they shall close and enclose, and bury in the depths of the earth, so that they may no longer go out and deceive others with their deceit. Therefore, there they will bury Gog and his entire multitude, which always delights the heretics. And the name of that valley where Gog is buried will be called the Valley of the Multitude, or πολυάνδριον, that is, the tomb of a very large multitude. And as we said above, the weapons of the adversaries will be burned for seven years: thus, for seven months, the land will be cleansed of the filth of the heretics. For from the first month, when we celebrate the Passover of the Lord and avoid the destroyer of Egypt, the lamb with the blood on our doorposts, until the end of the year, that is, until the seventh month when we pitch our tents and are protected among the other branches of palm trees, in order to demonstrate a complete victory against the enemies. We fulfill all the festivals among the people: not only the teachers, but also the entire population will do this eagerly, to bury Gog and cover the land, and by no means allow the free air to be shared. But after the killing and destruction, or the burial of Gog, Ecclesiastical men shall be chosen, who have this study, so that nothing of the former impurities remains in the land of Israel, nor anything of death. They shall search the land, and seek the dead, and bury them, so that the land of the Church may be cleansed. But if, after seven months, when everything should be cleansed, those who go through and surround the land find in any place the bone of a man, that is, the hardness of heretical corruption, or anything of the previous doctrine of death, they shall place it beside that, or they shall build a monument: so that once those who are of this kind have been marked, then they shall either be cleansed or buried with Gog, and cast into the tomb ((or crowd)) of his burial. The name of the city, where the victory of the Lord's servants is, and the adversaries lie down, and the whole multitude of its enemies is prostrated, will be called Amona, or Polyandrion, so that it may be the end of all things, the restoration of purity. Finally, it follows: And they shall cleanse the earth; no doubt those of whom it is written above will begin to seek, and will go around the earth.

<h2 id='tocuniq304'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 17 and following) 'Therefore, son of man, thus says the Lord God: Speak to every winged creature, to all the birds, and to all the beasts of the field or the countryside: Come together and hasten, gather from all around to my sacrifice that I have offered to you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, so that you may eat flesh and drink blood. You shall eat the meat of the mighty or giants, and you shall drink the blood of the rulers of the land: of rams, lambs, goats, and of bulls, as well as of all the fatted ones.' And you shall eat the fat in abundance, and drink the blood to the full, of the offering that I have sacrificed for you. And you shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men and all kinds of warriors, says the Lord God. And I will display my glory among the nations, and all the nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them. And the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God from that day forward. And all the nations shall know that the house of Israel were taken captive because of their iniquities, because they had forsaken me and I had hidden my face from them and given them into the hand of their enemies, and they all fell by the sword. According to their uncleanness and their transgressions, I dealt with them and hid my face from them. Therefore thus says the Lord God: Now I will bring back the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel: and I will be zealous for my holy name. And they shall bear their confusion (or disgrace), and all their transgressions, whereby they have transgressed against me, when they dwelt confidently (or securely) in their own land, fearing no one. And I will bring them back from the peoples (or nations), and gather them out of the countries of their enemies (or from the regions of the nations), and I will be sanctified in them in the sight (or presence) of many nations. And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, when I have caused them to be carried away among the nations (or when I have appeared to them in the Gentiles), and have gathered them together upon their own land, and have not left any one of them there. Neither will I hide my face any more from them, for I have poured out my spirit (or fury) upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord God.' This which we have translated according to the Hebrew, and I will gather them together upon their own land, and will not leave any one of them there, is not found in the LXX. And again, what is placed at the end according to the Hebrews for a blessing, because I have poured out my spirit, the Septuagint translated as fury, which pertains to anger, especially since in Hebrew it is written as Ruhi, which properly means my spirit, and by no means my fury. However, everything up to that point, where the construction of the temple follows, those whom we have mentioned above, the Jews, and our Judaizing brethren, refer to the ultimate time: that Gog and all his army may be fattened like the choicest sacrifices of birds and beasts, and that Israel may be restored to its former state, and no longer be conquered by the nations, but that God may pour out his spirit upon them, so that they may dwell in their land: not all nations, but specifically the house of Israel. But following the initiated tropology, we will say this, that the Lord summons all birds and all beasts to devour the leaders of heretics as the fattest victims. Birds and beasts, however, are called so either because of their swiftness in running everywhere or because of their fierceness and cruelty, to which adversaries are handed over to be destroyed in the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved and they may learn not to blaspheme (I Tim. I). However, they will eat a large and fattest victim; not elsewhere, but on the mountains of Israel, which we ought to understand as the prophets and apostles, and holy men. For in them the teachers of contrary doctrines fall, and they perish wounded by themselves, upon whom the Church is built: and to speak more truly, upon the mountain of mountains, about which Isaiah and Micah speak: Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will show us his ways (Isa. II, 3; Mic. IV, 2). But those birds and those animals, swift and cruel, will eat flesh and drink blood, which cannot possess the kingdom of God: the flesh of the mighty, or giants, who rebelled against the knowledge of God, and the blood of princes, not of heaven, but of the earth, they will drink, who have savored all earthly things: the blood of rams, and lambs, and goats, or according to the Septuagint, the blood of rams, calves, and goats, to signify the three animals that are sacrificed in the offerings to God. For heretics imitate the gentleness of the Church, but their offering does not profit for the worship of God, but for the food of demons, which is their fattest host, and they are satisfied with fatness and drink the blood of deceivers to the point of drunkenness. But God sacrifices this victim through ecclesiastical men, so that the guests of the worst kind may be satisfied with the multitude of deceivers, and they may drink to the point of vomiting and drunkenness. When you see holy men, instructed in divine Scriptures, cut down the horses of heretics and charioteers, of whom it is written: He threw the horse and its rider into the sea (Exodus XV, 1), and cut down all rebels and giants with his sword, and shed the blood of all warriors of false-named knowledge, then know that the table of the Lord has been prepared, that he may put his glory in all nations that believe in his name, and that they may understand the judgment of the Church of his holy ones, which they have performed against their adversaries, and the strong hand with which they have struck them; and let the house of Israel know and understand that he is their Lord God, who spoke: I am your Lord God, from the day of the Lord's victory until eternity; and let them recall that the house of Israel was once captured by heretics and scattered throughout the entire world of perverse doctrines, because they had abandoned him who had hidden momentarily or turned his face away from them, and delivered them into the hands of heretics, and they fell, pierced by their swords, because of their impurities and iniquities; and this was the reason why he hid and turned his face away from them. But after presenting the arguments, according to what is written: There must be heresies so that those who are approved may become manifest (I Cor. XI, 19), the captivity of Israel, namely the Church, in which those who see God dwell: now it promises that it will restore the captivity of Jacob to the Church, who had supplanted the Jewish people, and was later supplanted by the tricks of the heretics: and it will have mercy on the whole house of Israel, not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. And I will take up my zeal for my holy name, which was blasphemed among the nations because of heretics: so that once I have delivered them, they may be ashamed and confounded, for why have they forsaken the faith of the Church, and transgressed against me. But let them be confounded and ashamed very quickly, when they have dwelt in their land, the land of the meek, and the land of the saints, and have dwelt confidently, whether in peace, not fearing the snares of heretics. Then they will be brought back from the peoples, and will be gathered from the lands of their enemies into their own land. And the Lord will be sanctified in them in the sight of many nations, who themselves will also believe in the Lord. And the end of blessedness will be to know and recognize that he is their Lord God, because he has appeared to them among the nations, or has brought them over from the nations, and has gathered them onto his own land, the land of Judah, the land of confession, the land of gentleness, and the land of the living, and he will not even leave a trace of heretical wickedness. And he will no longer hide his face from them, nor turn away from them, because he has poured out the spirit of his grace, of which the prophet Joel also speaks: 'In the last days, I will pour out from my spirit upon all flesh' (Joel 2:28), and he will pour it out upon all the house of Israel. But if we read 'fury' according to the Septuagint, which is not found in the Hebrew, it should be understood that he will no longer hide his face from those on whom he had previously poured out his fury. Up to this point in the prophet Ezekiel, with God aiding and opening our mouth, we have spoken: not destroying the opinion of others, if anyone has written, or in the future, if they are to write, but asserting whatever is ours. But in the construction of the temple, and the order of the priests, and the division of the holy land, and the river flowing out of the temple, and the trees on both banks always green, and the fruit brought forth every month, and all the rest that is contained in the prophetic volume until the end, we frankly confess our ignorance, deeming it better to say nothing than to say too little.

<h2 id='tocuniq305'>Book Twelve</h2>

Book Twelve

Your prayers, daughter Eustochium, and the Lord's promises have overcome my fear of explaining the temple of Ezekiel, or rather my determination to remain silent, as it says: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. And as we made excuses in the conclusion of the previous volume, it is better to say nothing than to say little; you have turned it around so that you consider it better to say little than to say nothing: because in the former, the will is eager, in the latter, there is despair of the entire work. And you recall that it is the nature of such people that they do not have as much gratitude for what you have given them as they have sorrow over what you have denied them. For we praise virtues with less zeal than we criticize vices: and even though bodies may be beautiful, they become more conspicuous due to the wickedness and deformity of one part. Therefore, I will comply with your will, and with the Holy Spirit blowing, I will hoist the sails, ignorant of the shores I will reach, and along with this same prophet I exclaim, 'Come, spirits, from the four winds'; and to the fastidious reader, or rather to the mind about to be engaged with our reading, I declare with complete freedom in the explanation of the temple that if he desires the truth, let him seek it from others. However, we simply confess and declare those things that we can suspect in the most difficult task, giving thanks to the Lord, if He will not have opened to us the doors of knowledge in all things, which is impossible, but in many things. For it is honorable, as that sublime orator says, to continue even in second or third place to the one who pursues.

<h2 id='tocuniq306'>(Chap. XL.—Vers. 1 seq.)</h2>

(Chapter XL - Verses 1 onwards) 'In the twenty-fifth year of our exile (or captivity), at the beginning of the year (or in the first month), on the tenth day of the month, fourteen years after the city was struck down (or captured): on that very day, the hand of the Lord was upon me, and He brought me there. In visions (or in a vision) of God, He brought me to the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was like a city-building, facing southward (or from the south).' And he brought me there: and behold a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass (or shining brass); and a line of flax (or masons' line) was in his hand, and a measuring reed in his hand. And he stood in the gate: and he said to me, Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I shall show you (or set in your heart all that I shall show you): for you have been brought (or entered) here for this purpose, and declare (or show) to the house of Israel all that you see. If, in the fifth year of captivity or exile of King Joachin, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, the heavens were opened to the prophet Ezekiel by the river Chebar, and he saw visions of God; and now it is said that in the twenty-fifth year of the same captivity or exile of Jehoiachin, at the beginning of the year, in the tenth month, the hand of the Lord came upon him, and he was brought to the land of Israel and placed on a very high mountain, where he could see the city under construction, facing south; then there is no doubt that his entire prophecy was composed over a period of nineteen years, nine months, and five days of the twentieth year. But if, according to Theodotion, who interpreted in that place where we have placed [it], at the beginning of the year, it is understood that on the new year, the tenth month (however, the new year is called the seventh month among the Hebrews, which has the name Tishri, that is, on the Kalends of the seventh month, there is the sound of trumpets, and on the tenth day of the same month, there is the day of fasting and atonement; but on the fifteenth day, when the whole circle of the moon is completed, there are the days of the booths), it is understood that on the tenth day of the Day of Atonement, the building of the city as shown to Ezekiel, the prophet. And just as he demonstrated the restoration of the people, or rather the revival in the bones of the valley under the image of the resurrection, so now the Lord promises the restoration of the city that was destroyed by the Babylonians fourteen years ago, under its description, just as the type of captivity and destruction that he had shown through the boiling pot from the face of the North, and the truth of the prophecy was confirmed by the work, so the truth of the future edification would be proven by the faith in past events and the prediction. Nor is this said of that time, as some ignorant Jews want, when under Zerubbabel and under Jesus, son of Josedech, the high priest, the temple was built, with the prophets Haggai and Zechariah prophesying. For this temple that is now described, and the order of the priesthood, and the division of the land and fertility, is much more magnificent than what Solomon built. But the temple that was built under Zerubbabel was so small, and compared to the previous one was nothing: those who had seen the previous temple, and then saw this one, would wail and testify their sorrow with tears, and the clamor of the mourners would be much louder than the sound of trumpets. Read the book of Ezra. Furthermore, what is added, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck (or captured), according to mystical understanding, it signifies fourteen generations: which completed from David to the birth of Christ, the restoration of the city is promised by him, about whom it is written: He will build my city and bring back the captivity of my people. And again: He came to proclaim release to the captives and sight to the blind, saying to those who were in chains, come out, and to those who were in darkness, be revealed. But the hand of the Lord came upon him, so that Israel in the flesh, who was situated in Babylon, would come to the land in spirit. And he would not be placed on a high mountain in a vision, but in the visions of God, on an exceedingly high mountain, about which Isaiah and Micah prophesied: Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob (Isa. II, 3; Mic. IV, 2). For it is exceedingly high, in comparison to the other mountains, about which the prophet testifies, saying: I lift up my eyes to the mountains, from where will my help come? (Ps. CXX, 1). And in another place: Mountains are around it, and the Lord is around His people (Ps. CXXIV, 2). Concerning this it is also said by Isaiah: Ascend to a high mountain, you who bring good news to Zion (Isa. XL, 9). On this mountain, the city's building is shown, according to the Septuagint and Aquila, from the region, and opposite the north, from where the prophet came to the land of Israel; but according to Theodotion and Symmachus, it faces south, where there is full light, and the sun of righteousness is positioned at the highest point of the sky. And in the Song of Songs it says: Rise up, O north wind, and come, O south wind, blow upon my garden, that its spices may flow out. (Song 4:16) For the harsh north wind is driven away by the breath of the Lord, lest the warmth of love grow cold and the flowers wither. But when it is said, 'Like the structure of a city, not truly a city, but a likeness of a city is shown,' it refers to the city about which it is written: Glorious things are said of you, O city of God. (Psalm 87:2) This is Jerusalem, built as a city, whose unity itself is in that very city, and in it the great Lord is greatly praised, in the city of our God, on his holy mountain. (Psalm 48). And in the towers of this city, God is known when he will receive it. As it is said elsewhere: The streams of the river gladden the city of God (Ps. 46:4). And: A city set on a hill cannot be hidden (Matt. 5:14), as spoken in Isaiah: I am a solid city, a city under attack (Isa. 23). It did not say that it is conquered, but under attack: it is built on a rock and is not shaken by any storm. It follows: And he led me there, as it is understood, by the hand of God. There, however, that is, to the building of the city, so that he might show me all the things that were inside. And behold, he says, a man, whose appearance or vision was like a shining bronze, specifically the one of whom it is written: Behold a man, the Rising Sun is his name (Zach. VI, 12). But he did not have the appearance of amber, as is said at the beginning of this volume, nor was he girded with a golden belt, as is stated in the Book of Revelation (Apoc. I): but he had the appearance of bronze, according to the Hebrew. For this material is more resonant than all metals and resounds with a far-reaching sound. Hence, in the Book of Daniel, the kingdom of Alexander and the Greeks is symbolized by an image made of gold, silver, bronze, and iron (Daniel. II); in order to represent the eloquence of the Greek language: through which it is clear that they still need teaching, who have not yet fully understood the mysteries of spiritually building the temple. There was also a line made of twine in his hand, as it is written in Zechariah (Zech. II), that he had a measuring line to measure the width and length of the city. And the workers of masonry, either the angels who served under God's command, or Moses, and all the prophets and apostles who build the city of God, and are helpers or ministers of the Lord's will. Hence, the Apostle Paul also said: We are God's field, God's building (1 Cor. III, 9). And what follows: And the pen of measurement in his hand signifies prophetic grace, of which it is written in the forty-fourth psalm: My tongue is the pen of a swift scribe (Psalm 44:2). And concerning John the prophet and the baptist: What did you go out to the desert to see? A reed shaken by the wind (Matthew 11:7). Those who desire to imitate this reed, are those who write iniquity, and to whom the prophet curses: Rebuke the beasts of the reed (Psalm 68:31). But he was standing at the gate; for through him we enter the Father, and without him we cannot enter the city of God, so that it may receive the worthy and cast out the unworthy. There is also judgment at the gate. Hence the prophet says: They hate those who correct at the gate (Isa. 29:21). And in another place: He will not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies at the gate (Ps. 127:5). This man spoke to the prophet, in whose hand was a cord, and whose appearance was like bronze, and he held a reed in his hand. He spoke to Ezekiel, a true architect, whom Paul the apostle imitated, saying: Like a wise architect, I have laid the foundation (I Cor. III, 10). But he calls the wise architect, to distinguish him from the foolish one, and he is called an unworthy shepherd in Zechariah; but he spoke the following: Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears (Zech. XI): not with the eyes of the flesh, but with the spirit; not with the ears of the body, but with the soul. Lift up, he says, your eyes, and see that the fields are already white for harvest (John 4:35). And: He who has ears to hear, let him hear (Luke 8:8). The construction of the city is visible, and the order of the ceremonies and priests, and the description of the land can be heard. But it is not enough to command to see with the eyes and hear with the ears; but he added: And place your heart in all things; or, place in your heart all that I will show you. For nothing is of benefit to have seen and heard, unless you place those things that you have seen and heard in the treasure of memory. When, however, he says, 'all things that I will show you', he makes the listener attentive, and he prepares the eyes of the heart, so that he may hold in his memory those things that are to be shown to him, for you have been brought here so that all things may be shown to you. With this, he shows specifically that nothing is sweeter than theory and knowledge, which the prophet desires, saying: 'One thing I have asked of the Lord, this I will seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.' In order to see the delight of the Lord, and to visit His temple (Psalm 26:4, 5). Hence he joins and speaks: Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house and the dwelling place of your glory. Proclaim, he says, all that you see to the house of Israel, so that those who cannot see for themselves may learn through you what is shown to you by the Lord. But to the house of Israel are those who contemplate God with their mind, such as Nathanael, who earnestly sought Christ, and deserved to hear: Behold, a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit (John 1:47).


<h2 id='tocuniq307'>(Vers. 5 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 5 and following) And behold, there was a wall surrounding the house on all sides, and in the hand of the man was a measuring reed of six cubits and a handbreadth, and he measured the width of the building with the reed, one reed wide, and the height with the reed, one reed high. And he came to the gate that faced the eastern road, and he went up its steps, and he measured the threshold of the gate with the reed, one reed wide, that is, one reed wide, and the vestibule one reed long, and one reed wide, and between the vestibules five cubits, and the threshold of the gate next to the entrance of the gate inside, one reed wide. And the vestibule of the gate was eight cubits, and the front of it two cubits: but the gate itself was inward. And the chambers of the gate towards the east, three on this side, and three on that side; they measured one against another: and the fronts of the gate on both sides were of one measure. And he measured the length of the porch of the gate, ten cubits: and the breadth of the gate, thirteen cubits. And there was also a space before the chambers, one cubit on this side, and one cubit on that side: and the chambers six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. And he measured the gate from the roof of the chamber to its roof, a width of twenty-five cubits, door against door. Seventy: And behold, a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits and a handbreadth. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed. Then he went inside the gateway which faced toward the east, went up its stairs and measured the threshold of the gateway, which was one reed wide, and the other threshold was one reed wide. Each gate chamber was one reed long and one reed wide; between the gate chambers were five cubits. The threshold of the gateway by the vestibule of the inside gate was one reed. And three equal in width for the stem, and equal in length for the stem, and one gate next to the gate of eight cubits, and one of two cubits, and one gate on the inside, and three gates on each side, and one measurement: one measurement for the gate on both sides. The width of the entrance of the gate was ten cubits, and the width of the gate was thirteen cubits, and one cubit was equivalent to the sight of one finger, and the end of one cubit on both sides, and three cubits here, and three cubits there. And the gate was measured from wall to wall, a width of twenty-five cubits. This gate is opposite the gate.» When I was a boy in Rome, and was being educated in the liberal arts, I used to go with others of the same age and purpose, on Sundays, to visit the tombs of the apostles and martyrs; and I would often enter the crypts, which are dug deep in the earth, and on both sides of those who enter, the bodies of the buried are held in the walls, and everything is so dark that almost the prophetic saying is fulfilled: 'Let the living descend into hell' (Psalm 55:16): and rarely is light admitted from above to temper the horror of the darkness, so that you would think it is not a window, but a hole of light descending: and again, one approaches slowly, and in the blind night that Virgilian phrase is set forth (Aeneid, Book II):

Everywhere horror seizes the souls, and the very silence terrifies. Let this statement be for me, so that the wise reader may understand the sentiment I have concerning the explanation of the temple of God in Ezekiel, about which it is written: Clouds and darkness are under His feet (Ps. 96:2). And again: Darkness is His hiding place (Ps. 18:12): Hence Moses also entered into a cloud and darkness, so that he could contemplate the mysteries of the Lord, which the people, being far away and remaining below, could not see (Exod. 24 and 34). After forty days, the common people were unable to see the face of Moses because it was glorified, or as it is written in Hebrew, Moses had horns on his face. Similarly, while reading the description of the mystical temple (which the Jews believe should be built literally upon the coming of their own Christ, whom we believe to be the Antichrist, but we refer to the Church of Christ, which we see being built daily in his saints), whenever the eye of the heart opens, it happens to me that I think I see and possess the bridegroom and joyfully say: 'I have found him whom my soul loves; I will hold him, and not let him go.' (Song of Solomon 3:4). Then again, the divine word deserts me, the bridegroom flees from my hands, and my eyes are blinded by darkness, so that I am compelled to say: 'O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God!' How inscrutable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out! (Rom. 11:33) And what is written elsewhere: The judgments of the Lord are a great abyss. (Ps. 36:7) And: Out of the depths I have cried to You, O Lord; Lord, hear my voice. (Ps. 129:1) And that of Elisha, who followed with his eyes his master being taken up, saying: My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen! (2 Kings 2:12) Therefore, it must be simply confessed that the temple of the blessed Ezekiel, which all ages have been silent about, I do not wish to discuss rashly, but to demonstrate the conjecture of my mind to the readers with faith and fear of God; so that if I should offer in the tabernacle of God the skins of goats and hairs, by which the thorns and thistles of sins may be protected, and rains and storms may be kept out: let another, who is rich, according to the quality of his merits, offer iron, or bronze, or silver, and gold and precious stones, and not despise our offerings, because they are lesser, but rejoice in his own wealth. For if the lower parts are not present, the upper parts cannot exist. And in order for the greater things to be praised, they increase in comparison to the smaller things. Let us therefore see what Ezekiel, upon entering the building of the city facing south, first saw and then heard: 'And behold,' he says, 'there was a wall on the outside surrounding the house on all sides.' Regarding the wall, which Aquila and Theodotion interpreted as 'περίβολον', Symmachus and the Seventy translated it as 'περίβολος'. Therefore, the wall, or 'περίβολος', surrounded the house, that is, the temple of the Lord on all sides, and it had a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, who not only held a geometric string and a mason's trowel, but also held a measuring rod in his hand, the measurement of which is not explicitly stated, but is now given as six cubits and a palm, which is more accurately called 'παλαιστή' in Greek and is the sixth part of a cubit. Moreover, the word 'spithamen' is used to mean 'palm,' as some use 'palm' to distinguish it. Furthermore, they are accustomed to call a wrestler a 'palm'. Therefore, with a measuring rod, he measured the width and height of the wall, and both, that is, the width and height, were six cubits and one palm. And since there were many gates, he did not want to enter through the other gates, but through the one that faced the eastern region. And because the place was not level, and the wall went around, and the house of God itself was built on higher ground, therefore he entered, or rather, ascended through steps. These are referred to as 'LXX seven' alone, when in Hebrew and in other translations we read only the word 'steps' without a number. Having entered the gate, he immediately measured the threshold of the gate, which the Greeks call LXX θεὸς: for which it is written in Hebrew Seph. And I think the diligent and studious reader should be reminded: if, however, he is led by the knowledge of the Scriptures and not by the empty declamations of orators, so that he knows nearly all the Hebrew words and names, which have been greatly corrupted by age in the Greek and Latin translations, distorted by the fault of the scribes, and while they are written about in their uncorrected form, made even more uncorrected, having turned into Sarmatian instead of Hebrew, nay of no nation at all, since they have ceased to be Hebrew and have not yet begun to be foreign. The LXX also translated the word aelam (αἰλὰμ) as itself, which Symmachus interpreted as anteliminare in the following passages. There were two bedchambers, or cubicles, and παραστάδαs which were five cubits long, and another threshold of the gate next to the vestibule on the inside with a single reed. The third vestibule of the gate also had eight cubits, and in front of it, or on its borders, two cubits. In order to prevent anyone from confusing this vestibule with the previous one, he added: This vestibule is the inner vestibule of the gate, for which the LXX translated first, second, and third vestibule. But the chambers, that is, the bedrooms, which were built after the Eastern gate in the vestibules, faced the Eastern road. And so that we may know how many chambers there were, it is joined, three on this side and three on that: namely, facing North and South, and facing the Eastern road: and the measurements of the fronts were the same on both sides. Also, the measurement of the width of the gate threshold was taken, and it was found to be ten cubits, and in length thirteen cubits, and the ends of the chambers were narrowed down to one cubit, or as Symmachus translated, "παραστάδων", and each front had one cubit. But the chambers, or παραστάδες, and as the LXX have rendered it θεηλὰθ, had on each side six cubits. And he measured the door of the chamber, or παραστάδος, from the roof of the one chamber to the roof of the other, and it was twenty-five cubits wide. So there was only space from the door to the door, or from the gate to the gate. This we have briefly spoken to suggest more the divine presence than to explain, desiring to outline the picture according to the obscure and almost unseen letter. Furthermore, we will set down a few things that we can suspect narrowly and with doubts. The Apostle Paul, desiring the Ephesians to understand more sacred things, prays that they may be filled with the wisdom and love of the Lord, so that rooted and founded, they may be able to know and comprehend the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and the profound riches of Him. And he speaks to them: Therefore, you are by no means strangers but fellow citizens of the saints and domestics of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Jesus Christ Himself as the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure grows together to form a holy temple in the Lord. In Him, you also are built together to be a dwelling place of God in the Holy Spirit. Peter the Apostle also speaks in almost the same words, because of the same spirit, in his Epistle: For if you have believed that the Lord is good, approaching him as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men but chosen, and honorable before God, and be yourselves built up as living stones into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, offering up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2, 3-5). From this it is clear that the Lord and Savior, who is the true architect, tests the stones that can be placed in the foundations of the temple, both in the middle and in the higher places, and whether they are of a less solid strength in the wall and whether they can be placed outside the temple in the circuit of the enclosure. For it is not of little strength or of minimal firmness to support the stones placed on top. Hence the Apostle writes to the believers: Bear one another's burdens (Galatians 6:2). And in another place it is written: we should not take on a burden that we cannot bear. But the reed of measurement, which had six cubits and one palm, signifies our conversation with God, which is contained in the six days in which the world was made, and signifies the reason for each work, so that one thing belongs to the work, another to the mind. Hence, the width is equal to the height: the width refers to the works, as we said; the height refers to the soul, which hastens to lofty things. But let it suffice to have warned once: to know me by name, and to be called by a neutral gender, but for the sake of simplicity and ease of understanding, and the common usage, to use the masculine gender. For our concern is not to avoid grammatical errors, but to explain the obscurity of the Holy Scripture with whatever words. Therefore, a man enters, whose name is East, through the Eastern gate, to enlighten those whom he finds in the first part of the entrance hall, whether in the entrance itself: not through one, but through several steps, whose number is kept silent, so that the difficulty of ascent may be apparent, and for whatever number of steps you propose, you may know that it is less than the doubt that is left behind. I consider this to be the gate, of which it is sung in the Psalms: This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall enter through it (Ps. 118:20). And the threshold of the gate is measured, so that we may know that all the knowledge of God is open. This threshold is said to be one reed in width, and it is silent about height and length. For it is both the way and the entrance, and through it one must proceed to the inner parts (although in this place the Septuagint unnecessarily speaks of length, or, as is contained in most manuscripts, height); but the chambers, that is, the bedrooms and alcoves, have individual reeds in both length and width, but there are five cubits between each chamber, so that the inner chambers have the full measure of a reed, that is, six cubits and one palm, as the works and calculations agree. Those things which are external, that is, between chamber and chamber, are five cubits; for the secrets of Christ have not yet been penetrated, and they cannot say: The king has brought me into his chamber (Song of Songs 1:3). And elsewhere: All the glory of the king's daughter is within (Psalm 44:14). But while the disciples were staying at home with Christ, they could not hear his mysteries, and they desired to go outside to hear the word of God; and therefore a measurement of five cubits is placed in them, so that they may be taught to refer everything to the five senses. The threshold of the other gate, as it is contained in the Septuagint, of the second vestibule and third, is of the same size as one reed. After this vestibule, that is, the threshold of the gate, eight cubits are placed at the entrance, so that the inner parts of the vestibule do not hold a number of seven, but of eight, which pertain to the sacrament of the resurrection and the Lord's Day. And in front, he says, of the same vestibule, there were two cubits, which pertain either to both Testaments, or to the letter and the spirit, or to the mystery of the pair of tongs, which is included in Isaiah about the altar of coal, and is brought to cleanse the lips of the prophet. And so that we may know what this vestibule is, which is terminated by eight and two cubits, he explains it more clearly: The vestibule of the gate was inside, through which we came to the temple of God. There were also chambers and rooms which were on the way to the eastern gate, for which the Septuagint write 'Elau', there were three on one side and three on the other, each measuring one, that is, a reed which had six cubits and one palm, as mentioned above: And one reed for length, and one reed for width, and between the chambers five cubits. Therefore, we should not think that there are only two bedchambers, but rather six on each side, to indicate the number six, which is also shown in the water pots of the Gospel (John 2), in which water was turned into wine, and the Jewish water is daily turned into wine, which gladdens the heart of man, and becomes sweeter with the blood of Christ. He also measured the width of the threshold of the ten-cubit gate, which is a perfect number and is contained either in the Decalogue or in the sacraments of the four Gospels. Whoever begins with one, reaches four in such a way as to fill the number ten. Its length was thirteen cubits: for which the width is again placed at seventy, which seems to me to have been corrupted by the carelessness of scribes. For the Scripture would not have said the width in one place and again the width of ten or thirteen cubits. However, it can be understood as the gate of the threshold, in which the number of the Old and New Testament is consecrated, or the Lord himself, who says: I am the gate (John 10:9); or certainly all the saints through whom we enter into the knowledge of God, to whom the Apostle Paul spoke: My mouth is open to you, Corinthians; and: Enlarge yourselves also (2 Corinthians 6:11). But thirteen cubits after the number eighteen, they contain the sacrament of the books of Moses, which are also shown in the five loaves (Matthew 14), and in the Samaritan woman of the Gospel (John 4), who is accused of having had five husbands, and the sixth one she thought she had, she did not have: and yet the number eight, and the number five, is completed by one cubit, that is, the fourteenth ((or thirteenth)): because in Christ all things are recapitulated. It is said: 'And one cubit at each end: for the old and new Testaments together make up one measurement of Christ, and one cubit contains the height of the ark of Noah, which is thirty cubits. However, the rooms, as the Septuagint has it, either as 'thau' or 'thee', changing and altering the names in each place as they wished, were six cubits on either side, which is called 'here and there', and they did not have a span or additional measure placed on top, which would have signified the present life leading to future blessedness, but only six cubits.' And it is measured from the roof of the chamber to the roof or wall of it, and it is found to be twenty-five cubits in width; which number, though multiplied four times, still relates to sense. For if you arrange five cubits against it five times, you will produce the number twenty-five, which is between the roof of the chambers and the roof; and yet both, when placed opposite each other, have a doorway facing the doorway. Let these things not seem frivolous to the reader, although they may displease even myself who speak, feeling like I am knocking on a closed door; but they are to be read with permission: otherwise, I could simply confess my ignorance and remove every desire of the students. For just as we are far from perfect knowledge, we consider a minor fault at least somewhat lighter than saying absolutely nothing.

<h2 id='tocuniq308'>(Vers. 14 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 14 and following) He made fronts for sixty cubits, and the courtyard of the gate had a surrounding circuit. And before the face of the gate, which reached up to the face of the interior vestibule gate, there were fifty cubits, and oblique windows in the chambers, and in their fronts which were inside the gate all around. Similarly, there were windows in the vestibules all around inside: and before the fronts, there was a depiction of palms. LXX: And under the sky was the court of the gate sixty cubits, and the threshold of the court of the gate all round. And under the sky of the court outside was the gate of the inner court fifty cubits, and windows screened with palm trees, and also the threshold of the gate within the court round about. And similarly the gate chambers, and windows all around inside, and the thresholds of the gates were palm trees on both sides.\" Symmachus interpreted this passage as follows: And he made circuits, which we can call surroundings: for which in Hebrew he has Elim (), which Aquila interpreted as κρίωμα, and we translate as frontiers. Again, where the Seventy placed the entrance of the atrium, in Hebrew it has El () in the singular number, which Symmachus translated as near the entrance, Aquila as κρίωμα, that is, the front of the atrium. Also, under the open sky, Aquila, before the face of the gate's posts; Symmachus, opposite the face of the gate's vestibule, translated. The hidden windows called Atemoth in Hebrew, Symmachus translated as τοξικὰς. And where the Seventy said above the entrance and above the gate's post, Symmachus placed the posts and the surroundings; Aquila, the chambers, and their fronts: for which it is written in Hebrew Theim and Ele. Moreover, Elamoth, which Septuagint and Theodotion also translated similarly; Symmachus translated circumstantias [circumstances], Aquila translated frontes [fronts]. But Aelam, for which it is written El in Hebrew ((Mss. Ul)), is called ostium [door] or porticus [porch]. Also, for palmis [palms], it is written in Hebrew as Thamarim [plural number]: because in the singular number, it calls palmam [palm], Thamar. I know that these things will be annoying to a fastidious reader: but I wanted to show briefly how much the ancient translation differs from the Hebrew truth due to the length of time, or rather the fault of the scribes, and, to speak more openly, our lack of knowledge of Hebrew: especially in Hebrew names, which we have translated from other editions into the Latin language, indicating not so much an explanation of the words as our simple suspicion. However, I think that around the wall of the temple on the outside, and the temple itself in the courtyard, that is, in the middle, there were certain things placed for decoration, which Symmachus interprets as surroundings, that is, certain standing structures, raised high from the ground, and these occupied a space of sixty cubits. And again, as one went out from the inner gate to the front of the vestibule, which faced the outer gate, there were fifty cubits of space, in which there were oblique windows, which Seventy called 'toxicas'. And in these windows were in the chambers, that is, in each room, and in the porticoes that extended before the rooms, measuring fifty cubits. These windows were slanted or arched, therefore they were called 'sagittae', which means 'arrows', because they allow a narrow light to enter the house, like arrows, and expand inward: and all around they were full of such windows. And in front of the facades of the porticoes, he says, there were paintings or carvings of palm trees, through which it is shown at the entrance of the gate, and immediately upon entering, a wall measuring sixty cubits with various ornaments meets, which refer to the condition of the world, so that the Creator may be understood through His creations: and everything in order and with reason, show the variety of the world, which among the Greeks is called 'kosmos', derived from adornment: and it was made in six days, so that each day, ten decades are reckoned, which we have mentioned above as the perfect number. After this, as we enter the inner atrium, we come across before us the vestibule of the inner gate of the bedroom, with oblique windows, occupying a space of fifty cubits, which itself is a sacred number. And after seven full weeks of festivity and joy, the first day of the Octave begins, which is the Day of Resurrection, and it brings us close to the temple. For when we have done all things, repenting for our previous errors, then we become neighbors and close to God, so that in the outer atrium, the order of creatures teaches us knowledge of the Creator with constancy, and in the inner [atrium] true jubilation, in which all our debts are forgiven, instructs us in the theology, and introduces us to the Holy of Holies. It is also worth noting that the inner courtyard has several windows, which are not direct and equal, but rather oblique and narrow on the outside, and widening inward, so that we can penetrate the interior through small openings and reach the fullness of the brightest light, which is present in the temple. Finally, after sixty and fifty cubits, and chambers, and porticoes, and the facades of the porticoes, and numerous windows all around, the carving or painting of palm trees is shown to us, so that as victors of the world, we may become worthy to see the palm trees of virtues.


<h2 id='tocuniq309'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 17 and onwards) 'And he led me to the outer court, and behold, treasuries, and a pavement laid with stone in the court all around: thirty treasuries around the pavement. And the pavement in front of the gateways, at the gateways, was lower. And he measured the width of the gateway from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court outside, one hundred cubits on the east side and on the north side. Seventy: And he brought me into the inner court, and behold, chambers, and the posts of the court all around, thirty chambers by the posts. And there was a porch in front of the gateways, and there were posts along the front of the gateways, below the columns.' And he measured the width of the atrium from the place that was under the outer gate to the inner gate: under the outer gate that faced the outside, one hundred cubits, and it turned towards the east. For the chambers, thirty, which were turned into seventy, or treasury rooms and cellars, as Aquila interpreted, Symmachus placed platforms. And for one hundred cubits of the outer space, which extended to the Eastern gate, the same number of cubits in Hebrew, and it is said to extend to the North: but in the Seventy, the name of the North has been removed. Therefore, that man who had in his hand a measuring line and a reed of measurement, and stood at the gate, among other things that the prophets showed to the sight, after the courtyard of sixty cubits, and another vestibule of the inner gate which measured fifty cubits, led the prophet to the outer courtyard, or as it is contained in the Septuagint, he brought him to the inner courtyard. And I marvel greatly, according to the literal and Septuagint text, how after the outer courts, which measure sixty and fifty cubits, there is an inner court which extends in width one hundred cubits: unless, of course, according to mystical understanding and the progress of those who enter, the inner things in teachings are broader. But upon entering the inner courtyard, or upon being led to the outer courtyard, as is stated in Hebrew, he immediately saw thirty chambers or treasuries, or as Symmachus interprets, exedras, which had been prepared for the dwelling of the Levites and priests, and a pavement adorned with living stones or intercolumnia, to show that the inner or outer courtyard had a row of columns in front of the entrance, and a pavement in front of the gates, or a portico behind the gates. In these colonnades, I believe that the columns were arranged in order, so that there were colonnades in front of the treasuries, and columns supporting the colonnades in front of the facades of the colonnades. The pavement, which was laid with stones, extended in front of the atrium’s colonnades, lower in elevation than the colonnades, and had the same length as the building of the chambers. And the same man, in whose hand there was a measuring line and a reed, measured from the face of the lower gate, or as the Seventy translate it, the outer gate, to the front of the atrium or the inner gate, one hundred cubits towards the east, and, as it is said in Hebrew, towards the north. From which we understand that Evangelical saying which is narrated by the Savior (Matthew 15), sowing in the field of the mind good seeds, which multiplies fruits according to the variety of virtues in thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and hundredfold, agree with the prophecy of this place. And here the thirtieth, sixtieth, and hundredth number are mentioned, so that by these steps we may be able to reach perfect knowledge; but only in such a way that the fiftieth number leads us to the inner parts of the Church, which, after the completion of the seven weeks of the Sabbath, broke forth into the day of the resurrection. But they are called gazophylacia, which are full of spiritual riches, of which it is written: The redemption of a man's soul, his own riches (Prov. XIII, 8). About which also the Apostle Paul congratulates his disciples, that they are full of every word and all knowledge (Philippians I). However, in the Persian language, gaza is the term for riches. Or certainly, the thalami, which in Greek are called παστοφόρια, show the prepared chambers for the arrival of the bridegroom, which were thirty in number, in order to demonstrate the perfect age of the inhabitants. And the pavement was laid with stone, so that the feet of the inhabitants, who were sinners, would not be polluted by mud, dirt, and the dust. But rather, the stones on which the temple of God is built, were walked upon. Whether the spaces between the columns were in front of the doors of the chambers, which supported the building placed on top. These are the columns, of which even the Apostle Paul writes: They gave me and Barnabas their right hands, Peter and John, who seemed to be columns (Gal. II, 9). And in another place: The pillar and foundation of truth (1 Timothy 3:15). And in the Book of Revelation we read: He who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall never go out of it (Revelation 3:12). Therefore, the pavement that was in front of the gates, which we have already mentioned, or the covered walkway behind the gates, which protected the inhabitants of the chambers from rain, was lower. For always those things which are lower are placed in higher places, so that we may be able to arrive at mystical and secret things, and those full of spiritual riches, through ascent and steps. And the number is full and perfect in the number of ten decades, which also multiplies the seed of Isaac by a hundred grains (Gen. XXVI). But because he was in the land, and still he could say: I am a stranger, and a sojourner like all my fathers (Psal. XXXVIII, 13), it is recounted that he sowed barley, and harvested a hundredth of the grain. For the grain of wheat had not yet died in the earth, which would make many grains (Matth. XIII, Joan. XII), and to satisfy the hunger of the Jewish people hearing the word of God, He fed them with the bread that descended from heaven (Amos VIII, Joan. VI). However, how one hundred cubits were not only towards the Eastern gate, but also towards the Northern gate, the following testimony will demonstrate.

<h2 id='tocuniq310'>(Vers. 20, 21.)</h2>

(Verse 20, 21.) He also measured the gate of the outer court that faced north, both in length and width. It had three rooms on each side, and its front and vestibule were the same size as those of the gate that faced east. The gate was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide, and its windows, vestibule, and carvings were all the same size as those of the gate that faced east. There were seven steps in its ascent, and a vestibule before it. And there was a gate of the inner court opposite the gate to the north and east. And it was measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits. Seventy: And he brought me to the north gate and behold, a gate facing the outer court. And it was measured, its length and its width, with its three sides here, and three there, and its threshing floor, and its rooms (which it did not have in Hebrew) and its palm tree. And it was made in the measurement of the gate facing east: its length was fifty cubits, and its width was twenty-five cubits. And its windows and palm trees were like the gate that faced east. And it had seven steps leading up to it, with palm trees on the inside. And the inner gate of the courtyard faced the gate of the north (which is not mentioned in Hebrew, like the gate that faces east). And the courtyard was measured from gate to gate, a hundred cubits. What the Hebrew words "thee," "elau," and "elamoth" mean, we have already explained in more detail. But our translation will teach you their meaning in the present context. However, there was a man whose cord was in his hand, and also the gate of the outer court of the north, or he brought the prophet through the gate of the north to the outer court. In which it is to be considered that it is first introduced through the gate of the north, secondly, through the gate of the south, thirdly, through the gate of the east. For from the north evil flames are kindled upon the inhabitants of the earth. And it is clear that the one who dwells on the earth, and is not a stranger or a foreigner, is exposed to the spears of him who comes from the north, whose spears are on fire, which, according to the Apostle, are extinguished by the shield of faith. And towards the North, the outer courtyard is called; but towards the South, that is, towards the South, it is not outside, but inside. For the Scripture says: And he brought me to the inner court by the South gate, which is also found written in the Eastern courtyard. For the first one entered with power, trampling underfoot the North, and by the fiftieth and twenty-fifth number, reached the top of the hundredth; then he was brought in to the South side, and expelled the cold of the North: and then he reached perfect power, that is, the Eastern gate, where the sun of justice rises, and through which only the high priest enters. And this must be noted, that while there are four cardinal directions, the western gate is not mentioned, about which it is written in the beginning of the sixty-seventh psalm: Make a way for Him who ascends in the West, the Lord is His name (Psalm 7:5); so that after we prepare a way for the Lord and fulfill what John the Baptist proclaims in the wilderness: Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight His paths (Matthew 3:3), we may be able to hear what is said in the last part of the same psalm: Sing to God, sing praises to the Lord, who ascends above the highest heavens to the East (Psalm 68:33). But what is said about the three chambers in this passage, three on one side and three on the other, teaches us that both the letter and the spirit, as well as understanding in both literal and figurative sense, pertain to the sacraments of the Trinity. And what is said about the front and the vestibule according to the measurement of the previous gate signifies the Eastern gate, which is called 'first' not in order but in merit. And it had, it says, fifty cubits in length and twenty-five in width, so that eternal rest might be demonstrated after fifty weeks following seven weeks: extending during the day of resurrection to the kingdoms of heaven, in which true rest is found. But in twenty-five, of which number we spoke earlier, let the measurement of the five senses be preserved through the five orders of the square, of which one is adapted to length and another to width, so that in length there may be rest and delight of a more sacred knowledge; in width, a demonstration of present things that pertain to the senses. And it is inferred: And its windows, and vestibules, and sculptures, or as the Seventy added, palm trees, were according to the measurement of the gate that looked towards the East, this is subtly indicated, that whoever is positioned at the entrance of virtues, enters three and three chambers, recognizes the front and vestibule of the measurement of the previous gate, comes to them, and sees what has been most abundantly received in the Eastern gate. Furthermore, what follows: And there was a seven-step ascent, and a vestibule before it, or within it, this has the meaning that through the seven steps of the week, and the lamps that are lit from the face of the North, and the Jewish ceremonies to which God gave commandments that are not good, and the justifications in which they do not live, we ascend to higher things and to its vestibule, that is, to the gates, for which the Seventy Elamites translated. The vestibule before the gate is both interior and exterior. Not only is there one gate to the North, which is called the outer gate, but there is also another inner gate, which resembles the Eastern gate, as the Seventy have clearly stated. And the inner gate of the court faces the gate to the North, just as the gate that faced the East. And the distance from the outer gate to the inner gate of the same North is one hundred cubits, so that by means of these steps and measurements, we may be able to reach the inner gate by departing from the outer gate, as has been said in the explanation of the numbers.


<h2 id='tocuniq311'>(Vers 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 24 and following) 'And he led me to the south gate, and behold, there was a gate that faced south. And its frontispiece and vestibule were measured according to the upper measurements, and its windows and vestibules all around were like the other windows. It had a length of fifty cubits, and a width of twenty-five cubits, and it was ascended by seven steps, and there was a vestibule in front of its doors, and palm trees were carved on it, one on one side, and the other on the other side in front of it.' And the entrance of the inner court was on the south side, and it measured from entrance to entrance on the south side, one hundred cubits. And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate, and he measured the south gate according to the same measurements, its rooms, its doorway, and its vestibule, with the same measurements. And the vestibules all around the court were fifty cubits in length and twenty-five cubits in width. And a vestibule in a circular shape, with a length of twenty-five cubits and a width of five cubits. And its vestibule was towards the outer court, and its palm trees were on its front, and it had eight steps by which it was ascended. Seventy agree in the same words, except for thee, elau, elamoth, and elam, which in Hebrew is ulam. But thee is interpreted as threshold or front; elau, around it or supports; elamoth, entrance or vestibule; ulam is πρόπυλον, that is, before the doors. But what we have placed next to the Hebrew, that is, the vestibule or πρόπυλον, is not found in the Septuagint. But it should also be noted that in the southern gate it is not called a road according to the Septuagint, but simply 'and he led me to the south,' and behold, a gate that faced south. Therefore, through each entrance, Ezekiel, whose name means 'God strengthens,' is led. And from the northern gate, he goes to the southern gate, whose fronts, thresholds, τροπύλαια, or vestibules, and windows had similar measurements around, twenty-five cubits in length and five cubits in width. And it was ascended by seven steps, that is, to the southern gate and its vestibule, which is called elamoth, in front of its doors. Also, two carved palm trees, which we mentioned in the gate of the northern region. And let this be enough to remind you, that whatever is presented there, according to the more common understanding, that is, according to the literal sense, we understand at the south gate according to the spiritual sense. For in the same lines, both history and tropology run: but the former is lowly, the latter is sublime: the former clings to the earth, the latter soars to the heavens. And all things were filled with light around through the windows. For each problem has its own limits, and through them the light of faith enters the soul of the believer, especially if the length of his life has been extended to fifty years, that is, to the mystery of jubilee, and he is able to reach the breadth of a more divine understanding. In this latitude and on these streets, wisdom moves confidently, and with a lofty voice she exclaims: she climbs seven steps in order to reach the vestibule, and through the palms of her purpose and efforts, she holds eternal victory. And lest we think there is only one atrium to the south, it is said about the second atrium: And the entrance of the inner atrium is on the southern road: and it is measured from the entrance to the entrance on the southern road one hundred cubits; so that after a week and the sacraments of the old covenant, she may reach the good land and the grace of the Gospel. Not only is there a second atrium in the southern gate, but also a third, which is now called: 'And he brought me to the inner atrium at the southern gate, and he measured the gate according to the upper measurements, etc. For each atrium has its own measurements and arrangement, and in these measurements there is a different grace, as we know the same things differently at the beginning, in progress, and at the end. However, what is not found in the Septuagint, and the vestibule, or πρόπυλον, around twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide, seems to raise a question, because it was not placed in the ancient interpretation, how twenty-five cubits and five are placed after the progress of the third step.' But it removes the ambiguity that follows: And its vestibule is towards the outer courtyard, and its palms are at the front; so that this courtyard, which had a length of twenty-five cubits and a width of five, belongs not to the inner courtyard but to the outer courtyard, so that the width of the former courtyard, that is, twenty-five cubits, is possessed by the length of the outer courtyard, and it holds a width of five cubits. These measurements, that is, twenty-five and five, we refer to the same senses, namely sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, which if we ascend to higher things, we double by fivefold and make them spiritual from carnal senses, as it is written: Lift up your eyes and see that the fields are already white for harvest (John 4:35), and: He who has ears to hear, let him hear (Luke 8:8). And: Taste and see, for the Lord is sweet (Psalm 33:8). And: We are the good fragrance of Christ to God among those who believe (2 Corinthians 2:15). And in the Epistle of John it is said: That which we have heard and seen, and our hands have touched, concerning the Word of life (1 John 1:1). And finally, in no way are only seven degrees sufficient in the northern region: but after seven, the number eight is added, as we move from the Synagogue to the Church, from the old covenant to the new, from earthly things to heavenly things.


<h2 id='tocuniq312'>(Vers. 28 seqq.)</h2>

(Versed. 28 seqq.) And he led me into the inner courtyard by the eastern way: and he measured the gate according to the upper measurements; its chamber and its front and its vestibule as before, and its windows and its vestibules all around, with a length of fifty cubits and a width of twenty-five cubits. And its vestibule, that is, the outer courtyard (which the Septuagint and Symmachus have placed as the inner courtyard); and carved palm trees on its front, both here and there, and with eight steps leading up to it. » From the Northern region, into whose courtyard only seven steps were ascended, one passes to the Southern gate and courtyard of the same region, to which not only seven, as mentioned above, but eight steps are ascended: namely, so that we may pass from the Old to the New; and to speak more clearly, through the patriarchs and prophets, we come to the apostles: so that in one week there is an octet in the other. But now it comes to the last, or rather to the highest, and introduces the prophet through the way of the inner gate, or through the courtyard, to which one goes through the Eastern gate. In this place, according to the Septuagint, the way is only mentioned; in the Northern and Southern regions, it is completely silent, so that we can understand that in the Eastern region only is that way to be understood, which says: I am the way, the truth and the life (John 14:6). For through Him we come to the Father, and it is written about Him: Blessed are the undefiled in the way (Psalm 119:1), who think nothing left of Christ, but their faith is pure and not in any way polluted by the stain of heretics. Likewise, the number of rooms, facades, entrances, windows, and the amount of light in them, as well as the same measurement of length and width: fifty by twenty-five cubits, preserving the sacredness, and the vestibule of its gate or inner courtyard, which is placed outside according to the Hebrew, so that everything is enclosed by the Eastern light, according to what is written: 'There is no one who can hide from its heat' (Psalm 19:7). But if we understand the atrium both externally and internally: thus it must be understood that God is both encompassing and indwelling, saying through the prophet: He who holds the heavens in the palm of his hand, and the earth in his fist (Isaiah XL, 12): so that everything may be seen as included in him. And again: Heaven is my throne, and the earth is the footstool of my feet (Isaiah LXVI, 1), so that he is believed to exist within all things: according to that verse from Virgil's Aeneid (Book VI).

In the beginning, the sky and the earth, and the liquid fields, And the shining globe of the moon, and the Astra of Titania, A Spirit nourishes them within: and infused throughout their limbs, The Mind moves the whole mass, and mingles itself with the great body.

And when, through the weapons of justice, on the right and left, through glory and disgrace, through good and bad reputation, through praise and blame, we have obtained victory over this world (2 Cor. 6): then palms are given to us on both sides, which neither joys have changed, nor sorrow, nor prosperity, nor adversity have overcome: and not by seven (or eight) degrees, as in the region of the North, nor by seven and eight, as in the South, are we contained, but by only eight (or seven) degrees do we ascend to the highest: because the number eight is sufficient for us, that is, the sacrament of the Gospel; so that we may say with the Apostle: And though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him no more (2 Cor. 5:16), it is understood, according to the flesh.


<h2 id='tocuniq313'>(Vers. 35 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 35 and following) 'And he brought me to the gate that faced the north, and he measured it according to the higher measurements: its chamber, its facade, its vestibule, and its windows all around: it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. Its vestibule faced the outer court, and its palm tree engravings on its facade on both sides, and its staircase with eight steps.' And at each treasury there shall be a door in the gates (or fronts) of the doors: there they shall wash the holocaust. And at the entrance of the gate, there shall be two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, upon which the holocaust shall be immolated, and for sin, and for trespass. And on the outer side, which goes to the gate that leads to the north, there shall be two tables, and on the other side, before the vestibule of the gate, there shall be two tables. Four tables on this side, and four tables on that side: by the sides of the gate, there were eight tables, upon which they shall immolate (or used to immolate): but there were four tables for holocaust made of square stones, of one cubit and a half long, and of one cubit and a half wide, and of one cubit high, upon which the vessels were laid in which the holocaust and the victims are immolated. And their lips were a cubit long, turned inward all around; but on the tables were the flesh of the offering.» There is much disagreement in this testimony between the Hebrew Truth and the edition of the Seventy Interpreters. For what we have said: There they shall wash the burnt offering, and in the vestibule of the gate there are two tables on this side, and again: That the burnt offering and the sin offering be offered on them, is not found in the Seventy, but it is added in many copies from Theodotion. Again, when we said: And their lips turned inward by one palm's measure all around, Seventy translated it, and having the measurement of a span all around. Whether this word is Hebrew or Greek, we cannot know, except only that for 'gisum,' Symmachus and Theodotion translated it as 'lips,' Aquila's first edition translated it as 'ἐπιστάσεις' in the plural number; the second translated it as 'lips': for which in Hebrew it is written as 'Asephathaim'(). And when we say, above the tables however the meats of the offering, the Seventy put from their own, and they put coverings on the tables from above, so that they may be protected from rain and dryness. But that which they have given in Hebrew names, Thee, and Elau, and Elalamoth, and Aelam, what it signifies, and we have shown above, and our translation can show from the context: it is not necessary to often remind the reader about this, and to doubt their prudence and effort. Therefore, he is brought again to the gate that looked towards the North: but not as before to the outer courtyard, but to the inner one. For in what follows it is said: Its vestibule looked towards the outer courtyard, showing that this courtyard was inside. Through this, the progress of the one entering is shown; for in each place there are specific names and measures, and windows all around filled with the light of knowledge, showing all things, and through fifty and twenty-five cubits are the sacraments of divine sense and remission placed, as positioned in the vestibule of the inner courtyard, that we may see the exterior: contemplating knowledge of past and present, through which we may come to double palms and victories, and understand the mysteries of the eight degrees, having entered the treasuries, in which the riches of the temple are contained, and our prayers are cleansed from all the filth of sin; and tables are placed on both sides, so that the burnt offering may be first offered.

The diligent shepherd follows the custom of his father, and Gesaque, the barker of Sydon, etc., all of which the sacred fire consumes, first for sin, and finally for ignorance: whether we commit them knowingly or unknowingly. On the outer side, next to the Seventy, there was a man-made stream that carried away the ashes of the burnt offering and the harmfulness of the flesh externally: either there were two tables, and on the other side of the vestibule of the same gate there were two tables, that is, four on each side, four here and four there, and behind, or on the side of these there were eight other tables, so that they make a total of sixteen tables: by this number the mysteries of the prophets are shown, so that whatever we offer through the Gospel dispensation, we may affirm as foretold by their prophecies. And there are four tables made of square stones, and these themselves are for sacrifice and burnt offering (also called holocausts). These are living stones that are rolled upon the earth, and they have with them a corner stone, by which the walls of the old and new Covenant are held together. Now the number four signifies the Gospel sacraments, having in length and width one and a half cubits, that is, a square, which, when joined together, make three cubits, which three cubits have one cubit in height, so that the mysteries of the Trinity may preserve the measure of one cubit, that is, the divine majesty, as the Lord tells the disciples: Go, baptize all nations in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19). The name of God, as it were, is of one (or, one) cubit in height, which encompasses three properties, and always accepts the holocaust offerings of our oblations. Above these, however, are four tables of holocausts built with living stones, the length, width, and height of which have been described; vessels are placed in them in which the holocaust of the martyrs is offered, of whom it is said: Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints (Ps. 116:15); and their victims, who, through self-control and the holiness of their bodies, offer their souls as a sacrifice to the Lord. I believe that the meaning of these tables is contained in the books of Matthew, Luke, Mark, and John, which are about the apostles. Above these tables there was a curved crown on the inside, encircling the edges, to contain the sacrificial offerings and prevent them from flowing freely. It also held the meat of the offering, or as the Septuagint translated: 'And the tables themselves were covered on top, because of the violence of the rain and the excessive dryness of the summer sun, so that the meat placed on top could say with the prophet: “By day the sun will not harm us nor the moon by night."' (Psalm 121:6). One of which, with excessive rains and storms, dissolves the offerings of tribulations; the other, with violent heat, dries up whatever has been offered. Forgive me, reader, for the difficulty of the places; or if you can find something better, teach us: we gladly learn what we do not know.

<h2 id='tocuniq314'>(Vers. 44 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 44 seqq.) «And outside the front gate of the cantor's treasury in the inner courtyard, which was on the side of the gate facing the north, their faces were towards the south: one on the side of the eastern gate, which faced the way of the north. And he said to me: This is the treasury that faces the southern way of the priests, who keep watch in the temple's guardrooms. Furthermore, the treasury that faces the way of the north will be for the priests who serve at the altar: these are the sons of Zadok who come near from the sons of Levi to the Lord, to minister to Him. And he measured the porch of the temple by the length of one hundred cubits, and the width of one hundred cubits, square: and the altar that was before the temple: and he brought me into the porch of the temple, and he measured the porch five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. And the length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and there were steps to it: and pillars before the gates one on this side, and another on that side. Regarding the treasuries, the Seventy translated them as exedrae. And what we called exedrae, or the treasuries of the singers, was omitted by them. And again, after the measurement of the vestibule of five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side, they added from their own, and the width of the gate was fourteen cubits, whereas in the Hebrew it is only mentioned as a width of twelve cubits, and the width of the gate on this side was three cubits, and on that side was three cubits. I have reminded the reader not to be confused by the diversity of translations, but to be satisfied with the Hebrew truth in this particular place, especially when it comes to the measurements of the temple. Therefore, after the wall, which the Seventy translated as the περίβολον, which surrounded the whole temple in a square circuit, we read that the prophet was introduced into the inner courtyard, and then to the north, and to the south, and to the Eastern Gate, and again to the north: concerning which, as we were able, we have spoken, and in the diversity of which, either of names or of measurements, the past discourse showed what seemed to us: the meaning of which the testimony of the Savior briefly shows, saying: In my Father's house there are many mansions (John 14:2). After completing these things, he enters the temple, that is, the Holy of Holies, of which it is now said, and within the inner gate, the treasuries, or the singing halls. To them is given this command: Sing to the Lord a new song (Psalm 95:1). They cry out with the angels: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will (Luke 2:14). This inner courtyard was situated on the side of the gate that faced the North, the South, and the East, so that the singers of the Lord, and those who are engaged in the ministry of angels, may always remember by which steps they have reached the highest, and diligently understand the mysteries of each place. Finally, that man whose pen and cord were in his hand, having led the prophet into the inner courtyard which overlooked the southern road, spoke these words: 'This is the treasury or council chamber; and as Theodotius set it up, the chamber, which is separated for the dwelling of the priests, is for the observation of the temple guards. Furthermore, the treasury which overlooks the northern road will belong to the priests who stand guard at the service of the altar.' In which it should be noted that the priests to whom the custody of the temple has been entrusted dwell in the treasury, which faces the south, where the fullest light is. But those who stand guard at the ministry of the altar, where victims are offered for sin, should be in the treasury facing the north, for those who come from the north and offer victims for sins, desiring to receive and save them. Both of these, serving the Lord in their respective duties, are called the sons of Zadok, which means righteous or justifying. For God, the Almighty, whose name is written: The Lord is righteous and loves justice; His face has seen equity (Psalm 11: 8). But these are the sons of Sadoc of the sons of Levi, which is interpreted as 'assumed'. And they themselves are assumed by the Lord, so that they may approach Him, and never is it said of Moses alone: Moses approached the Lord; but also all who serve and minister to Him are said to draw near to the Lord. But this man who introduced Ezekiel into the inner courtyard, and so to speak, into the Holy of Holies, measured the courtyard itself, in which there were two chambers or treasuries assigned to the guards of the temple or the dwelling places of the altar, and he found it to be two hundred cubits in length and breadth: so that the priests of God who serve in the ministry, who had entered through a narrow and tight path, may have wide walkways and dwell in a perfect and complete number of virtues. And in the very courtyard there was an altar in front of the face of the temple, so that the prayers of the saints never ceased before God. Moreover, the aforementioned man led Ezekiel into the vestibule, or πρόπυλον of the temple, which measured five cubits on each side, for the one who was brought in had been trained in divine understanding and knew neither right nor left, but entered by the royal way. The width of the gate itself, which was the entrance to the vestibule of the temple, was three cubits on each side. In the elegant observance of the Holy Scriptures, it is not said from the right or the left, lest anything be named left in the Holy of Holies, but from this side and that side, that is, from both sides. And immediately the discerning reader understands that the number three relates to the mystery of the Trinity, which is the gate for those who approach God, for the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, and the Holy Spirit is in both. This number three is the gate for those who, after baptism in the Trinity, come to salvation. But what follows, the length of the vestibule is twenty cubits, and the width is eleven cubits, seems to raise the question of how the dual number, which refers to two decades, and the eleventh, which seems to have one less, can be said to complete the sacred number twelve in the temple vestibule. Most people solve this problem in the following way: Although the priests are holy and placed in the service of the temple, and offer daily sacrifices to Christ, because they dwell in this mortal and fragile body, subject to sickness and vice, they have the number twenty and eleven. Where was it that the Apostle said, 'Wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from this body of death' (Rom. VII, 24)? Not that we believe, according to the most savage heresy, that bodies are to be destroyed; but that it is our desire to be clothed upon, not stripped, and to receive immortality with this mortal, and to put on incorruption with this corruptible. However, what follows, 'And it was ascended by eight steps' (I Cor. XV), that is, to the inner gate, presents a great difficulty for those who know the Hebrew language. Finally, Symmachus, whom we have followed in this place, set out eight degrees: Seventy, ten; Theodotion and the second edition of Aquila, eleven; but the first edition set no number, but simply said, and the degrees by which it was ascended to it: so that either according to the custom of the previous gates, we understand eight degrees, as Symmachus understood, or certainly those which the inner gate had, whose number Scripture did not say (for which in Hebrew it is placed, Urob (), that is, breadth, Aste (), Esre (). But if it is read in this way, eleven signifies; but if we read 'Esre,' which means ten, without the final 's,' it does not signify ten but a pronoun (which). To experts in the Hebrew language, these may seem like delusions; but now we are not writing about controversies or speeches in which the composition of words is commonly used, but about explanations and commentaries on Hebrew books. But let us return to our task. The number eight or ten, which is a perfect number, or eleven, about which we have already spoken, is ascended to the gate of the holy ones, on the front of which there were columns, one on this side and another on that side. He did not say 'two' so as not to incur the number dual, but 'one and one', which is a perfect number, and imitates the unity of God. These, however, were two columns, of which it is also said in the Apocalypse: 'He who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more' (Rev. 3:12). And Peter and John are called the pillars of the Church (Gal. 2), through whom we enter into the Holy of Holies, and by whose teaching our entrance to Christ is made.

(Chapter 41, Verse 1 and following) 'And he brought me into the temple, and measured the fronts, six cubits in width here and six cubits in width there, the width of the tabernacle. And the width of the gate was ten cubits, and the sides (or shoulders) of the gate were five cubits here and five cubits there. And he measured its length, forty cubits, and its width, twenty cubits.' After many mysteries and various entrances, and the peculiarities of each place, at last finally a man comes, whose string of masons and measuring rod was in his hand, and he brings Ezekiel the prophet into the temple, and he measured the front of the temple: for which atelam, the Septuagint; and aelim Theodotius; and around Symmachus translated. And on both sides the width of the tabernacle was six cubits, containing the mystery of all creatures: for in six days the world was finished. Through the knowledge of these and the causes and conditions and the order of creation, we enter into the temple of God, and through the order and stability of created things we come to know the Creator. But the width of the gate of the temple was ten cubits, which is a sacred and perfect number, and in which, on the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, there is fasting and propitiation. But on the tenth day of the first month, which is called Nisan, the lamb is taken for sacrifice and preparation for the Passover. Therefore, in the seventh month, the tithes are offered in the storehouses of God, or, as the Scripture has accustomed to call them, the wine presses. Hence the Apostle says: Be ye enlarged also (2 Corinthians 6); so that after entering the temple through the ten cubit gates, on both sides of the gate itself, the sides, or as it is properly said in Hebrew, the shoulders are measured, which are always referred to as works. And Issachar desired good (Gen. XLIX), resting among the clergy, seeing the rest, because it is good, and the land, because it is fertile, he put his shoulder to work, and he became a man of agriculture. And in the vestment of the high priest, the ephod with the breastplate is fastened, so that the works of reason are joined, and the man can say: I have understood from your commandments (Ps. CXVIII, 104). The gatekeepers on both sides of the gate had five porches, so that through earthly and divine senses, about which we have often written their differences, we may enter the inner sanctuary of the temple, which was measured by that man, who was the prophet's guide, with a length of forty cubits, and a width of twenty cubits, or rather, the gate's length and width: because he had spoken only of the width and shoulders above. But that the number which is next to eight hundred forty makes is no doubt. Hence it is commanded in Ecclesiastes: Give portions to seven, and also to eight (Eccl. XI, 2). I am aware that there is frequent debate about the mystery of this number, whether it is because through tribulations and distresses of this world we enter into the sanctuary of the Lord: therefore the length of the gate had forty cubits, which number is always associated with labor. And so, Moses and Elijah did not eat bread or drink water for forty days (Deut. 9, 3 Kings 19, Deut. 29). And for forty years, the people of Israel are troubled and tested in the wilderness and enter the promised land through many struggles. And the Lord and Savior, according to the weakness of the assumed body, is tested for forty days in the wilderness, so that after the victory, angels approach and minister to him (Matt. 4). But when we can say in the midst of tribulations and distress, the words of the Apostle: In all things we are troubled, but not crushed (2 Cor. 4, 8), and the prophetic words: In tribulation, you have enlarged me (Psalm 4, 1), then the widest entrance is opened to us, which has a width of twenty cubits, so that having overcome the struggles and earthly things, which themselves represent duality, we may enter the inner sanctuary of the temple and hear the Lord commanding his disciples: Have confidence, I have overcome the world (John 16, 34).


<h2 id='tocuniq316'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(Vers. 3, 4.) \"And he entered inside (or into the inner court) and measured the front (or threshold) of the gate to be two cubits, and the gate to be six (or ten) cubits, and the width of the gate to be seven cubits (or, the width of the gate from one shoulder to the other being seven cubits on each side). And he measured its (or the doors') length to be twenty cubits and its width to be twenty cubits in front of the temple. And he said to me: This is the Holy of Holies.\ « Let us make progress, for greater progress always opens up for us. After entering the temple, we once again enter inside, or as the Septuagint translated, the inner courtyard, in whose front, or Ael, for which Symmachus, around the gate, Theodotus Aelam, Hebrew Ul (), Aquila door, we interpret the front, there were two cubits. So, according to the higher meaning, we enter by the dual number to that place where the Holy of Holies is located. » And the gate itself was six cubits, through which we entered and obtained eternal rest, which is demonstrated in the number seven. For this reason, the Seventy translated it, and the width of the gate was seven cubits on this side and seven cubits on that side, in Hebrew and other editions only seven cubits were placed in the width of the gate. However, what follows: And its length was measured, or as the Seventy translated it, the doors were twenty cubits, for which in most codices forty are contained according to the Seventy, it also signifies a width of twenty cubits in front of the face of the temple, that which before the face of the temple and its entrance, the measure of past labor and struggle always comes to us. For just as the number two possesses a double relationship in individual numbers, so do the decades have the same relationship. And consider this: entering inward through the gateway of two cubits in width, and having six cubits in depth, and seven cubits in width on each side, and twenty cubits in length, and the same in the very doors of the temple, let it be taught by the prophet what that place is, or by what name it is called. For he said to me: This is the Holy of Holies. But if, as Scripture calls it, it is before the temple, or before the Holy of Holies, how great a blessedness must we think there is in the innermost parts of the temple! Concerning which the prophet speaks: This is labor in my sight, until I enter into the sanctuary of God, and understand their last things (Ps. 77:16-17). But this should also be noted, that in the description of the tabernacle it is said 'Holy of Holies' in the plural number; but here 'Holy of Holies' in the singular number, so that after the holy things we come to the holy: just as after many songs we come to the Song of Songs, which is the song of all songs, and in singing it, we are joined in the embrace of the Bridegroom.


<h2 id='tocuniq317'>(Vers. 5 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 5 seqq.) And the wall of the house was measured six cubits, and the width of each side was four cubits all around the house. The sides were side by side, thirty-three on each side, and there were projections that entered through the wall of the house on the sides all around, in order to contain them and not touch the wall of the temple. And there was a ascending courtyard: going up through a spiral staircase and leading to the upper room of the temple in a circular path. Therefore, the temple was broader in the higher parts, and thus one ascended from the lower parts to the higher in the middle, and from the middle to the narrow, and to Thrael. However, what is placed in the Septuagint, 'And from the middle to the narrow,' that is, to the three balconies, and to Thrael, is not found in Hebrew. For Thrael also (which I do not know what it signifies; since it is not found in Hebrew) is read by those of Urani (), which both we and others have translated, and I have seen, so that the order of the testimony may be followed.


<h2 id='tocuniq318'>(Vers. 8 seqq.)</h2>

(Versed. 8 seqq.) 'And I saw in the house a height all around, with foundations of reed measuring six cubits, and the width along the outer wall of the side chamber, five cubits. And the inner part of the house and the space between the storehouses, twenty cubits wide all around the house. And there were doors in the side chambers toward the outer court, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south. And the width of the place for worship, five cubits all around.' And the building, which was separate and facing the road towards the sea, was seventy cubits wide. The wall of the building was five cubits wide all around, and its length was ninety cubits. After he reached the Holy of Holies, of which we spoke earlier, that venerable man measured the wall of the Holy of Holies. It had a height of six cubits because of the structure of the world and all visible creation, which was created in six days, and a width of one side of four cubits, not on one side only, but all around. But the width of the house, measured around, was four cubits, to represent the four elements from which all things are composed, especially human bodies. Against these, the holy ones fight and subject themselves to the power of the soul, so that they may deserve to enter the inner regions and know the secrets of the Lord. The sides of the house, which were around it and were separated from the walls of the temple by a space of four cubits, were joined together. So that one side touched another side, and it had a length not of thirty-three cubits, but of sixty-six, that is, sixty-six. In the book of Leviticus, it is said that after one week in the birth of a male child, the mother and the child must wait for thirty-three days in order to undergo purification (Lev. XII). However, if the child is female, the waiting period is doubled to sixty-six days. And because, in order to enter the holy of holies, we need not only the first birth, but also the second, to be born in the flesh and be reborn in the spirit: therefore, the number is not sixty-six, but twice thirty and three, so that both births are owed to God the creator and his mercy, and the two sides of the house that support the structure of the temple are enclosed by a double wall. And what follows according to the Hebrew: 'And there were certain heights that would go out through the wall of the house on the sides all around, to contain, and not touch the wall of the temple,' signifies this: that holy men, amidst the multitude of believers, burst forth through the wall of the temple, through all the sides all around, and uphold the foundations of the Church, and yet do not touch the wall of the temple: content with having seen only, and from afar, worship the indescribable mysteries. Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity. (1 Corinthians 13:12-13) But through the circular and spiral ascent we reach the upper room of the temple, which, among all shapes, is also approved by philosophers of this age as the most beautiful: for both the sky, the sun, the moon, and the other stars, and the earth, in human bodies as well, the eyes are like other stars, and the shape of the head, which is the receptacle of all the senses, and the rounded fingers, and women, and arms, exhibit this roundness. Moreover, I think that the upper room of the temple, which we ascend from the lower to the higher, is the same one that Elijah and Elisha had, as mentioned in the book of Kings, and also Tabitha had it in the Acts of the Apostles, which means 'the gazelle' in Greek, and our damsel who had reached the highest through good works (3 Kings 17; 4 Kings 4; Acts 9; Acts 10). But the Apostle Peter, on whom the Lord established the foundations of the Church, surpasses the upper room and comes to the roof, which is more significantly called 'dorma' in Greek, that is, the solarium of the roof, and he came to know the mysteries of the Church, previously unknown to the world. The Savior also made the Pasch in the upper room, and in a large and wide upper room, and after all impurity had been cleansed and the bed prepared, and the spiritual feast prepared, where he delivered the mystery of his body and blood to his disciples, and left to us the eternal celebration of the immaculate Lamb. And he added: And from the middle to the saddest, that is, the third upper room and Thrael, it seems to me that it should be marked with a note. For why do we need to discuss doubtful and unwritten things when we should devote ourselves to the books held by the Hebrews? It follows: 'And I saw in the house a height encompassed by sides, measured by a reed, a space of six cubits; and a width by the outer wall of the side of five cubits; and between the treasuries' (which Symmachus calls 'exedrae') 'a width of twenty cubits around the house.' By these measurements it is shown that we are deserving of ascending not only into the Holy of Holies, but also into their upper room, and that we should always remember that through the six days of our earthly condition, and through the five senses, and through the twenty cubits of width, we ascend to the upper room of the temple, leaving behind earthly humility and the sense of the letter, and we pass over to the summit of the Church, and rejoice in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.' And the entrance, he says, of the side toward the north (Jer. 1:14), from which evil spreads over all the earth, and which the Lord promises to drive away from us, saying: 'And I will drive away from you him who is from the north' (Joel 2:20). And it is a beautiful place for prayer at the entrance opposite the north, so that, according to the Apostle, we may pray without ceasing (1 Thess. 5), and say with Jeremiah: 'Let not the apple of my eye be silent' (Lam. 2:18), whether we desire to avoid present evils or give thanks for the past. For as long as we are in the tent of this body, we groan and say: Wretched me, who will set me free from this body of death? (Rom. VII, 24). But there was also a door to the South, which had a place of prayer nearby according to the Hebrew custom, and it extended five cubits around. For after the cold of the North, we pass through the heat of the South, and yet we still seek a place for prayer, in the door of the North, in order to escape dangers; in the South, to give thanks for the past and to have a secure possession of victory. But five cubits, and in this place they indicate divine senses, through which we ascend from earthly things to higher things. And the building, he says, which was separated and turned toward the road facing the sea, was seventy cubits wide: so that after labors and dangers, and the waves and shipwrecks of this world, and seventy years, of which Jeremiah, Daniel, and Zechariah write (Jer. 25 and 29; Dan. 9, Zech. 9); but also the legitimate sabbath of seven decades we may attain: so that we may have eternal rest, and through the width of five cubits we may come to a length of ninety cubits: in which age Sarah gave birth to a son according to the promise, who, at the age of ninety, that is, at the end of nine decades, was born to Abraham, who was one hundred years old (Gen. 21), that is, having the mystery of ten decades. The following Scripture will show what the number signifies.

(Verses 13 and following) And the house was measured in length a hundred cubits. And the separate building, and its walls, were also a hundred cubits in length. The width before the face of the house, and that which was separate against the East, was a hundred cubits. And the length of the building over against the face thereof, which was separated at the back, was also a hundred cubits. And there were chambers exceeding in height on either side a hundred cubits; and the inner temple, and the porches of the court. Doorways and slanted windows were set outward, in a perimeter on three sides against the threshold of each, and a wooden floor went all the way around. And the earth was up to the windows: and the windows were closed. Above the doors, and up to the inner house; and on the outside, through every wall on the inside; and on the outside, to the measurement. And cherubs and palm trees were carved: and a palm tree was between cherub and cherub: and each cherub had two faces: the face of a man next to the palm tree on one side, and the face of a lion next to the palm tree on the other side; carved throughout the whole house on the inside. From the ground up to the upper gates, there were carved cherubim and palm trees on the wall of the temple. The threshold was square. The sanctuary faced the shape of the wooden altar, its height being three cubits. Its length was two cubits. Its corners, length, and walls were all made of wood. Seventy: It measured against the length of the house, one hundred cubits. And the remaining and separating walls, in the length of one hundred cubits. And the width against the face of the temple, and the remaining opposite one hundred cubits. And he measured the length of the separating wall facing the back of the house, and the remaining width of one hundred cubits. And the temple and the corners, and the outer Aelam covered with wood, and three windows made like a net, for light to shine through, that one could look through them. And the house and the adjacent structures, all covered with wood around. And the floor, and from the floor to the windows. And the windows were opened threefold, so that one could look through them: both into the inner and outer house, and through every wall around inside and outside the measurement, and carved cherubim, and palm trees between cherub and cherub. Two faces of cherub: the face of a man towards the palm tree on one side, and the face of a lion towards the palm tree on the other side: the entire wall was carved all around from the floor to the rafters with cherubim and carved palm trees. And the sanctuary and the temple were opened on four corners towards the face of the saints: a vision as if the appearance of a wooden altar: its height being three cubits, and its length two cubits: and its width two cubits: and it had horns, and its bases and walls were wooden.» The word 'contra', which the LXX translated at the beginning of the testimony, where it is written: 'And he measured against the house', is not found in Hebrew, and therefore it must be marked with an obelus, in order for it to be correct and true, and he measured the house with a length of one hundred cubits, and so on. The Holy of Holies and the inner sanctuary are described, which is said to have a perfect number of ten decades, after ninety cubits, with three sides having one hundred cubits each: so that we may serve the Lord with our mind, speech, and deeds, remembering that Apostolic example in which it is said: 'That we may know the breadth, and length, and depth, and height' (Ephesians 3:18). But what is said in Hebrew, the separate structure and its walls, the Septuagint translates as separating and not clinging to the walls of the temple, but having their own nearby walls. The temple itself, as well as its corners and the porch or entrance hall (propylon), were covered with wood, a symbol of wisdom, as the Scripture records the tree of life being located in paradise (Gen. II). The windows were made in the form of a net, similar to lattice screens, so that they were not covered with stone or glass, but with wooden lattices woven with twists and turns. In Hebrew, they have diagonal windows, which were only present in three parts of the temple: on the right, on the left, and at the back, that is, to the South, North, and West. The eastern part, however, did not have windows because the entrance itself let in bright light from within, and all the interior of the temple was filled with the light of the doors, so that someone could look inside through each window and opening. And not only were the exterior areas covered with wood, but there was such an abundance of wood all around that the floor and everything up to the windows were connected with wood. The windows were opened in three ways according to the Seventy, so that when they were opened, a triple understanding of God's temple would be revealed, according to what is said elsewhere: 'But you, write down these things in three ways' (Prov. 22:20). And through them, both the interior and the exterior are seen: so that we may know the invisible things that are within, and the visible things that are without; so that one thing may show the mind, another the flesh, another the spiritual understanding, and another the simple historical account; and through all the surrounding walls, internally and externally, their measurements were consistent. For nothing is done in the temple of God without reason and measure, especially in the holy of holies made by God. The Cherubim were also carved, no doubt in wood, extending from the floor to the windows, and the carvings were so finely made that they appeared not sculpted, but applied. Cherubim are interpreted as a multitude of knowledge. Therefore, within the innermost part of the temple, after the multitude of knowledge, there are carvings and palm trees, in which the sign of victory is, as the Apostle says: But I press on to the goal for the prize of the heavenly call of God, in Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:14). Which palms were between the Cherub and the Cherub, so that one Cherub was surrounded on both sides by two palms: which Cherub did not, as we read at the beginning of this prophet, have four faces, namely, of a man, a lion, a calf, and an eagle; but only two, that is, of a man and a lion, of which the first pertains to reason, and the second to fury, which is more significantly called θυμὸς in Greek. By fury, however, we mean not that which is close to disturbance and vice, but that which consolidates the softness of the mind and makes the soul of the combatant stronger. For in the beginning, we are subject to concupiscence, which pertains to the earthly works; and some are carnal, others are spiritual, of which the ultimate is attributed to eagles. But when we enter the innermost sanctuary, and possess the inner parts of the temple, we have no need for anything else except reason and strength, of which one pertains to perception and prudence, the other to the perseverance of the soul. Therefore, every wall around the temple, from the floor to the ceiling, had Cherubim and palms skillfully carved: after which the sanctuary and the temple were opened from the four corners opposite the faces of the holy ones. First, we have a multitude of knowledge, through which we achieve victory over the enemy, and then a sanctuary and temple are opened to us, which has four angles, and a very strong position, and which is inclined in no direction. For it has the nature of a square measure, so that it may stand on a stable base, and it possesses, in a mystical number that is clear to the wise reader, four elements from which all things consist, solid and everlasting. And they looked at everything opposite the face of the sanctuary: before which was the sanctuary, or in which was the image of the wooden altar three cubits high, and two cubits long, and two cubits wide, which together make seven cubits. This altar had horns; and both its bases and its walls, that is, its sides, were made of wood, in which the holy Scriptures mysteries, human speech cannot explain: how the altar, in which the fire was to be kindled, namely the incense offering, should suffer nothing from the fire, but, so to speak, becomes more pure through the fire. For just as the works of the saints, of which the Apostle writes, 'The work of each will be made manifest; for the Day will disclose it' (1 Corinthians 3:13), do not perish, but are made even more pure through fire, so too the wood of the altar, which is from the trees of paradise, is not consumed by nearby fire, but is made even more pure. It is not surprising to believe this about the sanctuary and the inner parts of the temple and the altar of incense, since even linen, which is a type of flax, or something with a similar appearance to linen, is found to be cleaner the more it is burned. Forgive, reader, the difficulty, and grant pardon to the impoverished understanding. For through slanted and net-like windows, which are always closed, we can barely allow our eye to enter into the inner chamber of our heart, so that all that we see, we see in shadow and in image, and with the Apostle, we cry out: O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are his judgments, and how unsearchable his ways (Rom. XI, 13)! And: Who has known the mind of God (Isaiah XL, 13), except the one who is the angel of great counsel, and who has the power to reveal worthy mysteries? And in Rome, they call the projections on the walls of dining rooms 'solaria,' or 'Meniana' from the one who first invented them, which some Greeks call 'exōstras.'

<h2 id='tocuniq319'>(Vers. 23 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 23 seqq.) And he spoke to me: This is the table before the Lord, and there were two doors in the temple and in the sanctuary, and in the two doors on each side there were two little doors that folded into each other. For there were two doors on each side of the doors, and on the doors of the temple there were carved cherubim and palm tree sculptures, just as they were also engraved on the walls. Therefore, the wood in the front of the vestibule was thicker: on top of which there were slanting windows, and the appearance of palm trees on both sides of the shoulders of the vestibule, according to the width of the house and the thickness of the walls. In this place, the Septuagint edition differs greatly from the Hebrew truth. Therefore, I will only mention that they have translated 'σπουδαῖα' as 'crassioribus lignis', which means necessary or worthy of attention, and 'absconditas' as 'oblique fenestras' or hidden windows. And at the end of the testimony, they have measured the 'laquearia superliminaris' or vestibule, as well as the 'conjuncta' or joined sides of the house, which they have called 'ἐζυγωμένα', and for which we can translate as equal weight. Therefore, that man who had brought the prophet into the hidden part of the temple and had shown him, among other things, the wooden altar which had both corners and horns according to the Septuagint, and wooden walls, said to him: This altar that you see, it is the table in front of the Lord, which burns in the likeness of a ruby and is not consumed; of which the holy one speaks to God: You have prepared a table before me, against those who trouble me (Ps. 22:5). There were also two doors in the temple and in the sanctuary itself, through which the sacraments of both instruments are revealed, and in the two doors on each side there were two little doors, which folded into each other: so that in history you may have spiritual understanding, and in the tropology the truth of history, both of which need each other, and if one is lacking, knowledge is incomplete. But what follows, 'There were two doors on each side of the doors,' is clear according to the letter. For in the larger dining rooms, it is customary for two to adhere and join together: so that the larger entrance is not closed or opened by two large doors, but by four smaller ones. In these doorways of the temple, or the holy of holies, there were carved Cherubs, of which we have mentioned above, and sculptures of palm trees, so that after a multitude of knowledge, victory would be provided to those entering. These sculptures of palm trees were also on all the walls of the temple. And the reasons why the Cherubim were carved on the doors themselves and the images of palm trees were depicted. Also, why the wood on the outer gate vestibule was thicker: so that they would have strength and could receive the carved work. Furthermore, according to spiritual understanding, the doors are more firm and carved, so that they possess both strength and beauty, so that no one like Uzziah can break into the Holy of Holies and claim priesthood for himself (2 Chronicles 26). Moreover, the gates which were windows were oblique, or concealed, so that the very light which was provided from within did not have perfect knowledge, nor clear light and open to all: but for the most part it was concealed. For now we see in an enigma (I Cor. XIII, 12); and we do not yet know as we ought to know: but when that which is perfect has come, then that which was in part, will be destroyed. And there was a likeness of palms here and there. In the interior of the Temple and in the Holy of Holies, he did not place the right hand and the left, so that he would not seem to say anything negative about things that are great and mysterious; but rather on this side and on that side, according to what is written in the Gospel: 'If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also' (Matthew 5:39). Could he not have said, 'and the left'? But when the right is struck, the other right is offered, because in a holy man, both the right and the left are perfect. And in the corners of the vestibule on the sides of the house, and the width of the walls: for which seventy were carried to the vaults of Aelus, that is, the porch, and the sides of the house, of equal weight or measure: through which it is covertly shown that the doorposts of the vestibule (for these seem to signify the corners) and the sides of the house, and the width of the walls, are all full of reason and measure, and that nothing is found in the temple of the Lord that is without order and wisdom.


<h2 id='tocuniq320'>Book Thirteen</h2>

Book Thirteen.

The thirteenth book of Explanations on Ezekiel is the second book of the exposition on the temple, which I, with the help of our Savior, desire to dictate until the end, hence singing that same number along with David in the fourteenth psalm: O Lord, who shall dwell in your tabernacle? Or who shall rest on your holy mountain? (Psalm 14:1) This we must understand as difficult and even impossible. Therefore, in another place, he earnestly implores as a man of desires and says: One thing I have asked from the Lord, this is what I shall seek: That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life; that I may see the delight of the Lord, and visit his holy temple. (Psalm 26:4, 5). And again: How beloved are your tabernacles, O Lord of hosts: my soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord (Psalm 83:1). I anticipate the curses of rivals who consider not what they themselves are capable of, but what I am not capable of. And when they judge our actions, they do not offer their own actions to be judged: never fighting in the arena, but judging those who fight with a leisurely, even arrogant spirit. It is easy to dictate to the people and to criticize each blow individually, and to laugh at the blood of others, and to discuss like inexperienced trainers where a wound should be inflicted. In my explanation of Ezekiel's temple, and the other things that pertain to the end of that book, I confess that I am writing nothing worthy of the subject's magnitude, and in a few words, if I deserve to receive any, I give thanks to the Savior. For it is written: Unless you believe, you will not understand (Isaiah 6). And in another place: If you have faith like a mustard seed, and say to this mountain, move from here to there, it will be done (Matthew 17:19). And how does the Apostle mention that the grain of mustard seed is not a small portion of faith, but is the whole of faith, saying, 'And if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains' (1 Corinthians 13:2)? Therefore, this grain of mustard seed, even if it is small, grows into a great tree, and the birds of the air make their nests in its branches (Luke 13). Therefore, to you, daughter Eustochium, who willingly accept whatever our circumstances may be, I desire to make this known, and I briefly remind you of that of the rhetorician Victorinus, so that you may know that obscurity in volumes comes from three things: either from the greatness of the subject, or from the ignorance of the teacher, or from the hardness of the listener. I will readily confess the first and second in this work; the third, however, your keen intellect and desire for Scripture easily reject. You possess God as a constant guest, not only due to your virginity and self-discipline, but also I will say, without frequency but with constancy. Therefore, let us proceed to the thirteenth book in the Book of Ezekiel, whose beginning is this:

<h2 id='tocuniq321'>(Chap. XLII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

Chapter XLII, verses 1 and following: 'And he brought me to the outer court by the way leading to the north, and he brought me to the treasury which was opposite the separated building and opposite the temple facing the north. On the face of the length of one hundred cubits of the north gate, and the breadth of fifty cubits, opposite the twenty cubits of the inner court, and opposite the pavement laid with stone of the outer court, where the porch was joined to the triple porch.' And before the treasury, there was a walkway ten cubits wide, looking inward, with the doors facing north, where the treasuries were lower on the upper levels because the porticoes that protruded from the lower and middle parts of the building supported them. These porticoes were narrow and did not have columns like the columns of the courtyards, so they protruded from the lower and middle parts of the building by fifty cubits. And there was an outer courtyard by the treasury, which was in the way of the outer court before the treasury: the length of it was fifty cubits. Because the length of the treasuries of the outer court was fifty cubits and the length before the face of the temple was one hundred cubits. And there was an entrance under these treasuries from the east for those who entered from the outer court: in the width of the courtyard of the eastern way before the separate building. And there were before the building treasuries, and a road in front of their face like the treasuries, which were on the northern side, according to their length, and thus their width. And every entrance of them, and their similarities, and their doors, according to the doors of the treasuries, which were on the road facing the South (Known), a door at the head of the road, which was in front of the separate vestibule through the Eastern road for those entering. LXX: And he brought me into the outer court towards the east, opposite the north gate; and he led me to the inner court, and behold, there were five chambers on the north side of the building, and a separate building adjoining the north side, one hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide, with the same measurements as the gates of the inner court, and like the pillars of the outer court, according to the arrangement of the gateways of the three-sided portico, and opposite the chambers was a walkway ten cubits wide, one hundred cubits long, along the inner way of one cubit, with its entrance facing north. And the walkways of the upper rooms were similar, as the columns of the upper rooms stood out from the lower columns, and the space was similar. And there were triple porticoes, and they did not have columns like the columns on the outer side; therefore, they stood out from those that were lower, and in the middle of the ground fifty cubits, and the outer light was like the outer courtyard porticoes, which faced the porticoes of the north, with a length of fifty cubits. The length of the porticos facing the outer courtyard was fifty cubits. And these are opposite their own facade, all one hundred cubits, and the entrance of these porticos is towards the Eastern entrance, so one may enter through them into the outer courtyard, according to the light that was at the beginning of the walkway to the South, opposite the Southern side of the building, and separate. And the porticos and walkway are opposite their own facade, according to the measurements of the porticos and the way to the North, and their length, and their width, and all their exits, and entrances, and lights, and the entrance to the porticos towards the South, and the entrance from the beginning of the walkway to the light, the space of the reed pen: and so one may go towards the East through them. That which is translated into the East in the LXX is not found in the Hebrew, and it is clear that it is superfluous. For how is it brought out to the outer gate toward the East, when it follows against the gate of the North? That which we have also put above, and in this place: He brought me into the treasury, which will be opposite the separate building, and opposite the temple facing the North, for which it is held in the LXX: And he brought me: and behold, there are five chambers from the remaining building and next to the separate building toward the North: for separate, which Aquila and Symmachus translated, the second edition of Aquila, and Theodotion placed this word itself, Gazera (), expressing it similarly in all places: and many other things which are placed in the present passage between the Hebrew and the LXX not only differ in order, but also in number, and in the interpretation of words, so that if we wished to linger on each one, and seek and explain their reason for the diversity, we would depart greatly from the proposed subject. And I had wanted to pass over in silence my present testimony of final despair and greatness, but I thought it better to say anything than to say nothing at all, adopting that Socratic principle: I know that I do not know. For it is a part of knowledge to know that you do not know. Therefore, after the prophet had carefully observed the things that were inside, the man, whose rope and reed were in his hand, led him out to the outer courtyard, along the path leading to the North, which he had already seen from above before he entered the inner chambers. But we see things differently when it comes to perfect knowledge, compared to the beginning of discipline. And it is necessary for one who has looked into the inner workings, according to the same form and measures and hidden sacraments, to also see the external things. However, he was led into the treasury, or as the Septuagint translated it, the hall, or as Theodotion, the παστοφόριον, which is turned into a chamber: which was located opposite the separate building. But what the Seventy added for the treasury, five exedras, is not found in Hebrew. The treasury was a separate building, as we have already said. Gazera. And it was separate, receiving those who came from the North, and it was against the temple facing the North, that is, looking towards the parts of the North, but not located in the North, so that there would be an easier passage for those who were leaving the cold of the North, from which evils arise upon the earth (Jer. 1). We read in the book of Numbers that the tribes of Dan and Naphtali, and the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, the maidservants of Rachel and Leah, held their camps in the northern regions. Moreover, the width of the entrance to the north was one hundred cubits, and the length was fifty cubits: a square number and perfect from ten decades, and from seven weeks, which is the number of remission, and at the beginning of unity, that is, the octave, it bursts forth, so that the spaces of the priestly duties in the temple of God may be shown. And that which is joined next to the Hebrew, opposite the twenty cubits of the inner court, which the Seventy have translated, was described like the gates of the inner court, has this meaning: that the number of a hundred and fifty in the outer court should have the same force as the number of twenty in the inner court. For if you reckon four times five times, in the number twenty, you will find both Testaments: so that both the Law may be held in the Gospel and the Gospel may be born from the root of the Law. For the number seventy, the likeness of the inner court, may have been interpreted, perhaps fearing the number twenty, in which offerings of Esau are made, to place in the inner court. It follows: And against the pavement, the floor of the outer court, where there was a porch, joined to the triple porch; for which seventy were transferred: And as the columns of the outer court were placed in order, opposite the face of the triple porches. However, it signifies that the pavement of the outer court was laid with living stone, so that the feet of the priests are not defiled by the dust of summer or the mud of winter. And so, the Lord, about to ascend to the Father, washes the feet of the Apostles (John 13), so that with purified and cleansed feet they may ascend to the kingdoms of heaven; and he commands the apostles that in whichever city they enter and are not received, they should shake off the dust from their feet (Matthew 10; and Mark 6): so that nothing of earthly possessions may remain with them. And not only was the pavement covered with stones, but there was also a portico joined to a triple portico. A portico protecting priests from rain and heat, and joined to the triple portico, showing the mystery of the Trinity, which, while being divided in names among the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, is yet joined in one divinity to itself. There was also before the treasury, or the halls, or the chambers, a walkway of ten cubits in width, looking towards the interior of the road of one cubit. And what was added by the Seventy: It is extra to have a length of one hundred cubits: for in the Hebrew it is not held, what they set forth, they took what is held in Hebrew, looking towards the interior of the road of one cubit, which we translated from the truth of Hebrew. But it signifies that before the doors of all the treasuries, or exedrae, and chambers, there was a walkway, having a width of ten cubits, which is a perfect number, either because of the Decalogue or because of the mystery of the Gospel. For if you come from one to four by twos and threes, the number ten is made, the number of the Gospels: in the width of which the priests walk, going before each treasury. But in such a way that they always look towards the interior of the path which leads to one cubit, that is, to the worship of one divinity, as the Son says to the Father: I have revealed thy name to men (John 17:6). For she is the way, looking inward, which is said in the Gospel: I am the way, and the truth, and the life (John XIV, 6): because no one comes to the knowledge of the Father, except through the Son. It follows: And their doors to the north, where the treasuries were in the lower and middle parts: because the porticoes which stood out from the lower and middle parts of the building supported them. For they were narrow, and did not have columns like the columns of the courts: therefore they stood out from the lower and middle parts by fifty cubits from the ground. What is joined: the doors of these, it is understood, (belong to) the exedrae or treasury rooms, about which there was discussion above. The treasuries were on the upper floors, that is, in the lower rooms. The upper rooms were ascended by Elijah and Elisha (1 Kings 17; 2 Kings 4); and the Lord, with the disciples, celebrated the Passover (Mark 14), and Tabitha, who was raised by the Apostle's faith and the merit of her virtues (Acts 9). These are the upper rooms, about which it is written in the psalm: He waters the mountains from his upper rooms (Psalm 104, 13). For unless a mountain is made, and rises to higher things, it will not be irrigated by the rains of the Lord, which for the diversity of merits are irrigated in the first, second, and third coenaculum. Even the storerooms themselves, that is, the treasuries of the Lord's treasures, are lower in the higher places. (Ephesians 3). However, the higher one is, the more one is humbled with the Apostle, saying: I am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God. (1 Corinthians 1:9). However, the treasure rooms themselves were located in the lower rooms, because they supported the porticoes that projected from the lower and middle parts of the building. And the reason why the treasure rooms were placed in the lower rooms and were lower was this: because the porticoes, which enjoyed the freedom of the air, supported and projected from the lower and middle parts of the building. In this way, the second floor of the building would be higher than the first floor, and the third floor would be higher than the second, so that as one ascended to higher levels, they would use a higher treasure room, which increased in humility, as the Lord says: 'If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all.' (Mark 9:35). For they were not carried by other columns, as we read in the columns of the atrium; but they protruded from the lower and middle parts of the ground by fifty cubits, as a sign of the remission of all debts. These, however, are the sad things of which it is commanded: Describe them in triple form, with counsel and knowledge, so that you may answer with words of truth those things that are proposed to you (Prov. 22:20-21). Therefore, the lower and outer parts need columns, but the higher and inner parts do not need the support of columns, that is, of external help. After this it is said: And the outer court was surrounded by a wall, with treasuries along the outside walls. The length of this outer court was fifty cubits, because the length of the treasuries of the outer court was fifty cubits, and the length before the front of the temple was one hundred cubits. The surrounding wall, called the peribolus, enclosed the treasuries along the outside walls of the outer court, and it was fifty cubits in length, as we have frequently mentioned. Moreover, the length in front of the face of the temple was not fifty cubits, as it was before the treasury, but one hundred cubits: so that after the remission of all sins, we may await perfect rewards in the number one hundred (Lev. XII). Regarding the barrier, or wall, which in Hebrew is called Gader (), the Seventy have interpreted it as light, which comes from outside and illuminates the eyes of our hearts: our natural light, which operates in the senses, is not sufficient to have the perfect brightness of knowledge, unless it enters from outside through the grace of God. What first illuminates the eyes of our heart, and the outer atrium, which extends to a width of fifty cubits, makes it shine. Then, when we come before the face of the temple, we shall receive perfect rewards in the number of one hundred. And below, there was an entrance to the treasury from the East for those entering from the outer atrium. For it is necessary for us to possess the riches of God, and to find the entrance below the treasury from the outer atrium, under the treasury of the East, and to come through the width of the vestibule, which faces the way of the East, to the building that is separated for the holy ones, before which are the treasuries, and in that very way, a likeness to the treasuries that were in the way of the North. For although we may reach the entrance to the East, the resemblance of the ancestors is found in the smaller things, and we cannot reach the light of the East except by way of the North, that is, by progressing from the smaller and lower things to the greater and higher things. In the very entrance itself, the length was similar to the width, that is, the same measurement throughout: every entrance and likeness, and doors had the same measurement and likeness as the treasure chambers that were on the road facing the South. For indeed, by the East the cold of the North is resisted, we reach the South, in which the bridegroom reclines at midday, and moves in full light. At the head, however, of the same road, that is, the Eastern one, which is open to those who enter, there is a door, which unless it is opened by Him who says: I am the door (John 10:9) and who has the key of David, to the vestibule separated by holy virtues, and which receives those coming from the North, we cannot reach. It is unnecessary to discuss each individual word of this passage in detail: both what has been said does not lack clarity, and what we keep silent about is almost similar to what we have said.

<h2 id='tocuniq322'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verse 13, 14.) And he said to me: The treasuries of the North and the treasuries of the South, which are before the separated building, these are the holy treasuries in which the priests who approach the Lord in the Most Holy Place eat. There they shall put the Most Holy Place, and the offering for sin and for guilt. For it is a holy place. But when the priests enter, they shall not go out from the holy place to the outer court, and there they shall put on their garments in which they minister, for they are holy. And they shall put on other garments and then go out to the people. That man, who was a leader and prophet, after he led him into the outer courtyard and showed him all that the previous conversation had mentioned, also the treasuries and the rooms in which he stayed for a long time, said to him: These are the treasuries, or rooms, and chambers to the north and south, which are in front of the separate building, and are called the holy treasuries, in which the priests who approach the Lord in the holy of holies partake. From these things we learn that there are many diversities in foods, which are allowed or not allowed for priests to eat, and of those very things that are allowed to be taken as food, they are not taken in all places, nor by all people, nor at all times. I think that the Gazophylacia Aquilonis Austri is, either those things that contain the simplicity of history, or the sacraments of spiritual understanding, so that through Aquilon we may come to the South. For the letter should not be read in such a way, and the foundations of history should be laid, so that we may not come to the heights; and the roof of the most beautiful building should not be placed in such a way that the foundations are not solid. But the priests who live in the cellars, in which many riches are contained, are the ones who approach the Lord: Scripture testifies of them (Exodus 24) that Moses approached the Lord, and the others could not come near. In the building of the mystical temple, and in the sacrament of the Church, there are many priests and apostolic men who approach the Lord, and not in any place, but in the holy of holies. And as it is said in the Septuagint: Sons of Zadok, which means just, is not found in Hebrew. There, he says, the priests shall place the holy of holies, and the offering, that is, the burnt offering, and for sin, and for ignorance: so that they may not only offer a perpetual sacrifice, but also, due to the diversity of times and the quality of sin and ignorance, know how to appease the Lord, because the place itself is holy and the priestly dignity dwells in it, which can intercede for others. But when it is necessary to proceed to those who cannot penetrate the inner depths of the temple, nor understand the secrets of divine knowledge, let the priests go outside to them into the outer courtyard. Absolutely not clothed in the garments with which they were clothed internally, namely the viscera of mercy and the Lord Savior, of whom it is written: Put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. XIII, 14); nor should they use these words, about which God speaks: My mystery is for me and for my own; lest they fall into that which the Savior prohibits, saying: Do not give holy things to dogs, nor cast pearls before swine (Matth. VII, 6). But they shall lay aside their garments, with which they are clothed, when they minister in the inner part of the temple; for they are holy, and should not be brought out to those who do not have perfect holiness: and they shall put on other garments, and thus they shall come to the people. Thus, he says, they shall speak to the people, in a way that the people can hear. And so the Apostle spoke to the Corinthians, among whom fornication was heard, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles: I have given you milk to drink, not solid food: for you were not yet able to receive it. To them again he says: My little children, for whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you (Gal. IV, 19). For to little ones and babes solid food is not only useless, but kills those who are suited to perfect age. Moreover, that which is added in the Septuagint: Therefore the priests shall not go out of the outer court, that those who offer may always be holy, let us remark, is not found in Hebrew.


<h2 id='tocuniq323'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 onwards) When he had finished measuring the interior dimensions of the house, he led me along the way of the gate that faced east, and he measured it all around. (He measured the likeness of the house all around in order.) He measured the east side with the measuring rod; it was 500 rods long by the measuring rod all around. (He also measured the north side, south side, and west side.) And he measured against the north wind, five hundred cubits, measuring with a cubit in circumference. And he measured against the south wind, five hundred cubits, measuring with a cubit in circumference. And he measured against the west wind, five hundred cubits, measuring with a cubit. He measured on all four sides, the wall surrounding it, with a length of five hundred cubits and a width of five hundred cubits, dividing between the sanctuary and the common area. It should be known that after the East and North wind, the South and West wind has a reversed order among the Seventy. For they first set the West, that is the sea; and then the South, whereas among the Hebrews the South wind is first, and then the West. And what the Scripture now says: 'And when he had finished measuring the interior of the house, he led me through the gate that faces toward the East, and showed me all that has been mentioned, both inside and out, and the inner parts of the temple, that is, the Most Holy Place, properly belong to the building of the temple and the inner temple.' Now it follows: He led me through the gate, which looked towards the Eastern road, and measured it all around, like the likeness of a house. By this it is shown that it is not the house itself, but the likeness of the house that is seen: for now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then I shall know even as I am known (I Cor. XIII). Therefore, even Moses in the tabernacle, and Solomon in the building, made not the true tent of the temple, but the likeness and figure of it: that by these things which are lesser and earthly, we may understand those things which are heavenly, and in the spiritual building. But the man who had brought the prophet, went not into the outer courtyard, but through the gate which looked towards the eastern way, first measuring against the eastern wind, that is, the eastern quarter, five hundred reeds round about; second, towards the north; thirdly, towards the south; fourthly, towards the sea, that is, towards the west, on the four sides, a wall all around, as much in length as in breadth, that is, square, which wall had together with it two thousand reeds. But if the reed was six cubits long, and the wrestler one-sixth of a cubit, it is clear that the outer wall had a circumference of 2,000 reeds, which makes 12,333 cubits and a third of two thousand. Let the wise and diligent reader read the book of Joshua and he will find how this measure is preserved in the suburbs. Therefore, even the legion of demons chose this number in the suffocation of the pigs (Luke 8), so that he who was separated from the servants of God by the command of the Lord may be led to his own destruction, to the ruin of those who lead a life worthy of filth and squalor. But every exterior wall, which has a very spacious length and width in the form of a square, contains the number of the apostles, that is, twelve thousand: so that a thousand number is assigned to each apostle, and yet it does not reach the measure of the fullness of Christ and the perfect man, unless it is joined by the παλαιστὴ, which is three hundred and thirty-three cubits, and a third part of a cubit: through which the mystery of the holy and venerable Trinity is demonstrated, which encircles and protects everything, and provides the safest dwelling for the inhabitants of its temple. Where the ark of Noah has a length of three hundred cubits, and a height of thirty cubits, which is completed in one cubit (Gen. 5). But the fifty cubits that are added there in width signify the sacrament of remission (as we have often said). Hence the Lord came to baptism at the age of thirty, and this very prophet puts the thirtieth year at the beginning of his book: which is completed by adding three hundred and thirtieth, and the thirtieth number and a third part. However, in regard to the simplicity of the interpretation, while we pay little attention to the speed of dictation, both the Septuagint and our translation have its wall on all sides, with a length of five hundred cubits and a width of five hundred cubits. The Hebrew text, however, does not include the word 'wall', but simply the length of five hundred and the width of five hundred, with the understanding of 'reeds'. As mentioned earlier, towards the east wind, and towards the north, and towards the south, and towards the sea, the wall of each section was measured by the person holding the reed. But the number five hundred, which is close to fifty, concerning the remission of all sins, is indicated not only in the old Scripture (Lev. XXV), but also in the words of the Savior in the Gospel, saying: There were two debtors to a certain creditor: one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty (Luke VII, 41). And the wall divides between the sanctuary and the place of the common people. From this we understand that all the description above the temple, the priests, who are the sons of Zadok, were delegated to ministries. But this wall, which stretches over such a large space and surrounds everything, separates the sanctuary from the common area.

<h2 id='tocuniq324'>(Chap. XLIII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 43, verses 1 onwards) \"And he brought me to the gate that faced east. And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. And the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with his majesty. And I saw a vision like the vision that I had seen when he came to destroy the city. And the vision that I saw was like the vision that I had seen by the river Chebar. And I fell on my face.\ And the majesty of the Lord entered the temple through the gate facing east. And the spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house. And I heard someone speaking to me from the house. And the man standing beside me said to me, 'Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Israel forever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, they and their kings, by their whoring and by the dead bodies of their kings at their high places, by setting their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them. They have defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed, so I have consumed them in my anger.' So now they shall put far from themselves their fornication and the ruins of their kings from me, and I will dwell in their midst forever. LXX: And he brought me to the gate, which looked toward the East, and he led me out; and behold the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the East, and the voice of the camp was like the voice of many waters, and the earth shone with the brightness of the glory on every side. And the vision that I saw was like the vision that I saw when I entered to anoint the city. And the vision of the chariot that I saw was like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar, and I fell on my face. And the glory of the Lord entered the house through the way of the gate that faced east. And the spirit took hold of me and brought me into the inner court, and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house. And I stood, and behold, a voice from the house speaking to me, and a man stood beside me and said to me: Have you seen, son of man, the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where my name shall dwell in the midst of the house of Israel forever. And they shall no longer defile the house of Israel with their idols and with their detestable things and with all their transgressions, but I will save them from all the backslidings in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. » First, about the variety of translation, it must be said that what the Septuagint put: 'And he led me out' is not found in the Hebrew. For if he had been led to the gate facing East, why was it necessary for him to be led out, since he was brought in to see what was being done at the Eastern gate? Then, where it is said: 'The voice was to him,' no doubt it is a voice of God, like the sound of many waters, which John also confirms in his Apocalypse, the Septuagint put: 'And the voice of the camp, like the voice of many geminators' (Apoc. XIV). In the third place, it is written in Hebrew: I saw a vision according to the appearance that I had seen when he came to destroy the city. But that one came, who at the beginning of this prophet was clothed in linen, and had an ink horn at his waist, along with six others, to destroy the city, not to anoint, which the Seventy translated as: And the vision of the chariot that I had seen, which is not found in Hebrew. Let us speak separately about each one, to the extent that the difficulty of explanation allows: lest while we strive for brevity, the veil remain not only on Moses, but also on Ezekiel the prophet in us, who desire to contemplate the revealed truth of the Lord (Exod. 34; 2 Cor. 3). Therefore the glory of the God of Israel enters by the eastern way, by which it had also departed when the city of the Lord was struck by fury. It enters, or rather returns to it, because it had shown the temple of the Lord built on the mountain. And yet there is much more that is said in what follows: The spirit lifted me up and brought me into the outer court, and behold the glory of the Lord filled the house. For here is where only the glory of the God of Israel enters; but there it is said that the fullness of the glory of the Lord was in the temple, as Isaiah also writes: I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the house was full of his glory (Isaiah 6:1); when we contemplate the revealed face of the glory of the Lord, we are transformed into the image of the Creator. There was also the voice of God, like the voice of many waters, that is, of all the peoples in the whole world, as John the Evangelist explains (Apoc. XIV): or like the voice of armies, and like the voice of many praising God, that the army of God might know the sacraments. Jacob, understanding this, called the name of that place Camp (Genes. XXXII). And elsewhere it is written: The chariots of God are multiplied by ten thousand, thousands of rejoicers (Ps. LXVII, 18). But one voice is said to be of the camp and the multitude, because of the unanimous praise of God. And the voice of those singing is doubled for the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit: Holy, holy, holy Lord God of hosts, the earth is full of his glory (Isa. VI, 3). It follows: And the earth shone with his majesty (Psalm XVIII). Which properly happened at the coming of Christ; when the sound of the apostles went out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world (Rom. XVIII): and it is fulfilled daily in believers, and will be fulfilled completely, when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality (I Cor. XV). But the following is added: 'And I saw a vision in the likeness of the vision which I had seen when he came to destroy the city.' For which the Seventy have rendered: 'When I went in to anoint the city,' since it is clear contrary to the Hebrew; but according to the LXX it is very dark. How Ezekiel went in to anoint the city, and what was the purport of his prophecy, we have stated, unless we say, of course, that the prophet’s representation means the anointing of the city, and that the anointing with oil of joy is sacerdotal and regal, and that they become anointed of the Lord who willingly receive and hear Him to whom it is written: 'Do not touch My Christs;' and to those who touch them: 'My prophets, do not harm.' (Ps. 104:15). But he can anoint the city according to the anagoge, of which it is written: Glorious things are said of you, O city of God (Psalm 86:2); he who saw the vision of the chariot and the mysteries of God, which Ezekiel witnessed by the river Chebar, which signifies the burden and weight. For what is heavier than the Babylonian rivers, over which David sat and wept when he remembered Zion? Of which it is written: For the form of this world is passing away (Psalm 136). And I think that there is nothing perpetual in the confusion of this world, but everything passes and flows (1 Corinthians 7:31). Whoever considers this will fall on their face, understanding how far they are from the majesty of God, and will bow their knees to the Father in the name of Jesus Christ. And when, he says, I had fallen, the majesty of the Lord entered the temple through the gate facing east, and immediately the spirit lifted me up (for I could not go on lying down), and he led me into the court of annihilation, for I had fallen outside; and behold, I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east, and I saw the glory of the Lord filling his house, and I heard a voice speaking to me from inside the house. What this is spoken about, the Scripture does not narrate, unless perhaps that of the Apostle: And I heard unspeakable words, that it is not lawful for a man to utter (2 Corinthians 12:4). But the man, he says, who stood beside the prophet, said to him: whom we clearly understand to be the Lord. For who else could it befit what follows: Son of man, the place of My throne, and the place of the soles of My feet, where I dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever, except those who dwell in the Church in the midst of the children of Israel who behold God, and dwell forever, not according to the temple of Solomon for a time? And his place is the one about which it is written: And his place became peaceful (Psalm 75:2), which surpasses all understanding. And the place of his footsteps, as the Apostles say: Let us worship in the place where his feet stood (Psalm 31:7). And beautifully it is said, they stood: for the feet of the Lord stand in the Church, they walk in the synagogue and pass by. But in order that we may know that this is said about the Church, it is joined: And they will no longer defile my holy name, the house of Israel: which properly belongs to those who dwell in holy conversation in the Church. However, those who have defiled the holy name of God are more clearly specified: both their kings and their people, as well as their priests, in their own acts of fornication, through which they have fornicated with God; and in the ruins of their kings, who in vain, through pride, assume the royal name. Finally, it follows: And in high places. For an arrogant mind offends God; a humble one incites mercy. These people, after pride, or rather through pride, have fashioned their threshold next to the threshold of God, and their doorposts next to His doorposts. Let these women burdened with sins, carried about by every wind of doctrine, always learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth; having a form of godliness but denying its power, turn away from such people. For among them are those who creep into households and captivate weak-willed women weighed down with sins, led away by various lusts, always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was. And the Apostle also says: But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup (I Cor. XI, 28). And to make what he said more serious, he follows it with the verse: And there was a wall between me and them; so that a very short wall would separate the priestly sacrifices and the places of the sacraments of the body and blood of Christ. And they have polluted, he says, my holy name, in the abominations which they have committed. What is the advantage of dwelling near, and a wall, the wall of the Lord's altar, between our cell and the altar of the Lord, when in those things which we do in secret, and which it is even shameful to speak of, the name of the Lord is defiled and polluted? I think this, that the name of the Lord is not polluted, except by the one who has seen his name and believed, and is considered in his name. And just as he who previously believed in Christ pollutes the name of God, so also the one who previously accepted his name in faith pollutes it. Otherwise, the Gentile and the Jew, although they are defiled and contaminated, indeed contamination itself and pollution, cannot pollute and defile the name of God: what they pollute is attributed to them, to whom it is said, 'My name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you' (Rom. 2:24). Therefore, because of these reasons, I consumed them in my anger, because they did the things we have mentioned. And yet the merciful Lord again commands the prophets to tell them to remove their former fornications from themselves and to abandon the ruins of their kings and rulers, and to not only reject them from themselves, but also from God. And he immediately promises rewards for good deeds, saying: \"And I will dwell among them,\" as it is written in the Gospel: \"There stands among you one whom you do not know\" (John 1:26). And he will dwell not for a short time, like in the Synagogue, but forever, as is confirmed in the Church of Christ.


<h2 id='tocuniq325'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 and following) But you, son of man, show the house of Israel the temple: and let them be confounded by their iniquities, and let them measure the structure, and let them be ashamed of all that they have done. Show them the form of the house and its structure, its exits and entrances, and all its descriptions and all its laws. Show them the entire order and all its laws, and write them in their sight, that they may keep all its arrangements and its laws, and do them. This is the law of the house on the top of the mountain: All its boundaries around, it will be most holy. This, therefore, is the law of the house. 70: And you, son of man, show the house of Israel the house, and they will cease from their sins, and its vision and its arrangement: and they themselves will bear their punishment for all the things they have done. And describe the house and its preparation, and its exits and entrances, and its substance and all its ordinances, and all its statutes you will show them, and describe them before them: and they will observe all my judgments and all my commandments, and they will do them, and the description of the house on the top of the mountain, all its boundaries around are most holy. This is the law of the house. It is not a small task to demonstrate to those who see with their eyes or with their minds, so that they themselves seem to have seen with you. Therefore, Josephus writes that those who were sent by Jesus son of Nave to describe the land were geometers and had the art which now belongs to philosophers, the art of Geometry. Thus, for the house of Israel, those who see God with their mind, the house is shown, that is, the temple which Ezekiel saw situated on the mountain, and not only on a mountain, but as it is now said, on the summit of the mountain: which we should not think is the one that is described as being built by Solomon in the books of Kings and Chronicles. For that [temple] belongs to another order and size, and in each [temple] it has great diversity: and it [the second temple] is so much inferior to the temple that Ezekiel now shows, that not only its worshipers and priests, but even its builder, Solomon, sinned and offended God, although he later repented, writing in the Proverbs, where he says: Finally, I repented and considered to choose discipline (Prov. XXIV, 2). But this, which is shown by Ezekiel and through Ezekiel to the house of Israel, is as follows: that whoever contemplates it with the mind, ceases from his iniquities, not some, but all of them: or as it is contained in Hebrew, is confused and endures punishment for all that he has done. But he endures the punishment of his iniquities, who ceases to commit past sins: and it greatly benefits him who has sinned before, to see the house of God, and to know the reason for all its structure; so that he may cease to sin, and having a longing for it, may say to the Lord: O Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house: and the place of the habitation of your glory (Ps. 25:8). And again: One thing I have asked of the Lord, this I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life (Psalm 27:4), when I begin to live and be with Christ, who is the life of believers. It follows: His going out and coming in, understood as the house. But the going out of those who go out to those who are outside, and the coming in of those who penetrate the interior through the discipline of their masters. And every, he says, description or substance of it, as the Septuagint has translated, which pertains not so much to the nature of the house, but to the furnishings and riches. And you shall show them all the commandments, the entire order, and all the laws of the temple, to those who have carried the burden of their iniquities and have ceased or been confused about the things they had done before. But show it to them so that they may keep all the commandments. For it is of no use to know the description of the house and all its distributions, about which it is written: In my Father's house there are many mansions (John 14:2). And again: He established the boundaries of the nations according to the number of the children of Israel, even the angels of God (Deut. XXXII), unless you do what is commanded. But the house and law of all the commandments of God, and the city which is situated on the top of the mountain, that is to be believed, as it is written: A city cannot be hidden when it is situated on a mountain (Matth. I, 14). And: The rushing of the river makes the city of God rejoice (Ps. XLV, 4): which clearly refers to the Church, and is located on that mountain, which is at the top of all mountains, and from which the prince of Tyre was wounded: and all the borders and boundaries of this house are holy of holies. In that house, that is, in the tabernacle that was built by Moses, and in the temple that was constructed by Solomon, only the innermost parts, where the Cherubim, and the propitiatory, and the Ark of the Covenant, and the table of incense were located, were called the Holy of Holies. But in this house, which is shown by Ezekiel, and which is situated on the top of the mountain, all its boundaries are considered to be in the Holy of Holies. And what is inferred: This is the law of the house, either referring to the past, about which it has already been said, or to those things that will be said later.


<h2 id='tocuniq326'>(Vers. 13 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 13 seqq.) These are the measurements of the altar: in the true cubit, which is a cubit and a handbreadth (or παλαιστὴν) in his bosom, the cubit was in length, and its width was measured from its lip to the surrounding palm of one hand. This was also the trench of the altar. From the bosom of the earth to the outermost base, it was two cubits in height, and the width of one cubit. And from the smaller base to the larger base, it was four cubits, and the width of one cubit. But the altar itself was four cubits high, and from the altar up to the horns there were four horns. And the altar was twelve cubits long, twelve cubits wide, a square with equal sides. And there was a ledge fourteen cubits long, fourteen cubits wide on its four corners, and a crown around it half a cubit high, and a rim one cubit wide around it. Its steps were turned towards the East. LXX: And this is the measure of the altar in perfect cubits and παλαιστῆς, the height of which is a cubit all around and the width of a cubit, and the lip of it around the edge is one palm. And this is the height of the altar from the bottom of the base to its great propitiatory, which was beneath two cubits, and the width of a cubit. And from the smaller propitiatory to the larger propitiatory are four cubits: and the width of a cubit and the ariel are four cubits: and from the ariel to the upper horns are cubits. But the altar had twelve cubits in length, and twelve cubits in width, with four corners. And the mercy seat had fourteen cubits in width, with four parts. And its ledge went around it by the measure of a half cubit, and its circuit by a cubit. And its steps faced toward the east. It is written: Who can discover the depths and wisdom? (Ecclesiastes 1:2). And: O depth of wisdom and knowledge of God (Rom. XI, 33): 'Whose deep depth, and who shall find it?' It is much if we desire to compare the temple of Solomon to this temple, and all its parts and tabernacles. But because this is very difficult, for the time being let us compare the altar that was shown to Ezekiel, the altar that we read about in Exodus, in a small part (Exod. XXXVIII). There an altar is described, five cubits in length and five cubits in width, that is, square, and three cubits in height: but here, departing from the senses by five, it tends towards union, in which the perfect cubit, or truest, is placed, to which is joined a palm, that is, π α λ α ι σ τ ὴ, the sixth, as we said above, having a part of a cubit. But in its bosom, that is, the altar, there was an elbow, which indeed received those things that were consumed by fire, and another elbow in its width: so that the interior, that is, the secrets, and the spaces of the altar that are shown in its width, would be terminated by one elbow. But what follows: And the measurement up to its edge, for which Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion placed a boundary, the Seventy interpreted as a cubit again. Of which word, as I have already said, I cannot know the reason; nor can I confidently say in what language it is spoken, unless I remind the reader that I have now transferred the definition above the crown. And this is briefly demonstrated, that around the altar itself, that is, on the edge and in a circular manner, there was a lip and, as it were, a crown resembling a lily, having in appearance great beauty. This definition, or rather invention, extended in circumference by the span of one palm, or in width by the παλαιστῆς. The bottom and depths of the Altar, or its profundity and height, for which it is called in Hebrew Gab, from the bosom of the earth to the highest foot, or to the maximum propitiatory, were two cubits, and its width was one cubit. For the lower and deep parts, cohesive with the earth, are contained in the dual number, which is also used for unclean animals (Genesis 7); but the upper parts, reaching to the foot or propitiatory, which Theodotus himself calls by the Hebrew name Azara, have a width of one cubit, so that the dual number passes into the solitary; and the good of marriage, which is lower, may attain to the blessedness of union. And what follows: And from the smaller threshold to the larger threshold, four cubits, and the width of one cubit, for which it is written in the Septuagint: And from the smaller mercy seat to the larger mercy seat; and Theodotus translated in both Azara, it is to be understood that the smaller mercy seat is a stone cut from the mountain without hands, and the larger mercy seat is the stone itself that grew into a great mountain and filled the whole earth (Dan. II). Or, in another sense, the propitiatory is less when he took on the form of a servant (Philippians 2) and the propitiatory is greater when he received the glory that he had with the Father before the world was made (John 17). For we first come to know the humbler aspects of Christ and thus reach the height of his divinity. And yet the propitiatory of both natures, that is, of the lower and the greater, belongs to the sacrament of one altar. But between the two propitiatory [covers], the smaller and the larger, there were four cubits, signifying the four elements of the world, which themselves also come to a height of one cubit. And this should be noted, that in the measurement of the altar, the first cubit in width is not joined to anything, but is perfect in its own unit: but the second cubit of the width, after two cubits, increases to the top, and the third cubit, after the smaller and larger propitiatory [covers], tends to the mystery of one cubit through the four elements; and one and another, and a third cubit in the altar of the Lord, are by no means first, second, and third; but let it be said to be one and one, and one. But Ariel was four cubits long, and from Ariel upwards there were four horns: or, as it is said in the Septuagint, from Ariel to the top of the horn there was one cubit. Ariel, as most people understand, is interpreted as 'my light is God.' Regarding this, in the prophet Isaiah, where it is written: 'Woe to you, Ariel, the city David besieged, or surrounded,' we have spoken more fully. But as I think, it means 'lion' or 'mighty one of God,' a name that properly refers to the altar, in which there is either the illumination of God or the lion and his strength, as Jacob said to Judah: 'Judah, you are like a lion's cub. You have climbed up to the prey, my son. You have crouched down and stretched out like a lion or a lioness. Who will dare to awaken you?' But there are four sides, and it has four horns; whether the upper parts of the four horns are finished with one cubit, so that the measure of the Gospels and the strength running throughout the whole world may be demonstrated under the illumination of God and the strength of the lion, and may reach the divine confession in one cubit. And so that gradually the darkness of the present place may become more manifest, it follows: And Ariel is twelve cubits in length, with twelve cubits in width, a quadrangle with equal sides. What no one doubts pertains to the twelve tribes, which are written in the Book of Revelation, and to the number of the Apostles, concerning whose sacrament I remember having spoken above (Rev. 7). Moreover, through the four sides of the world, the twelve cubits together make forty-eight cubits of the priestly cities, so that with these, as if foundations divided throughout the whole world, the strength of the Church may be solidified. Furthermore, the step, for which the Septuagint rendered it 'propitiatory' and Theodotion as 'azara' above; Symmachus 'peridromēn', that is, 'circuit', fourteen cubits in length and fourteen in width, has at its four corners a crown half a cubit in circumference; for which, once again, the Septuagint rendered it 'gisum', and [meaning] 'bosom', or, according to Symmachus, its completion and perfection, one cubit in circumference, secretly suggests that our Lord, who is truly called the propitiatory not only for our sins, but for the whole world, came through fourteen generations from Abraham to David; and again, through another fourteen until the captivity of Jeconiah, and by the sacrament of the same number descended to earthly things: so that in the fourteenth triad and the sacrament of the divine gift, he would save the four corners of the world, of which it is written: 'Many will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and will recline at table with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven' (Matthew 8:11). And what follows, the crown, or gisus around it, signifies the propitiatory, which had a half cubit, and the bosom of the propitiatory, or the completion and perfection, which Symmachus interpreted as περιδρομὴν, had one cubit; this signifies that both sinners and the righteous are saved by the propitiation of the Lord, as the apostle Paul says: 'We have been reconciled to God through the blood of His Son' (Rom. 5:10). And it is said of sinners that they have a measure of half a cubit in circumference; yet they are saved by the mercy of the Creator, as it is written in the Psalm: You will save them as if they were nothing (Ps. 55:8). Regarding the righteous, it is said that they are saved in a singular and perfect number, and they imitate one divinity, as the same Apostle says: God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself (2 Cor. 5:19). And what is mentioned at the end of this testimony, and its steps turned towards the East, these steps should be understood as the twenty-four books of the Old Testament, which had harps in the Apocalypse of John (Rev. 5), and crowns on their heads: or the sacrament of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, in which true propitiation is given to us. And to speak more clearly, therefore the number of steps is left uncertain, so that no matter how diligently we may be able to ascend to higher things, we may consider ourselves placed in lower things, and think of that of the Psalmist: They go from strength to strength (Ps. LXXXIII, 8).

<h2 id='tocuniq327'>(Vers. 18 seqq.)</h2>

(Ver. 18 and following) And he said to me: Son of man, thus says the Lord God: These are the rituals of the altar when it is made, to offer a burnt offering and pour out blood. And you shall give to the priests, the Levites who are of the seed of Zadok, who approach me, says the Lord God: to offer to me a young bull from the herd as a sin offering. And you shall take some of its blood, and put it on the four horns and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border all around; and you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it. And you shall take the calf that was offered for sin and burn it in a separate place outside the sanctuary. And on the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for sin, and they shall make atonement for the altar as they made atonement for the calf. LXX: And he said to me, Son of man, thus says the Lord God: These are the statutes of the altar on the day it is made, upon which burnt offerings are offered and blood is poured out on it. And you shall give to the Levite priests who are of the seed of Sadduc, and who approach me, says the Lord God, to minister to me a calf from the cattle for a sin offering. And they shall take its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, and on its base all around, and they shall cleanse and make atonement for it. And they shall take the calf for a sin offering and burn it in a designated place outside the sanctuary of the house. And on the second day they shall take two male goats without blemish from the goats for a sin offering, and they shall make atonement for the altar as they made atonement with the calf. After the prophet showed the altar, and its cubit, which was two cubits, and again a cubit and four cubits, and a third cubit, as well as twelve cubits for the other twelve, and four horns of the altar: also twelve cubits for Ariel, by twelve cubits, and a ledge, that is, a mercy seat, of fourteen cubits, by fourteen cubits: also its crown, and a breast boundary of half a cubit and one cubit all around: and steps to the east, the number of which is uncertain, a man spoke, whose pen and cord were in his hand, and he instructed him how, with the work of the altar completed, the altar should be cleansed and consecrated. And first a victim is offered, and it is given to the priests of the tribe of Levi, who are from the descendants of Sadoc, whom the Seventy call Sadduc, which I cannot understand. But Sadoc means just. And according to the Seventy and Theodotion, a calf is offered; according to Symmachus, a bull, which is called Phar in Hebrew. But the calf that was sacrificed for us, and many passages of the Scriptures, and the notable Epistle of Barnabas, which is found among the apocryphal writings, mention it. And a male goat of the she-goats is offered on the second day. Hence, those who will celebrate Passover take a lamb and a kid from the flock, and those who could not celebrate the first Passover, celebrate it in the second month: one of which pertains to the righteous, the other to the penitents. But if we agree with the interpretation of the Seventy, who said: 'On the second day, they shall take two unblemished kids for the sin,' it is daring indeed what we are about to say, but the opinion of others must be simply presented, who say that two unblemished kids were offered after the Lord's passion on the altar of the Lord, Jacob and Stephen: one of whom was from the number of the apostles, the other was the chief among the seven chosen for the ministry of the Lord (Acts XXII). This is James, who saw the Transfigured Savior on the mountain (cf. Mark 9), who witnessed the raising of the daughter of the synagogue official with the Lord Peter and John (cf. Matthew 17), who is listed as the first among the apostles, with his name paired with his brother's (cf. Mark 9). He was killed by Herod (cf. Matthew 9), and like an unblemished lamb, he was sacrificed on the day after the Savior's passion (cf. Mark 3). The Jews also stoned Stephen, whose wisdom and teaching no one could resist (Acts 6:10), and he saw the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God, and said (Acts 7:59): Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. And the Jews also stoned him. And just as the Apostle names certain first fruits of the believers in Achaia and Asia (1 Corinthians 16), so these were the first fruits of the martyrs, whom the confession of Christ afterwards crowned. And it should be noted that the whole calf is offered as a burnt offering, and the thickness of its body is consumed by the divine fire. For we used to know Christ according to the flesh, but now we no longer know Him according to the flesh (2 Corinthians 5:16). However, Jacob and Stephen, who were offered on the second day, or the goat, which is mentioned in the Hebrew narrative, is indeed offered as a sacrifice, but the burnt offering is reserved for the presence of the Lord. And as for the blood that Peter speaks of when he says, 'You were redeemed from your vain conversation by the precious blood of Christ' (1 Peter 1); and the Apostle Paul teaches, 'You were bought with a price' (1 Corinthians 7:23); and in another place, 'Making peace through the blood of His cross, whether on earth or in heaven' (Colossians 1:20), that signifies that by the blood of the Savior, the four horns of the altar are purified, that is, the four corners of the world are cleansed; and the mercy seat is sprinkled, or the bases are sprinkled all around, so that everything may be cleansed and the propitiation may be firm. Therefore, on the second day, either two young goats, of which we have spoken above, or a he-goat is taken; because the animal always hastens to higher places and sustains no danger on precipices, and there it finds a path where destruction is to other animals. Therefore, in Greek speech, the flock of goats and he-goats is called conversation of the sublime, that is, αἰπόλιον, as if αἰποπόλιον, since αἴπος, high, and πόλιον (Mss. πολεῖν), signifies conversation. Furthermore, the altar of Christ is cleansed with blood, so that the prayers of the saints may reach God in purity. It should also be noted that, according to the Hebrew Ezekiel himself, he is commanded to take a calf as a priest and offer it as a burnt offering, and sprinkle its blood around the altar, as well as the corners and the crown or base. However, the Seventy Interpreters show other priests doing this, of whom it is said: You shall give to the Levite priests, who are of the seed of Zadok, who come near to me.


<h2 id='tocuniq328'>(Vers. 23 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 23 seqq.) 'When you have completed cleansing it, you shall offer an unblemished calf from the herd and an unblemished ram from the flock. You shall present them before the Lord, and the priests shall sprinkle salt on them and offer them as a burnt offering to the Lord. For seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and consecrate it; then the altar shall be most holy, and whatever touches the altar shall become holy.' On the eighth day and beyond, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar, and I will be appeased with you, says the Lord God. LXX: And when you have completed the purgation, you shall offer a calf from the herd without blemish, and a ram from the flock without blemish, and you shall offer them before the Lord, and the priests shall sprinkle salt upon them; and they shall offer them as burnt offerings to the Lord. For seven days you shall make atonement with a goat for sin daily, and a calf from the herd, and a ram from the flock without blemish shall be offered for seven days. And they shall purify the altar, and cleanse it, and fill their hands, and accomplish the days. And from the eighth day and beyond, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings upon the altar, for your salvation. And I will receive you, says the Lord God. After the altar and its measurements were shown on the top of the mountain, and the purification and consecration of it were demonstrated to the prophets, through one unblemished calf and a male goat, or two young goats, the first of which we refer to the Lord and Savior, and the two that followed to the apostles and ministers, so that in the consecration of the spiritual altar and specifically  pertaining to the Church, it may not seem that the law and the prophets were excluded. Therefore, after the altar had been consecrated, an unblemished calf and a ram are taken and offered in the sight of the Lord; and the sons of Zadok, that is, the righteous priests, sprinkle salt upon their heads, so that both the law and the prophets may be seasoned with the taste of the Gospel. And there is no sacrifice (according to the command of the law and the interpretation of the Apostle, who says (Col. IV, 6): Let your speech be seasoned with salt) that is lacking in salt. Both, however, are offered as a burnt offering to the Lord, like the fat of the letter, which is signified in the Law, and the prophecy, like a cloud of fire of the Lord, that is, the Holy Spirit, of whom Paul says, fervent in spirit (Rom. XII, 11), are transformed into a spiritual and thin substance. We want to know more clearly what the calf of the unblemished herd is, and the ram with the purest fleece from the sheep, let us understand Moses and Elijah (Num. XII, III Reg. XIX); the former of whom was the gentlest among all men who dwelt on the earth; the latter was similar to Moses in fervor of faith. Hence he dared to say: I am left alone. But what is written in Hebrew as 'You shall offer a calf', in the Septuagint it is written as 'the priests shall offer', there is no question about it. And indeed Ezekiel himself, to whom these things are said, is from the number of priests, full of age and perfect; and the grace of prophecy increased the priestly rank in him. And Moses and Elijah appear on the mountain with the Lord, that is, the law and the prophets, who announced to him what he would suffer in Jerusalem. But after the altar is cleansed, for seven days a goat or a young goat is offered for sin daily, and a bull from the herd, and an unblemished ram from the flock, so that through these sacrifices the altar may be cleansed for seven days and made perfect. In seven days the Sabbath is observed, which according to the Apostle (Hebrews IV) is reserved for the people of God: in which we hope for eternal and true rest, and do no servile work of sin. However, in the goat, and the calf, and the ram, three general sins are demonstrated, to which all human beings are subject. For we sin either in thoughts, or in speech, or in action. Thoughts are referred to the ram, which is the first of all sins, and from which the other two sins arise. But the goat, or rather the male goat, is known for its eloquence or discourse, always engaging in higher-level discussions. However, it is specifically designated for agricultural work, being bound to the plow and toil and earthly labor. Therefore, we must offer these blameless things for the true Sabbath, which lasts for seven days, and cleanse the altar, so that our prayer may reach God in purity. The phrase that follows, 'And they shall cleanse it, and fill his hand,' as translated by both the Hebrew and other interpreters, signifies that the offerings for the expiation of the altar itself should also be fulfilled, just as offerings are made for the priests, the people, and the high priest, so that nothing may appear empty in the sight of the Lord. For what reason they set aside the Septuagint: both will clean it, and they will fill their hands, so that the priests may be heard, who when they are full of good works, for this reason their hands are full, after the Sabbath has passed, they may come to the eighth day of resurrection, and may say with the Apostle: We have risen with Christ (Rom. VI, Coloss. III); and beyond the eighth day, they may strive for heavenly things, and may offer burnt offerings for us, or those which are for the peace of our sins and our salvation: so that through the fire of the Holy Spirit, everything that we think, speak, and do, may be transformed into spiritual substance: and the Lord, pleased with such sacrifices, may be appeased towards us.


<h2 id='tocuniq329'>(Chap. XLIV.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 44, verses 1 onwards) And he brought me back to the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces eastward and was closed. And the Lord said to me: This gate shall be closed and shall not be opened, and no man shall enter through it, for the Lord God of Israel has entered (or will enter) by it; it shall be closed for the prince. The prince himself shall sit in it to eat bread before the Lord. Through the vestibule (that is, the porch), he shall enter by the gate, and he shall go out by its way. For it is written in Hebrew: 'It shall be shut to the prince.' The Septuagint translated it as: 'It shall be shut, for the leader himself shall sit in it.' There are many gates described in the Scripture of the temple of Ezekiel, both inside and outside. The previous discourse also covers the representation, consecration, and sacrifices of the altar. After this, he comes to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east and is shut. And immediately, the man who was the guide of the prophet and showed him everything spoke to him: This gate that you are looking at will always be shut and will not be opened, and no man will pass through it. And it gives the reason why it is always closed: because the Lord God of Israel has entered, or will enter through it: and it will be closed according to the Hebrew, to the prince, whom the LXX translated as leader. The prince and leader, that is, the Nasi, will sit in it to eat bread before the Lord: and he will enter by way of the vestibule of the gate, and he will go out through it. What is this gate that is always closed, and only the Lord God of Israel enters through it? Namely, the one about which the Savior speaks in the Gospel: Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! And woe to you, teachers of the law, who take away the key of knowledge! You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are entering (Matthew 23:23). Isaiah also writes about this book under this name: The words of this book shall be like the words of a sealed book: if you give it to a man who cannot read, saying, 'Read this,' he will say, 'I cannot read.' And they shall give the book to a man who knows letters, saying: Read; and he shall say: I cannot read, for it is sealed (Isa. XXIX, 11). But this is the book that no one can unseal or open the seals, neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth, except for the one of whom it is said in the Apocalypse of John: Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root and offspring of David, has conquered, so that he may open the book and unseal its seals (Rev. V, 5). For before the Savior assumed a human body and humbled himself, taking on the form of a servant (Phil. II), the Law and the Prophets, and all the knowledge of the Scriptures, were closed, and paradise was closed. But after he hung on the cross, and spoke to the thief, 'Today you will be with me in paradise' (Luke XXIII, 43), immediately the veil of the temple was torn, and everything was opened; and with the veil removed, we say: But we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image, from glory to glory (II Cor. III, 18). But if all things are revealed, for in Christ, according to the words of Paul, all things are revealed (Ibid., XIII), how will the gate be closed and not opened, and a man not pass through it? From these things we learn that even though we have come to the ultimate knowledge, compared to divine knowledge, we now know in part and understand in part; but when that which is perfect comes, then that which is in part will be done away with. Hence, in another place, the Apostle himself speaks of being imperfect and, again, perfect. But if it lacks interpretation, it seems to be the opposite. For he says: Not that I have already obtained, or am already perfect. Brothers, I do not consider myself to have taken hold of it; but one thing I do: forgetting what is behind and straining towards what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:12, 14). And when we thought that he, according to his profession, was not yet perfect, and that he was seeking rather than having found what is true, he not only says this about himself, but also about others: Therefore, let us all who are perfect have this same attitude. But the meaning of this place is as follows: Compared to other people who do not have care of the knowledge of the Scriptures or the mysteries of God, I confess that I am perfect; but as for the understanding of the divine majesty, I now see it in an enigma and through a cloud and darkness, and I say with the prophet: Your knowledge is amazing to me, it is confirmed, and I will not be able to attain it (Ps. 138:6). Therefore, this gate, which is closed to everyone (for a man will not pass through it and perish), will be closed to the prince or leader, and it will be opened by his arrival, who will sit in it to eat bread before the Lord, about whom he himself testifies in the Gospel, saying: My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work (John 4:34). He is the prince and the high priest according to the order of Melchizedek. He is the offering and the priest who, in the presence of the Father, eats heavenly bread with us and drinks wine, of which he speaks in the Gospel: I will not drink of the fruit of this vine until I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom (Matthew 26:29): in that kingdom, of which he himself and elsewhere says: The kingdom of God is within you (Luke 17:21). And the gate will be closed. No one can truly understand the passion of the Lord, his body and blood as the sacraments of the divine mystery. Such is the greatness of his goodness and the prince of his mercy, that even though he alone sits at the closed door and eats bread before the Lord, he desires to have more companions at his table and feast, and says: Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone opens to me, I will enter in and dine with him, and he with me (Rev. 3:20). But he alone eats bread in the presence of the Lord, because his substance and divine nature are separate from all the substances of creatures. He himself enters and exits through the same gate of the vestibule: for he is both inside and outside, that is, infused and encompassing all; entering through the gate in order to bring with him those who cannot enter without his teaching and help; and exiting in order to bring in others again; and speak to those who do not understand difficult things. But inasmuch as the Eastern gate outside the boundaries of the world is always closed and never opens to human sight, the Gospel of John proves the words of the one who said: No one has ever seen God: the Only Begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, has revealed Him (John 1:18). In other words, it will be closed to everyone except the ruler. The ruler alone will sit in it, to eat the bread of perfect and complete knowledge. For no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal (Matthew 11:27). Some understand beautifully that the closed gate through which only the Lord God of Israel enters, and the leader to whom the gate is closed, to be the Virgin Mary, who both before childbirth and after childbirth remained a virgin. Indeed, at the time when the angel spoke: The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus (Luke 1:35), and when he was born, the virgin remained eternal; to confound those who claim that after the birth of the Savior, she had other sons by Joseph, based on the occasion of his brothers who are mentioned in the Gospel (Mark 3). I know that I wrote a small book in my youth, against Helvidius, the heretic of that time, in Rome.

<h2 id='tocuniq330'>(Vers. 4 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 4 and following) And he brought me through the way of the north gate in the sight of the house, and I saw, and behold, the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord, and I fell on my face. And the Lord said to me, Son of man, set your heart and see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I speak to you concerning all the statutes of the house of the Lord, and concerning all its laws, and set your heart upon the entrance of the temple and on all the exits of the sanctuary. The man who is the leader of the prophet, and who knows everything in the temple by showing, after he showed the closed gate that must never be opened, and yet opened to him who had entered through closed doors. He leads the prophet to the way of the North gate, which is also in the sight of the house, undoubtedly signifying the temple. And when the prophet saw the fullness of the house of the Lord's glory, namely the same house that he saw from the opposite side in the North area, he immediately fell on his face, unable to bear the majesty of the Lord's glory. Because he had been brought low by his humility, the Lord says to him, not as a man but as the Lord: Son of man, set your heart, and so on. In the completion of the tabernacle and the building of the temple constructed by Solomon, the glory of the Lord appeared, which was later destroyed by comparison to the glory of the Gospel, as the Apostle says: For that which was glorified has not been glorified in this respect, because of the excellent glory. For if that which is destroyed is by glory, much more that which remains is in glory (2 Corinthians 3:10). And we must beware lest we think the destruction of the previous glory is an abolition; but we must think thus, that after what is perfect has come, that which was in part will be destroyed: just as if you compare the rays of the sun to a lamp, or the light of a lamp to a small lantern. Therefore, it is also said about John the Baptist: He was a shining lamp in the house (John 5:35). However, when the sun of justice came, the light of the lamp was hidden, as the prophet himself and John the Baptist said: He must increase, but I must decrease (John 3:30). The prophet fell on his face, lest, desiring to see more than human frailty can behold, he should lose even the light of his eyes. Hence the Lord calls him more familiarly "son of man," and commands him to set his heart, and see with his eyes, and hear with his ears. For first the mind must be opened to understand what is said; secondly, the heart must understand with the eyes, concerning which it is said to Abraham: Lift up your eyes and see the stars of heaven (Gen. 15:5); thirdly, it must be heard with these ears, of which the Savior says: He who has ears to hear, let him hear (Luke 8:8), so that he may understand all the ceremonies of the temple and its legal requirements, and finally set his heart on the ways of the temple; for there are different approaches to God. Whether through the paths of the temple, it signifies the order of ceremonies, and the exit of the sanctuary. Therefore, it is the prologue and preparation of the prophet, to understand what he will subsequently learn about the order of the temple. And it should be noted that in this world, the plague which is positioned in the evil and placed in the cold of the North, the celestial order of ceremonies is shown to us.

(V. 6 seqq.) And you shall say to the rebellious house of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: Sufficient for you are all your sins, O house of Israel, because you bring in foreign sons (or foreigners) uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary and to defile my temple, and you offer my bread, fat, and blood, and you have broken (or transgressed) my covenant in all your sins; and you have not kept the precepts of my sanctuary and you have set the ministers of my observances in my sanctuary for yourselves. When he says, let all your crimes and iniquities be sufficient for you, he exhorts you to repentance for your former sins, so that we do not increase sins by sins, and prepare material for future burning; but let us hear what Isaiah speaks: Woe to those who draw sins like a long rope, and iniquities like the yoke of a calf's leather strap (Isa. 5:18). And the first sin is that they bring in alien sons, or uncircumcised foreigners in heart and in flesh, so that they may be in the sanctuary of God and defile the house of God. For a little leaven corrupts the whole lump (1 Cor. 5:6); and in some versions of Proverbs it is written: Do not bring the wicked into the dwelling of the righteous. The Jews and Ebionites press us on this matter, who receive the circumcision of the flesh: how can we explain this passage to those uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh? Indeed, after spiritual understanding, should we also undergo the circumcision of the flesh. But we who read what Paul says: Now I testify to every man who is circumcised that if you are circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you (Gal. V, 2). And that of Jeremiah: Behold, your ears are uncircumcised and you refuse to listen (Jer. VI, 10). And in Exodus, Moses spoke before the Lord, saying: Behold, the Israelites have not listened to me; how then will Pharaoh listen to me? But I am slow of speech (Exod. VI, 12), for which the Seventy translated: Am I not unreasoning? which is better rendered in Hebrew: But I have uncircumcised lips. Let us ask them, or rather compel them, to circumcise their ears and desecrate their lips, so that they may seem to fulfill the Scripture. But if they begin to interpret the circumcision of the ears, when we endure nothing shameful or dishonorable to hear, and the circumcision of the lips, when we speak nothing indecent: let us say to them, you must also keep the same interpretation in your heart and in your flesh. We circumcise the heart with the knife of God, and the foreskin is removed from our heart, when unclean thoughts never come out of our heart, and it is not said of us: 'This people's heart has grown fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily' (Acts 28:27). Therefore, the flesh is also circumcised in a similar manner, so that we do not engage in earthly works that we are compelled to do for the needs of the body, such as eating, drinking, sleeping, and wearing clothes. We circumcise these things not for pleasure, luxury, or laziness, but for the sake of the necessity of our nature and the sustenance of this body. The one who drinks wine in moderation due to their stomach and frequent illnesses, and hates drunkenness, circumcises their own flesh (I Tim. 5). Whoever sleeps as much as nature allows, will hear from Solomon: If you sit, you will be without fear; if you sleep, you will sleep sweetly, and you will not fear the coming terror; nor the attacks of the wicked (Prov. III, 24). And whoever flees from fornication and returns to his wife, let Satan not tempt him (I Cor. VII), will hear with the people of Israel: On this day I have taken away the reproach of Egypt from you. He will also use clothing that repels the cold; not clothing that, by its thinness, reveals the body. With flesh weakened by fasting and bounded by self-control, he avoids the reproach of the Egyptians, who pride themselves on their ample flesh. He can say what is commonly read in the Septuagint: 'As my flesh languished, so in a dry and trackless land I appeared to you, in a place devoid of water.' If, therefore, at any time we should wish to introduce aliens into the temple of God, let us circumcise their ears, and their lips, and their heart, and all their flesh, and their eyes, and their taste, and their smell, so that we may do all things with the fear and reason of God. Let the bishops and priests and all the ecclesiastical order hear this, so that they do not bring in uncircumcised sons in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, so that they may not be in the sanctuary of God and pollute his house. For if they do this, what follows will be applicable to them: 'And you offer my breads, breads of course of the offering, in all Churches and in the whole world, sprouting from one bread, and not only breads, but also fatness, of which it is written: 'He has filled them with the fatness of wheat' (Ps. 80:17), and the blood which was shed in Christ's passion.' And the order of reading should be as follows: When you bring uncircumcised foreign children with your heart and body into my sanctuary, and defile my house, you dare to offer bread and fat and blood, mystical sacraments, and you do not understand that you have broken, and you have violated my covenant in all your crimes and impieties, and you have not kept the precepts of my sanctuary, nor have you appointed guardians of my ceremonies in my sanctuary. But every threat is against those who have not heeded the Apostle's warning: Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins (I Tim. V, 22). Or certainly it should be understood thus: You have broken my covenant with all your crimes, and have not kept the precepts of my sanctuary, and you dare to appoint unworthy and foreign custodians in the observation of my sanctuary for yourselves, let it be understood, not for me. And there is sense: That they may serve and minister unto you in carnal things and profane my sanctuary for your worldly comforts.

<h2 id='tocuniq331'>(Vers. 9, seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 9 and following) Thus says the Lord God: Every uncircumcised foreigner in heart and in flesh shall not enter my sanctuary, every foreign son who is among the sons of Israel. But the Levites who went far away from me in the error of the sons of Israel, and who went astray after their idols, shall bear their iniquity, those who were in my sanctuary, the ministers of the gates of the house, and the ministers of the house; they themselves slaughtered the burnt offerings and the sacrifices of the people, and there they stood before them to minister for them. Therefore, because they ministered to them in the presence of their idols, and the house of Israel became a stumbling block of iniquity, therefore I have lifted my hand against them, says the Lord God, and they shall bear their iniquity. And they shall not approach me to serve as priests, nor come near to any of my sanctuaries, according to the most holy things; but they shall bear their shame and the sins they have committed. And I will give them custodians of the house in all its ministry, and for all that is done in it. But the Levite priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept the ceremonial duties of my sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me; and they shall stand before me to offer me the fat and the blood, says the Lord God. They shall enter my sanctuary; and they shall come near to my table to minister to me, and they shall keep my ceremonies. LXX: Therefore thus says the Lord: Every uncircumcised foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall not enter my sanctuary, among all the foreign-born children of Israel. But the Levites who went far from me when Israel went astray, following their own imaginations and carrying their own sins, shall serve in my sanctuary, guarding the gates of the temple and ministering in the house. They shall offer burnt offerings and sacrifices to the people, and they shall stand before the people to minister to them. Because they ministered to them before their idols, and the house of Israel became a stumbling block of iniquity, therefore I have stretched out my hand over them, says the Lord God, and they shall bear their iniquity and shall not come near me to serve as priests to me, nor to offer to all the holy things of the children of Israel, nor to the most holy things of my sanctuary, but they shall bear their disgrace and the error in which they have wandered. And they shall set them to keep the guard of the house, and to do all the works thereof, and all that shall be done therein. And the priests the Levites, the sons of Sadoc, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me, and they shall stand before me to offer me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord God. They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and to keep my charge. I have placed the testimony next to each edition, so that from comparing them we may be able to know what the LXX thought, what the Hebrew holds. The Seventy signify this, that the uncircumcised foreigners in heart and flesh who dwell among the children of Israel should not enter the sanctuary of God. But the Levites, that is, the priestly order, who have strayed far from the Lord in the error of the children of Israel, and have gone after their idols, after they have received their iniquity, let them stand in the sanctuary of the Lord as builders and doorkeepers, and ministers of the house, and let them offer burnt offerings and sacrifices of the people; and let them be in their presence to minister to them what they have ministered to their idols, and let them become a torment of iniquity for the house of Israel; and therefore the Lord God says that He has lifted His hand against them, so that they may not approach Him and officiate in the priesthood, nor offer in the holy of holies, and let them bear their shame in the error in which they have erred; so that they may be put under the observation of the guardians of the house in all its works, and in everything that is done in the house. But if this is so, how can it be possible for the Levites, who have strayed far from God and gone astray after their own idols, to serve in the house and offer sacrifices and victims for the people, and to stand before them to serve them? For what more will the priests of the sons of Zadok, who have kept the ceremonies of the sanctuary of God, do? Of whom it is said: They will approach me to serve me, and they will stand before me to offer me fat and the rest? But Hebrew has this meaning: Every uncircumcised foreigner in heart and flesh shall not enter my sanctuary, though he may be seen as being with the people of Israel. But the Levites, that is, the priestly class, who have gone far astray from me in the error of the children of Israel, and have followed idols, shall bear their iniquity because they have served in my sanctuary as gatekeepers of the house, and as its ministers. For they offered burnt offerings and the people's sacrifices, and they stood before them to minister to them. So because they ministered for them in the presence of their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have stretched out my hand against them, says the Lord God, and they shall bear their iniquity and shall not come near me to serve as priests to me, nor to approach any of my sanctuary's holy things, but they shall bear their disgrace and the crimes they have committed. For the priestly office which they were accustomed to, offering burnt offerings and sacrifices and all kinds of offerings, they shall be reduced to the lowest level and become the gatekeepers of the house, in eternal disgrace, so that they may be seen by the whole people entering and leaving, from what sublime dignity they have reached to this lowest level. But the priests, he says, that is, the Levites, who are the sons of Zadok, that is, the righteous or just of God, and who during the time of the error of all the Israelites, have kept the ceremonies of my sanctuary, they themselves will approach me to minister to me, and they will stand in my presence, and they will offer me fat, that is, the fattest victim and blood, namely, a living and pleasing victim to God, and they themselves will enter my sanctuary, and they will approach my table, to burn incense to me, and they will observe every rite of the sacrifice. But if it is so, that those who in the time of error and persecution followed idols, which they had fashioned in their own hearts, and not only declared with their voice, but also with the signing of their hands, that the Son of God was a creature, and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever, how do they assume for themselves the high office of priesthood and pontificate, and dare to offer sacrifices to God, once worshippers of idols? But, as the most ardent poet testifies,

Whatever is committed by many is left unpunished: The multitude of sinners has made the impious obtain even greater forgiveness, so that those who, having been reduced to laymen, should have bewailed the crimes of their sacrilege, now recline on the pontifical throne and belch forth the nauseating reflux of simulated faith, or rather the open shortcuts of covert treachery. Let them at least, then, listen late and observe the precepts of the almighty God. Every foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and in flesh, shall not enter my sanctuary. Although he may be a son, although he may be connected by kinship, although he may cling to us through ancient obligation: if he is uncircumcised in heart or flesh, he should not be admitted into the sanctuary of God: lest we make ministers of Christ, our ministers, and defile the altars of the Lord with carnal indulgences. For this reason, I will appoint them as the gatekeepers of the house, in charge of all the services performed in it: namely, the Levites who have strayed far from God in the error of the children of Israel, and have followed idols to which they have sacrificed. Taking into consideration the order of reading and the sense, Symmachus interpreted it more accurately, saying: For I had appointed them as custodians of the gates of the entire ministry and of all that is done in it, so that it would not pertain to those who are to come in the temple, but to those who have been.

<h2 id='tocuniq332'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Verses 17 onwards) And when they enter the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments (or robes); they shall not wear anything made of wool (or they shall not wear garments made of wool) when they minister at the gates of the inner court and inside. Linen turbans shall be on their heads (or they shall have linen turbans on their heads) and linen undergarments shall be around their waists, and they shall not be bound in sweat (or forced). And when they go out to the outer courtyard to the people, they shall take off their garments (or stoles) in which they ministered, and they shall put them in the treasury (or colonnades) of the sanctuary (or the holy place), and they shall put on other garments (or stoles), and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments (or stoles). But they shall not shave their heads, nor let their hair grow long, but they shall trim their hair (or shave their heads) without shaving the hair too close: they shall cover their heads. And not every priest shall drink wine when he is about to enter the inner court. First, the words of the story must be interpreted. Among other things that the sermon of the Lord commands to the priests, he also orders that they should be clothed in linen garments at the very gates of the inner court, that is, with linen stoles: and they should not use garments woven with gold either at the gates of the inner court or inside, that is, in the holy of holies; and linen turbans or headbands should be on their heads, and linen undergarments around their loins. And what follows according to the Septuagint: 'And they shall not gird themselves violently,' which Aquila and Symmachus translated as 'in sweat.' Theodotion, expressing the Hebrew word itself, rendered it as, 'in Jeze,' meaning that they should not be girded violently, tightly, like prisoners, so as not to become unfit for the priestly and Levitical duties, and be unable to hold and slaughter the victims, nor to draw and run around. And because he had previously commanded the priests what garments they should wear when they were inside the sanctuary, he now orders that when they go out into the treasuries or the holy places, they should take off their former garments and put on others. For if they had the holy garments, they would sanctify the people who were standing outside and had not yet been sanctified, nor had prepared themselves for the sanctification of the temple, so that they may be of Nazarene for the Lord. From this we learn that we should not enter into the holy of holies with everyday and any garments that are polluted for common use, but with a clean conscience and clean garments, keep the sacraments of the Lord. And what follows: 'But they shall not shave their heads, nor let their hair grow long, but they shall trim their heads,' clearly demonstrates that we should not be priests and worshippers of Isis and Serapis with shaved heads, but neither should we let our hair grow long, which is properly luxurious and belongs to barbarians and warriors; but that the honorable appearance of the priests be shown on their faces. For this reason, the LXX said, 'They shall not shave their heads, nor let their hair grow long, but they shall cover their heads,' from which we learn that we should not make baldness with a razor or cut our hair so close that we appear like shaven ones, but that our hair should be left long enough to cover the skin. Or certainly, the priests should always cover their heads, according to what Virgil said (Aeneid, Book III):

To veil his hair with a purple covering. But this is a violent interpretation. However, not only will priests and Levites not drink wine in their ministry, but they will not even enter the Holy of Holies, so that their mind may not be overwhelmed, and their senses may not become duller. Hence the Apostle says: It is good, he says, not to drink wine and not to eat meat (Rom. XIV, 21). And in another place: And do not get drunk with wine, in which there is debauchery (Ephes. V, 18). For the people ate and drank, and then got up to play. And he clearly showed (as Alexander shows) why he granted Timothy to drink a little wine: for his stomach, he says, and frequent illnesses (1 Timothy 5). The Egyptian priests use linen garments not only internally but also externally. Furthermore, the divine religion has one dress for the ministry and another for common use in life. The undergarments are properly worn to preserve modesty and decorum: so that, when ascending the steps of the altar and moving about in the ministry, they do not reveal indecency. The superstition of the pagans has many heads. But as far as my knowledge is concerned, I do not believe that any of the pagans abstain from wine. These words will show what all things in accordance with sense indicate as spiritual. The Apostle also teaches that there are sacred and spiritual garments, saying: Put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. XIII, 14). And in another place: Put on the bowels of mercy, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience (Coloss. III, 12). And again: Stripped off the old man with his works, and put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge, according to the image of the Creator (1 Cor. 15:54); which I think also signifies this: For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, and so on. About the priestly garments in Exodus, it is written more fully (Exodus 28); and we have previously published a book (Epistle 64, to Fabiola), to the interpretation of which a diligent reader must be sent. For we cannot comprehend a broad subject in a concise discourse. These clothes we make with our own labor, which are woven from above, such as the Lord had a tunic that could not be torn (John 18); in which we are clothed when we know the secret and hidden things of the Lord, and we have the spirit that searches even the high and deep things of God, which are not to be shown to the common people, nor to be spoken to the un-sanctified, nor to those not prepared for the sanctity of the Lord: so that if they hear greater things, they may not be able to bear the majesty of knowledge, and be choked like solid food, who are still nourished by the milk of infancy. But on the contrary, Scripture teaches that the worst clothing, as is sung in the Psalms about the traitor Judas, is to be clothed with curses (Ps. CVIII, 29). And a little later: Let it become for him like the clothing with which he is surrounded, and like the belt with which he is always girded. Therefore, the Lord, who suffered for us and carried our sins, is said to have dirty clothes in Zechariah, of which it is written: And Jesus was clothed in dirty clothes (Zach. III, 4): which he later takes off, as the Scripture says: Take away the dirty clothes from him and dress him in clean clothes, and so on. But what follows: "Vittae, sive cidares lineae erunt in capitibus eorum, puto coronam ostendere gratiarum, de qua scriptum est: Coronam enim gratiarum suscipiet tuus vertex (Prov. IV, 9). Nec illud nobis de operto et nudo capite faciet quaestionem, quod Apostolusloquitur: Mulier debet velamen habere super caput, propter angelos. Si enim non velatur mulier, attondeatur. Sin autem, turpe est mulieri tonderi aut radi, operiatur. For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man (2 Cor. XI, 10). For if it is the custom for men not to cover the head, it seems to be the opposite, so why do priests now command them to cover their heads or cut their hair? But if we read diligently, the present matters will be resolved from the previous ones. For it is said above: When they serve at the doors of the inner court and within. For if we enter into the holy and stand in the presence of the Lord, we ought to cover our heads: Because not every living thing will be justified in the sight of the Lord (Ps. CXLII, 2). And: From infancy the heart of man is inclined to evil. Finally, we also use our female bodies inwardly so that no defilement of conscience and impurity of matrimonial work appears in the sight of God. The Savior wants his apostles to be girded with these female items, saying: Let your loins be girded, and your lamps burning in your hands (Luke 12:35). And the Apostle speaks to believers: Therefore, gird up your loins in truth (Ephesians 6:14). And the imitators of Christ hear that which is written about him: He shall be girded with justice and clothed with truth (Isaiah 11:5). And this very belt, which is holy and has ascended to the pinnacle of virtues, is not bound forcibly: lest he appear unwilling to observe the good of continence and to eat the bread of his face in sweat, but to do the commandment of the Lord willingly. Finally, when he goes out and mingles with the people, he puts off his priestly garments in the treasury, where the riches of the Lord are preserved; and the priests use other garments and another teaching for the common people, so that the people may not be sanctified in their garments. It is a burden for the multitude to undertake beyond their strength, as Solomon says: 'The snare of a man is to consecrate quickly what is his own; for when he has made a vow, repentance steals upon him.' (Prov. XX, 25, LXX) . Finally, the Nazarenes offer themselves willingly, and whoever vows something and does not fulfill it is guilty of the vow. Hence it is said about widows: 'When they have given themselves to wantonness, they want to marry in Christ, having condemnation because they have cast off the first faith.' (I Tim. V, 11, 12) . For it is better not to promise than to promise and not do. Anna offered Samuel, who remained in eternal sanctity (1 Samuel 1). And Manoah offered Samson his son, but the lust of Delilah defiled the sanctification of his hair (Judges 13). Finally, the Lord withdrew from him and he was condemned to blindness, except that later, as his hair grew, he regained his former strength and in the image of Christ, he killed many more of the enemies of Israel in death than he did in life. But the Lord wants his priests to have perpetual holy hair and to cover their heads, not with any external veil, but with their own natural hair, not for adornment and luxury, but for decency. Therefore, the apostles' hair is counted, as the Savior says: But the very hairs of your head are all numbered (Matt. 10:30). That head, about which it is written in Ecclesiastes: The wise man's eyes are in his head (Eccl. 2:14). But the head of the man is Christ, whom the sinner tramples upon and despises, and, so to speak, shaves with a razor, and takes away his beauty. Which the sons of Ammon also did to those whom David had sent as ambassadors (2 Samuel 10). But, on the other hand, transgressing the law dishonors God, and therefore, whoever keeps the precepts of the law, honors him, so that what is written may be fulfilled: That all may honor the Son as they honor the Father (John 5:23). Furthermore, what follows is clear: That every priest, when about to enter the inner courtyard, should not drink wine, it is evident that the state of mind is overturned in drunkenness and debauchery, and we do not fully understand when the mind is occupied with the satisfaction of wine. But drunkenness is not only shown in the drinking of wine, but in all things, in which the mind is intoxicated and fluctuates with love and hatred, in contracts and business of the world, and cannot maintain its state. And because we are surrounded by fragile flesh, and we are compelled to do certain things that pertain to the body, such as providing for food and clothing and necessities, which we should not do, at least it is required of us that when we return to ourselves and understand why we were born, and enter the innermost sanctuary of the temple, we withdraw from the vices of the world and do not even commit the slightest sins. Through this, it is shown that we commit minor sins out of necessity of the flesh, and again, there is a time when, entering the inner courtyard, we must be free from all worldliness and external distractions.

(Vers. 22 seqq.) Widows and divorced (or expelled) women will not marry, but only a virgin from the seed of the house of Israel. But they will accept a widow who was married to a priest: and they will teach my people what is holy and what is defiled, and they will show them what is clean and what is unclean. And when there is a dispute (as added in the Septuagint, regarding blood), they will stand in my courts, and they will judge my laws, and they will keep my commandments in all my solemnities. This place contains the instructions of the priests, who, after many things that we have explained above, are commanded not to take widows, divorced women, or expelled women as wives. The widow and the divorced woman are the synagogue, that is, the congregation of the Jews, which did not receive the Lord. Therefore, it is rightly called the expelled woman, or the widow synagogue. The expelled woman also refers to the crowd of heretics who departed from us because they were not of us. But he says, 'I want to present you all as a holy virgin to Christ,' speaking also of the woman from the seed of the house of Israel who was nourished in the house of God, in the law and the prophets, about whom the Apostle also speaks (2 Corinthians 11:2). This is the virgin about whom the divine word speaks elsewhere: Love her, and she will keep you: surround her, and she will exalt you: honor her, so that she may embrace you (Prov. IV, 8). But whoever reads it will know what kind of virgin should be loved and how she should keep her lover: I loved her and sought her from my youth, and I sought to take her as my spouse, and I became a lover of her beauty (Wisdom VIII, 2). And again: And the Lord loved her above all. Not only, however, should priests marry virgins, but also widows, who were, nevertheless, the wives of another priest; that is, the knowledge that another worshipper of God has found. For we must not only be satisfied with new doctrine, but also cultivate the old and join it to our company, if she has been educated in sacred worship. It is also the duty of the priest to teach the people what is holy and what is impure, what is clean and what is unclean; so that we may first refer to the doctrines, and then to the works that are accomplished through the flesh. For who understands the sins? And when there is a dispute about any matter, whether as the Seventy have translated it, blood, that is, a crime that pertains to death, the priests shall stand in my judgments, so that they may not judge according to favoritism, nor show partiality to the poor or the rich in judgment, but they shall judge according to the judgments of God, and they shall remember that psalm: God stands in the assembly of gods, but he judges the gods in the midst of them, calling gods those who have the power to judge over men: and whoever judges in that judgment, he shall be judged by them. He said, 'My laws and my precepts shall be observed on all my solemnities, so that they may know how Christ is immolated for us as the Paschal Lamb; how we ought to fulfill the seven weeks of joy and gladness, and to humble our souls in fasting; and to understand the sound of trumpets and the spiritual tabernacles, in which we say: 'I am a stranger and a sojourner as were all my fathers' (Ps. XXXVIII, 13). These are the true solemnities of God, which someone discussing the Pentateuch will interpret in a consistent manner.' The first virtue of a priest is not only to teach what he knows, but also to observe all the festivals of God, so that he can instruct others in what they should observe, which he himself has also observed. Moreover, the duty of the priests is to have knowledge of the law, and in Malachi we learn, who says: The lips of the priest will keep knowledge, and the law they shall seek at his mouth: because he is the angel of the Lord of hosts (Mal. II, 7).

<h2 id='tocuniq334'>(Vers. 25 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 25 onwards) And they shall sanctify my Sabbaths, and they shall not go unto a dead person, lest they be defiled (for the Septuagint translated it as, and they shall not go upon the soul of a dead person, lest they be defiled): except for father and mother, he said, and son and daughter, brother and sister who has no husband, they shall be defiled. And after he has been cleansed, seven days shall be numbered for him, and on the day of his entrance into the sanctuary and into the inner courtyard, to minister unto me in the sanctuary, he shall offer a sin-offering unto the Lord God (or he shall offer an atonement). But they will not have an inheritance: I will be their inheritance, and you shall not give them any possession in Israel; I will be their possession. Furthermore, it is commanded to the priests: in which it is to be observed that it does not say absolutely: and they shall sanctify the sabbaths; or according to Isaiah: My soul hates your new moons and sabbaths (Isa. 1:13): but with distinction, my sabbaths. Hence, it is also written in the Gospel: The priests in the temple violate the Sabbath, and they are without guilt (Matt. 12:5): not the Sabbath of God, but the Sabbath of the law, the Sabbath of the Jews, which they rightly violate who are the chosen race, royal, priestly. Furthermore, let us understand the Sabbath, which is sanctified, as the Apostle teaches, to have been left to the people of God, about whom it is said: 'If they shall enter into my rest' (Ps. 94:11), which is called the Sabbath in Hebrew. But God sanctifies the Sabbath, who does not bear the burden of sin on the Sabbath, nor says: 'As the heavy burden, they have been heavily laden upon me' (Ps. 37:5). Whoever is such, does not gather wood on the Sabbath; nor does he build upon the foundation of Jesus Christ with wood, hay, straw (1 Cor. 3); nor does he light a fire that consumes useless material, and he remains in one place on the day of Sabbath; nor does he go outside, but remains like a column placed in the temple of God, as John writes in the Apocalypse: 'He who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more' (Rev. 3:12). And what follows: They shall not enter the place where the dead person is, lest they be polluted. It is the proper office of the priesthood not to touch anything connected with death, so that the one who prays for the sins of others may approach the altar in a state of purity. Our Savior also speaks of these dead in the Gospel: Let the dead bury their own dead (Matthew 8:22). They are polluted by their dead father when they abandon their Creator, and by their dead mother when they depart from the Church. Likewise, by their son and daughter, for there is a distinction between thoughts and actions, which is more expressively stated in Greek as τὰ νοητὰ καὶ αἰσθητά. Also, if a brother and sister, who have been born of the same spirit, mistakenly believe that one of them has died, they become contaminated by this belief. However, this only applies if the sister remains a virgin and has not been defiled by any man. From this, we understand the virgin privilege, which is taken away by the touch of any man, thereby removing perfect purity. Whether this is said correctly or incorrectly, we leave it to the judgment of the reader. Furthermore, this is supported by the natural affection in the order of charity, as it is written: 'Set me as a seal upon your heart' (Song of Solomon 2:4). After God, the parent of all things, let the father and mother of the flesh also be loved and respected, as well as the son and daughter, and the brother and sister. However, this only applies if they have not left the household nor come under the authority of another. But after the priest has been purified according to the order of purification that is prescribed in the Mosaic law, let seven days be numbered for him, either the perfect number of penance, or after the consummation of the world, when we pass over to the true ogdoad, so that he may enter the holy of holies (which is the inner courtyard) and minister in the sanctuary and always offer a victim for the sin of conscience: and let there be no time when he does not remember that he has been defiled by his father and mother, son and daughter, brother and sister. For indeed we are compelled to do many things in the constraints of this world, either due to the condition of the flesh or the frailty of nature. But whoever is such that he ministers in the sanctuary, and enters the inner court, and offers a perpetual sacrifice to God, so that he may be a true priest, indeed an imitator of him about whom it is written: 'You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek' (Psalm 110:4), this person will have no inheritance, except God who is his inheritance; nor will he receive possession among the common people of Israel; but rather a priestly one, so that the Lord may say about him: 'I am their inheritance and possession.' When they find him, they will speak and say: I will hold him, and I will not let him go; and they will sing with the prophet: The Lord is my portion (Ps. II, 26).

<h2 id='tocuniq335'>(Vers. 29, 30.)</h2>

(Verse 29, 30) They themselves shall eat the victim for sin and for transgression (or for ignorance), and every vow (or separation) in Israel shall be theirs. And the firstborn of all the firstborns, and all the libations from all that are offered, shall be for the priests. And you shall give the firstfruits of your food to the priest, so that he may put a blessing on his house (or put blessings on your houses). For the victim and sacrifice, which in Hebrew is called Manaa (), Aquila and Symmachus interpreted as a gift. Again, for the vow which the Seventy translated as ἀφόρισμα, which means separation, Aquila and Symmachus and Theodotion interpreted as a dedication, which in Hebrew is called Herem (). And it is to be considered that all that which the Lord now speaks through the prophet, He had already spoken through Moses. And it is to be sought why the same things that were said are repeated: namely, that those things which are in the minds of men, deleted either by negligence in reading or contempt in hearing and forgetting, may be renewed orally, which are not written with pen and ink, but with the Spirit and word of God. And so the Savior left no written volume of his teaching, which in many cases the apocrypha fabricate delusional writings: but he speaks daily to the hearts of believers through the Father and his Spirit. And this will be the response against those who slander the prophets, asking why they repeat what is contained in the Pentateuch in their own writings. Therefore, let the priests eat the victim, both for sin and for transgression, or ignorance, about whom it is written: They will eat the sins of my people (Hosea IV, 8). We must not only rejoice at the offering of gifts, but also fear the condemnation of honor, if we unworthily misuse them. The first things according to the letter are of living beings, and of inanimate things that are first born, and of those that the earth first produces. The first fruits of our food are also offered to the priests, so that we may not taste of new crops unless the priest has tasted first. We do this so that the priest may repon our blessing and offering in his house, or so that the Lord may bless our houses according to his imprecation. The dignity of priests is great, but their downfall is also great if they sin. Let us rejoice in their ascent, but let us fear their descent. It is not as joyful to have reached lofty heights as it is sorrowful to fall from them. For we will not only give an account for our own sins, but also for the sins of all those whose gifts we have abused, and we are not at all concerned for their salvation.

<h2 id='tocuniq336'>(Vers. 31.)</h2>

(Verse 31) Every dead body and every animal caught by a beast, whether birds or livestock, the priests shall not eat. And according to the letter, this command applies to every chosen people, the royal and priestly, which properly applies to Christians who are anointed with spiritual oil, as it is written: 'God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your companions' (Psalm 45:7). These commandments are appropriate so that the priests do not eat any dead bodies, whether from birds or livestock, whose blood has not been properly drained, as mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles as being strangled; and these things must necessarily be observed, as the Epistle of the Apostles from Jerusalem reminds us (Acts 15). And every animal caught by a beast, because it is likewise strangled, condemns those priests who do not refrain from consuming things like thrushes, figpeckers, dormice, and other such things out of the desire of gluttony. But we can say, according to the mystical interpretation, that the dead body represents the soul, and Nabal imitates the foolishness of Carmel, which means foolish. And hearing of David's anger, he trembled with fear, and his heart died within him (1 Samuel 25). But captured by beasts, so as not to be torn apart by their bites, the prophet sighs, saying: Do not deliver the soul of your confessor to beasts (Psalm 73:19). He should be called the one who is devoured by the bites of the lion and the leopard that does not change its spots, and by the she-bear that rages against its stolen cubs, and by the wolves of Arabia, and by the other beasts that we perceive in the diversity of demons. But we say that birds are those that place their mouth in the sky, and those animals that lean forward towards the ground serve only their belly and the things that are under the belly.

<h2 id='tocuniq337'>(Chap. XLV.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 45, vers. 1 and following) When you begin to divide the land as an inheritance, set apart for the Lord a portion of the land, twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand cubits in width, which shall be consecrated in all its boundaries. This portion shall be holy and shall be laid out in a square, five hundred by five hundred cubits in size, with fifty cubits of additional land as its outskirts. And you shall measure this measure of length twenty-five thousand, and a width of ten thousand, and in it there shall be a temple (or consecration) and a holy of holies. The consecrated portion of the land shall be for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who approach to minister to the Lord, and there shall be a place for them in the houses, and in the sanctuary of holiness. Twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in width. But the Levites who serve the house: they shall possess twenty storerooms (for which the Seventy translated: they shall hold the city to dwell in). And you shall give a possession of the city of five thousand in width, and twenty-five thousand in length, according to the separation of the sanctuary, to the whole house of Israel. Also, the prince shall have a portion on both sides of the separation of the sanctuary and of the possession of the city, extending from the side of the sea to the sea, and from the side of the east to the east. And the length shall be alongside each of the portions, from the west border to the east border of the land. It shall be a possession for them in Israel. And my people will no longer be oppressed by their leaders. They shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes. After the ceremonies of the priests, their worship, and the food they should eat and avoid, he now describes the land of the holy place, and before dividing it among the tribes, he commands a place to be chosen from all the tribes, which should have a length of twenty-five thousand and a width of ten thousand. And because the cubits or feet or arms are not mentioned, it is understood to signify a reed that was in the man's hand, which measured six cubits and a sixth part of one cubit, that is, a παλαιστήν. Let the diligent reader calculate how many paces a thousand reeds make, and how many thousands there were in length and in width. After this description, he again commands that from the consecrated land, which was chosen from all the tribes of Israel, that is, twenty-five thousand reeds in length and ten thousand in width, be chosen to build the sanctuary, that is, the temple of the Lord, with another piece of land inside of five hundred reeds in circumference, that is, two thousand. And so that other buildings would not be joined to the building of the temple by chance, he commanded that there be an empty space in the suburb of fifty cubits around it: or as Symmachus and Theodotius and the LXX translated, to a boundary, and separation and space. With this description finished, another measure of complete separation for consecration is commanded, that twenty-five thousand reed lengths in length, and ten thousand in width, be measured on the upper part of the land, in which there should be no temple, that is, a holy place, but a holy and most holy place, and in it the priests who approach the ministry of the Lord shall dwell. But they shall dwell at that time, when they are performing the priestly office, and the possession itself, as we have said, shall be twenty-five thousand cubits in length, and ten thousand in width. Moreover, the Levites who serve the priests and have their own ministries shall receive a place to build twenty treasuries; next to Aquila, exedras; next to Symmachus, chambers; next to Theodotion, gazebos, or as the seventy translated, a city. By which we understand that a certain separate place for the habitation of the Levites, is called by the name of a city, which place is five thousand cubits in breadth, and twenty-five thousand in length. But all these, that is, the sanctuary, and another sanctuary, the holy of holies, and the dwelling places of the priests, and the house of the Levites, who minister to the priests, are called separate and consecrated places for ministry and for the sanctification of the house of Israel. After the fourfold description of the Holy Land, the fifth division is made. The leader or ruler of the people may take possession here and there, that is, on both sides of the sanctuary, and reside in the city. Their possession should face the separate temple area and the face of the city. It should extend from the side of the sea, that is, from the west, to the other side of the sea, having the width that the prophet describes in the subsequent description of each tribe. Finally, it follows: In terms of length, on each side, which each tribe takes, from the Western boundary, that is, the sea, to the Eastern boundary, where it ends, we will learn in the division of the tribes. And this will be the possession of the duke or prince in the land of Israel. Let these things be said for the sake of a simple historical account. But if we wish to compare spiritual things with spiritual, and according to certain interpreters to ascend to higher things, who assert that the figure of future things is present, and that everything that is said pertains to the heavenly Jerusalem, which is the mother of all of us, and to the Church of the early Christians, it will not indeed be difficult to say what has been said by others, but we fear that the wise reader may in no way accept such an exposition. At the present time, everything must be directed towards the Church, which is now working in the world and hastening to go to heaven, so that others may be chosen from the entire world to possess God, those who possess the holy; others, who have made progress in greater things, may hold the holy of holies. Among the ministers, there is also a different order of priests and Levites, some of whom offer sacrifices to God daily through their prayers and virtues; others are in a second and lower rank, to serve them, and through them those who have reached the heights of virtue, and in the end there should be a leader or prince, who should be able to receive a possession against one tribe; and the merit of one should compensate for the merits of many, and first, while he is in the world, he should possess the breadth from sea to sea; then from the West or from the sea to the East, so that, leaving the present, he may hasten to the future and have his own certain possession, and the princes should never desire what belongs to others, and each tribe should hold its own portion: which can properly be referred to bishops and presbyters, to whom it is said, that they should not devastate and depopulate the people of God any further, nor possess the land of Israel as an inheritance, but each one should have his own possession that is appointed for his rank. Twenty-five thousand, however, are referred to the senses, which are four times placed. Furthermore, ten thousand are related to perfect knowledge, so that in the former only a simple history is maintained, while in the latter both theology and discussion of supernatural virtues are included, because ten is a perfect number. It must also be considered that priests, who are in a higher degree, possess twenty-five thousand in length and ten thousand in width. But the Levites, that is, the inferior order, have the same number in length, that is, twenty-five thousand: but their breadth is limited to a number fivefold. Therefore, only twenty receive the treasuries: in which number the gifts of Esau are offered. However, the true leader among the people, who deserves to be called a leader, receives possession of the sanctuary from both sides: namely, from all those who are subject to his will and from the dwelling of the city, and he receives reward for the well-being of many. In the front temple, which is called the sanctuary, five hundred on each side of the reeds are described; and again, fifty cubits by which the entire possession of the priests is separated. But in the second sanctuary, where the holy of holies is, the width and space of the temple are not described, but the number is uncertain. Indeed, we find this also in the possession of the prince, who has possession in the people of Israel without any number, while the surplus of all flows back to the prince; and the salvation of the disciples is the reward of the teachers.


<h2 id='tocuniq338'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) Thus says the Lord God: Enough for you, princes of Israel: cease iniquity and robberies, and execute judgment and justice, and separate your borders from my people, says the Lord God. For because of robberies they have brought misery upon the seventy; for because of borders, oppression. And the meaning is this: Since you, O princes, have received your portion, as the Scripture says: To each prince from this side and that side shall be given a portion of the sanctuary's possession within the city; and your power is so great that one tribe's portion shall be given unto you as possession. Therefore, I command and advise you, that you have done enough in committing iniquity and robberies, while invading and plundering the property of others. And because it is written: Depart from evil, and do good; and contrarywise, judge ye and practice justice (Ps. XXXVI, 27), judging the orphan and vindicating the widow: separate your boundaries from my people, lest you transfer the landmarks. And because this very proximity harms the more humble, who cannot withstand the arrogance of the greater and more powerful, it is said through Isaiah: Woe to those who join house to house, and field to field, even to the boundaries of the place. Let this be said for the people of that time. Moreover, this commandment can also be applied to our leaders, who, like the Pharaoh and the Egyptians, oppress the children of Israel by force, and do not remember the scripture: They have set up a governor over you, do not be exalted, but be among them as one of them (Eccl. XXXII, 1). And also what the Lord speaks in the Gospel according to Luke: But if that servant says in his heart, 'My master is delayed in coming,' and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful (Luke XII, 45, 46). He also instructs his disciples in the Gospel according to Matthew with these teachings: 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.' (Matthew 20:25) There are many things that, if one desires to delve into the Sacred Scriptures, the pride of the arrogant is restrained, and all are challenged by the Lord's words, saying: 'Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart.' (Matthew 11:29)


<h2 id='tocuniq339'>Book Fourteen</h2>

Book Fourteen.

What I should have said at the beginning of Ezekiel's temple, I am now going to say out of order at the end, mindful of that little verse (Virgil, Book VI of the Aeneid).

Here is that laborious task, and the bewildering error.

About which the same poet sings in another place (Aeneid. V):

Once upon a time, there was a labyrinth in high Crete: a path woven with blind walls, and a thousand-fold deceit in its many ways, where the signs of following would deceive the unsuspecting, and the mistake was irretrievable.

So I, too, have entered into the ocean of these Scriptures, and the mysteries of God, to speak thus, the labyrinth, of which it is written: He has set darkness as his hiding place; And: Clouds surround him (Ps. XVII, 12): I dare not claim to possess a perfect knowledge of the truth, but I have provided some indications of doctrine for those who desire to know, not by my own strength, but by the mercy of Christ, who himself unravels the tricks and ambiguities of the hidden, guiding us in the blind paths with the Holy Spirit; by following him, we may arrive at the port of the explanations of the prophet Ezekiel, where the last, that is, the fourteenth book is. If, while you are praying, I, the virgin Eustochium of Christ, lead you all the way to the end, and the Lord grants me the span of this life, I will then move on to Jeremiah, who remains the only prophet for us; the interpretation of which, indeed, will be the work of myself and your prayers, but primarily of the mercy of Christ.

<h2 id='tocuniq340'>(Chap. XLV.—.Vers. 10, seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 45, verses 10 and following) 'A fair balance and a fair ephah and a fair bath shall be for you. The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, so that the bath may contain a tenth part of a homer, and the ephah a tenth part of a homer: their measure shall be according to the homer. Now a shekel has twenty obols. Furthermore, twenty shekels, and twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels make a mina.' LXX: A just balance, a just measure, and a just dry measure shall you have: the dry measure shall be a choenix, and a choenix shall be the same as a homer. The tenth part of a homer shall be a choenix, and the tenth part of a homer shall be an ephah. A homer shall be equal to twenty obols in weight. Twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels shall be a mina for you.» This passage in the LXX does not cohere, and cannot be entirely understood, since not only have they changed the numbers of the measures, but also the names. For they have interpreted pro ephi as a measure, a general term for a specific one, and for bato choenica: for homer also Hebrew, which is called κόρος in Greek, they translated as gomor: and again for bato choenica. Let us therefore speak according to the Hebrew and the letter, and let us explain more clearly what seems to us, individually. The balance, which is called Mozene in Hebrew (), is understood as those which are attached. The ephah, which is corruptly called Ἔφι in the Greek language, pertains to the measure of various grains, for example, wheat, barley, legumes. Furthermore, a batus, which in Hebrew is called Bath, is the same measure as the ephi, and is used only for liquids, such as wine and oil, and the like. It holds thirty modios, both in the dry and liquid measure. The tenth part of a cor in those things which are measured by the modius is called epha, that is, three modii; and the tenth part of a cor in liquid measures is called Batus or Vadus, so that epha and batus are of the same measure. Furthermore, the coin called στατὴρ in Greek has twenty obols. But the weight called mna has sixty siclos, which makes twelve hundred obols. However, it should not confuse the reader that there are twenty siclos, twenty-five siclos, and fifteen siclos in a mina. For the difficulty lies in the numbers, to focus the attention of the listener. Hence, many things are said in parables and riddles, so that those who have ears to hear may hear. And all prophecy contains truth in obscurity, so that the disciples may hear from within: the common and lowly people, positioned outside, may not know what is said. Therefore, divine Scripture commands that the weights be just, saying: You shall not have in your bag two kinds of weights, a large one and a small one: a true and just balance shall be yours, and a true and just measure shall be yours (Leviticus 19:36). And in Proverbs it is said: Both a large and a small weight are an abomination in the sight of God (Proverbs 11:1). Indeed, this should be observed not only in commerce and in the use of everyday life, but in all things justice must be preserved, as the Scripture says: 'You shall make a balance and weights for your words' (Eccl. 28:23), so that in both words and deeds and thoughts, we may do everything with proper measure and reason. However, we read in another place that 'to him who is faithful, the whole world of riches belongs', and for him who is unfaithful, not even an obolus remains (Prov. 17:6 LXX). In other words, he said: The unbeliever possesses nothing in the world: but even the smallest portion is needed. Regarding this, in other words, it is said in the Gospel: He shall not depart from there until he pays the last farthing (Matt. 5:26), that is, even the last and least coin. We read of ten minas given to each servant to trade with (Luke 19); and in another parable, talents divided among servants; and a debtor of five hundred denarii, and fifty (Matt. 25); and the vineyard workers who each receive a denarius (Luke 7); and the widow who had lost a drachma and found it only by lighting a lamp (Matt. 20, Luke 15). To discuss all of these things and their meaning is not of this time.

<h2 id='tocuniq341'>(Vers. 13, 14)</h2>

And these are the firstfruits that you shall offer: one-sixth of an ephah of wheat, and one-sixth of an ephah of barley. The measure of oil: a bath of oil is one-tenth of a cor; and ten baths make one cor, for ten baths fill a cor. And these are the firstfruits that you shall separate: one-sixth of a measure of wheat, and one-sixth of an ephah of barley, and a prescribed measure of oil, a cotyle, which is a tenth of a cor; and ten cotyles make one measure, for ten cotyles are a cor. And here, in the 70th edition, all the names of the measurements were changed and confused, so that it is not possible to understand what is being said. For those who had previously called the measure "ephi" and the measure "bato," they now call them "choenica" and "gomor" for the measure "coro." And for the measure "siclo" they now call it "appendiculum," and here they put the measure "ephi" for the measure "coro," now called "gomor," and sometimes even "corum." And in the measurement of oil, instead of "bato," they use the term "κοτύλην," that is, "cyathum." Therefore, let us first say, according to the letter, that the "δεκάδα" (or "δεκάδας"), that is, the tenth part of all fruits, was to be given to the people of Leviticus according to the law. Again, from the tithes themselves, the Levites, that is, the lower order of ministers, gave tithes to the priests, and this is what is called the second tithe. There were also other tithes, which each person from the people of Israel set aside in their own barns to eat when they went to the temple in the city of Jerusalem, and in the vestibule of the temple, and the priests and Levites were invited to feasts. There were also other tithes, which were given to the poor, and these are called the poor tithe in Greek. But the first fruits that they offered from the crops were not defined by a specific number, but left to the discretion of the offerers. And we have received a tradition from the Hebrews, not commanded by law but established by the decision of the teachers: the one who had a lot gave a fortieth part to the priests, the one who had little gave a sixtieth part. Between the fortieth and the sixtieth part, they were allowed to offer whatever they wanted. Therefore, what was left doubtful in the Pentateuch is specifically defined here because of the greed of the priests, so that they do not demand more from the people in the offering of the first fruits, that is, that they offer a sixtieth part of what is produced from the land. For if a kor, which in Hebrew is called a homer, and is called a gomor by the Septuagint, holds thirty modii, both in dry and liquid commodities; and if an ephah and bath, as we have said before, is the tenth part of a kor, it is commanded that the sixth part of an ephah and bath be given to the priests in the offering of first-fruits, which is half a modius out of three, and it is clearly computed that the priests ought to receive the sixtieth part of the first-fruits. Let this be enough for now, to understand and hear the literal and Hebrew truth. Now let us turn to spiritual understanding, in which we must first seek to discern: Honor the Lord with your righteous labors, and give Him the fruits of your righteousness, so that your storehouses may be filled with grain, and your vats may overflow with wine (Prov. III, 9); so that after you have offered the firstfruits of your labors and virtues, and have said: Behold, I have brought you the firstfruits of the fruits of the land that you have given me, O Lord; may you deserve to hear: Blessed are you in the city, and blessed are you in the field; blessed are the fruit of your womb, and the produce of your land, and the offspring of your livestock (Deut. XXVIII, 3), and the rest, and may you possess, according to the Apostle (Ephes. I), every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ: for whatever you have, do not consider it to be of your own virtue, but of His mercy, who gave the fruits. And if indeed we have such knowledge of the Scriptures, that we may unfold and teach mystical things, and instruct men, that is, rational animals, we offer the first fruits of our grain. But if after the anagoge, we follow only the pure history, which can nourish the simple, according to what is written: You will save men and animals, Lord (Ps. 35:7), we offer the first fruits of our barley, which Isaac sowed, but in a foreign land, and it brought him a hundredfold (Gen. 26). He who gives firstfruits of barley can say: The Lord feeds me, and nothing shall I lack, in a place of pasture He has placed me: He has led me up on the waters of refreshment (Ps. 23:1-2). But he who feeds rational beings turns the sentiment, and says: You have prepared in my sight a table against those who trouble me. And after he has offered firstfruits of oil and wine, he joins in and speaks: You have fattened my head with oil, and your chalice which inebriates, how brilliant it is, that oil which is most pure without sediment, is prepared for the lamp of the Lord. The one who prepares this, his face will be exhilarated with oil; with the oil of exultation, with which Christ is anointed before His companions; and he will be like a fruitful olive tree in the house of God (Psalm 51:10). And with that wine which flows abundantly from the true vine in the winepresses of the Savior, as the Lord says: I am the vine, and you are the branches, my Father is the vinedresser (John 15:5). Concerning these winepresses, we read three psalms, the eighth, the eightieth, and the eighty-third, which all refer to the sacraments of the Church. And indeed, in the old law, there were no measures and no fixed number: for God did not give the spirit in measure. However, in the second building of the temple that is contained in the prophecy of Ezekiel, there is a definite measure, that is, the number sixty, by which the world is completed, as it is said to us: 'With the measure you measure, it will be measured to you' (Matt. VII, 2).

<h2 id='tocuniq342'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 and following) And one ram from the flock of two hundred, from those that nourish Israel, for a sacrifice, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them, says the Lord God. The whole population of the land shall be held accountable for these first fruits to the prince in Israel. And the prince shall have burnt offerings, and sacrifice, and drink offerings for the festivals, and for the new moons, and for the Sabbaths, and for all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel. He himself will make a sacrifice for sin, and a burnt offering, and peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel. As mentioned above, a certain portion of those things that are offered, both dry and liquid measures, should be offered to the prince. Now he holds the same order of firstfruits in regard to animals: that one of the flock of two hundred rams should be commanded to be offered, which nourishes Israel, as a sacrifice and burnt offering, and peace offering, to make atonement for the people of Israel, says the Lord God. What we have interpreted, regarding what nourishes Israel, is written in Hebrew as Memmasce(), which Aquila and Symmachus interpret as 'from the waters', and the Septuagint and Theodotion interpret as 'from the reservoirs'. The former refers to irrigation, while the latter refers to canals or pools, indicating that the firstfruits of the prince should only be nourished in irrigation systems. And just as we read in previous passages that a sixtieth part should be offered to the prince from what is attached and subject to measurement, now a two-hundredth part of animals is commanded to be offered. And by such commands of the law, the entire people are subject to offering to the leader or prince, so that through him, burnt offerings, sacrifices, and libations may be offered for the people and the house of God may be exonerated. From which it must be noted that just as the people owe the offering of first fruits to the ruler, so the ruler owes the offering of victims to the people, whom, according to the trope, we can understand to be none other than the Lord Savior. It is he who receives a ram for the two hundred animals, or as the Hebrew word more significantly indicates, the sustenance that can be referred not specifically to the ram but to all animals, and he receives the animal or ram that has been nourished in fertile places, namely the holy Scriptures, and he can say, 'The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want; he has set me in a place of pasture, he has nourished me by the waters of refreshment' (Psalm 22:1-2). These were the irrigated, or rather, these were the canals, to which Jacob led his livestock, so that they could drink and conceive in them, and according to the color of the rods, they would produce offspring for the Lord (Gen. 30). As for sacrifice, that is θυσία in Greek, Aquila and Symmachus interpret it as gift: which in Hebrew is called Manaa (), and properly does not pertain to the offering, but to those things which are offered in sacrifice, such as flour, porridge, and oil. But a Holocaust is what is entirely offered to God and is consumed by sacred fire. Pacifica, when we are reconciled to God; and the Apostle speaks for us: We beseech you in Christ, be reconciled to God (2 Corinthians 5:20). And in another place: God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself (ibid., 19). Now this ruler, to whom the first fruits are offered, is also a king: as is demonstrated on the title of the cross with Hebrew, Greek, and Latin letters. And when the Jews insisted that the triumphal title be removed, the crowd of the Gentiles responded to Pilate: What I have written, I have written (John 19:22). Under the prince, he says, they will be. The dignity of the priesthood should be bestowed beautifully, to which it is subject; so that it knows that it must offer sacrifices and libations that are offered from wine ((or smoke)) for the people in all solemnities: both on the kalends, that is, the first day of the month, and on the sabbaths: when darkness covers everything, the beginning of the lunar light is: and on the rest of the sabbaths: so that it may indeed make atonement for sin, to cleanse the house of Israel, which is the Church of the living God, a pillar and foundation of truth. For this is the house of the living God, and the house of Israel, which is in need of the expiation of its sins.

<h2 id='tocuniq343'>(Vers. 18 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 18 and following) Thus says the Lord God: In the first month, on the first day of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish, and you shall purify the sanctuary. The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the house, and on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the doorposts of the gate of the inner court. So you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who has sinned inadvertently and been deceived by error, and you shall make atonement for the house. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, there shall be a solemn feast for you: for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. And on that day the prince shall make a sin offering for himself and for all the people of the land, a young bull. And during the seven-day feast he shall offer a burnt offering to the Lord: seven young bulls and seven spotless rams each day for seven days, and a male goat for a sin offering each day. And for each young bull he shall offer a hin of oil, and for each ram he shall offer a hin of oil, and for each male goat he shall offer a measurement of oil. In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, during the feast, he shall perform as mentioned above for seven days: both for sin and for burnt offering, and in sacrifice and in oil. I have included the entire passage so as not to disturb the reader's mind by dividing it into individual parts. And first, we must speak of the variety of interpretations. Where we have interpreted, at the four corners of the altar's base. The Septuagint translated it as on the four corners of the temple and on the altar. And where we said 'for each and every one who is ignorant and deceived by error,' they put 'for the ignorant and for the little one.' In that same place where we said 'the offering of an ephah for a calf and an ephah for a ram,' and 'a hin of oil for each ephah,' their edition holds 'the offering and cooking of a calf and the cooking of a ram you shall give, and the cooking of oil.' And in the final verse where we said 'in the sacrifice and in the oil,' they said 'as in the manna, as in the oil.' In the first month and on the first day of the month (no doubt, Nisan signifies) you shall take a calf from the cattle: not one that is raised in the house, but one that is from the cattle, that is, from the flock and a larger number. On the seventh day of the same month: these two solemnities, that is, the first day of the first month, and the seventh of the same, are not found in the Mosaic law. But the fourteenth day of the month, on which the Passover is celebrated, and Moses commanded to be observed, when we eat unleavened bread for seven days. But the fourth solemnity, of which he says: On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, in the solemnity (Exod. XII), and the rest, seems to me to signify the scenopegia, which he has placed here without a name. So let us run through each [topic] and briefly discuss what seems to us [to be relevant]. There are spiritual celebrations, and the Apostle teaches: Therefore let no one pass judgement on you in questions of food and drink or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. These are a shadow of the things to come (Colossians 2:16). And thus God speaks through Isaiah: I cannot endure solemn assemblies with iniquity. Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates (Isaiah 1:13). It is clear that whoever despises the Jewish feasts loves his own, namely the Sabbath that was left to the people of God. Let us see what has been given to us by God, and let us speak, not in the learned words of human wisdom, but in the teaching of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. In the present age, which is under the power of the evil one, we cannot see good days, but in the new age: of which days the Holy Spirit sings in the Mosaic song: Remember the days of old: understand the years of generations upon generations (Deut. XXXII, 7). Of which (things) even the Holy One spoke in the psalm: In the night my heart meditated (Ps. LXXVI, 7). And again: And I have kept eternal years in my mind, and have meditated (Ibid., 6). Whoever does not understand this, let him answer how he can explain what Isaiah prophesies about the future and the new age: There shall be a month from month to month, and a Sabbath from Sabbath, and all flesh shall come to worship the Lord (Isa. LXVI, 23): when true worshippers shall not worship on Mount Gerizim or in Jerusalem, but in spirit and truth (John. IV); when there shall be a new heaven and a new earth, and all creation shall be freed from the bondage of corruption, unto the liberty of the sons of God, and the sun shall receive light seven times brighter, and the moon shall be compared to the sun (Rom. VIII, Isa. LXV). For we have come to Mount Zion, which is interpreted as the lookout, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to the thousands of angels in festive gathering. Concerning this feast, another prophet speaks: What will you do on the days of the assembly and on the days of the Lord's solemnity? (Hosea 9:5). This is what is also said elsewhere: Celebrate, O Judah, your festivities; fulfill your vows (Numbers 1:15). Therefore, if we have learned spiritual solemnities, we will subsequently be taught spiritual sacrifices. A calf is taken from the herd, or a bull, as Symmachus interpreted, free and not burdened by any yoke, that is, the burden of sins, and spotless: who did not commit sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth, a young calf, carrying horns and hooves: so that in him the sanctuary may be cleansed and atoned. And the priest will take, he says, from his blood which will be for the sin of all: who is called in other words the lamb in Exodus, and in the Gospel, John the Baptist saying: Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world (John 1:29). But the blood itself is precious, in which we are redeemed in the passion of the Lord and Savior; in whose flesh we are nourished, and in whose blood we are made to drink; by which the four corners of the altar of the Temple, which Theodotius placed, the Hebrew word itself, Azara (), or the Temple, as the LXX translated it, are touched, so that the house and the altar may be sanctified. For all the elements of the world are sanctified by this blood, so that when someone has been purified and cleansed, they may enter the gate of the inner court and be able to know the secrets of the Lord and subsequently come to the seventh day of the first month, and attain rest, and offer a sacrifice to the Lord for both ignorance, of which David speaks: The sins of my youth and my ignorances do not remember (Ps. 24:7), and for the child who, when he reaches the measure of a perfect man, will destroy those things which are childish and speak with confidence: When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child (2 Cor. 13:11). Whether it is for the one who has been deceived by error, and not so much by will, as by the opinion of good, he has sinned. But when the two solemnities of the first month are completed, that is, the first day and its seventh, he comes to the fourteenth day of the month, in which the solemnity of Easter is: of which it is written: For Christ our Pasch is sacrificed (I Cor. V, 7). Then we eat unleavened bread for seven days in rest and security of all things, when we eat the bread of sincerity and truth, destroying the leaven of malice and wickedness, our prince offering all these things for us, and first for himself. For he assumed the human body and, through sin, destroyed sin; he who suffers for us and bears our weaknesses. Then, for his own house, as is written in the Septuagint, but not in the Hebrew, that is, for the Church, and for all the people of the earth, that is, for the entire human race. For the Savior is the Savior of all men, especially of the faithful, and he is the one who offers forgiveness for our sins; and not only for ours but for the whole world. But a calf is offered for the whole people of the earth, and for the seven remaining days of the Lord's Passion, seven calves and seven unblemished rams are offered daily, so that they may be consumed as a burnt offering and in the Lord's fire. And there are seven calves and seven rams, which symbolize the Lord's Passion, so that they may imitate the true calf and the true ram, and the blood of the martyrs may purify the sins of the whole world for seven days. And a goat of the goats is also offered for sin daily, specifically for seven days. And it must be observed more diligently that in the sacrifice of the calf, and the ram, and the hin of oil, the offerings which are commanded by the Law are made. But in the offering of the goat, neither the hin nor the preparation (as the Septuagint has rendered it) is mentioned, which they have interpreted as referring to the hin, that is, to the preparation. But the hin of oil, which is a fixed measure, as we have already said, is used in the sacrifice of the calf and the ram, so that we may be able to receive the nourishment of eternal light, and the rest from labor, and the health from weariness, after the propitiation of sins. In the seventh month also, on the fifteenth day of the month, that is, the Feast of Tabernacles, the same order of offerings and sacrifices is to be observed, both for sin and burnt offerings, and in the sacrifice, and in the oil, so that we may obtain the Lord's festival, the darkness being banished and the light of the oil rising: and that we may have brighter solemnities, in which all sins are forgiven.

<h2 id='tocuniq344'>(Chap. XLVI.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 46—Verses 1 onwards). Thus says the Lord God: The gate of the inner court that faces east will be closed for six days, during which work is being done; but on the Sabbath day it will be opened, and also on the day of the new moon it will be opened. And the prince shall enter through the vestibule of the outer gate, and shall stand at the threshold of the gate. The priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate and then leave. But the gate shall not be closed until evening. And the people of the land shall worship at the entrance of that gate on the Sabbaths and on the new moons before the Lord. The prince shall offer on the Sabbaths, as a burnt offering to the Lord, six unblemished lambs and an unblemished ram, and a grain offering of an ephah for the ram. And for the lambs, whatever his hand gives as a sacrifice, and a hin of oil for each ephah. On the new moons, he shall offer an unblemished bull from the herd, and six lambs and rams shall be unblemished. And one ephah for a young bull, and one ephah for a ram shall he make a sacrifice: and with every ephah there shall be a hin of oil. Where we have translated ephah, which is a tenth part of an ephah, they have rendered it πέμμα, which in our language means a measure of volume. And where we have said sacrifice, they have used the Hebrew word Manaa, which Aquila translated as gift or sacrifice, and Theodotion translated as sacrifice. And meanwhile, before we discuss what these things mean, the very words of Scripture must be explained paraphrastically. 'The gate,' it says, 'of the inner court shall be closed for six days, as it is written: Six days you shall work and do all your works (Exod. XXIII, 12); and it shall not be any gate, but the one facing the East, where the sun of justice rises. Moreover, on the Sabbath day, that is, on the seventh day, which is a day of rest, it shall be opened each week, and again, when thirty days are complete, which is the end of one month and the beginning of another, that is, on the day of the calends, it shall be opened, so that what the seventh day has as a privilege in the week, the beginning of the month may have as a privilege as well.' But why it is opened on the seventh day, and on the first day of the month, the inner gate of the atrium facing the East will be explained in the following discourse. And the prince will enter, he says, through the path of the outer gate of the atrium: and he will stand at the threshold of the inner gate of the atrium, which faces the East: and he will not enter the inner atrium, but while he is standing there, other priests will make a burnt offering for him, which offering Symmachus interpreted as a holocaust: and peace offerings, or those pertaining to salvation, so that after the offering of the prince has been consumed by the holy fire, and the leader has been reconciled with God, then he may be able to worship on the threshold of the inner gate of the atrium where he stood, and he may exit. What then? Will the gate be immediately closed after the departure of the prince? By no means, but it will be open until evening, so that after the prince, all the people of the land may worship in front of that gate; they shall worship on the Sabbaths and the first days of the month when the gate is opened. And because he had said before: 'The priests shall make his burnt offering and his peace offerings,' and he had not indicated the number of burnt offerings, now he adds: 'On the Sabbaths, the prince shall offer this burnt offering to the Lord.' However, it is offered not by itself, but by the priests, of whom it is written: 'And the priests shall offer its burnt offering and its peace offerings: six flawless male lambs, and one flawless ram; and the sacrifice of the ram shall be measured by an ephah, which in Hebrew is called an Epha (). And the sacrifice that his hands who offer it are able to offer shall be six lambs; and for each ephah, the measure of oil shall be a hin, which is called in Hebrew a hin. But on the first day of the month, which is the day of the new moon, it shall have a greater privilege than the Sabbath, and a calf shall be offered from the herd, or a flawless bull.' The rest, that is, six spotless lambs and one spotless ram, and their sacrifices, shall possess the ritual of the Sabbath: only in this way, that just as in the ram the same amount of flour and oil is offered as a sacrifice, so it should be offered in the calf. These things are stated for the sake of clarity: now, with the Lord's gift, let us unlock the spiritual meaning. But when we have come to the seventh day, that is, the Sabbath, on which eternal rest is, or to the day of the Kalends, when after a blind night and horrible darkness, the beginning of light is, the Eastern gate is opened to us: and if any of us, by the merits of virtues, shall have attained to the name and dignity of leader by the way of the porch of the outer gate, that is, by the labours of this world: and shall enter the gate of the Church, which is as yet placed in earthly boundaries: it shall enter not the inner court, for this is written in the present place; but it shall stand at the threshold of the inner gate, and abide in it. But if the prince does not enter the inner atrium in the present Scripture, but stands at its threshold, there is no doubt that now we see and know in part; and not yet revealed, we contemplate the glory of the Lord. Finally, with the prince standing at the threshold of the gate of the inner atrium, the other priests, to whom this duty is delegated (whom we can understand as angelic virtues), will make a burnt offering and peace offerings on behalf of him. For we are born of the mercy of God, and every creature is unclean in comparison to the Creator, and must be cleansed by divine fire, as the lips of the prophet Isaiah were cleansed, so that after receiving peace through sacrifice, he may then stand at the threshold and worship the almighty God, and acknowledge his unworthiness to enter the inner court, and immediately enter. After the first person has exited, the inner gate of the court will not be closed until evening of this age, but will remain open so that the people of the earth may come to the door and worship him. Not at all times, but when they have rested from sins and the darkness of faith has been dispelled, and they have received the light of knowledge. But this very burnt offering that the prince offers through the priests on the Sabbath day is concluded with six unblemished lambs; namely, for the six days in which we work in the world, and a flawless ram, which is the leader of the flock; so that through each ram it may be offered in sacrifice an ephah, that is, a tenth part of a measure. In the sacrifice of the six lambs, a certain measure is not specified: but whatever amount the hand of the one offering has given, that is, according to the quality and measure of the works (Matthew 25). But he shall offer a hin of oil for each ephah, that is, the oil which the five virgins prepared for themselves, so that he may anoint the flour or mix it, and every offering of God may be full of the light of truth and the face of the one offering the oil may be brightened. But on the day of the kalends, that is, the thirtieth day, when the firstborn and the Levites are numbered in the Law, apart from all of Israel, of whom we have spoken above, an unblemished calf from the herd is offered, about which we discussed more fully in the previous chapter, and six lambs, and unblemished rams, and whatever is offered on the Sabbaths, so that we may attain eternal rest and deserve to hear: 'Well done, good servant, because you have been faithful in a few things, I will set you over many, enter into the rest of your Lord' (Matthew 25:21; Luke 19:17); and not only arrive at the gate of the inner courtyard, but also be able to enter its innermost parts, and possess it by work: 'Planted in the house of the Lord, they will flourish in the courts of our God' (Psalm 92:14).


<h2 id='tocuniq345'>(Vers. 8 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 8 and following) When the prince enters, he shall enter through the gateway vestibule and exit through the same way. And when the people of the land enter in the presence of the Lord on the appointed festivals, the one who enters through the north gate to worship shall exit through the south gate, and the one who enters through the south gate shall exit through the north gate. They shall not return through the gate they entered, but rather shall exit opposite it. But the prince, in their midst, will enter when they enter, and will exit when they exit. And on market days and festivals there will be a sacrifice of one ephah of flour with a bull, and one ephah of flour with a ram. But the sacrifice of the lamb will be according to what his hand finds, and a hin of oil for each ephah. That prince, of whom it was said above, 'And the prince will enter through the way of the outer gate, and through the same gate he will enter and exit' (John 10), has free will and the power to lay down his life and take it up again. And when he comes to us or ascends to the heavens, he exercises the same authority of his majesty. Finally, he does not seek markets, nor solemnities, nor does he observe any difference in days: because every time is a celebration for him. But the people only enter and exit the markets and solemnities: and not through the same path, but through one and then another. For it is written: And when the people of the land enter before the Lord in solemnities: let the one who entered through the North gate to worship, exit through the way of the South gate, and let the one who entered through the South gate, exit through the way of the North gate: he shall not return through the gate by which he entered, but he shall exit opposite to it. This is not only commanded to those who depart from Sodom, and it is said to them: Do not look back (Gen. XIX, 17); nor to those who put their hand to the plow, so that they do not look at the things that are behind them: but even to those who are established in the house of the Lord, they are commanded not to look back and turn to the needy and weak elements, and being initiated in the spirit, to be consumed (or consumed) by the flesh ((Al. consumed)): but to proceed also from spiritual things to greater things, and to say with the Apostle: Forgetting the past, and extending myself towards the things that are before (Phil. III, 13): so that they may not know in part and prophesy in part, but may come to perfection according to the perfection that human nature can achieve, so that we understand that Gospel saying: So you also, when you have done everything you were commanded to do, should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty' (Luke XVII, 10). And the Apostle in the same Epistle speaks of two perfections: for he writes as if he were imperfect: Not as though I have already attained, or were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:13). And immediately he speaks as if he were perfect: Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Therefore, let us understand this: however many of us are perfect, let us know this. For how can the statement stand, that the one who said, 'Not because I have already received, or because I am already perfect,' dare to say, 'However many of us are perfect, let us know this?' From this it is clear that every person and the whole creation, although they have come to perfection, still need the mercy of God and possess full perfection through grace, not through merit. Therefore, it is commanded to the people of the land, that if someone enters through the gate of the North to worship, they should exit through the way of the gate of the South. Who is this people to whom this is commanded? It is surely the pagans; those who, leaving the gate of the North, from where evils flare up upon the earth, have entered the temple, should not exit except through the way of the gate of the South, to the gate of light, to the gate of heat, to the gate where the bridegroom lies at noon (Jer. I). Finally, it is said in the same Song of Songs: Arise, O north wind, and come, O south wind (Song of Solomon IV, 16). But whoever enters through the south gate should exit through the north gate. Who is this people? It is the Jews, who, abandoning the gate of the way of light, go to the north gate, of whom it is said: The north wind, a very strong wind (Jeremiah I). For even the pot of Jeremiah is lit from the face of the north. Let us also say this: Through the north gate enters the one who forgives sins, and through the south gate exits the one who follows virtues. And on the contrary, if the righteous person falls into sin, he enters indeed through the southern gate, but he exits through the way of the northern gate. And the Prince, he says, will be in their midst, namely, of those who enter and those who exit, according to what is written: He stands in the midst of you, whom you do not know (John 1:26). And the Apostle says: Do you not know that Christ is in you (2 Corinthians 13:5)? But if it is said to those who do not know that Christ stands in their midst, how much more to those who know! But while Christ stood among the knowledgeable, then the dead body will become because of sin, and the living spirit because of righteousness. Indeed, the prince enters with those who enter, and exits with those who exit, witnessing the power and sin of both. Therefore, at the fairs and solemnities, namely the Sabbaths, Kalends, and all the festivals we have spoken about before, both a calf and a ram will be offered as sacrifices, each measuring an ephah. But in the offerings, there will not be a fixed number, nor a diminished will; but with strength, each person will offer according to their ability and with a clear conscience: offering as much as they can, not as much as they want, and above all, a hin of oil for each ephah of flour, so that it may be used for anointing and a lamp may be lit in the presence of the Lord. And those who use it may say: But I am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of the Lord (Ps. 51:10).

<h2 id='tocuniq346'>(Vers. 12 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 12 and following) When the prince offers a voluntary burnt offering or a voluntary peace offering to the Lord, the gate facing east shall be opened for him, and he shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offering as is customary on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out, the gate shall be closed. He shall also offer a year-old lamb without blemish as a burnt offering to the Lord every day. He shall offer it in the morning and in the evening. And he shall offer as a grain offering a sixth of an ephah of grain and a third of a hin of olive oil, mixed with the grain offering. This is a perpetual ordinance to the Lord. You will make a lamb and a sacrifice, and oil every morning, a perpetual burnt offering. Where we read immaculate, in Hebrew it is written Thamim (), which the Aquila perfectum. And where LXX Manaa (): Theodotion, sacrifice; Aquila and Symmachus, they translate as gift. But for what we said, spontaneous, LXX translated as ὁμολογίαν, that is, confession: and for prince, they translate as leader, for this Nasi () signifies. Moreover, there is still talk of a prince, about whom Isaiah speaks: Behold, I have given him as a witness to the nations, a prince and a teacher among the nations (Isaiah 55:4). And Ezekiel says: And I, the Lord, will be their God, and David will be their prince among them (Ezekiel 34:24). Therefore, when this prince acts willingly and says: May the voluntary and spontaneous offerings of my mouth be pleasing to you, Lord (Psalm 119:108): the voluntary burnt offering, which means offering oneself entirely to God, and the peaceful voluntary offerings, which are not mentioned earlier; for it is written: And the priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings: and concerning the voluntary and spontaneous offerings, which are now mentioned, it is completely silent, so that they are not done out of necessity, but out of free will: after the burnt offering, he shall offer the peaceful offerings and reconcile with God. Whereas virginity is greater than marriage (I Cor. VII), because it is not demanded, nor is it returned, but it is offered. The propitiatory offerings, which are called Selamim in Hebrew, are interpreted as salvific by the LXX: so too the reconciliation of the peace offerings is the salvation of the one offering them. Therefore, when the prince has done this, the gate will be opened to him; or according to the Septuagint, the gate that faces the East will be opened for him; that is, that gate about which it is written: 'This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter through it' (Ps. CXVII, 20), and from where the sun of justice arises. And he will make his burnt offering, and his peace offerings: of which we have now spoken. He shall do it alone, because it is his spontaneous sacrifice, and the priests shall not offer these things for him, nor shall they mix the sacrifices with the people. And at any time the burnt offering or the peace offering, which is offered voluntarily, has the gate of the Lord reserved: neither shall he observe the sabbath, but all days shall be to him as a day of rest. Finally, after he has offered the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he shall immediately go out, and the door shall be closed after him, or the door shall be closed: so that his privilege as prince may be preserved, and his sacrifices may not be mixed with the people. And because he had said in general, a voluntary holocaust, or a peaceful voluntary offering to the Lord, and had not added a bull or a calf, and a ram or a sheep, and a male goat for sin, he teaches what the holocaust itself should be: saying, 'You shall make a yearling immaculate lamb a holocaust; and not on certain days, but daily, and not at any hour, but in the morning, morning he shall make it; particularly every morning, when the sun rises and the beginning of light appears.' About whom David speaks in the psalm: In the morning, you will hear my voice; in the morning, I will stand before you and see (Ps. 5:4). And in another place: Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the morning (Ps. 30:6). And again: O God, you are my God; early will I seek you (Ps. 63:1). But as for that spotless lamb, or perfect and year-old lamb, Isaiah explains more fully, saying: He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth (Isa. 53:7). And Jeremiah: But I was like an innocent lamb led to the slaughter; I did not know (Jer. XI, 19). And John the Baptist: Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world (John I, 29). This is the lamb that was sacrificed in Egypt, whose blood the doorposts of faith are marked with, and the destroyer is excluded (Exod. XII). And the year of the Lord's favor, and the day of retribution. And the reader should not be surprised if he is also called prince, and priest, and calf, and ram, and lamb, since in the Holy Scriptures we read of him as Lord, and God, and man, and prophet, and staff, and root, and flower, and prince, and judge, and king, righteous, and justice, apostle, and bishop, arm, servant, ointment, shepherd, son, and child, only-begotten, and first-born, door, way, angel, arrow, wisdom, and many others, all of which, if I were to want to recount the testimonies, would require their own book. Therefore, the high priest himself will perform the sacrifice of that immaculate and yearling lamb in the holocaust, which is offered every morning. This sacrifice is called the Manaa, and it consists of a sixth part of an ephah of fine flour. A sixth part of an ephah is half a modius. For if an ephah is a tenth part of a cor, which is three modii, then undoubtedly a sixth part of an ephah makes half a modius. Of oil, a third part of a hin is offered, in order to mix it with or sprinkle it upon the sacrifice of fine flour, which is a legitimate, perpetual offering to God that is never interrupted. It is offered at all times, from the rising of the sun, so that what is written at the end of this chapter may be fulfilled: 'He shall offer a lamb for a sacrifice and oil every morning, a perpetual holocaust.'


<h2 id='tocuniq347'>(Vers. 16, 17 et seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 16, 17 and following) Thus says the Lord God: If a prince (or leader) gives a gift to someone from his own sons, it shall be the inheritance of his sons; they shall possess it as an inheritance. But if he gives a legacy from his own inheritance to one of his servants, it shall belong to him until the year of release (for which Theodotius put the Hebrew word 'Deror'), but it shall return to the prince; however, the inheritance shall belong to his son. And the prince shall not take the inheritance of the people by violence, and from their possession: but out of his own possession he shall give an inheritance to his sons: that my people may not be scattered each one from his possession. Thus far the discourse is concerning the prince, now precepts are given concerning his heirs: indeed concerning gifts, inheritance, and legacies, to whom he ought to give them, and whose possession is either for a time, or eternal. If, says he, he shall give a gift or inheritance to his sons, they shall possess it: because it is due to them by the right of succession, and possession cannot pass from one to another. But if he has given any of his servants as a legatee, he shall possess them as long as the remission year, which is called the Year of Release (), or the jubilee, which is the fiftieth year, comes: when all sales and gifts revert to the previous owners: so that the servant has the use for a time, and the ownership of the possession of the prince's sons. But what follows: And the prince shall not take from the inheritance of the people by violence (Lev. XXIII), or as the Septuagint has translated, to oppress them, or as Aquila and Symmachus, to afflict and distress them: but he shall give his inheritance to his sons from his own possession: this rebukes not only the priests and princes of that time, but also our own, who become richer by the dignity of the priesthood and, besides what is owed to them by the Lord's disposition, take away from the poor by violence: or under the name of honor, strip the wealthy, so that they also leave nothing to their own sons, to whom paternal inheritance is due, except what has been left to them by their parents. Therefore, whoever is a wealthier priest, when he comes to the priesthood, should not give whatever excess he has to his children, but to the poor, and to holy brothers, and to the faithful domestic servants, who surpass the merits of children, so that he may render to the Lord what belongs to the Lord, who speaks in the Gospel: Whatever you have done to the least of these, you have done to me (Matt. 25:40). For he is received as a guest in the poor; he is visited in prison; he is clothed in nakedness; he drinks when thirsty; he is satiated when hungry. So that my people, he says, may not be scattered from their possession. For if the ruler has the power, either to receive or to take by force, or to hold under the pretext of honor, that which does not belong to him, and to leave it to his children, the people who were gathered in the name of God will be scattered and torn apart: either according to the Law, so that the inheritance of one gradually passes to another, and the cord of division perishes, through which perhaps the inheritance comes to each individual. Therefore, he disperses the people of God and takes away from them the eternal possession of faith, who abandons the gifts or goods of others, either through theft, robbery, flattery, seduction, or under the pretext of religion, to his own children, brothers, and relatives.

<h2 id='tocuniq348'>(Vers. 19 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 19 and following) And he led me through the entrance that was on the side (or behind) the gate into the treasuries of the sanctuary, to the priests (or into chambers and rooms) that faced north. And there was a place there that faced west (or the sea: and as the LXX translated, separated). And he said to me: This is the place where the priests boil for the offense and for the sin (or for ignorance and therefore) where they boil the sacrifice (or the manna and the offering) so that they do not carry it out into the outer court, and the people may be sanctified. And he led me into the outer courtyard, and he led me around the four corners of the courtyard. And behold, there was a smaller courtyard in the corner of the courtyard, with a smaller courtyard in each corner of the courtyard. In the four corners of the courtyard, the smaller courtyards were arranged, forty cubits in length and thirty cubits in width. The measurements of each were the same: and a wall surrounded the four smaller courtyards in a circle. And kitchens were built underneath the colonnades around (or near) the dining areas, which Aquila interpreted as recesses, Symmachus as enclosures, and Theodotion put the Hebrew word Turoth itself. And he said, 'This is the house of the kitchens, where the ministers of the house cook the sacrifices of the people. For in Hebrew, Zeba means a man who holds a reed in his hand and a string of a mason, with which he measures the building. He led me, he says, through the entrance, which was on the side of the gate or behind the gate. He did not specify which gate, whether eastern, southern, or of another direction, but left it uncertain so that I would go to the place of the sanctuary, and to the treasury, or to the chambers of the priests, which faced north and the sea, namely, to the north and west. Holy Scripture has the custom of always calling the sea the west, according to the position of the land of Judaea. And it is to be noted that the place of the priests, where they cook sacrifices for transgressions, or ignorance, and for sins, so that they are not offered raw, is situated in the outer court facing north and west, from where the coldest wind arises and where the light of the sun sets. From this it is evident that whatever pertains to food is either for error or for sin. But if a sacrifice is offered also for ignorance, how much more for the consciousness of a transgression! Hence, Job offered a daily morning sacrifice for his sons, fearing that they had transgressed in ignorance. But what follows, 'So that they do not offer in the outer court, and the people who were not prepared for sanctification may be sanctified,' means that we should not lightly give holy things to those who are not sanctified, nor should we cast pearls before swine, nor give what is holy to dogs, as the Gospel says. Finally, Moses wished the people to be sanctified for three days from all impurity and from the embrace of their wives, so that they might approach Mount Sinai and receive the holy things when they were sanctified. But if they were commanded to be sanctified from their wives in order to approach and receive the words of God, it is clear that it is contained in the Law of the Apostles: 'Do not defraud one another, unless by consent for a time, so that you may give yourselves to prayer.' And with consent, we must abstain from our wives so that we may give ourselves to prayer. After this, it is written, 'And he led me into the outer court and led me around the four corners of the court. And behold, there was a small courtyard in the corner of the court, with small courtyards placed in each corner of the court, arranged in the four corners of the court.' That man, whom he often mentions, led him out from the place of the priests, which faced north or was separate, where the priests cook for transgressions, sins, or ignorance, and led him into the outer court. From this we understand that the court from which he went out was inside, and there were many courts in the Holy Scriptures, about which we read, 'You who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.' And in John, 'And I have other sheep that are not of this fold, and it is necessary that I bring them also, and they will hear my voice, and there will be one fold and one shepherd.' For this in Greek is called αὐλὴ, which the simple Latin translation rendered as a sheepfold. But when he says, 'of this fold,' he shows that there is another one, which is either demonstrated in the multitude of the nations for the distinction from Israel or in heaven for the separation of the earthly fold. And according to the quality of merits, each office is assigned to a particular court, about which we have spoken more fully earlier. But this court that is now being discussed had small courtyards at each of its four corners, which the Seventy call minor, and we have called them small courtyards for the sake of easier understanding. They were forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide. Concerning these numbers, I remember that I have discussed in this same work that one refers to tribulations and narrowness, the other to perfect age. For forty days, Moses, Elijah, the Lord and Savior fasted in the wilderness, and they reach the priestly office not after the twenty-fifth year of age, but after the thirtieth. Therefore, the Lord was thirty years old when he came for baptism, and in this same work, the thirtieth year is mentioned at the beginning. Wherever there is food, there is also distress and temptation through which provisions are obtained. And when we reach the perfect age of man, everything must be trampled upon, and we must say, 'Having food and clothing, let us be content with these.' And, 'If the Lord gives me food to eat and clothes to cover me.' Or certainly, 'Food for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will destroy both it and them.' For we will not eat or drink in the future, but we will be nourished by the bread that descends from heaven, about which it is sung in the Psalms, 'Man ate the bread of angels.' And, 'My food is to do the will of him who sent me.' But concerning the measure of the small courtyards, which possessed the corners of the large court, it signifies the four regions of the world. For in the sweat of our faces we eat bread, and every laborally profiting conduces to the stomach. Those four small courtyards or one wall surrounded, and kitchens were built underneath the colonnades all around, or they had nearby alcoves, so that where there is food, there is also the preparation of measures. And lest the prophet might not know what these things that he saw were, he said to him, 'This is the house of the kitchens, where the ministers of the Lord cook the sacrifices of the people.' Indeed, the sacrifices of the people, which are offered for transgressions, sins, and ignorance, are the food and refreshment of the priests, so that they remember not to seek anything else when the meats are also prepared for their refreshment in the temple.

<h2 id='tocuniq349'>(Chap. XLVII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 47, verses 1 and following) And he brought me back to the door of the house, and behold, water was coming out from under the threshold of the house eastward. For the face of the house was toward the east, and the water was flowing down from the right side of the temple, south of the altar. Then he led me out by way of the north gate and led me around on the outside to the outer gate that faces toward the east; and behold, water was trickling from the right side. When the man went out toward the east with a line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he led me through the water, water reaching the ankles (or passed through water of remission). And he measured again a thousand, and he led me through the water up to the knees (or he passed in the water unto the thighs). And he measured a thousand, and he led me through the water up to the loins (or he passed in the water unto the waist). And he measured a thousand of a deep, which I could not pass over, because the waters were risen, waters of a deep river, which could not be passed over. For which LXX have translated: And he measured a thousand, and could not pass over: because the water was bearing a stream like the rapid stream, which cannot be passed over. These waters which were flowing out from beneath the threshold of the house, that is, the temple, did not flow towards the North and the West, but also towards the East, and on the right side of the temple, that is, towards the South, and towards the very South not of any place, but of the altar. From this it becomes clear that the waters are sacred, and they signify the doctrine of our Savior, according to that which is written: 'For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem' (Isaiah 2:3). And in another place: The knowledge of the Lord fills everything, like water covering the sea (Isai. XI, 9). Concerning these waters, the Prophet Zacharias also predicted, saying: In that day, living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half of it toward the eastern sea and half of it toward the western sea (Zach. XIV, 8). Concerning these waters, the Lord spoke to the Samaritan woman: If you knew who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water (John IV, 10). And again: Everyone who drinks from this water will be thirsty again; but whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again (John 4:13). And in the temple he cried out and said: If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me (as the scripture says), out of his belly will flow rivers of living water. But this he said of the Spirit, which those who believed in him were to receive (John 7:37-38). These are the waters that the prophet spoke of in the psalm: He led me beside still waters (Psalm 23:3). And Ezekiel: I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses. (Ezek. XXXVI, 24, 25). For water fountains appeared. And in the ninety-second Psalm it is sung: The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voices from the voices of many waters. Wonderful are the elevations of the sea. (Ps. XCII, 2, 3). These are the waters of Siloam, which flow with silence, of which Isaiah speaks: You shall draw waters with joy from the fountains of salvation. (Isaiah XII, 3). And the Psalmist says: Bless the Lord from the fountains of Israel (Ps. 67). Likewise, Isaiah speaks of the Lord as Savior: He, it is said, shall dwell in the high cave of the strongest rock. Bread shall be given to him, and his water shall be faithful (Isa. 33:16). For water burst forth in the desert, and a valley in a thirsty land. And it is said to the believers: Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; you are mine, and if you pass through water, I am with you (Isa. 43:1, 2). And again: 'All you who are thirsty, come to the water' (Isaiah 55:1). And through Jeremiah, God speaks: 'My people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water' (Jeremiah 2:13). Therefore, just as we read in a good sense the waters that flow from the threshold of the temple and are returned to the teaching of the Church, so are bitter waters and the worst waters to which the prophet Jeremiah forbids us to approach, saying: 'What have you to do with the way of Egypt, to drink from the waters of the Nile?' (ibid). The Hebrew term for 'turbid and muddy' is Sior. Regarding these, God speaks angrily about the heretics: Behold, I will feed them with bitterness and give them poisonous water to drink (Jeremiah 9:15), in which the Egyptian dragon reigns, saying: The rivers are mine, and I made them; he who sees all that is high, and he himself is the king of those who are in the waters. Therefore, the man from Sirach prays to the Lord and says: Save me, O Lord, for the waters have come up to my neck. I am stuck in the mud of the deep, and there is no substance, and the storm has engulfed me (Ps. 68:1-2). And again; Deliver me from those who hate me, and from the depths of the waters: let not the water storm overwhelm me, nor let the depths swallow me up, nor let the pit close its mouth over me (Ps. 15:16). And in another psalm: If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, let Israel now say: If it had not been the Lord who was on our side. When men rose up against us, then they might have swallowed us up alive. When their fury was raging against us, perhaps the water would have swallowed us up (Psalm 123:1-3). And the Bride in the Song of Songs: Many waters cannot quench love, nor can rivers drown it (Song of Songs 8:7). This is the water of which Hosea speaks: The city of Galaad has scorned me, a city that works in vanities, disturbing the water, and the strength of its men are pirates (Hosea 6:7-8). This water is called by another name, Mara, which means bitterness; into it the wood of the Cross is placed, and the bitter is turned into sweet. Consider the law of Moses, if understood according to the carnal sense of the Jews, how bitter it is, 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth' (Exodus XXI); see the fornication of Thamar (II Kings XIII), and the joining of the prostitute by Hosea (Hosea I, Jeremiah XIII), Moses' Ethiopian wife, and the killing of the Egyptian, and a thousand other things, which if understood according to the literal sense, and not according to the life-giving spirit, are bitter, and do not edify the reader as much as they destroy (Numbers XII, Exodus II). Therefore, those waters which flow out from the temple of the Lord, and proceed to the East, and descend to the right side of the Temple, to the South of the altar, where the bridegroom feeds his guests, and reclines. But what follows: And he led me by the way of the North gate, and turned to the way outside the outer gate, the way that looked towards the East, he covertly shows that we cannot immediately reach the Eastern gate, unless we go around it through the way of the North gate. For unless we conquer the most extreme cold by the heat of faith, and trample on its regions, that may be fulfilled in us what is in the Apostle: But the God of peace shall crush Satan under your feet speedily. (Rom. 16:20), we will not be able to enter the gate through which the waters flow out, which are on the right side. And note that those waters that enter through the gate of the East flee so much towards the left side, that they are described as going from the right side of the altar to the South. But the man, he said, who had a rope in his hand, when he had led me through the gate on the outer side to the road that looked towards the East, and he himself was also in the same place, measured the same water a thousand cubits; and he led me through the water up to the ankles, which Aquila and Symmachus, and Theodotio rendered as 'ankles', for which the LXX rendered: and he passed into the water, the water of forgiveness: which we can understand as signifying the first sins of men, which are forgiven for us when we enter the waters of the Lord, and they show the saving grace of baptism and are the beginnings of progress, yet they themselves are sublime. Finally, they reach the ankles, which are close to the heel and exposed to the bites of snakes, as the Lord says: You will watch out for its head, and it will watch out for your heel (Gen. III, 15, according to the Septuagint). And in the Psalms about Judas the betrayer, it is said: He who ate my bread has magnified treachery against me (Ps. XL, 10), or rather the heel, for the Greek word πτέρνη (or πτέρνα in some manuscripts) means heel. But after one thousand cubits, which bring us to the ankle, he measures another thousand cubits in water and leads me up to the knees. After the forgiveness of sins, and during the journey of progress, when we attempt to ascend even a little from earthly things to higher ones, we bend our knees to the Lord, with the Apostle saying: So that every knee shall bow, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father (Philippians 2:10). He measures another three thousand cubits, and leads me through the water up to my waist, he says. For we climb to lofty heights by degrees: but those very heights descend to the loins and kidneys, so that every base desire within us is cut off; and we possess the sanctification of the body, without which no one sees God. Hence in the same Prophet it is written: 'From His feet to His loins He is a fiery God' (Ezekiel 8:2). For the loins need fire and purgation, as the just man says, 'For my loins are filled with illusions' (Psalm 38:8), through which the enemy deludes us both in the day and in the night time. But from the loins to the head and neck, it shines with the glitter of precious electrum, so that it has nothing filthy in itself, nothing of cheapness. Hence it is now said in the fourth (book): And he measured a thousand, with the addition of cubits, of a torrent (which the Septuagint did not translate), which I could not go through: much better than the Seventy who said, and he could not go through. For the prophet and all human nature, after the loins of the torrent of thoughts, and the incentives of vices in the heart, cannot go through. But that man, who was clothed with Baddim and was the leader of the prophets, passed through easily; who did not commit sin, nor was guile found in his mouth (Isaiah 56). And he gives the reasons why the prophet could not pass through a thousand cubits: because, he says, the deep waters of the torrent had swelled, which could not be crossed. And as it is written, with the prophet boasting: Our soul has passed through the torrent (Psalm 124, 5). But it is easily resolved if we know that this is written in Hebrew: A torrent passed through my soul. Concerning this torrent, Isaiah says: Behold, I will extend peace over them like a river, and the glory like a overflowing torrent (Isa. LXVI, 12). And in the thirty-fifth psalm, it is said about the saints: They will hope in the protection of your wings. They will be intoxicated with the abundance of your house, and you will give them to drink from the river of your delights; for with you is the fountain of life (Psal. XXXV, 8, 9). And on the hundred and twenty-fifth: Convert, O Lord, our captivity, like a stream in the South (Psalm 125:5). And about the Savior: He shall drink from the brook by the wayside (Psalm 110:7). For who among men can boast of having a pure heart? (Proverbs 20). Or whose mind, through the windows of the eyes, shall not be entered by the death of desire (Jeremiah 9), and, dare I say, the tickling of the soul? For the world is placed in the evil one (1 John 5:19), and from childhood the heart of man is inclined to evil, so that from the very beginning of his birth, not even for one day, is human condition without sin (Job 15). And David confesses in the psalm: Behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins my mother conceived me (Ps. 50:7). Not in the iniquities of my mother, or certainly mine, but in the iniquities of human condition. Hence the Apostle says: Death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam's transgression (Rom. 5:14). We use the term cubits, in the masculine gender and not neutral, according to the rule of grammarians, as I have taught in previous passages. We do this not out of ignorance, but out of custom for the sake of the simple and uneducated, among whom the majority is in the congregation of the Church.


<h2 id='tocuniq350'>(Vers. 6 seqq.)</h2>

(Ver. 6 seqq.) And he said to me: You have certainly seen, son of man; and he brought me out, and turned me toward the bank of the river (or the stream). And when I turned (or had turned), behold, on the bank of the river (or the stream) there were very many trees (or very many trees) on both sides. And he said to me: These waters that go out to the hills of the East (or Oriental), and go down to the plains of the desert (or this water that goes out into Galilee, which turns to the East, and goes down to Arabia), shall enter the sea, and shall go out, and the waters shall be healed. And every living creature (or animal) that crawls (or of crawling creatures), wherever the torrent (or river) shall come, shall live; and there shall be very many fish, after these waters come there; and they shall be healed, and all things to which the torrent (or river) shall come shall live. And the fishermen shall stand upon its banks from Engaddi even to Engallim; it shall be a place to spread their nets. The fish of it shall be of very many kinds, like the fish of the great sea, exceeding many. But the marshes that go out of the banks will not be healed, but will be given to the salt marshes. And over the torrent (or river) there shall spring up on its banks on both sides every fruit-bearing tree, its leaf shall not wither (or it shall not grow old): and its fruit shall not fail. Every month they shall bring forth first fruits (or all things shall be renewed); because its waters shall go forth from the sanctuary, and its fruit shall be for food, and its leaves for medicine (or its ascent for health). Although this whole chapter may be lengthy, I wanted to present it all at once so as not to interrupt the reader's understanding and to avoid disrupting the listener's comprehension. First, it should be noted that in Hebrew it is called Nehel () and in Greek it is called χειμάῤῥους, which the Septuagint translates as 'river'. Then, for Galilee, which is called Galila () in Hebrew, Aquila translates it as θίνας, which means 'sand dunes'; Symmachus translates it as μεθόριον, which we can translate as 'border'. Symmachus also transferred to Arabia, which is uninhabitable; Aquila, the low and flat areas; Theodotius, to Araba. Let us therefore say what seems to us in each. That man who was the leader of Ezekiel, advises the prophet to look more closely and see, and to attentively observe the hidden mysteries with the eyes of the mind. He calls the son of man, or in the likeness of the Lord and Savior; and indeed Ezekiel is interpreted as strength, or the kingdom of God: or certainly for the disturbance of human weakness; lest he forget his own condition, while great things are shown to him: and he leads and turns to the bank of the river, so that because he could not cross the middle depth, at least he may recognize those things which are on the banks. And when, he said, I turned, or he turned me, who was the guide and teacher; behold on the river bank, or the stream, many logs, or very many trees on both sides. This torrent, which is carried by the abundance of water like a torrent, and receives rain from the sky, as we mentioned in the previous lesson, is called a river by LXX, because it has perpetual waters: not from rains collected here and there, but from a living and perpetual source. Of which river we read many things in the holy Scriptures; but for the present few things are to be said, and first this: The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice, the floods have lifted up their waves. (Psalm 93:3) And in Isaiah: I will make a way in the desert and rivers in the wilderness (Isa. XLIII, 19). And in another place of the same book, more clearly: There will appear in Zion a river flowing glorious in a thirsty land (Isa. XLIV, 3). Above this river there were many trees on both sides of the bank; so that between two instruments, the old and the new, the enclosed river would flow. However, there were many wood or rather, very many trees, which I believe abound in various fruits as the Scripture mentions in paradise; and the leading guide and teacher, the prophet, teaches and says: These waters that come out, either into the Galilee of the Gentiles, according to the Septuagint, or (as it is more accurately contained in Hebrew) into the hills of the eastern sand, and they descend to the plains of the desert, or to Arabia, they will enter the sea, or to the ends of the sea, and the waters will be healed. We previously said that waters either signify the grace of baptism or the Evangelical doctrine. If these waters leave the threshold of the Lord's temple and hold fast to the Apostolic discipline, they make the previously barren and infertile hills fruitful and turn everything flat and deserted into a well-watered land, so that they embody the sacrament of the Jordan River. This river, which Elisha cured with Evangelical and Apostolic salt, transformed barrenness and death into abundance and life. Not only did they heal the deserts, but they entered the Dead Sea, a sea in which nothing living could exist, and the most bitter sea, which in Greek is called λίμνην ἀσφαλτῖτιν, that is, the lake of bitumen. And in a wonderful way, the dead waters are healed by the waters of the Gospel, which, because they have nothing living in them, are given the name of death. For they had not known Him who says: I am the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). And truly, according to the letter, nothing that breathes and can walk can be found in this sea due to excessive bitterness: not even snails, small worms, eels, and other types of animals or serpents, whose bodies we can know more than their names. Finally, if the Jordan river, swollen by rain, carries fish to this place, they immediately die and float on the oily waters. Since these things have no usefulness, as simple speech testifies, even if they were done, which the foolish superstition of the Jews believes, they will have many fish according to the spiritual understanding of the Lord, when the river is healed, and all things will live to which this river has come; so that fishermen will stand on the shores from Engedi to En-galim: the former means the source or spring of goats, and the latter means the source or spring of calves. For in the beginning, there is the sea of the Dead, where the Jordan enters. And there is En-gedi, where it ends and is consumed. But I believe that the Dead Sea is the one Zacharias speaks of: In that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half of it towards the eastern sea and half towards the western sea (Zach. XIV, 8). Daniel also agrees with these words: I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea (Dan. VII, 2). And David: The waves of the sea are marvelous (Psal. XCII, 4). And from the person of the Savior in the Psalm: Come into the deep sea and the tempest has overwhelmed me (Psalm 68, 2). The King of Egypt also is called the dragon according to the same Ezekiel (Ezekiel 32), who dwells in the sea, and stirs up the rivers as with his horns. And again, This great and spacious sea (Psalm 103, 25). As long as it has not taken in the waters of the river, or the torrent, it kills everything that is in it; but the Lord, of whom it is said, He will strike, and he will heal us after two days, and on the third day we shall rise, and we shall live in his sight (Hosea 6, 23), He speaks in the same Prophet Hosea: I have bound up Ephraim, I have taken him upon my arm, and they have not known, because I have healed them in the corruption of man (Hosea 11, 9); who was wounded for our sins, and weakened for our iniquities. By the discipline of our peace on him, and by his bruises we were healed (Isaiah 53:5). He himself healed this sea, which is very salty and dead with excessive bitterness, by his death. He who says through Isaiah: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me; he has sent me to bring good news to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted (Isaiah 61:1). Therefore, he also cries out through Jeremiah: Return, O backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings (Jeremiah 3:22). For the impatient people have said, unable to bear the pain of their wounds any longer: Summer has passed, the harvest is over, and we are not saved. Then the Lord answered them: Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the healing of the daughter of my people not come (Jeremiah 8:22)? And Jeremiah himself cries out and says: Heal me, O Lord, and I will be healed; save me and I will be saved (Jeremiah 17:14). Finally, the angels who were the protectors of the people of the Jews at that time when the foolish crowd cried out, saying, 'His blood be upon us and upon our children' (Matth. XXVII, 25); and, 'The veil of the temple was torn, and all the Hebrew sacraments were revealed,' they responded to the Lord who was commanding, and said, 'We have cared for Babylon, and she has not been healed: let us leave her' (Jerem. LI, 9), the city of confusion and vices. And Josephus also relates in his History that after the Lord was crucified and the veil of the temple was torn, or the doorpost of the temple collapsed, a voice was heard in the innermost part of the temple of celestial powers, saying, Let us depart from these dwellings. All of this is not said in vain, but necessarily, because the Dead Sea, when the river of the Lord flows into it, is said to be healed. Above this sea, from Engedi, the eye and fountain of the goat, which is always offered for sin at Engallim, the fountain of the calves that are sacrificed to the Lord, and they imitate the calf carrying its horns and hooves, which in the type of the Savior is sacrificed at the altar, there will be fishermen, to whom the Lord Jesus speaks: Come to me, and I will make you fishers of men (Matt. IV, 19): of whom also Jeremiah says: Behold, I will send fishermen (Jer. XVI, 16). And there will be very many species, indeed, genera of fish in the once-dead sea. These fish, at the command of the Lord, were drawn out by Peter to the right side, and they were one hundred fifty-three: so much so that because of their multitude the nets were torn (John 21). However, those who have written about the nature and properties of animals, both in Latin and Greek language, say that there are one hundred fifty-three fishing methods, which were all used by the apostles, and nothing remained uncaught, while both noble and common, rich and poor, and every kind of human being from the sea of this world is drawn out for salvation. But what follows, In its shores and swamps, or in those that extend beyond the shores, the waters will not be healed, covertly shows that those who were not in Noah's ark will perish during the reign of the flood; and those whom the river did not touch will not receive health; but they will be thrown into salt pits, as it is written: When the pestilence rages, the fool becomes wiser (Prov. XIX, 25). For the examples of the wicked educate the good. Whether they are given in the salt ponds, according to what is written in the Gospel: Salt is good; but if the salt has become tasteless, with what will it be seasoned? (Matthew 5:13) so that they may forever lack fruits and vitality. This is also demonstrated by a city that, after its destruction, is sprinkled with salt. But above the torrent or river, on its banks, every fruitful tree, or as they all agree, βρῶσιμον (Al. βρῶμα) which gives food and nourishment and can be eaten, is called in the Hebrew language, Machal, and nothing will decay in it according to the Septuagint, but its fruits will be renewed daily, and its leaves will not wither, and its fruit will not fail; according to what is written in the first psalm. And he shall be like a tree, which is planted near the running waters, that shall bring forth its fruit in due season. And his leaf shall not fall off (Psalm 1:3). Each month, he says, it shall bring forth its firstfruits, or as it is written in the Septuagint: Its fruit shall be its firstfruits in its renewal; so that all the fruits of the believers may be firstfruits, and each month may be assigned to each apostle. And this shall happen, because its waters shall come forth from the sanctuary: Let us not think that the abundance of banks, trees, or months, is the cause and source of such great fruitfulness: because its waters shall come forth from the sanctuary. Therefore it is not of the one who wants or of the one who runs, but of God who shows mercy (Rom. 9:16). The principle of all these trees is the tree of life, which is understood as wisdom, of which it is written: The tree of life is to all who believe in it (Prov. 3). And that which is said: And its fruits shall be for food, and its leaves for medicine, demonstrates the sacraments of the divine books: of which one pertains to the letter, the other to the spirit: so that we may understand simple words in the leaves, and the hidden meaning in the fruits. For just as the knowledge of the Scriptures leads to the kingdom of heaven and provides us with the bread that says, 'I am the bread that came down from heaven' (John 6:41), so do its leaves contain moral doctrine and offer healing, so that they may heal the wounds of sinners. Concerning the leaves, which are called 'Ale' in Hebrew, they were translated by the Septuagint as 'ascension,' because it can also be understood in such a way that after partaking of the nourishment of the fruits, we ascend to heavenly things by the admonitions of the words.


<h2 id='tocuniq351'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verse 13, 14) Thus says the Lord God: This is the boundary in which you shall possess the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel, for Joseph has a double portion. Each of you shall possess it equally as his brother, to whom I raised my hand to give it to your fathers; and this land shall fall to you as a possession. Because we said that Joseph has a double portion, the Septuagint translated it as an increase of the portion. For indeed Joseph is interpreted as increase; understanding the matter instead of the name, and confusing the mind of the reader. For when the Levite tribe was subtracted and delegated to temple sacrifices, there remained eleven tribes, of which the tribe of Joseph was divided into two, Ephraim and Manasseh, who said to Joshua the son of Nun: Why have you given me the possession of one lot and one portion, since I am of such a great multitude, and the Lord has blessed me? To which Joshua responded: If you are a large population, go up into the forest and clear for yourself the spaces in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaim, because the possession of the mountain of Ephraim is narrow for you (Joshua 17: 14, 15). And again, Joshua said to the house of Ephraim and Manasseh: You are a large and powerful people, you shall not have one portion, but you shall go to the mountain and clear for yourself spaces to dwell, and you will be able to advance further when you have driven out the Canaanite, who you say has iron chariots and is strongest (Ibid., 27). We say this for the following reason: because the Scriptures now mention Joseph, that is, Ephraim and Manasseh, as having a double portion. But each tribe, according to its own multitude, receives equal portions of land, not divided by the will of the divider, but by lot, which is in the power of the Lord. Finally, even Joshua himself, who was the divider of the land, did not separate for himself a particular piece of land, so as not to appear to have chosen the best; but he received from the leaders of all the tribes, Timnath-serah in the mount of Ephraim.


<h2 id='tocuniq352'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(Versed. 15 seqq.) This is the end of the land on the northern side, from the great sea, for those coming from Ethalon, Sadada, Emath, Berotha, Sabarim, which is between the middle of Damascus and the border of Emath: the courtyard of Thicon (Vulg. house of Atthicon), which is near the borders of Auran (or Auranitis). And the boundary will be from the sea to the courtyard of Enon (or Seraranan), the boundary of Damascus, and from the North to the North the boundary of Emath on the northern side (Vulg. and the boundary of Emath; on the northern side). Concerning the description of the land of the holy twelve tribes, commanded by Joshua the son of Nun, and which is now ruled by Ezekiel, it is worth noting that there the land is divided among the tribes by lot, as ordained by the Lord. In the Book of Numbers (Num. XXXIV), which divides the entire promised land into four regions in a brief discourse, the description of the northern region is as follows: Starting from the north, that is, the northern border, they will begin from the Great Sea, reaching up to the highest mountain, from which you will come to Hamath, to the borders of Zedad, they will go to Ziphrona and the town of Enam, also known as Aser Enon. And the Hebrews say that the northern region begins from the Great Sea, which extends along the coasts of Palestine, Phoenicia, the region called Coele Syria, and Cilicia, and stretches through Egypt to Libya. And when it says, 'The borders shall reach to the highest mountain' (Numbers 34:7), the same Hebrews interpret it to mean either Mount Amanus or Mount Taurus, which we think is more likely. From there, it is said, one will come to Emath, which is now called Epiphania, with the name changed by Antiochus, the most cruel of tyrants: for he had the surname Epiphanes. He says, 'They will go to the boundaries of Sadada, a place that is currently mentioned in the reading of Ezechiel, and they will reach the borders of Zephrona, which is today called Zephyrium, a town in Cilicia. And the next part, 'And the village of Enam,' is written in Hebrew as 'Aser Enon,' or 'Enan,' and the present location is included in this. And for now, it suffices to briefly summarize the historical context, and to connect the description in both Numbers and Ezechiel: so that a discerning reader understands in which places they mentioned the same, similar, or different things. Now that we have interpreted the names of each, let us follow the anagoge and discuss what seems to us in each, with the Lord providing. Ethalon is interpreted as the cradle of sorrow. Sadada, his side, understand not in terms of width but in terms of the side. Emath, fury, which is called in Greek, χόλος. Berotha, of the well. Sabarim, circuit of mountains. Damascus, blood of the bag and the kiss, or cup. But the house, or atrium Thicon, Symmachus interprets as the middle atrium, which extends to the borders of Auran. Therefore, Thicon, the middle one, resounds: Auran, which in Greek translates to Auranitidis, anger. Aser, however, Enon, which is the boundary of Damascus, is called the atrium of the fountain in our language. Therefore, the northern region begins from the great sea through the way of Ethalon, which means the cradle of sorrow, and through repentance it comes to Sadada, where there is a decline on the side. For we understand the impending Emath upon us, which is the wrath of God; or Emath, the truth being known, the wells of Berotha are opened for us, which were dug by the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: and after a long circuit we come to the mountains of Sabarim, which are located between Damascus, that is, the blood of the cilice, and the border of Emath, as we have said above, the truth. For just as we turn away from approaching evils through fear and avoid them on one side, so after the shedding of blood and the sackcloth of a bloody life, before we come to the borders of Emath, we circumscribe and arrive at the mountains, of which it is written: Mountains surround it, and the Lord surrounds his people (Psalm 124:2). This place is called the court of Thicon, that is, the middle court, as Symmachus has interpreted, near the borders of Auran, which means wrath, and let us say with the prophet: I will endure the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against him (Micah 4:9). And from the sea as far as the borders of Damascus; in which also the Apostle Paul (Acts IX) saw the light in blindness from the Jewish fury and the shedding of Ecclesiastical blood, and having taken up the sackcloth of old persecution, he preached the Gospel in order to reach the courtyard of the eternal fountain, and being placed in the North, he grasped the boundary of truth.

<h2 id='tocuniq353'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18) Furthermore, the eastern region stretches from the middle of Auran, and from the middle of Damascus, and from the middle of Gilead, and from the middle of the land of Israel. The Jordan River divides it, extending to the eastern sea. In the Book of Numbers, it is written as follows: From there, the boundaries extend opposite the eastern region, from the town of Enan, also known as Aser Enon, to Sephama. From Sephama, the boundaries go down to Rebla, opposite the spring. From there, they reach the eastern sea, which is the Sea of Chenereth, and continue all the way to the Jordan River, finally closing at the sea. He had said above: And the boundary shall be from the sea to Aser Enon, the boundary of Damascus (Num. XXXIV, 10, 11). Therefore, at the end of the northern region, that is, at the court of Enan, the boundaries extend according to the Book of Numbers to Sephama, which the Hebrews call Apamea: and from Apamea the boundaries descend to Rebla, which is now called Antioch in Syria. And so that you may know that this Rebla signifies the city, which is now the most noble in Coele-Syria, it follows: Against the spring, which is clearly meant to signify Daphne: from which spring the aforesaid city enjoys very abundant waters. But this place, established by Gnaeus Pompeius, who was the first to conquer Judea under Roman rule, was built with military force; and according to the fable of the poets, it was named Daphne because of the laurels and cypresses, which are very abundant trees in that place. From there, it says, the boundaries extend opposite the eastern region to the Sea of Chinnereth, all the way to the Sea of Tiberias. However, it is called a sea because it has fresh waters, according to the language of the Scriptures, in which collections of water are called seas. And the borders, he says, will stretch as far as the Jordan River, and in the end will be closed off by the sea, either the dead sea or, as others think, the Red Sea, on whose shore Ahila is located, where the legion and the Roman garrison are now stationed. This statement can be found in the book of Numbers. But according to Ezekiel, it refers to the middle of Auran, which is the city of Damascus in the desert, and the middle of Galaad, where Mount Lebanon is connected to the hills and falls into the territory of Ruben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh. It is situated behind Phoenicia and Arabia. This is the mountain that Jacob reached after leaving Charran, where he was captured by Laban (Gen. XXXI), and Jeremiah also speaks of it: Galaad, you are the beginning of Lebanon (Jerem. XXII). This region was taken by Galaad, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, from the Amorite region. The boundary of this region is the Jordan River and the Eastern Sea, which in this place is understood to be the dead sea, not the shore of the Red Sea. Let us speak according to tropology: After the borders of the North, through Ethalon, and Sadada, and Berotha, also Sabarim, Thicon, and Auran, and Damascus, and the atrium of Enon, it reaches as far as Emath in the eastern region: from the midst of anger, that is Auran, and from the midst of Damascus, that is the blood of penance, and from the midst of Gilead, which is interpreted as revelation, or the hill of testimony; in order to show hope of salvation after anger and penance: and from the midst of the land of Israel, which contains the vision of peace, it reaches to the sweetest flow of the Jordan river: which, far from the distant sea, obtains the light of the East, so that it is terminated by the river Jordan, which is interpreted as the stream of judgment, and the boundary of the East. But what is called φοινικῶνος in the Septuagint, which means palmeti in Latin, is not found in Hebrew: for which reason we have translated it as metiemini: And a clear error is evident, that due to the similarity of the letters, they read Thamorru instead of Thamoddu.

<h2 id='tocuniq354'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) The southern region stretches from Thamar to the waters of contradiction (or Mariboth: this word signifies contradiction or disputes). It includes Cades and the river, reaching all the way to the Great Sea. This is the southern region. According to the Book of Numbers, it is written as follows: It begins from the wilderness of Sin, near Edom, and its borders extend towards the eastern sea (some manuscripts add 'the saltiest sea'), encircling the southern region up along the ascent of Scorpio, passing through Senna and reaching south to Cadesbarne. From there, the borders extend to a village named Addar, and continue to Asemona. The boundary line then goes from Asemona to the torrent of Egypt, and ends at the shore of the Great Sea (Num. 34:3-5). This briefly signifies (so that we do not appear to have passed over the very wide stretch of Numbers by occasion of Ezekiel's exposition) to go around the wilderness of Sin, which is near Edom, and the boundary of the Red Sea, and through the ascent of Scorpions, and through Senna and Kadesh-barnea, and the courtyard of Addar, and to come from Asemona as far as the river of Egypt, which flows into the sea near the city of Rhinocorura. But truly, this boundary of the southern region, that is, the southernmost part, begins from Tamar, which is a city in the wilderness, which Solomon also built with marvelous works and is now called Palmyra; and in the Hebrew language, it is called Thamar, which in our language means "palm," as far as the waters of Meribah Kadesh, which is undoubtedly in the desert, and the river entering the Great Sea, which stretches along the coast of Egypt and Palestine, and this is the southern region to the South. Afterward, we receive the Southern region when the light from above is poured upon us, just as Abraham joined in a feast and we are intoxicated with the wine that gladdens the heart, like Joseph and his brothers. This possession begins at Thamar and extends to the waters of contradiction, a place of victory over vices. For virtue is always contradicted. Therefore, Jews opposing Paul in the preaching of the Gospel assert that it is contradicted throughout the whole world (Acts 15). And in the Gospel, we read Simeon saying: This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be contradicted (Luke 2:34). However, every contradiction is of holiness, which is interpreted as Kadesh, as the Psalmist says: The Lord will shake Kadesh's desert (Psalm 29:8); which originally did not have the holiness of the Lord, but it was shaken and moved to receive the guest God, who says: Upon whom will my spirit rest, if not upon the humble and quiet one who trembles at my words? (Isaiah 66:2). Beyond the deserted region of Cades, all the way to the great sea in the south, the southern region is arid, as we mentioned before; it does not have rain from the land, but rather from the sky, collected in various forms of different powers.

<h2 id='tocuniq355'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) And the plague of the sea, the great sea from the border in a straight line, until you come to Emath, this is the plague of the sea. Of which the Book of Numbers writes more clearly and briefly. But the western plague will begin from the great sea and will conclude at the very end, that is, from sea to sea: to the torrent, namely the Rhinocorura, which flows into the sea, up to the place that is opposite the city of Emath in Syria, of which we have spoken above. But the setting sun, according to the laws of tropology, is always in the sea: always in the salt and waves, where shipwrecks occur daily, and the deaths of the wretched, and the loss of wealth and goods, and yet when we have endured all these with patience, we come straight to Emath, that is, to the truth of the Lord, who, having conquered persecutions, has promised us eternal rewards.

(Verse 21 onwards) And you shall divide this land among yourselves into the tribes of Israel, and you shall allocate it as an inheritance to yourselves and to the foreigners who have joined you and have children born among you. They shall be considered as natives among the children of Israel and shall share in the possession with you among the tribes of Israel. In whatever tribe a foreigner resides, you shall give them an inheritance there, says the Lord God. By this chapter, we learn (and it is a refutation of the Jewish objections) that there is no distinction between the people of Israel and the Gentiles. For if the foreigners and strangers come with those who are from the people of Israel, that is to say, with the indigenous people, the land is divided; there is no doubt that it is the same inheritance of the people of the Gentiles and the people of the Jews: however, if they have converted to the worship of the God of Israel, which is properly called Christian, having the Jews as possessors of the letter of the Law, and us of the spirit: they hold on to the membranes, and we to him who is written in the membranes. And with Moses the land is divided by lot; but here, as we have said, it is delegated by the judgment of the Lord: and there is one possession for the stranger and the Israelite, and an inheritance is given in each tribe, at the command of the Lord God.

<h2 id='tocuniq357'>(Chap. XLVIII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 48, verses 1 onwards) And these are the names of the tribes: starting from the northern borders, near the path of Ethalon that goes to Emath, Atrium, Enon, the boundary of Damascus to the north of Emath, and it will have the eastern boundary, the sea. Dan is one tribe. And from the boundary of Dan to the eastern boundary, Asher is one tribe. And beyond the boundary of Asher to the eastern boundary, Nephthali is one tribe. And beyond the boundary of Nephthali to the eastern boundary, Manasseh is one tribe. And over the territory of Manasseh from the eastern border to the sea, Ephraim one. And over the territory of Ephraim from the eastern border to the sea, Reuben one. And over the territory of Reuben from the eastern border to the sea, Judah one. The description of the possession of the Holy Land is given, both according to the present prophecy of Ezekiel and according to the book of Numbers: now the possession of each tribe is described from the eastern border to the western border, that is, the sea. And first, the borders are taken from the north along the route of Ethalon to those going towards Emath, the courtyard or Aser-Enon bordering Damascus to the north near Emath, of which we have already spoken. And so it begins, the first portion goes to the tribe of Dan, the second to Aser, the third to Nephthali, the fourth to Manasseh, the fifth to Ephraim, the sixth to Ruben, the seventh to Judah, which is on the left side, completing the number seven. Then the firstfruits of the priests and the Levites, and the sanctuary of the Lord in the midst, and the holy of holies. The city itself is described on each side in a square, having four thousand and five hundred rods. The suburban areas of the priests and the Levites are also described in order, along with the possession of the prince. And again, on the right side, five tribes succeed from the region similarly to the East, all the way to the region of the West, of which the first is Benjamin; the second is Simeon, having its own possession specifically, and not mixed with Judah as before; the third is Issachar; the fourth is Zebulun; the fifth is Gad; and there are three gates of the city on each side; and the name of this city is contained on the golden plate on the forehead of the high priest. We will discuss all of these in their proper places. And it should be noted that the names of forty-eight cities which are given in the book of Numbers to the Levites for dwelling with their suburbs are omitted here, as well as the cities of refuge: of which three are on the other side of the Jordan, namely Bosor, and Ramoth, and Gaulon, which are given to two and a half tribes; and three are within the Jordan, namely Kadesh, and Sichem, and Kiriatharba. For there was no need in this mystical description and the dwelling of the saints and the perfect conversation to describe the supports of the fugitives, which Israel still needed while in the land and hastening to come to this city through many labors and dangers, and speaking in each of the saints: I am a stranger and a sojourner like all my fathers (Ps. XXXVIII, 13). And in a foreign land: I lived with the inhabitants of Cedar, my soul has traveled far.

<h2 id='tocuniq358'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Verse 8, 9.) And over the border of Judah from the east side to the west side shall be the portion which you shall offer, twenty-five thousand cubits in breadth and in length, like one of the portions from the east side to the west side; and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it. The portion which you shall offer to the Lord shall be twenty-five thousand cubits in length, and ten thousand in breadth. It is unnecessary to go into detail about what has already been discussed, and to labor again on the same points as if they had not been said. After the boundaries of the seven tribes, the firstfruits are described from east to west; the width of which is twenty-five thousand reeds: but the length, as each tribe holds from east to the sea, has an uncertain number. For the measurement of each tribe's description is not recorded. But if the width is twenty-five thousand reeds, it is given that the number of length is much greater, which is always greater than the width. But in the middle of the sanctuary is placed, next to the firstfruits that are separated for the Lord, a length of twenty-five thousand reeds and a width of ten thousand: reading which I can say nothing other than what the Apostle said: O the depth of the riches of wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are His judgments and how unsearchable His ways! (Rom. XI, 33)! And in another place: That you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length, and height and depth: to know also the surpassing knowledge of the charity of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God (Eph. III, 18): But the number twenty-five refers to the senses, of which it is said: You shall possess divine sense, and ten thousand refers to perfect and complete virtue, which reaches from the Ten Commandments of the Old Testament to the sacrament of the Gospel, and we have explained this briefly earlier and will remind you of it in part here. For if you add one to the number, you will reach four, and you will fill the number with a ten; and thus it will happen, that both the old Testament may be contained in the new, and the new may be extended in the old.

<h2 id='tocuniq359'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 and following) These will be the firstfruits of the sanctuary for the priests: towards the north, a length of twenty-five thousand [cubits], and towards the sea, a width of ten thousand [cubits]; but also towards the east, a width of ten thousand [cubits], and towards the south, a length of twenty-five thousand [cubits]. And the sanctuary of the Lord will be in the midst of it. It will be a sanctuary for the priests from the descendants of Zadok, who have kept my statutes and have not strayed as the children of Israel strayed, as the Levites strayed. And there will be offerings from the first fruits of the land of the Holy of Holies, according to the boundary of the Levites. The four offerings of the sanctuary are described, which do not pertain to the common people or the lower class Levites, but specifically to the worship of the priests: namely the offerings of the North, West, East, and South. And the order of their arrangement is described in parts, as we leave behind the cold of the North and come to the West: so that our vices may perish and we may then move to the East, where the sun of justice rises for us, and finally come to the South, where the light is most bright and perfect. And both from the North to the sea and from the East to the South, let there be twenty-five thousand in length and ten thousand in width: so that the same measure of length and width is preserved everywhere. However, the sanctuary, that is, the Temple of the Lord, will be in the midst of the firstfruits of the priests, and it will be surrounded on all sides by an equal wall. And what he had said, 'These shall be the firstfruits of the sanctuary of the priests,' was to prevent all the priests from claiming the possession of this place and the special ceremonies to be observed by a common name, specifically stating: 'The sanctuary shall be for the priests of the sons of Zadok,' which means 'righteous.' This is said of him: 'The Lord is righteous, and he loves righteousness; his face beholds the upright' (Psalm 11:7). Regarding this, Sadoc, the Septuagint writes Sadduc. This Sadoc speaks in the Gospel: For the Father judgeth no man, but hath given all judgment unto the Son (John 5:22). And concerning this, under the name of Solomon, the Prophet sings mystically: Give thy judgment to the king, O God, and thy justice to the king's son (Psalm 71:1). But those priests of the Lord shall possess the sanctuary, and shall keep the ceremonies thereof: who have not erred when the children of Israel and the Levites erred, of whom it was discoursed in the foregoing. They do not offer victims, but being content with the privilege of their name and the humility of their error, they always speak from the heart: I acknowledge my wickedness, and my sin is always before me (Psalm 50:4). Let him hear this priestly order, and, overcome by the fury of the Arian persecution, and subsequently submitting his neck to the power of the true faith, so that he may not lack resources, if he is not expelled from the temple, let him hold a certain shadow and image of his former name, and let him not, lying on his back, belch out delights, as if he were immaculate and pure, let him not belch forth the nausea of his ignorance and barbaric babbling from his lofty throne. They shall be, he says, the first fruits from the first fruits of the earth, that is, for the priests: and those who did not go astray, when the sons of Israel and the Levites went astray. But the first crop from the first crops, like the tenth of the tithes, and the holy of holies, according to the boundary of the Levites: for indeed the Levites have the precincts of the priests, but they cannot hold the center, that is, the middle of it, and the actual possession.

<h2 id='tocuniq360'>(Vers. 13 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 13 and following) But the Levites shall have a portion like the priests, consisting of twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand cubits in width; the whole length shall be twenty-five thousand cubits and the width ten thousand cubits. They shall not sell any of it or exchange it, nor shall the firstfruits of the land be taken away from it, for they are holy to the Lord. The remaining five thousand cubits in width, along the twenty-five thousand, shall be for common use by the city for dwellings and common land, and the city shall be in the middle of it. What we translate as 'profane', Aquila translated as 'βέβηλον', Symmachus and Theodotion translated as 'λαἳκὸν'; the LXX used 'προτείχισμα' which can also be translated as 'antemurale'. 'Profane' and 'laicum' are both secular, that is, common, and can be used by all people everywhere. However, what the LXX said: 'It will not be measured, nor will it be taken away,' is clear that it does not have the same meaning as what we said: 'It will not be changed, nor will it be transferred.' The possession of the Levites is also described, which is indeed adjacent to the territories of the priests, and it has the same dimensions in length and breadth according to the number of Levites, which has the same number as the priests, but it uses its own boundaries and understands itself to be separate from the priestly rank: to remove the pride of the ministers, who, ignorant of the humility of their position, swell up beyond the priests, that is, the elders, and think of themselves as having dignity not by merit, but by wealth. Certainly, the one who is the first among ministers, because he preaches to the people individually and does not depart from the side of the Pontiff, considers it an injury if he is ordained a presbyter. And he does not remember that he is a minister of the altars and widows, entrusted not only to the service and ministry of the priests, but also to the widows and the poor. And they shall not sell, he says, nor exchange, so that the eternal possession of the Levitical distribution may remain, nor shall the worthiness of dignity be overcome by price, nor shall we transfer from one to another: for what has been sanctified to the Lord belongs not to those to whom it has been given, but to Him in whose name it is possessed. However, the remaining five thousand in width, by twenty-five thousand, is understood to be the length, will be profane of the city: so that it is lawful for all the Israelites and every member of the people to dwell there; not because they are unclean or because anything in the habitation of the holy land is contaminated, putrid, and filthy; but because, apart from the priests, it is permitted for everyone to dwell in them. By this we understand that all the things we refer to as sensations, that is, bodily pleasures that we perceive by sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste, are profane and do not have the sanctity of the temple, nor do they have the privilege of the priesthood, but rather they belong to the realm of the laity and commoners. However, the city will be in the middle, concerning which it is written: The stream of the river makes the city of God glad (Ps. 46:4). And: A city set on a hill cannot be hidden (Matthew 5:14): of which we will speak in the following. Προτείχισμα, which means a fortification, and διάστημα, which means a space, which the LXX translated as suburbs, we do not know the meaning they have in this place.

<h2 id='tocuniq361'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16) And the measurements of it, towards the North side, five hundred and four thousand: and towards the South side, five hundred and four thousand: and towards the East side, five hundred and four thousand: and towards the West side, five hundred and four thousand. What it says: And the measurements of it, it must be understood, of the city. For at the end of the previous chapter it is stated: And the city shall be in the midst of it, that is, the land. And first it begins from the North and extends towards the South. And again it matches like with like: so that it places the Western side opposite the Eastern side, that is, the sea: and each side of the city has four thousand and five hundred paces; which in total, approximately eleven thousand and eighty-five paces, so that the entire city, as it is written at the end of this volume, has a circumference of eighteen thousand paces, which is equivalent to forty-four thousand three hundred and forty. Also, the forty-fourth Psalm, which is titled 'For those who will be changed' and belongs to Idithun, that is, to the beloved of the Lord, or as Aquila has interpreted it, ‘For the lilies,’ and Symmachus, ‘For the flowers,’ contains the sacraments of the Church, which is the city of the Lord, about which it is written in the same psalm: At Your right hand stood the queen in a garment adorned with gold, surrounded with variety (Psalm 44:10). And again: All the glory of the daughter of the king is within (Ibid., 14): so that it may not be like the whitened sepulchers outside, but both inside and outside it may wash away all things with the perfume of myrrh (Matthew 23). And when we have moved away from the North, with a very cold wind, we pass to the South, and after the rising of the light of knowledge in us, we fear the setting of fortitudes, considering not the past but the future, neither possessing a certain possession of virtue, but daily saying in prayer: Lead us not into temptation, which we cannot endure (Matthew 86:13).

<h2 id='tocuniq362'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) The suburbs of the city on the north side shall be two hundred and fifty cubits in length, on the south side two hundred and fifty cubits in length, on the east side two hundred and fifty cubits in length, and on the west side two hundred and fifty cubits in length. As for the suburbs, which are called "Magras" in Hebrew, they have again transferred the distance of seventy times seventy cubits, that is, a space. And what is said, two hundred and fifty on each side, is understood to refer to reeds, which are six cubits and one palm in length, and on each side they make six hundred and seventeen and a little less steps, and in total one thousand reeds, making two thousand four hundred and sixty-eight steps: these spaces surround the walls of the city in a circle, so as to divide the city from the rest. From this it is shown that none of these spaces have the right to engage in the work of the city and to gather its fruits, but rather to be free from the use and work of men, so that the areas around the city walls, with their naturally growing shrubs and herbs, and other things that the land produces, may have beauty.

But the remaining length, according to the holy area, shall be ten thousand cubits toward the east and ten thousand toward the west: and it shall be over against the holy sanctuary. And the fruits thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for medicine. And the workers of the city, that work therein, shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel. All the fruits thereof shall be for the service of the holy city, and the priests of the sanctuary, who shall go in and out of the house of the Lord, shall eat it. And it shall be a place for a habitation unto them. And the separated cities shall be in the midst of that which shall be for the possession of the prince: and the possession of the holy place shall be in the midst of the portion of the Levites. He wants to designate the remaining part of the firstfruits of the sanctuary, ten thousand baskets extending towards the East, and another ten thousand baskets extending towards the West, to be allocated to those who work for the city for various purposes, whatever the city needs: so that the workers who build or restore the city walls, when necessary, may be nourished from the crops that grow on this land, and so that the city may have its adornment and the repaired roofs be restored. And this, not only in Israel or in the possession of the Holy Land, is contained spiritually in the mystery of the Church, but we also approve that it happens under Roman authority, so that certain villas belong to the rights of cities, either through royal generosity or through the inheritance and donation of many, so that buildings are not gradually ruined and public buildings, which are an ornament to the city, are not long neglected. But the workers, he said, or those who serve in the works of the city, will be from all the tribes of Israel: so that no one may consider themselves exempt from the work of the city, but all may eagerly build up the Church. This is also what we read was done in the tabernacle, that for the diversity of strengths, one offers gold and silver, scarlet, fine linen, and purple, and various and diverse coverings: others offer skins and the hair of goats: and although there were different gifts according to the quality of the substance, the reward of those who gave was one: indeed, greater than those who offered little, but more according to their abilities, as an example of the poor widow, who sent two small coins as gifts to the treasury; she was praised by the judgment of the Lord, saying: Truly I say to you, this widow, poor as she is, has put in more than all the others. For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth to the offerings of God, but she, from her poverty, has offered her whole livelihood. Therefore, as we have said about the works of the city, it must be briefly stated that all the first fruits of the sanctuary, and the possession of the city calculated together in a square, amount to two thousand four hundred and sixty-six, and a third part. For if twenty-five thousand reeds, which have six cubits and one palm, make ours, that is, Roman sixty, and one thousand, and six hundred and sixty-seven paces; there is no doubt that these, when multiplied by four, exceed the previous number. From which we understand that all things are to be understood spiritually, the possession of the Church is much broader than it was in Judea, who did not even receive a part of the holy land: but from each tribe they received forty-eight cities, not the full possession, but habitation and hospitality: so also the laity themselves, although they have not reached the priestly and Levitical degree, if they work in the city of the Lord, they may partake of the holy land, the land of meekness, and the land of believers, of whom one said: I believe to see the good things of the Lord, in the land of the living (Ps. 27:13).


<h2 id='tocuniq363'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verse 21, 22.) But what remains will belong to the prince on all sides, either from here or from there ((The Vulgate is silent whether from here or from there)) as the firstfruits of the sanctuary and the possession of the city, bordering (or facing) twenty-five thousand firstfruits to the eastern boundary, and also from the sea ((The Vulgate says to the sea)) bordering (or facing) twenty-five thousand to the boundary of the sea. Similarly, in the areas belonging to the prince, there will be the firstfruits of the sanctuary and the sanctuary of the temple in its midst. There will also be possession of the Levites, and possession of the city in the middle of the prince's territory, between the boundary of Judah and the boundary of Benjamin, and it will belong to the prince. There has been much discussion about this prince above, and that he would receive only as much as one tribe. But now we learn something else, that whatever is left from all the tribes, only he shall receive it: so that there is no tribe that does not offer gifts to the prince: not from elsewhere, but from the firstfruits which serve the temple and the sanctuary and the delegated parts of the city. For this is what he says: From the east boundary to the western boundary, and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary, the firstfruits will belong to the seven and a half tribes. Within these firstfruits will be the city and its surrounding suburbs, as well as the sanctuary of the temple in the middle of the city. As for the land assigned to the Levites and the rest of the city, it will be considered as belonging to the prince. The area next to the firstfruits and the city, in the tribe of Judah, will be the western portion of the seven tribes. The eastern portion, in the tribe of Benjamin, will also belong to the prince. Since the sacraments of Holy Scripture are wondrous and should be contemplated more than spoken (Dan. XXXII). In the former division of the land beyond the Jordan by Moses, the land was divided among the two tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh (Joshua, XIII). But beyond the Jordan, by Joshua the son of Nun and Eleazar the son of Aaron, Judah possessed the south (Joshua, XV); and Ephraim and the half tribe of Manasseh possessed the north (Joshua, XVIII). Afterwards, with the spies sent to each tribe and a description of the land brought to Joshua and Eleazar, Benjamin received possession next to Judah from the south, and next to Ephraim and half the tribe of Manasseh. The second tribe, Simeon, received an inheritance within the tribe of Judah, so that what is written about Levi and Simeon would be fulfilled: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel (Gen. XLIX, 7). The third tribe, Zebulun, received Galilee, which includes Mount Tabor. On the fourth day, Isachar, where Jezreel is located, to the Jordan. On the fifth day, Aser, up to Mount Carmel, which overlooks the Great Sea, and Tyre and Sidon. On the sixth day, Nephthali, in Galilee and up to the Jordan, where Tiberias, which was once called Chenereth, is located. On the seventh day, Dan up to Joppa, where the towers of Ailon, Selebi, and Emmaus are located, which is now called Nicopolis: although we will later read that they took the city of Lesem in the tribe of Dan, which is now called Paneas. When these things are so, and there is such a difference between the previous description of the tribes and the one now held, let us consider how both in the current description and in the past, the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, the city, and the Temple have been located. In the previous description, Judah was to the south, and Benjamin to the north: but now it is the opposite, with Judah to the north and Benjamin to the south: after them, the second is Simeon, the third is Issachar, and the fourth is Zebulun, the fifth is Gad: namely, five tribes, as it is said in the following verses; for it is written:

<h2 id='tocuniq364'>(Vers. 23 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 23 seqq.) And the rest of the tribes, from the eastern boundary to the western boundary, belong to Benjamin. And against the boundary of Benjamin, from the eastern boundary to the western boundary, belong to Simeon. And along the boundary of Simeon, from the eastern boundary to the western boundary, belong to Issachar. And along the boundary of Issachar, from the eastern boundary to the western boundary, belong to Zebulun. And along the boundary of Zebulun, from the eastern boundary to the sea, belong to Gad. And the border shall go to Gad towards the south side, and the end shall be at Thamar unto the waters of contradiction of Cades: the inheritance shall be against the great sea. This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions, says the Lord God. The portion which is always placed at the end in the numbering of the five and seven tribes is understood either as a part, a possession, or an inheritance: although Aquila and Symmachus interpret it as a neutral gender τὸ ὅριον, which means boundary. And it must be noted briefly that in the last five tribes, the tribe of Gad, which was mentioned earlier as being beyond the Jordan, is placed in the same area that Judas previously held, namely the southern region, and its boundary stretches from Thamar to the waters of contradiction at Kadesh, opposite the Great Sea: Thamar itself, which we have already mentioned, is now called Palmyra, and was built long ago by Solomon; for 'palm' in Hebrew is called Thamar, and some believe that it received this name because there are many palm trees there. And what follows: Even to the waters of contradiction of Cades, the inheritance against the great sea; for which seventy transferred from Theman, and the water of Mariboth, ((also Marimoth)) Cades, the inheritance even to the great sea, it is to be observed in the Hebrew language that the same word, Nehela (), is ambiguous, signifying both inheritance and torrent, and here it should be understood more as a torrent than as an inheritance. For this is the torrent that enters the great sea of Rhinocorura, as we have already mentioned. The place called Kadesh, which is also called Kadesh-Barnea in the book of Joshua, is in the desert, extending to the city of Petra. However, Mariboth, which means contradiction, is not a place name as many think, but a name for the waters in which the people contradicted the Lord and Moses offended God, as the Psalm says: They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that Moses suffered for their sins (Psalm 106:32). The entire inheritance of the Holy Land is bordered to the south by the boundaries of Egypt, Rhinocorura, and the River of Egypt. And because Gad is interpreted as temptation, in his possession we pass from the palm groves to the waters of contradiction, even to Kadesh, which is interpreted as holy, so that we may understand that even after the victory of the world we must be solicitous, and always in fear, and remember that verse: The life of man upon earth is a temptation (Job 7:1); and to attain holiness, resisting adversaries, and thus achieve victory, so that we may contemplate the nearby stream full of rain showers.


<h2 id='tocuniq365'>(Vers. 30 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 30 and following) And you shall measure five thousand four hundred cubits outside the city on the northern side. And the gates of the city shall be named after the tribes of Israel: three gates on the north side. The gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one. And on the eastern side, you shall measure five thousand four hundred cubits, and there shall be three gates. The gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one. And on the southern side, you shall measure five thousand four hundred cubits, and there shall be three gates. The Gate of Simeon, one; the Gate of Issachar, one; the Gate of Zebulun, one. And on the west side, five hundred and four thousand, and their gates three. The Gate of Gad, one; the Gate of Asher, one; the Gate of Naphtali, one; in all eighteen thousand cubits round about the city. And the name of the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there. Now it is written that it was measured along each side, which is eleven thousand and eighty-five paces, that there were three gates, which Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion call διεξόδους (exit passages), and the LXX call διεκβολὰς (projections): we interpret them as the entrances and exits of the city. And first, it must be briefly noted that the same three tribes camped around the tabernacle in such a way that Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun, the sons of Leah, were to the east; and to the south, Reuben, Simeon, and Gad, the two sons of Leah, and the third son of Leah's handmaid, Zilpah. But towards the west Ephraim and Manasseh, and Benjamin namely, the two sons of Rachel; for Joseph, who was from the tribe of Levi, which was appointed for sacrifices, was divided into two tribes, Ephraim and Manasseh. But towards the north, there are Dan, Asher, and Naphtali, of whom the first and third are the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant, and the second is the son of Zilpah, Leah's maidservant, who are of lowly birth and are positioned towards the north, being descendants of maidservants who were in conflict with each other. According to the book of Numbers and the description of the tabernacle, which was dictated by God to Moses (Num. XXXIV). But our city, which is the city of the great king of which God is the artificer and the founder, of which the psalmist sings: Shall it be said of Sion: This man and that man is born in her? and the Highest himself hath founded her (Ps. LXXXVI, 5), has a different description of the tribes in the holy land, and the measurement of the city and the order of possessions, and the boundaries of each tribe. First, three gates or exits of the city are opposed to the blows of the North Wind, of which the firstborn is Reuben, and Judah the founder of the royal line, and Levi, over whose name nothing is said in the description of the tabernacle and the sacred things, so that as possessors of the firstborn, we may despise the cold of the North. Second, towards the East are Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan: both sons of Rachel, and one of her maidservant Bilhah. But towards the South, Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun, who are three sons of Leah. Furthermore, towards the West, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali: the first two of whom are sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, and the third son of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid. Who is wise and understands these things? Understanding, will he know them? For the ways of the Lord are straight, and the just shall walk in them, but transgressors shall stumble upon them (Hosea, 14:10). I think that these twelve gates, or exits, were assigned to each tribe under the names of the Apostles and Patriarchs, according to the quality of their merits and virtues: of which it is written more explicitly in the Apocalypse of John, and many sacraments of the divine Scriptures testify (Apoc. 21). And it is necessary for such a city to hold eighteen thousand revolutions of calamities: under which number, and in the twenty-second Psalm, the natural law is written, and the grace of the Gospel is described: for which the Church, that is, the city of the Savior, is built. The name of this city will by no means be as before Jerusalem, which means vision of peace, but Adonai Sama ((Al. Adonaisan et Adonaisamia)) () which is translated into the Latin language, the Lord is there, who will never depart from it, as He said to the disciples before departing from the previous people: Arise, let us go from here (John XIV, 31). And to the Jews: Let your house be left desolate to you (Matt. 23:38): but let it have eternal possession, and let it be its own possession, promising the same to his disciples: Behold, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world (Matt. 28:20).
