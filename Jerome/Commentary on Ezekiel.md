Book One

With the completion of the eighteen volumes of Explanations on Isaiah, I desired to move on to Ezekiel, which I had often promised to you, Eustochium, virgin of Christ, and to your holy mother, Paula, and to place the final hand, so to speak, on the work of prophecy. And behold, suddenly I received news of the deaths of Pammachius and Marcella, and of the siege of the city of Rome, and of the sleeping of many brothers and sisters. And so I was struck with consternation and amazement, so that for days and nights I could think of nothing else but the salvation of all. And I considered myself to be a captive in the captivity of the saints, and I could not open my mouth until I learned something more certain. While I am suspended between hope and despair, I torture myself with the misfortunes of others. But when the most shining light of all the earth was extinguished, or rather, when the head of the Roman empire was cut off: and, to speak more truly, the whole world perished in one city, I was speechless and humiliated, and I kept silent among the good, and my sorrow was renewed: my heart burned within me, and a fire blazed up in my meditation (Psalm 38:4); and I did not consider that saying to be neglected: Music is an inconvenient narration in mourning (Sirach 22:6). But because you insist on this incessantly and the wound gradually forms a scar: and the Scorpion is pressed between Enceladus and Porphyrion on the Trinacriae ground, and the Hydra with many heads has stopped hissing against us: and a time has been given, when we ought to not respond to the snares of heretics, but to devote ourselves to the interpretation of the Scriptures, I will tackle the prophet Ezekiel, whose difficulty is proven by the tradition of the Hebrews. Nam nisi quis apud eos aetatem sacerdotalis ministerii, id est, tricesimum annum impleverit, nec principia Geneseos, nec Canticum Canticorum, nec hujus voluminis exordium et finem legere permittitur, ut ad perfectam scientiam, et mysticos intellectus, plenum humanae naturae tempus accedat. Quod opus si per Domini misericordiam ad calcem usque perduxero, transibo ad Jeremiam, qui in Lamentationibus suis, sub typo Jerusalem quatuor plagas mundi, quadruplici plangit alphabeto.


<h2 id='tocuniq4'>(Cap. I.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 1—Verse 1) And it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth, in the fifth month. The thirtieth year is not, as most suppose, the age of the prophet, nor the year of Jubilee, which is the year of remission; but from the twelfth year of the reign of Josiah, king of Judah, when the Book of Deuteronomy was found in the temple of God, until the fifth year of the captivity of Joachin, surnamed Jechoniah, who was led captive to Babylon with his mother, and with Daniel and the three young men, and Ezekiel (which is the first captivity of the tribe of Judah) when the wrath of God was poured out upon Jerusalem (2 Kings 22; 2 Chronicles 34; 2 Kings 24). But according to the mystical interpretation, it is prefigured that the Lord and Savior, who came to be baptized at the age of thirty (Luke 3), which is the perfect age in man. Hence, in the book of Numbers according to the Hebrews, the priests begin to minister in the tabernacle not at the age of twenty-five, as in the Septuagint, but at the age of thirty (Numbers 4). As a sign of this, Joseph also preceded, when he distributed grain to the starving people in Egypt (Genesis 41), and John the Baptist came to the banks of the Jordan and preached the baptism of repentance (Luke 3). And what is written in the fifth, with the sentence pending, is understood to be in the fourth month. For immediately following is the fifth month. And to make this more clear, they added Seventy above.

<h2 id='tocuniq5'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Verse 2) When I was among the captives by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God in the fifth month. It was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin. I saw the people sitting by the rivers of Babylon, and David prophesied in the spirit: By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept (Psalm 137). Chebar, either the name of a river or, according to its interpretation, which means 'heavy', it signifies the Tigris and the Euphrates, and all the great and weighty rivers that are said to be in the land of the Chaldeans. And understand that the heavens are open not by the division of the firmament, but by the faith of the believer, because the celestial things are mysteries revealed to him. Therefore, even in the baptism of the Savior, when the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the form of a dove, we read of the heavens being opened (Matthew 3), and with them opened, the visions of God are revealed. Not just one vision, but many, as the Lord spoke through the prophet: 'I will multiply visions, and in the hands of the prophets I am likened.' (Hosea 12:10). These are the visions that the entire prophecy of Ezekiel weaves together. According to the Hebrews and other interpreters, the exile of Joachin is called more significantly, and not captivity, which the Septuagint translated. For he was not taken captive by the conquered city; but by his own will, he was led to Babylon. Therefore, let the first exile be called Joachin, that is, Jechoniah; but let the second or ultimate captivity be called Zedekiah.

<h2 id='tocuniq6'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3) The word of the Lord came to Ezekiel, the son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chebar. And to Daniel and Ezekiel, who were in Babylon next to the rivers, the mysteries of the future are revealed over the waters, indeed in the purest waters, so that the power of baptism may be shown. Otherwise, even the Apostle Paul, when cleansed by Ananias in the Lord, his eyes being covered with scales beforehand, was freed from blindness (Acts 9). And in Genesis, those who were the first to live came forth from the waters. Also, it should be understood that in the thirtieth year of his age the Lord came to baptism: in the fourth month, which is called January among us, and is at the beginning of the year, except for the month of Nisan, in which the Passover is celebrated. For among the Eastern peoples, after the harvest and the pressing of grapes, when the tithes were brought to the temple, October was the first month, and January the fourth. On the fifth day of the month, the sign of baptism is added, in which the heavens were opened to Christ, and the day of Epiphany is held in high reverence until now, not as some think, the nativity in the flesh, for then he was hidden and did not appear. This is fitting for this period, when it was said: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased (Matthew 3:17). Moreover, 'Buzi' is translated into our language as 'Ezekiel', strengthened by God, despised and contemptible. That which is so fitting to the Lord, that we may say the Creator of the world, who is the Father of the Savior, is rejected and despised by all heretics, who do not accept the old Testament. It is not surprising that the Lord is the strength of God: since He is the power and wisdom of God Himself.

And the hand of the Lord became upon him there. LXX: And the hand of the Lord became upon me. In order to see the visions of God and understand, we need the hand and strength of God upon us (I Cor. I). In whose hand and arm the people of Israel were brought forth from Egypt; a part of whose strength even the Magi understood, saying: It is the finger of God (Exod. VIII). And the Savior in the Gospel: But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come upon you (Matth. XII, 28)." } For in another Gospel it is written: But if I by the finger of God cast out devils (Luke 11:20).

<h2 id='tocuniq7'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) And I saw, and behold, a whirlwind wind was coming from the North, and a great cloud, and fire enveloping, and brightness around it. And from its midst there was a kind of lightning, that is, from the midst of the fire. LXX: And I saw, and behold, a spirit pulling up (or lifting up) was coming from the North, and a great cloud in it, and shining fire, and brightness around it. And in its midst, there was a vision like lightning in the midst of fire, and brightness in it. In the consolation of the migrating people, and the revelation of God's will, the prophet sees the greatest vision. All the synagogues of the Jews are silent regarding its interpretation, claiming it to be beyond human understanding. And concerning this, and the construction of the temple, which is written about in the final prophecy, they attempt to undertake something. However, what we have received from our ancestors, and comparing spiritual things with spiritual in accordance with our limited understanding, we are able to speculate more than explain. We believe that kind-hearted and faithful readers will grant us forgiveness, as we beg for pardon for our audacity, or rather, our ignorance of faith, and that they will show favor rather than anger. Firstly, it must be known that the spirit that takes away or raises, which we have interpreted as the eagle, is understood by some as the wind of a whirlwind, and according to Symmachus and Theodotion as a blast and the spirit of a storm, received by some in a favorable direction, and by others in the opposite direction. The Hebrew word Rua is understood according to the quality of the places, either as spirit, or soul, or wind. Spirit, as in: Send forth your spirit, and they shall be created (Psalm 104:30). Soul: His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return into his earth (Psalm 145:4). Wind: Thou breaketh the ships of Tharsis with a violent wind (Psalm 47:8). And elsewhere: Fire and brimstone, and the spirit of storms, is the portion of their cup (Psalm 10:7). Those who understand the wind and the breath of the storm, feel this: the wrath and fury of God coming from the North, that is, from Nebuchadnezzar, and Jerusalem after six years from this vision shall be captured. In the fifth year of the reign of King Joachin, who was the fifth ruler in Jerusalem during the reign of Zedekiah, we read that after six years he was taken captive and brought to Babylon. Therefore, to those who dwelled near the river Chebar and willingly surrendered themselves to the king, it is revealed that they did well to obey the decree of God. In a short time, both the province of Judah and the city of Jerusalem were to be captured. And when a great cloud is described, let us understand it to portend the showers of inversions upon Judah, and the rains of collisions. And when fire appears wrapped around, it foreshows impending punishments and the evils of captivity. And the splendor surrounding it signifies the open judgments of God. But those who interpret it in the opposite way, namely, the good way, understand it to be the spirit that takes away or lifts up, the Holy Spirit, who takes away vices and sins from men, or lifts up those who are lying low to high things, and causes them to retreat from the very cold north wind, from which evils blaze up over all the earth (Sirach 43); and in Jeremiah, that terrible pot is kindled from the face of the north wind (Jeremiah 1). They also refer to the great cloud with respect to the person of Christ, who came into Egypt of this age upon a light cloud: and great is properly said in comparison to the lesser ones, namely, the prophets and all the apostles and saints, of whom it is written: And thy truth unto the clouds (Ps. 35:6); and: I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon Israel (Isaiah 5:6); and elsewhere: The clouds are the dust of his feet (Nahum 1:3); and again: Clouds and darkness are round about him (Ps. 96:2). He also desires that the shining fire and its brightness be received in the same way as it is written: God is a consuming fire (Deuteronomy 4:24). He says that the Savior came to send fire upon the earth, and he desires to burn in us and in all who believe (Luke 12:49). Despite bringing terror and punishment to sinners, he still shines with splendor and is full of light and radiance. Therefore, he purifies us so that he may grant us greater joy in our purified state.


<h2 id='tocuniq8'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5) And in the midst of it is the likeness of four living creatures, and this is their appearance: the likeness of a man is among them. And what follows, 'And there was a brightness in it,' should be noted. Unless the Scripture had added, saying: 'That is, from the midst of the fire,' we could have erred due to the ambiguity of the word, thinking that the appearance or vision was of lightning in the midst of the wind, or of a spirit. Therefore, it must be understood that in the midst of the fire and the torments of God, there is the likeness of lightning, which is more precious than gold and silver; so that after judgment and the torments, which seem sorrowful and harsh to those who endure them, the more precious brilliance of lightning appears, while God's providence governs all things, and what is thought to be punishment is actually a remedy.


<h2 id='tocuniq9'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) And in the midst of it was the likeness of four living creatures, and this was their appearance: the likeness of a man in them. In the midst of it, though not explicitly stated, is understood to be electrum; but it is better understood as fire, which is light to believers and punishment to unbelievers. Therefore, in the midst of this fire was the likeness of four living creatures, a likeness but not in nature; and the four living creatures that are subsequently described as having a quadriform shape have one likeness of a man, so that all rational things in the world may be displayed. For God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.' (Genesis 1)." } But the image and likeness of God is not a bodily form, but of the mind: described in the likeness of the true image of Christ, who is the image of the invisible God. These rational creatures revolve in four places, either because of the four cardinal points of the world, by which the globe is enclosed, or because of the four places, celestial, terrestrial, and infernal, and supercelestial, of which Paul the Apostle also speaks: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, on earth, and under the earth (Philippians 2:10). Of the three, there is Paul's testimony. Let us also consider the fourth. Praise the Lord, O heavens and you waters above the heavens, let them praise the name of the Lord (Psalm 148:5), and furthermore, other heavenly things are mentioned by the Apostle, and other things above the heavens (1 Corinthians 15).

<h2 id='tocuniq10'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) Four faces to one, and four wings to one, and their feet are straight feet, and the sole of their feet is like the sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkle like the appearance of burning bronze. And the hands of a man are under their wings on their four sides. LXX: And four faces to one, and four wings to one, and their legs are straight, and their feet are like the feet of a calf, and they sparkle like gleaming bronze, and their wings are light, and the hands of a man are under their wings on their four sides. We will endeavor to explain what the prophetic speech means to us, after briefly summarizing the opinions of each person, regarding the four animals, whose appearance resembled that of a human (only to the extent that they each had four faces, and four wings, and straight feet, and the sole of their foot was like the track of a calf's foot, or, as the Eagle interpreted it, round, which the Septuagint completely omitted), as well as the gleaming sparks of bronze, and their light feathers, which are not mentioned in Hebrew, and also the hand of a man under their wings divided into four parts, and the rest that the prophetic speech describes. Some believe that the four Gospels, which we also followed in the prologue of Matthew's commentary, are represented by the names of these animals: Matthew, because he described Jesus as a man: The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. They attribute the lion to Mark: The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as it is written in the prophet Isaiah: The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord: make his paths straight (Isaiah 40:3). Calves. In the Gospel according to Luke, which begins with the priesthood of Zacharias. Eagles, at the beginning of John, who, soaring to the heights, began: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. As for what seemed to us in the aforementioned work, we spoke in more detail in the Apocalypse of John (Chapter IV), where the species and names of these creatures are related to the four Gospels (also known as the Evangelists). We will attempt to explain how the description of all animals can be adapted to them, in its appropriate place. But others, who foolishly follow the wisdom of philosophers, believe that there are two hemispheres in the temple of the Cherubim, us and the Antipodes, as if humans were lying down and falling. Many, according to Plato, attribute rational soul, irascible soul, and concupiscible soul, which he calls λογικὸν, θυμικὸν, and ἐπιθυμητικὸν, to humans, lion, and calf: placing reason, cognition, mind, and understanding, as well as virtue and wisdom, in the citadel of the brain; and attributing ferocity, anger, and violence to the lion, which lies in the gall. Moreover, they locate desire, luxury, and the longing for all pleasures in the liver, that is, in the calf that clings to the earthly works. And they place forth, besides these three, a fourth, which is called by the Greeks συντήρησιν, which is the spark of conscience in the heart of Cain also, after he was expelled from paradise, which is not extinguished, and by which we, conquered by pleasures or by madness, and sometimes deceived by the appearance of reason itself, perceive that we sin. As the eagles are properly assigned, not mixing with three, but correcting the three that wander, which we sometimes read in the Scriptures called the spirit, who intercedes for us with unutterable groanings (Rom. VIII, 26). For no one knows the things of a man, except the spirit that is within him (I Cor. II, 11). And Paul also, writing to the Thessalonians, prays that they may be preserved whole in soul and body (I Thess. V). And yet this very conscience, according to what is written in the Proverbs: The wicked when he is come into the depth of sins, contemneth (Prov. XVIII, 13): we see to precipitate with some and to lose their place, who do not even have shame and modesty in their offenses, and deserve to hear: The face of a harlot is become to thee, thou hast (Alex. knowest) not been ashamed (Jerem. III, 3). Therefore God rules this team of horses like a charioteer, and restrains it in its unregulated steps, and makes it obedient, and compels it to obey his command. We will also discuss the nature of the soul, that is, of man, which the same philosophers call the microcosm. There are those who simply believe, according to the opinion of Hippocrates, that the four elements of the world are represented by four animals, from which all things are composed: fire, air, water, and earth. How these elements mix with each other, and how they appear to be joined together while remaining distinct, and how they touch each other, and how in one person they have four species and forms of animals, is not the purpose of this work. They also consider the four wheels that rise from earthly things to the heights, joined together with singular and four-formed animals, either as a mixture of the same elements or as the cycle of the four seasons, which is completed by twelve months, and the turning year, which has received its name from the fact that it always turns and returns to itself. Of these things, it has been elegantly said in one verse:

Spring, summer, autumn, winter, and months, and years. And it is said: There was a wheel in a wheel, they think it means year after year. About which another poet (Virgil, Georgics II):

And each year rolls on in its own footsteps. They also compare the likeness of the firmament to crystal, and they wish to understand this sky that we observe: under which four living creatures roll and pass. And they assume that the throne of sapphire-like color, and the man sitting above it in human likeness, describe the rule of everything and of all things under his feet, of the omnipotence of God; and to be said at the end: This is the vision of the likeness of the glory of God: through which, as through a certain picture and image, Providence is shown. And that the feet of animals are said to be straight, and the hoof of a calf, or round, to soar from earthly things to celestial ones, and with all angles removed, to follow roundness, which is the most beautiful of all figures. To indicate sparkling sparks, everything is full of light, and the hands of man under the feathers of both man himself, and the lion, and the calf, and the eagle: so that reason sustains everything, and lifts from earthly humility to celestial things. We can refer both to the Gospels and to all the things we have mentioned above. I remember hearing about four disturbances, which Cicero discusses at length in his Tusculan Disputations: joy, sorrow, desire, and fear. Of these, two are present and two are future, symbolized by four animals, about which Virgil briefly writes in Book VI of the Aeneid.

From these things they fear, desire, grieve, and rejoice: those things which owe their reason and power to God; and which are opposed, or rather imposed, by the four virtues, Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, and Temperance, so that they may be governed by their judgement. They completely ignored how these virtues are suited to the faces of a man, a lion, a calf, and an eagle. On these matters, the same philosopher and orator engages in a discussion in three books on duties addressed to his son. I have read a short discussion of a certain Catinus, whom the Syrians call 'subtle', that is, clever and ingenious. He believes that the order of the twelve tribes of the camp is described in the wilderness, toward the East and West, North and South, which are linked together by both charity and kinship, and that this is the wheel within a wheel that is led by the spirit and protected by a cloud in the desert, and illuminated by a pillar of fire at night; and they do not return to Egypt, but always hasten to go to the promised land. But in the middle, electricity is interpreted as the Holy of Holies, and the face of a man represents the whole of Israel; the lion represents the royal scepter of Judah; the calf represents the priestly and Levitical tribe. In addition to these, there is the face of an eagle, symbolizing God's vengeance and judgment, looking down from heaven on everything, and ready to tear apart the sinner, as mentioned in Hosea: 'Like an eagle over the house of God' (Hosea VIII, 12), that is, the temple. And in this same chapter (17), the great eagle with great wings and claws, which has the ability to enter into Lebanon, is understood to be Nebuchadnezzar, who even now signifies that he is about to come, and to sit as a charioteer on such a chariot of God, and to give commands, whether to do or not to do. But this, he says, is said to the people who are in Babylon, that if they submit their necks to God and obey His commands, they will once again deserve His help and regain the land they had lost.


<h2 id='tocuniq11'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Vers. 8, 9.) And they had wings, and the wings were joined one to another: they returned not when they went, but every one went straight forward. The Gospels are joined to one another and stick together, and they fly to and fro throughout the whole world; they have no end of their flight, nor are they ever overcome and retreat, but always they go forward to further places. And Paul says: Forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead (Philippians III, 13). We can say the same about the virtues of the soul, and about the flight of time, and the mixture of elements, that by leaving the past behind, they always hasten towards the former things. And that time slips away and flees is demonstrated in a short verse (Virgil, Georgics III).

But time flies meanwhile, it flies irreparably. And in a lyric poem (Horace. Carm. od. 14):

Alas, alas, swift years slip away, O Posthumus, Posthumus!

<h2 id='tocuniq12'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10) The likeness of their faces was that of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side of the four, and the face of an ox on the left side of the four, and the face of an eagle above the four. The faces represent the beginnings of the Gospels, in which the face of a man and a lion, that is, the birth of Christ, and the voice of prophets thundering in the wilderness, hold the right side. But the face of an ox, that is, of sacrifices and the priests of the Jews, is on the left side, which has been abolished and passed on to the spiritual priesthood, of which it was said: You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek (Psalm 110:4); so that all things may be united in it and considered as one body. But the eagle, which is both a symbol of birth and a symbol of prophecy, which is fulfilled by the coming of the Lord, and a symbol of the priesthood that has passed, 14 and beyond all these things, refers to the spiritual birth, how the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father. Concerning which it is rightly said: Who shall declare his generation? (Isaiah 53:8) These are, according to the Apocalypse (Chapter 4), as we have already said, the four living creatures full of eyes before and behind, one of which is like a lion, and the second like a calf, and the third has a face like a human, and the fourth is like a flying eagle. There they are said to have six wings: two covering their faces, two covering their feet, and two for flying. And they never cease saying day and night: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come (Rev. 4:8).

<h2 id='tocuniq13'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11) And their faces and their wings were extended above, two wings of each were joined together, and two covered their bodies. And above we said that the Gospels and the times, and all rational creatures, and the four virtues are joined to each other, so that whoever lacks one lacks them all. And that the two wings are extended and elevate themselves upward, signifies heavenly preaching, and all things tending towards the majesty of God. But of the two things by which bodies are covered, human knowledge is excluded, and perfect intuition is not provided, as the Apostle says: In part we know, and in part we prophesy. But when what is perfect comes, those things that are in part will be destroyed (I Cor. XIII, 9)." }

<h2 id='tocuniq14'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) And each one walked in front of his own face. Where the impulse of the spirit was, there they walked, and they did not turn back when they walked. He who holds the handle of the plow should not look back (Luke 9:62), nor imitate Lot's wife (Genesis 19), lest he fall into the punishment of Deuteronomy (Chapter 19) and perish in the incurable disease, like Eli, who had offended God with the vice of his sons (2 Kings 4). How much more do the four animals, which were full of light and feathers, which follow the preceding Holy Spirit, fly through the world like this, and raise themselves to the heights to protect their bodies with the wings of history, and not give us a fuller view? But what is said secondly: They did not turn back when they advanced, indicates the sacrament of both instruments, which quickly advance in these four creatures, both Law and Gospel for the future; and they never receive a backward movement.

<h2 id='tocuniq15'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verse 13, 14.) And the likeness of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of torches. This was the vision that was running among the living creatures, the brightness of the fire, and lightning coming out of the fire. And the living creatures were going and returning in the likeness of a flashing lightning. LXX: And in the midst of the living creatures was the vision, like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches running among the living creatures; and the brightness of the fire, and lightning was coming out of the fire like a flash. And what follows: And the animals were running and returning like a species of gazelle, which is added from Theodotion's edition to the Septuagint: so as not to seem to say something contrary to the two previous statements of the prophet, they thought that what they believed to be contradictory, that is, both the animals were running and returning, should be omitted, so as not to cause scandal to the reader. But it is better to translate in divine books what has been said, even if you do not understand why it has been said, than to remove what you do not know. Otherwise, many other things which are ineffable and the human mind cannot comprehend will be erased by this license. However, we say this, just as it is written in the same place in Proverbs: 'Do not answer a fool according to his folly, lest you be like him' (Prov. 26:4); and then it is stated what seems to be contradictory to us: 'Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he seem wise in his own eyes' (Prov. 26:5); and both statements agree in accordance with the difference in times and persons, as the fool is despised because he does not accept wisdom; and foolish pride is shaken off by other folly, just as the Apostle says: 'I have become a fool; you compelled me' (2 Cor. 12:11); so in this place we should seek why it was said above for the second time: 'Animals did not turn back when they walked, but now, they ran and turned back.' And if a question did not ensue, it would be like a flashing lightning, which in Hebrew is called Bezec, and interpreted by Symmachus as the appearance of a lightning beam. Therefore, just as the ether flashes with frequent fires and lightning bolts dart and return in the blink of an eye, without losing their source and, so to speak, the origin of fire and material: so too these animals, proceeding with undisturbed pace, hasten to their former places. But if, however, those who have undertaken it find anything hindered, they do not so much retreat as they contract themselves, to be extended again and to provide the light that they had momentarily hidden, in order to give food to the slaves at their proper time, neither to give holy things to the dogs, nor to throw pearls before swine (Matthew 7). Hence Paul also says: I have given you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it (1 Corinthians 3:2). And the election of Judas and the anointing of Saul do not argue that God is ignorant of the future, but they show that He is the judge of present things (Matthew 10). And it is commanded to the Apostles, that if they perceive an unworthy house by greeting, they should first shake off the dust from their feet; and let the peace which they gave to the house return to them. But the coals of a burning fire and the lamps running amidst the animals, are interpreted from that place of Isaiah: And fire shall devour the substance as hay, and I will sanctify them in a burning fire (Isaiah 5:24). And of them it is also written elsewhere: Coals shall fall upon them (Psalm 139:11). And against deceitful lips, in another psalm it is said: What can be given to you, or what can be added to you, to a deceitful tongue? The sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of desolation (Psalm 119:3-4). And in another place: You have coals of fire, you will sit on them; they will be a help to you (Isaiah 47:14). Whenever we look at any creature, the knowledge of God shines forth, as the Creator is recognized from the creatures. And from the midst of animals, the splendor of fire and lightning goes forth. For if you apply yourself to the Gospels, in the midst of simple words and humble history, you will find the sacraments of the Holy Spirit.

<h2 id='tocuniq16'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 and following) And as I looked at the animals, there appeared a wheel on the earth beside the animals, having four faces. And the appearance of the wheels and their work was like the vision of the sea. And there was one likeness for the four of them, and the appearance and work of each was like a wheel within a wheel. As they went, they went in the four directions and did not turn when they walked. The wheels also had stature and height and a fearsome appearance, and the whole body was full of eyes all around the four of them. LXX: And I saw, and behold, one wheel upon the earth following four animals. And the appearance of the wheels and their workmanship was like the color of beryl. And the likeness of the four was their appearance: and their work was as a wheel in the middle of a wheel. They went every one straight forward: whither the impulse of the spirit was to go, thither they went: and they turned not when they went. And their backs, and their height, and the appearance of them was terrible. And I saw, and I saw, and their backs were full of eyes, round about the four wheels. A single wheel appeared on the earth, which, divided into four, had as many faces as animals followed. And the resemblance of the four wheels to the four animals was so great that the single wheel was truly believed. And their work and structure were like a vision of beryl, which we turn into the sea. The eagle placed the jacinth; which stone resembles the sky. And their appearance was like a wheel within a wheel, so that you would believe not one wheel, but another joined to it. They were going in four directions and were not being dragged or turned back. For how could they turn back when they were following animals that always tend towards what is in front of them? Moreover, the size of the wheels and their height was such that it was a marvel to those who saw it. And the whole body and backs were filled with light all around, so that you could not see any limbs that did not have the light of eyes: like the stories of the poets describe Argus to have been with a hundred or many eyes, which Juno turned into a peacock because of his careless guarding, so that what is a marvel of the Creator God would be a condemnation of adultery without punishment. All the celestial and terrestrial things, and whatever falls under human understanding, are turned by the wheels of the Sun. The Moon runs the annual circle of the Sun through each month. Lucifer himself, who is the evening star, while he shines red towards the East and the West, tempers the darkness of the night with a small light and completes the same course every two years. And the four stars called wandering also move, and all that shines in the sky, as well as the varieties of crops, trees, and herbs, run their course in four seasons on their own wheels, and we see nothing that has not been before. The spirit moves in a gyrating motion, and it returns to its own circles. All the streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is not filled (Eccles. I, 6, 7). Why? Because they return to their sources from the abyssal depths. And as for the Gospels, that is, the four living creatures that breathe and live, if anyone considers their course and rotation, in a short time they will see that the world is completed by the apostolic teaching. The wheel within a wheel, or the joining of the two Testaments, signifies the ladder of Jacob (Gen. XXVIII), the tongs of Isaiah (Isai. VI), and the double-edged sword. It also represents the harmonious Gospels, whose course and structure tend towards heaven, touch slightly on earth, and always hasten towards the heights." } Concerning which, it is said elsewhere: 'Holy stones roll on the earth' (Zach. IX, 16); from which the celestial Jerusalem is built. I think this signifies the same thing as that which is sung in the psalm: 'The voice of your thunder in a wheel' (Psal. LXXVI, 19). And elsewhere: 'Which inflames the wheel of birth' (Jac. III, 6). The meaning of these testimonies in their respective places is not of this time. However, the whole body and backs full of eyes will approve, who will see that there is nothing in the Gospels that does not shine with light and illuminate the world with its brightness, so that even those things that are considered small and insignificant may shine with the majesty of the Holy Spirit.


<h2 id='tocuniq17'>(Vers. 19 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 19 and following) And as the animals walked, the wheels beside them also moved. And when the animals were lifted up from the ground, the wheels were lifted up at the same time. Wherever the spirit went, the wheels went there too, for the spirit of life was in the wheels. As the animals moved, the wheels moved; when the animals stood still, the wheels stood still; and when the animals were lifted up from the ground, the wheels followed them. For the spirit of life was in the wheels. Four animals followed the spirit, and a cloud that was in the spirit. And again, the wheels were lifted up from the earth, not the animals, but the spirit followed, to show their own will: because the spirit of life was in the wheels. Three things are indicated both in the animals and in the wheels together, when they stood, when they walked, when they were lifted up, which both the animals and the wheels did in common. For, animals standing still were not able to walk on wheels, nor were animals walking on the ground able to elevate themselves on wheels, but there was one action, one rest, one journey, and one elevation. And it is said secondly, because the spirit of life was in the wheels: so that we may not at all think of the wheels as vessels, which we see in the wagons of carts and chariots, but as living beings, indeed above living beings. For the animal-like man does not perceive those things that are spirits. Therefore, these wheels, in which the spirit of life was, make all things in order and measure, and they have harmony with animals, following them, and through them, the Holy Spirit; indeed, having skipped the middle, they enjoy the companionship of the Holy Spirit. All these things, according to the earlier understanding, a wise reader will be able to fit together with various interpretations.

<h2 id='tocuniq18'>(Vers. 22 seqq.)</h2>

(Verses 22 and following) And the likeness above the heads of the living creatures was like the appearance of a crystal terrible to behold, and they spread out their wings above, each creature having two wings that covered their bodies, and the other wings were similarly covered. And I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of many waters, like the sound of the Almighty God. When they walked, it was like the sound of a multitude, like the sound of an army camp; and when they stood still, their wings were lowered. For when a voice came above the firmament that was over their heads, they stood and let down their wings. And above the firmament that was over their heads, there appeared the likeness of a sapphire stone, as the likeness of a throne. And upon the likeness of the throne, there was the likeness as the appearance of a man above it. Wherever the spirit went, the creatures went in the direction that the spirit was moving. The creatures' wings were straight and they made a loud noise, like the sound of a voice from the Highest. The creatures moved in their formations and seemed powerful, which in Hebrew is called 'Saddai'. Many things have been omitted in this and other chapters by them, which they have postponed to include due to their length. However, what we have interpreted more clearly, one to another: each covered their body with two wings, and the other also covered their body similarly, for which it is written in Hebrew, a woman to her sister, a man covered his body with two wings, and a man also covered his body similarly: therefore, after the woman, the man is placed in the same person, so that we do not think of gender in heavenly beings: since in one and the same according to Hebrew custom, both the man and the woman are called the same. However, it seems that above there are 24 animals and an equal number of wheels, a likeness of the firmament, which we call the sky, having the appearance of crystal, which is very pure, and is said to congeal from clean and shining waters with excessive cold: just as water is also congealed by frost and is called κρύσταλλος in the Greek language. It was fitting, however, that in the higher things there should be surpassing purity, which protects all things, that is, the rational and wise virtues, and the course of the four seasons, and the regions of the world, and the order of all things, and the preaching of the Gospel, which is understood in part and veiled in part. And the voice of the wings of flying creatures is heard, like the sound of many waters, which, according to the Apocalypse of John (Chap. XVII), signifies peoples, and gradually progressing, is said to be like the voice of armies, and like the voice of the Most High God, which is called in Hebrew Saddai, and according to the Septuagint, the voice of the Word; so that we may believe that the voice of the Son of God is in all that is proclaimed in the world. And while the animals stood, their wings were lowered. For they could not bear the resounding voice of Almighty God in the heavens, but they stood and marveled; and in their silence, they demonstrated the power of God, who sat upon the firmament. The firmament below had the appearance of crystal, while the firmament above appeared like a sapphire stone. The sapphire stone resembled a throne, and the one sitting on the throne resembled a human. From this, we understand that the firmament, crystal, sapphire, and human are shown in similarity, not in truth. However, many testimonies teach us to understand the human as God the Father. Among these is the one in the Gospel: a certain man planted a vineyard and leased it to farmers (Matthew XXI, 33). And a little later: He sent servants and above all his son (Ibid., 37). Again: A certain man made a marriage for his son (Matth. XXII, 2). Not that the son is excluded from the kingdom, about which Isaiah wrote: I saw the Lord sitting on a high and exalted throne (Isai. VI, 1). And John said: This, he said, Isaiah said, when he saw the glory of the Son of God (Joan. XII, 41); but that he reigns in the Father and the Son. For all things are the Son's of the Father, who is the image of the invisible Father (Coloss. I, 15). For also in Daniel, God the Father is shown sitting (Dan. VII), and the Son of Man is offered to Him, that He may receive the kingdom. And in the Apocalypse of John, the same things are written about the Son (Apoc. III, VII). And in the battle of the first martyr Stephen, He is seen standing at the right hand of the Father. Concerning whom it is sung in the psalm: The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand. I will make your enemies a footstool for your feet (Psalm 110:1). Just as the purest and brightest things are shown in the heavenly realms, which illuminate our bodily eyes, so in the sapphire, that is, in the throne of God, and above the firmament that we understand as the sky, the hidden and mysterious and incomprehensible mysteries of God are revealed: He made darkness his hiding place (Psalm 18:11), appearing in a cloud and in darkness. And it is written in Exodus: And under the feet of God was like the work of sapphire stone, and as the appearance of the clearest sky (Exod. XXIV, 10). And thus the bride describes the beauty of the bridegroom in the Song of Songs: His belly is like a ivory tablet on a sapphire stone (Cant. V, 14). And in the Book of Revelation, the first foundation is written as jasper, the second as sapphire (Apoc. XXI). And in the breastplate of the high priest, in the order and arrangement of each stone, the second order has carbuncle, sapphire, and jasper (Exod. XXVIII). We have spoken about these things to some extent in the Explanations of Isaiah, concerning the stones.

<h2 id='tocuniq19'>(Vers. 27, 28.)</h2>

(Verse 27, 28.) And I saw a resemblance of amber, like the appearance of fire within it all around, from its loins and upward; and from its loins downward, I saw a resemblance of shining fire all around, like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day. This was the appearance of the splendor all around. This was the vision of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. The likeness of a man sat upon the likeness of a throne, which had the likeness of a sapphire stone, and it was likened to amber from its loins and upward. The electrum, both inside and outside, had the appearance of fire. But a shining fire was present around the loins and below, to show that the things above the loins, where sensation and reason are located, do not need fire or flames, but rather the most precious and pure metal. But the things below the loins, where copulation, generation, and the incitement of vices occur, need the purifying flames, so that once they have been cleansed, they can have a resemblance to a rainbow, commonly called Iris, which is in the cloud during a rainy day. For indeed Iris, which is called rainbow in the Holy Scripture, and in the Apocalypse of John is also called by the same name Iris (Apoc. IV), can only appear in rain and a watery cloud, of various and most beautiful colors, gradually transitioning into others. Hence also the poet (Virgil, Aeneid IV).

A thousand lights snatch various colors. But following the custom of the common people, the same poet says: 'When he drinks, he says, there is a rainbow.' From this he signifies that the rainbow never appears unless in the cloud and in the waters. This rainbow is a sign of God's mercy and covenant that he made with humans: that when it appears in the cloud, we know, according to the example of antiquity, that we will never again be destroyed by a flood (Genesis IX). From this it is shown that after punishments and penances, and the purging of sins, there will be future mercy, only for those who deserve to see God reigning. Where it is said: Here was the appearance of splendor in a circle. In the circle of God, or of the throne, or of all that was seen. And this is the vision of the glory of the likeness of God: not that he saw the glory of the Lord, but the likeness of his glory. And all this vision is: a spirit lifting up, and a great cloud, and four living creatures, and as many wheels following the creatures, and a spirit, which deserved to be under the firmament of God. After they were lifted up, they heard a voice like many waters, and like the sublime word of God, and the voice of camps and armies, they spread their wings and showed their astonishment in silence. And there appeared one sitting on the likeness of sapphire, like the likeness of a man, who had the appearance of electrum from his loins upward, and the appearance of fire from his loins downward in a circuit. After this, a sign of mercy is given, like the appearance of a rainbow when it is in the cloud on a rainy day. We have already spoken at length about this vision because it is both obscure and variously explained by many. In what follows, as much as possible without harming the senses, we will strive for brevity due to the magnitude of the volume.

<h2 id='tocuniq20'>(Cap. II.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 2, Verse 1) 23 And I saw, and fell upon my face, and heard the voice of him that spake. He was not lifted up by the greatness of the visions, but by the consciousness of human frailty he fell on his face. Hence, the apostle Paul, after the ascension into heaven and paradise, and the hearing of unspeakable words, says that a messenger of Satan was given to him, to buffet him, lest he be exalted. And Abraham fell upon his face after hearing the words of God. And yet, because he had fallen not due to sin but due to humility, he is lifted up by the Lord and commanded to hear his words (Genesis 17). It should also be known that to fall on one's face is different from falling backward. Abraham, after hearing about the birth of Isaac, fell on his face and laughed (1 Samuel 4). However, Eli, who had sinned, fell backward. And it is written about Dan in Genesis: Let Dan be a serpent on the path, biting the horse's heel, and let the rider fall backward, awaiting the salvation of God (Genesis 49:17-18). For because he had fallen off the horse to be bitten by a snake, he awaits the coming of the Savior. And in the Gospel according to John, those who had come to apprehend the Lord, after he answered: I am, they fell backward to the ground (John 18:6); not enduring his statement, who had said to Moses: Go, say to the children of Israel: He who is, has sent me to you (Exodus 3:14).

And he said to me: Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you ((Vulg. with you)). He could not hear the word of God while lying down, but he hears it with Moses: But you stand here with me (Exodus XXXIV, 2). Daniel also mentions that this happened to him (Daniel X).

<h2 id='tocuniq21'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Version 2.) And the spirit entered into me, after he had spoken to me, and set me upon my feet. And I heard him speaking to me, and saying: Son of man. LXX: And the spirit came to me, and took me, and lifted me up, and set me upon my feet: and I heard him speaking to me, and he said to me: Son of man. The divine word had commanded the prophet and had ordered: Stand on your feet (Psalm XXXIX, 3); but he could not stand without the help of God and the coming of the Holy Spirit: therefore, he enters into him, or takes and raises him up, so that he may stand firmly and be able to say: He has set my feet upon a rock (Ephesians VI, 14). And we read of no sinner standing, but it is said to the saints: Stand therefore with your loins girt. However, that sinner deserves to hear what is written in Deuteronomy 24: There shall be no firmness in the tread of your foot. It is frequently said to Ezekiel: Son of man, and rarely to Daniel: both of whom in his person said: But the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head, he consoles the captive people and brings them back to repentance.


<h2 id='tocuniq22'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) I send you to the sons of Israel, to the apostate nations who have turned away from me. They and their fathers have transgressed my covenant up to this day. They are called not the people of God Israel, but the apostate nations, those who have departed from the Lord, not only the fathers, but also the sons. And it is not that the sons should be held accountable for the sins of the fathers; but rather, that the impiety should be equal among both fathers and sons. Furthermore, what the LXX translated, provoking and turning me to bitterness, signifies that our sins cause the kind and gentle nature of God to change into bitterness." } For as it is said to the saints, 'Taste and see that the Lord is sweet' (Psalm 33:9); so sinners feel him as bitter. Therefore, the Apostle relates the goodness and severity of God towards the saints and sinners (Romans 21). And of the sinners who were lying down, it is written: 'The Lord raises up those who are cast down, the Lord loves the just, the Lord loosens the bound' (Psalm 145:8). Indeed, rewards are promised to the standing saints.


<h2 id='tocuniq23'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) And they are children with a hardened face and an unyielding heart, to whom I am sending you. This is not found in the Septuagint. It is of great mercy to send God to such people and not to despair of their salvation, and it is a prophetic confidence that he does not fear to go to such people. But we must understand the phrase 'hardened heart' and 'hardened face' according to what is said to sinners: 'Your neck is an iron sinew, and your brow is bronze.' (Isaiah 48:6) And those who are accused of having a heart of stone in their subsequent actions, because God says He will tear it out and replace it with a fleshy one, so that through its softness it may embrace God's commandments.

<h2 id='tocuniq24'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) And you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: If perhaps they will hear, and if perhaps they will be silent: for the house is provoking, and they shall know that there has been a prophet among them. Something similar is written in Jeremiah: If perhaps they will hear and repent (Jer. XXVI, 3). And in the Gospel: Perhaps they will fear my son (Matth. XXI, 37). God speaks these things with a doubting affection, in order to show the free will of man, so that the foreknowledge of future evil or good does not make immutable what God knows will happen in the future." } For it is not because he knows what is going to happen, that it is necessary for us to do what he has foreseen: but rather, because we are going to do it by our own will, he knows the future as if he were God.

<h2 id='tocuniq25'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6) So you, son of man, do not fear them, nor be afraid of their words, for they are unbelievers and subverters with you. LXX: And you, son of man, do not fear them, nor be dismayed by their presence, for they are insane and will gather against you all around. Though they may have stiff necks and rebellious hearts, my commands are stronger. And do not think that you will be deceived if you are sent to those who will not listen to you. Behold, I forewarn you that they will be mad and gather against you and surround you, leaving you no escape. But they will do this because they are unbelievers and despise the commands of God.

And you dwell with scorpions. Do not fear their words, and do not dread their faces, for their home is vexing. They are able to strike, to pierce with a curved wound, and with a barbed sting, so that the same blow opens both skin and disperses poison. Each one is given a name according to their character. You write and are called Pharisees: Brood of vipers (Matthew 23:33). And of Herod, who was a deceiver: Go and tell that fox (Luke 13:32). And false prophets are compared to foxes in this same Prophet. And now they are said to be scorpions with an untamed heart. Hence we read in the Gospel: All who came before me were thieves and robbers, and the sheep did not listen to them (John 10:8). And how did the lost sheep of the house of Israel listen to their adversaries? From this it is shown that those who listened lost the name of sheep and took on other names, so that they did not perish like sheep, but like vipers, foxes, and scorpions.


<h2 id='tocuniq26'>(Vers. 7, 8.)</h2>

(Vers. 7, 8.) And you shall speak my words to them: perhaps they may hear and fear, or be silent, because they are rebellious. But you, son of man, listen to what I speak to you. Therefore, there should be no ceasing, even though those we speak to are wicked; on the contrary, according to the Apostle (II Tim. IV), let us preach the word of God opportune, importune, for it is possible that both the hardened may be corrected to gentleness, and the obedient, with a changed will, may not listen.


Do not be exasperating, just as a house is exasperating. Once we said to put on the bitterness of Septuagint, whether irritation or exasperation. Therefore, what he says is this: You should not imitate those whom you are sent to correct, lest you deserve a similar sin and punishment.

Open your mouth, and eat what I give you. Make yourself worthy, he says, for my speeches, and receive spiritual food, so that as it is said in the Gospel: He who has ears to hear, let him hear (Luke 8:8); and here let it be said: He who has an open mouth for eating, let him eat. Hence the Lord speaks to the Psalmist: Open your mouth, and I will fill it (Psalm 80:11). And he responded: I have opened my mouth, and I have drawn in the spirit (Psalm 118:131). And the apostle Paul, who had in himself the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, and in whom Christ the Lord spoke, writes to the Corinthians: My mouth is open to you, oh Corinthians (II Cor. VI, 11). And Matthew reports about the Savior: Opening his mouth, he taught the disciples (Matt. V, 2).

And I saw, and behold a hand sent to me. For the hand that is sent, the Seventy translated it as extended. That which is sent and extended is for those who receive benefits. But it is contracted by those to whom it speaks through the Prophet: 'Has the hand of the Lord been shortened and contracted?' (Isaiah 50:2) And in the Psalm: 'Why do you withdraw your hand and your right hand from the midst of your bosom until the end?' (Psalm 73:11) Finally, He extends His wings in His passion, receives His disciples, and carries them on His shoulders, and He says: 'All day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people' (Isaiah 65:2), that He may gather the children of Israel, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings; and by the extension of Moses's hands, Israel overcomes Amalek (Exodus 17).


<h2 id='tocuniq27'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) In which was wrapped a book, and He spread it out before me, and it was written on the inside and on the outside: there were written in it lamentations, and a song, and woe. And He said to me: Son of man, whatever you find, eat it. Concerning the wrapped book, the seventy chapters of the book were translated. In the hand of the Lord, who was sitting on the throne, what was sent and extended. Of whom it is also said in the Psalms: It is written about me in the chapter of the book (Psalm 39:8). Chapter 27, let us understand the beginning. This book, wrapped and sealed, written inside and outside, or before and after, was of such difficulty that no one could open it and read it, neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth, except the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David and Jesse, whom John in the Apocalypse said had devoured himself (Rev. 5), not all of it, but in a chapter, that is, in the beginning. For it is impossible that human nature should devour the whole treasure of this book. And the prophet spread it out before them and presented it to be read and known, for it is said in Isaiah that it is signed to a people not redeeming (Isa. XXIX). Even to this day, the veil is placed over the Jews in the old Testament. And it was written before and behind; about the future and the past. Or certainly on the surface, in the letter of history, inside, in spiritual understanding, of which the Psalmist also says: All the glory of the king's daughter is within (Psal. XLIV, 14). And in it there were both inward and outward lamentations, and song, and woe. Lamentations, concerning those who are called to repentance, just as Samuel, Apostle Paul, mourned and lamented for Saul and the Corinthians, whom they desired to save (2 Chronicles 16; 2 Corinthians 12). Song about those who are worthy of God's testimony, and to whom the Psalmist commands: Sing to the Lord a new song (Psalm 95 and 97, 1). But woe to those who are deeply despairing and when they come into the depths of sin, they despise (Prov. XVIII).

<h2 id='tocuniq28'>(Cap. III.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 3, Verse 1) Eat this scroll, and go ((Vulg. going)), speak to the children ((Vulg. to the children)) of Israel. Unless we eat the open scroll beforehand, we cannot teach the children of Israel. Finally, even David, after he himself received mercy, said: I will teach, he said, the wicked your ways, and the ungodly will turn to you (Psalm 50, 15).

<h2 id='tocuniq29'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Ver. 2.) And I opened my mouth, and he fed me with that scroll. And he said to me: Son of man. I, he said, opened my mouth, because I was told: Open your mouth, and eat. And, with my mouth open, the Lord provided food; so that the beginnings of desire may be in us, and we may attain the perfection of blessedness from the Lord. For it is not of the one willing or of the one running, but of the merciful God (Rom. IX, 16). Yet both the willing and the running are of our own will. For it is opened, they translated the Septuagint, he opened, so that 28 God is understood: for he opened the mouth of the prophet, and fed him.

<h2 id='tocuniq30'>(Vers 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) Your stomach will eat; and your bowels will be filled with that volume which I give to you. LXX: Your mouth will eat, and your stomach will be filled with that chapter given to you. The beginning of the lesson, and the simple history, is the essence of this volume. But when we have stored the book of the Lord in the treasure of our memory through constant meditation, our spiritual stomach is filled, and our bowels are satisfied, so that we may have, with the Apostle Paul, the bowels of mercy (Colossians 3), and that stomach may be filled of which Jeremiah speaks: My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart (Jeremiah 4:19).


And I ate it, and it was in my mouth like sweet honey. David also says: How sweet are your words to my throat, sweeter than honey to my mouth (Psalms 118:103). And elsewhere: The judgments of the Lord are true, desired more than gold and precious stones; and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb (Psalms 19:10, 11). And Samson found honeycomb in the mouth of a lion (Judges 14); and after the resurrection, the Lord ate a piece of broiled fish and honeycomb (Luke 24). And in Proverbs it is said about the bee, even though there are no Hebrew examples of this: Go to the bee, and learn how industrious it is, and how it makes its work pure: by which the labor of kings and the foolish is misused for their own health (Prov. VI, 8, sec. LXX): this is what Moses and the prophets, and the evangelists, and the apostles have done; so that whoever becomes a king, whose heart is in the hand of God, may enjoy sweet foods. But whoever is simple and without the cunning of the serpent has the innocence of doves, let them believe with simple faith and be saved: because everywhere there are traps, and often the devil transforms himself into an angel of light (II Cor. II): and honey drips from the lips of a harlot woman, promising sweetness so that she may spread poison (Prov. V).


<h2 id='tocuniq31'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) And he said to me: Son of man, go and enter (in the Vulgate it is not 'and enter') into the house of Israel, and speak my words to them. It is said to him: Go and enter into the house of Israel, it is shown that he was not with the sinful people; although he seemed to dwell in the same place on the banks of the river Chebar. For it is written: And I was in the midst of the migration next to the river Chebar. Indeed, the conversation of the prophet was separate, and he was offended by the sight of the wicked. Moses did the same thing (Exodus 33) when he pitched the tabernacle far away from the camp, and when he had entered it, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tabernacle.

<h2 id='tocuniq32'>(Vers. 5, 6.)</h2>

(Verses 5, 6) For you are not being sent to the people of profound speech and difficult (Vulgate: unknown) language, to the house of Israel, nor to many peoples who speak an unknown language, whose speech you cannot understand. And if I were to send you to them, they would listen to you. But because they do not want to come to you, you go to them. For they do not have need of a doctor who is well, but of one who is sick (Luke 5:31). And you cannot say: I cannot speak to them, because their language is different, and we are barbarians to each other, and we cannot understand each other's speech. What shall I speak about the united people? If I were to send you to different nations, nonetheless my authority and power would conquer all difficulty. And I wish that the time were at hand, when I am about to send my apostles to all nations, so that I may give thanks for languages, and that they may preach and subdue the whole world under my yoke of one faith, from the diversity of languages; it would be easier for those who are deep and profound in speech to hear, and who have nothing of Jewish frivolity, but enter with a heavy and solid foot, and although the languages are unknown, the faith is known. And it follows: And if I were to send you to them, they would listen to you. Finally, he sent, and they all believed together. Hence, Paul and Barnabas speak to the Jews (or rather, to them): It was necessary for the word of God to be preached to you, but since you do not want to receive the message, behold, we turn to the Gentiles (Acts 13:46). And about the centurion, it is said: I have not found such great faith in Israel (Matthew 8:10).

<h2 id='tocuniq33'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) But the house of Israel does not want to listen to you, because they do not want to listen to me. For the whole house of Israel is weary-faced and hard-hearted. Do not be saddened, he says, if they do not want to listen to you. Therefore, they will not listen to you: because they will despise listening to me: just as the Savior also said: 'Whoever does not receive you, does not receive me' (Ibid., X, 40). In which it is clearly shown that free will is granted. And two reasons are given as to why they do not listen: because they are perverse of will, he says, and weary-faced, or, as the Seventy have translated, contentious: and it is understood that, being often invited to salvation, they did not want to listen.


<h2 id='tocuniq34'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Version 8, 9) Behold, I have made your face stronger than their faces, and your forehead harder than their foreheads. Like adamant and like flint I have made your face. Do not fear them or be afraid of their presence, for they are a rebellious house. And he said to me, 'The house of Israel has a stubborn and audacious forehead, and a heart as hard as scorpions. Therefore, I have given you a very hard face and a forehead that will not be ashamed.'" } From this we learn that sometimes it is necessary to resist the audacity of God's favor, and when the situation demands it, to stand firm and face adversity head on. However, this is attributed so that our true modesty and human decency does not fear the plots of enemies.

<h2 id='tocuniq35'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10) Son of man, take all my words that I speak to you, and receive them into your heart, and listen with your ears. This is the nourishment of the book, and these are the words by which, according to the diversity of those who hear, either lamentation, or song, or woe is spoken ((or spoken to)). And yet it should be noted that before the words of God are to be composed, heard, and understood more diligently in our hearts, and thus proclaimed to the people.

<h2 id='tocuniq36'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) Go, enter into exile (or captivity), to the children of your people, and speak to them, and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: if perhaps they may hear and be quiet: And our Lord came to the people of Judah, sent by the Father, to proclaim remission to the captives, and to fulfill in him what is written: Ascending on high, he led captivity captive: he gave gifts to men (Psalm 67:19).


<h2 id='tocuniq37'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Vers. 12.) And the Spirit took me, and I heard behind me a great sound of shaking: Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place. God of whom it is written: The Lord lifts up the meek (Psalm 146:6), He Himself also took up the prophet, who was not in the flesh, but in the spirit, and walking in the spirit, he did not fulfill the works of the flesh: for the spirit of God was in him. Therefore, despising earthly things, he is carried away by the spirit, and he hears behind him a great sound of shaking, forgetting the past and reaching out to the future, so as to leave the snares of his enemies behind him. We read of a similar incident in the book of Exodus (Exod. XXIV), when Pharaoh and his entire army pursued the Israelites, and the angel in the pillar of cloud left the front of the camp and came behind them, standing between Israel and the Egyptians all night. This caused great fear among the Egyptians and allowed the Israelites to hear the words: 'Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His place.' The place of the Lord is wherever He finds lodging. Alternatively, the Son is the place of the Father, just as the Father is the place of the Son, as the Lord Himself, our Savior, said: 'I am in the Father, and the Father in Me' (John XIV, 11). This same thing also signifies Michael: Behold, the Lord will come forth from his place, and will come down upon the high places of the earth. And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys shall be as wax melting before the fire, and as waters that are poured down a steep place. (Mich. I, 3, 4) For when the Lord and Savior descended, and proceeded from the Father, the high places of the earth and the mountains were moved, and the lower parts of the valleys were liquefied. This place can be the glory of the Lord, and the inaccessible light, of which the Apostle speaks: Who only hath immortality, and inhabiteth light inaccessible. (I Tim. VI, 16). When we turn over in our minds the past judgments of the Lord, we hear the voice from behind of a great commotion. When we reflect on the future in our hearts, a voice is heard about the things that came before, and from those that are before.

<h2 id='tocuniq38'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) And the voice of the wings of the animals striking one against another, and the voice of the following wheels of the animals, and the sound of a great commotion. Because it is understood, ἀπὸ κοινοῦ according to the Hebrew: I heard behind me the sound of a great commotion, and I heard the voice of the wings of the animals, and the sound of the wheels, added by the Septuagint: And I saw the voice of the wings of the animals striking one against another, and the rest according to what is read in Exodus: And all the people saw the voice of God (Exod. XX, 18): that is, the voice that came from behind, the prophet heard; but what was in front of him, he saw. But it is better and truer to have understood a heard voice than a seen one, as well as the beating of wings against each other and the sound of wheels, which we mentioned above, and the great commotion that showed the coming wrath of God upon the people of Israel.

Verse 14. The Spirit also lifted me up and took me away, and I went bitterly in the indignation of my spirit. Septuagint: And the Spirit lifted me up, and received me, and I went high in the impetuosity of my spirit. After being lifted up by the Spirit and taken by him, then in the indignation and bitterness of his spirit he went where he was carried, understanding the indignation of God and what the vision signified, pondering in his mind. 32 Whether he was carried high by the impetuosity of his own spirit, desiring to go where the Lord commanded." } But let us understand his spirit, not the Holy Spirit, but the spirit of man, about which it is said in many places, as in Isaiah: My spirit rises up to you, O God, during the night (Isaiah 26:9). And the prophet is carried (not as some think) in spirit, but in the very body, which we also read about in Habakkuk according to Theodotion (Daniel 14).

<h2 id='tocuniq39'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) For the hand of the Lord was with me, strengthening me. And I came to the exile at the mound of new fruits, to those who lived near the river Chebar. And I sat where they were sitting, and I stayed there for seven days mourning among them. LXX: And the hand of the Lord became strong upon me, and I entered into the lofty captivity. And I went around the inhabitants along the river Chebar, who were there. And I sat there for seven days, dwelling among them. For the reason that we have translated, Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion have placed the Hebrew words Thel Abib (): which the Seventy translated, lofty and roundabout; believing it better to say something than to impose something that would make the reader question. But we have learned from the Hebrews that Thel abib means, when new grains or barley are gathered, and after hunger and scarcity, before they are ground in the threshing floor, they promise some hope of food. Thus Israel, small and weak, who dwelt on the banks of the river Chobar, like one revived and sprung from the earth, promised the sowing of the Jewish people. But the hand of the Lord came upon the prophet, strengthening him, so that he may receive the name of a watchman, and teach what he has learned. And for seven days he dwells among them, seeing all that they are doing, so that he may know what he should reprove. And he mourns, or converses in their midst, seeing their crimes and the just punishment of God for the iniquity of their sins. For the reason that we have mentioned, he translated it grieving, and it is written in Hebrew as Masmim (), Theodotion translated it, admiring, in order to express the astonishment of the Prophets who perceive their iniquities. But the second edition of Aquila, which the Hebrews call 'according to accuracy', translated it: 'being calm', that is, being at rest, and being separated from them in mind although he was indeed among the 33 captives, to show.

<h2 id='tocuniq40'>(Vers. 16, 17.)</h2>

(Verse 16, 17.) But after seven days had passed, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel, and you shall hear a word from my mouth and declare it to them from me. The one who is to be a watchman and declare God's words to the people must rest for a long time and grieve over what he sees. He must have no guilt concerning the things he will correct in others.

<h2 id='tocuniq41'>(Vers. 18, 19.)</h2>

(Verse 18, 19.) If you say to the wicked, 'You shall surely die,' and you do not warn him or speak to warn the wicked to turn from his wicked way, that person shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you will have delivered your soul. The two are wicked, or unjust, as the Septuagint has translated. One who does not listen to the observer and dies in his impiety, whose blood is sought from the hands of the observer. Another, to whom the observer announces, and he, despising to listen, dies in his own fault: only so that the observer is free from blame. From this we understand that the Lord threatens the impious and says, 'You shall die by death,' in order to turn him away from his impious way and live. For the threat is not against men, but against sins; nor against those who turn away from vices, but those who remain in sin. And a great danger it is, to remain silent about God's teachings, for three reasons: either out of fear, or out of laziness, or out of flattery. Hence, Isaiah says: Woe is me, for I have kept silent (Isaiah 6:5). And what follows: But you have saved your own life, means what the Apostle says: If someone's work is burned up, they will suffer loss, but they themselves will be saved, yet as through fire (1 Corinthians 3:14); in order to prove whether an outsider is to blame for the death of the one who perished, or if they themselves are guilty. For the work of the teacher, the salvation of the student is.

<h2 id='tocuniq42'>(Vers. 20, 21.)</h2>

(Verse 20, 21.) But if the righteous turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, I will put a stumbling block before him. He will die because you did not warn him; he will die in his sin, and the righteous deeds he had done will not be remembered. But I will hold you accountable for his blood. However, if you warn the righteous man not to sin, and he does not sin, he will surely live because you have warned him, and you have saved your own soul. Just as we read about two wicked or unjust individuals: One, who did not listen, and perished; the other, who listened and persisted in wickedness: so there are two just individuals, one who did not listen and perished; the other, who listened and turned to repentance, saved his soul. It should be noted that the just individual can fall; and if he has a teacher, he can be converted to better things. And therefore, good deeds require a constant teacher, so that a misstep does not hold back the foot from the best course. And indeed, the wicked or unjust, if they do not repent, will die in their wickedness and iniquity. But the righteous, if they commit wickedness and sin, do not die immediately; rather, they are placed in stumbling or torment before them, as Theodotius said, in weakness: so that they may be tormented and not find a smooth path, and understand themselves to be weak, of whom the Apostle also says: Therefore, many are weak among you, and many sleep (I Corinthians XI, 30). For it is beneficial for the righteous to understand their sin and the torment of their conscience, and to say with the Psalmist: I am turned in my pain, while the thorn is fastened in me (Psalm XXXI, 4). And just as the wicked are not encountered by injustices if they turn away from their wicked way and live, so the ancient just deeds do not benefit the righteous if they are overwhelmed by new crimes. But what he introduces is: he will surely die, because you did not announce to him, it is understood, that he could have lived if the watcher and master had taught him.

<h2 id='tocuniq43'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) And there the hand of the Lord was upon me, and he said to me: Rise up, go out into the field, and there I will speak with you. What we have translated from Hebrew as 'there' is significantly placed, and there is no doubt that it signifies a place. For earlier we read: 'And I came to the captivity to the heap of new corn, to them that dwelt by the river Chebar' (Ezekiel 3:15). And rightly to the one to whom he had spoken, he sat down and is commanded to rise. And he who had entered to pass through, heard: go out, not into rugged valleys, not into steep cliffs, but into a wide field that can hold the glory of the Lord. Therefore, it is said to the Corinthians: Be enlarged (I Cor. VI, 13). When he enters to capture the captives, about whom it is said that they are mad and pursue him, perhaps he needs a strong hand in order to resist and endure the fury of those who pursue him. But when he goes out into the field, indeed the hand of the Lord is upon him: for he could not go out without his help, but strength is not added. For he goes out not to fight, but to see the glory of God. And it should be noted that while sitting among the captive, the Prophet himself did not see the glory of the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq44'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) And I arose and went out into the field, and behold, there the glory of the Lord stood, like the glory that I saw by the river Chebar. At the command of the Lord, he enters and at the command he exits, and he sits with those who are sitting; for the number of captives cannot hear him standing. And he went out into the width of the field, and saw the glory of the Lord standing, which he had previously seen walking and lifting itself up, and sometimes standing. Because near the river of this age, called Chobar, which can be interpreted (or, is interpreted) as most serious, glory was seen: which means that all the glory of this world overflows and does not have a stable degree. But the standing and persevering glory of the Lord, when seen with the standing Prophet in the field, could neither stand nor be seen among the captives.

<h2 id='tocuniq45'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24) And I fell on my face, and the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet: and he spoke to me, and said to me: Enter, and shut thyself in the midst of thy house. Unable to withstand the glory of the Lord standing, he fell on his face, so that he might be lifted up by the spirit entering into him. The spirit set him upon his feet and spoke to him, saying: Enter and shut yourself in the midst of your house. And here is the meaning: Because you have been strengthened by the vision of the Lord's majesty, do not fear or be afraid of anyone; but return to your own home, either for bodily needs, as some think, or as a sign of a future siege. Just as Isaiah, barefoot and naked, prophesied the captivity of the people for three years and the nakedness of the people (Isaiah 20), so you are also confined to your house, the very work of a prophet announcing the impending siege of the city of Jerusalem.


<h2 id='tocuniq46'>(Vers. 25, 26.)</h2>

(Verse 25, 26.) And you, son of man, behold, chains have been placed upon you, and they will bind you with them, and you will not go out from among them, and I will make your tongue cling to the roof (or throat) of your mouth, and you will be mute, not as a man reproving them (They are absent from the Vulgate): because the house is provoking. What is closed in the house, what is bound with chains, what does not go out to them, among whom it dwells, but among the multitude of captives, it suffers the loneliness of prison (as I have said above), an indication of siege, because Jerusalem is shut up and surrounded by the army of the Chaldeans, it will not allow anyone living there to go out. This is the pot about which Jeremiah speaks (Jerem. I), and he himself is this Prophet in the following; in which the flesh of the people is consumed. But the fact that the language of the Prophet clings to the palate or throat and becomes mute does not have the authority of a reproachful one, the reason is clear: because he says, 'the house is provoking.' And the sense is: They are of such bitterness, and of such contention against God, that they do not deserve to hear the one reproaching. From this it is clear that where there is a multitude of sinners, those who deserve correction are unworthy sinners, who are to be corrected by the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq47'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27) But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God: He who has ears to hear, let him hear; and he who is at rest, let him rest; for the house is rebellious.' What we read in Ecclesiastes, 'A time to keep silence, and a time to speak' (Eccles. III), is also affirmed in prophetic discourse: that it is the same wisdom to be silent and to speak in due time, and to give food to one's servants at the proper time. Therefore, Isaiah also said to the unbelieving people: I have kept silent, will I always be silent? says the Lord (Isa. 65). Therefore, he who, for a long time, kept his mouth shut because of the multitude of sins, because he saw that some could be converted, of whom it was said: He who hears, let him hear, and he who rests from evil, let him rest, and let him cease: therefore, speaking with an open mouth, not by his own will, but by the command of the Lord, he speaks to the people. But what we have set forth: He who hears, let him hear: and he who rests, let him rest: for which the Septuagint translated: He who hears, let him hear: and he who is unbelieving, let him remain unbelieving: the second edition of Aquila translated it thus: He who hears, will be heard: and he who leaves, will be left. And he said: To anyone who has, more will be given, and from anyone who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him (Mark 4:25).

<h2 id='tocuniq48'>(Cap. IV.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter IV - Verses 1, 2) And you, son of man, take for yourself a brick, and you shall put it before you, and you shall draw on it the city of Jerusalem. And you shall set up a siege against it, and build a siege wall against it, and pile up a mound against it, and you shall encamp against it, and set up battering rams against it all around. As we have said before: Go inside and enclose in the midst of your house, and behold, chains have been put on you, and they shall bind you, and you shall not go out. This is a symbol of the prophet of the future siege of the city of Jerusalem: now he is commanded to draw geometric art on a brick, and to place that brick before the prophet, so that after he has drawn Jerusalem in the dust, he may depict the entire siege against it, representing the fortifications, the piled mounds, the encircling army, and the battering rams, all of which are common in capturing cities. They are called fortifications, with which a city is enclosed, so that no one can escape from the besieged: embankments are brought in, with which the rampart and moat are filled; camps, the guards of the soldiers around; rams, with which the foundations of walls are shaken, and the joints of stones are dissolved. But this is said to signify the captivity of the nearby city of Jerusalem under Zedekiah: in the eleventh year both the king and the city were captured. On the side, which in Greek is called the feminine kind, Symmachus more clearly interpreted it as 'brick', which we can call a 'small brick' or 'tile'." } In whose dust the geometers are accustomed to describe lines, that is, lines and radii. From which some people want, it is not absurd to also have knowledge of this doctrine (repeating those examples, that Joshua son of Nun sent out explorers who would describe the land (Joshua 2) which is properly called Geometry: and the angel in Zechariah had a Geometric cord for measuring Jerusalem (Zechariah 2). And what the Prophet is now commanded to describe in the dust of Jerusalem (which is properly called Scene painting) we can take as a brick and a representation of Israel in mourning, which served Pharaoh in clay and brick (Exodus 1). Or let it be compared to a city which they thought was strong and impregnable, but which crumbles at the touch of water, as has been said before: Is not the hardest rock, or the mountain of the desert, turned into clay, which is corrupted by the flooding of Babylon; according to what is written: Therefore the Lord will bring upon you abundant and mighty waters, the king of Assyria (Isa. VIII, 7).


<h2 id='tocuniq49'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) And you shall take for yourself an iron griddle and place it as an iron wall between you and the city, and you shall set your face against it, and it shall be for a siege, and you shall surround it. This is a sign to the house of Israel. What we said above, both the prophet himself and the description of the side, the fortifications, the rampart, and the battering rams, surrounding Jerusalem as a sign preceding its siege, is now stated more clearly, after many things that are in the middle: The iron griddle is a sign to the house of Israel, and it represents a great wrath of God that will not be weakened by any prayers and will not be moved to mercy. For just as iron tames all metals, and nothing is harder than it, so the incredible crimes of Jerusalem, through their own vice, made God, who is naturally gentle, the most severe. It is also said that the frying pan is the barrier between the people and God, opposite to the wall, to show that the entire multitude can be quickly broken and reduced to nothingness. The hardening of the face against the city is a sign of severity, according to what we read elsewhere: The face of the Lord is against those who do evil; to destroy their memory from the earth (Ps. XXXIII, 17).


<h2 id='tocuniq50'>(Vers. 4 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 4 and following) And you shall lie on your left side, and you shall bear the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity. For I have assigned to you a number of days, three hundred and ninety days, to bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. And when you have completed these, you shall lie down on your right side for a second time, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah for forty days. I have given you a day for a year, I say, a day for a year. Let us consider the three hundred and ninety years that are equal to the same number of days in which the prophet lay bound and confined on his left side, so that he did not turn to the other side, demonstrating the captivity and miseries of the ten tribes, that is, the Israelites. And the forty years in which he lay on his right side, as the holy Scripture tells us, representing the sins of Judah, concerning this it must be said that under King Pekah, the son of Remaliah, who reigned in Israel for twenty years, Tiglath-Pileser, the king of Assyria, came and took, Aijon, Abel, the house of Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee, and all the land of Naphtali, and took them away to Assyria. After whom, Hoshea the son of Elah reigned in Israel for nine years, and he was captured with all of Samaria by Salmanassar, the king of the Assyrians, and he was transported to Elam and to the cities of the Medes in the rivers Abor and Gozan. But in the sixth year of the reign of King Hezekiah, as the holy book of Kings narrates, Hoshea was captured. If we calculate in order, we can find out how many years Israel was in distress and oppressed under the yoke of captivity. From the sixth year to the twenty-ninth year (for Hezekiah reigned for twenty-four years) twenty-four years are reckoned: after him came Manasseh, and he reigned for fifty-five years. After him Amon reigned for two years. After him Josiah reigned for thirty-two years. After him Jehoiakim, also called Eliakim, reigned for eleven years. After him Jehoiachin, also called Jeconiah, who was immediately taken into captivity, reigned for eleven years, and Zedekiah reigned in his place for eleven years, during which time Jerusalem was captured and the temple destroyed. Therefore, from the first captivity of Israel, which occurred under King Phacee until the eleventh year of Sedecias, when the Temple was desolated, there were 164 years (Al. 70). From the second captivity, when Osee was captured and all of Samaria was destroyed, there were 135 years (Al. 80). And there were 70 years of desolation of the Temple, which added to the first captivity, makes a total of 234 years. For in the second year of the reign of Darius, king of the Persians, the temple was built by Zerubbabel, the son of Salathiel, and Jesus, the son of Josedec, with the prophesying of Haggai and Zechariah. Darius reigned for thirty-six years, and when one year is subtracted, his reign was thirty-five years. After him, Xerxes, the son of Darius, reigned for twenty years. After him, Artabanus reigned for seven months. And Xerxes, also known as Μακρόχειρ, reigned for forty years. After him, Xerxes reigned for two months, and Sogdianus reigned for seven (or four) months. Darius, known as Νόθος, succeeded him, who reigned for nineteen years. After him, Artaxerxes, known as Μνήμων (or Memnon), the son of Darius and Parisatis, reigned for forty years, and he is called Assuerus by the Hebrews. It is under his reign that the story of Mordecai and Esther, found in the book of Esther (chapter 8), takes place. This is when the entire Jewish people were saved from the danger of death and regained their former freedom. From the second year of Darius to the final year of Assuerus, there are 155 years and four months. In addition to the previous 234 years, they make a total of 389 years and four months. The death on the right side, that is, 40 years, can be easily calculated. After Eliacim, who was called Joacim, his son Joachin, also known as Jechonias, reigned for three months. During his reign, the servants of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon ascended to Jerusalem and surrounded it with fortifications. Then King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to the city while his servants were besieging it. And Joachin, the king of Judah, went out to the king of Babylon, he and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his eunuchs, and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign and brought forth all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house. And after a little while: 'He carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of the army, ten thousand into captivity, and every craftsman, and smith, and nothing was left, except for the poor people of the land.' (Ibid.). After capturing Jerusalem with an infinite multitude of people and all the resources, Zedekiah reigned for eleven years. Under his rule, the city was captured and the temple was destroyed. Its desolation lasted until the second year of Darius, a period of seventy years. In the thirty-first year of the temple's desolation, Cyrus reigned in Persia after overthrowing King Astyages of the Medes. According to the prophecy of Isaiah, Cyrus sent back to Jerusalem nearly fifty thousand people from the tribe of Judah, along with the temple vessels that Nebuchadnezzar had taken, and other things that are narrated by Ezra in his history. Therefore, just as in Israel, that is, the ten tribes under the rule of King Pekah of Israel, under whom the Israelite people suffered much devastation by Salmanasar, until the fortieth year of King Assuerus, we calculate three hundred and ninety years, when the persecution of all the Jewish people was alleviated, so from the first year of Jechoniah, when a great part of Jerusalem was transported to Babylon, until the first year of Cyrus, king of the Persians, which was the thirtieth year of the desolation of the temple, forty years are reckoned, under which the captivity of the Jews was loosened, and freedom was restored to the people. Some, combining three hundred and ninety years for the Israelites and forty years for the Jews, make four hundred and thirty years, and they want them to be fulfilled from the baptism of the Savior to the end of the world. However, others, especially the Jews, want to be counted in tribulation, distress, and the yoke of captivity, four hundred and thirty years from the second year of Vespasian, when Jerusalem was captured by the Romans and the temple was destroyed, and thus the people to return to their former state. Just as the children of Israel were in Egypt for four hundred and thirty years, so may the final captivity end in the same number. And it is written in Exodus: Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. And again: After four hundred and thirty years, the entire army of the Lord went out at night. And I am quite amazed why the Vulgate editions have ninety years, and in some it is written one hundred and fifty years: when clearly, the Hebrew text, as well as Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion, hold three hundred and ninety years; and among the Seventy, who are not corrupted by the fault of the writers, the same number is found. The most difficult question, and I dare say proudly, not explained by anyone  42 , we believe has been expounded not so much by our knowledge, as by the grace of the Lord, fulfilling what He Himself promised: Seek, and you will find: ask, and you will receive: knock, and it will be opened to you (Matthew VII, 7). But whoever wants to calculate from the first captivity, which happened under Manahen, son of Gaddi, king of Israel, who reigned in Samaria for ten years (2 Kings XV): when Phul, king of the Assyrians, came into the land of Israel and received one thousand talents of silver; and after him, two more years Phacce, who reigned in Israel, will find that in the twenty-eighth year of king Assuerus, three hundred and ninety years were completed, when the story of Esther is said to have occurred: which is also more credible. For not with the end of the reign of Assuerus, but while he was still reigning, Israel cast off the yoke of the most burdensome servitude.

<h2 id='tocuniq51'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) And you shall turn your face to the siege of Jerusalem, and your arm shall be extended, and you shall prophesy against it. LXX: And you shall set your face against the siege of Jerusalem, and you shall strengthen your arm, and you shall prophesy against it. Preparation of the face is necessary, as well as strength, and confirmation of the extended and bared arm, so that not only through voice, but also through gesture and appearance of the prophet, the siege of the city may be demonstrated.


<h2 id='tocuniq52'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Vs. 8) Behold, I have surrounded you with chains, and you will not turn from one side to the other, until the days of your siege (or conclusion) are fulfilled. The left side, because it was without a temple and knowledge of God, is assigned to the Israelites; the right side, to the Jews, in which the worship and religion of God (or gods) resides. And it should be noted that in one side is the punishment of sinners, and in the other is the exercise of virtue. And one does not turn from one side to the other, so that no respite from torment is indicated, until the perfect conclusion of the aforementioned days is fulfilled. What the day is to prophets, that the year is to the patient (Gen. XXIX). And the years that Laban thought were few days for Jacob. But not only in punishments is there variety according to the diversity of merits; but also in the retribution of good things, lambs stand on the right, and kids stand on the left. Hence it is written in another place: The heart of the wise is in his right hand, but the heart of a fool is in his left hand (Ecclus. X, 1). There are different bonds of the Lord, by which we are bound for salvation; other bonds of the devil, by which he had bound a woman for eighteen years in the Gospel (Luke XIII). And so each and every one of the sinners is bound by the cords (Prov. V, 22). This the Lord loosens through the resurrection of Lazarus, who had been lying bound with graveclothes and burial bands (John XI).

<h2 id='tocuniq53'>(Vers. 9 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 9 onwards) And you shall take wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make yourself bread for the number of days that you shall lie on your side; three hundred and ninety days you shall eat it. And your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time you shall eat it. And you shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time you shall drink it. And you shall eat it like barley bread, and cover it with human excrement in their sight. This is how we interpret the vice, for which it is called Chasamim in Hebrew. The Septuagint and Theodotion rendered it as ὄλυραν, which some believe to be oats, others believe to be rye. But the first edition of Aquila and Symmachus translated it as ζέας or ζείας, which we call either spelt or emmer in the spoken language of Italy and Pannonia. Moreover, they also added figurines to the vase. And the prophet is commanded to foretell a future famine, and to demonstrate through action the poverty of the people of Israel. Just as in times of scarcity, one does not seek diverse and luxurious foods, but rather how to fill the stomach, so now the prophet mingles wheat, barley, beans, lentils, and millet, along with oats, in one vessel and makes three hundred and ninety loaves, which he will eat each day. Each loaf weighs twenty shekels, that is, stateres. The shekel, that is, the stater, has four drachmas. Eight drachmas, however, make a Latin ounce, so that one loaf is said to have ten ounces, by which the soul is drawn more than it is sustained. The sterility of food increases the sterility of water. For it is commanded to drink one sixth of the Hebrew measurement, which is called a hin, each day. Furthermore, a hin makes two Attic choas: 44 which we can call two Roman sextarii, so that the hin measurement is the Hebrew sextarius and our military one, of which one sixth makes one third of a Roman sextarius. Food and drink do not give strength, but prevent death, according to the famous Orator. And when he says, 'From time to time you shall eat or drink', he means from evening to evening, although some may misunderstand it as meaning from year to year. And the bread itself is made like barley bread mixed with ashes. It is said that it should be covered with human excrement, not for those who are going to eat it without knowledge (for ignorance usually tempers misery), but for those who see it, so that the sight causes horror before the taste causes nausea. Also, it should be noted that according to the number of days on the left side, three hundred and ninety subcinericii breads should be ordered to be made and eaten each day, and no mention should be made of the forty breads on the right side. This is a secret hint that the punishment of the sinful people is not the same if they have knowledge of God and of the one who has completely departed from the religion of the true God. We can also say this according to spiritual understanding, that the Jewish people, after offending God, still eat subcinericii bread mixed with wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and oats; one type of food for humans, the other for animals. For in that they seem to believe in one God, they have something of wheat. But in denying the Son, they feed on barley and beans, with which the belly of those who eat is inflated, and the mind is said to be oppressed: to such an extent that even to the Pythagoreans, the food is detestable. Because of a lentil, Esau lost his birthright (Genesis XXV). Millet is the food of peasants, rustic people, and birds. Oats, or weeds and wild herbs, are eaten by dumb animals. But what is written according to the Septuagint, that Elijah, fleeing from Jezebel, found barley bread, gritty and covered with ashes (3 Kings 19), is a sign of persecution and scarcity. Therefore, he is fed by ravens, so that because he did not find food in Israel, he would be nourished by unclean Gentile foods. Also, the very law they read, but do not understand, is bread covered with ashes and covered with human excrement. Therefore, Paul the Apostle says that he considered the gains of the Law and the observance of the former ceremonies as dung, in order to gain Christ (Philippians 3).


<h2 id='tocuniq54'>(Vers. 13 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 13 onwards) And the Lord said: So shall the children of Israel eat their bread, defiled among the nations to which I will cast them out. And I said, ah, ah, ah, Lord God: Behold, my soul is not defiled, and I have not eaten carrion or torn flesh from beasts from my infancy until now, and no unclean meat has entered my mouth. And He said to me: Behold, I have given you cow dung instead of human excrement, and you shall make your bread with it. According to the book of Zechariah (Zech. III), prophets are extraordinary men who predict the future through their works and speak on behalf of God. We frequently read in many places that God compares Himself to being in the hands of the prophets (Hosea XII, 10). Just as Ezekiel ate bread in excrement, so too will the Israelites, or all the people of Judah, or as some believe, the ten tribes, eat polluted bread among the nations. Although this is not a threat to those who have already been expelled, it is directed towards those who will be expelled from the promised land. When he learned this from the Prophet, he vehemently denounced it according to Aquila, ah, ah, ah. But according to Symmachus and the Seventy, he responded μηδαμῶς, which in Latin means 'by no means'. Therefore, Theodotion translated it as 'O Lord God'. We should not think that he is contradicting the command of the Lord, but rather giving reasons, or rather begging, why he cannot do this. Finally, he obtained what he asked for, and the severity of the sentence was tempered by a milder command. It is questioned why Ezekiel refused more easily, and why Hosea was immediately joined to a prostitute without contradicting or even responding, claiming to have a chaste body and not be defiled by the company of a harlot, as the Apostle says: 'He who is joined to a harlot becomes one body with her' (1 Cor. VI, 16). From this it is shown that the figure of the Synagogue, or the Church, was not truly accomplished according to the letter: which we have explained more fully by expounding the prophet. Morticinium is said to be a killing that loses life without shedding blood, and in which the soul dies, torn apart by wild beasts, which is called θηριάλωτον in Greek. But as for the human excrement, which is granted to be cattle manure, lighter evils are signified: while they are indeed commanded to eat bread cooked in cow manure; but it is far from being the uncleanness of human excrement: and even to this day this sentiment is observed among the Jewish people, that they do not eat their bread in human excrement. For they do not serve idols, nor do they worship the various wonders of demons; but they work with the flesh and belly and the goods of this earth, as it is said: Those who do these things shall live in them (Lev. XVIII, 5; Deut. IV). But we despise earthly things, and not only do we trample the foods of human waste, and consider earthly delights to be worthless, but we eat the bread that descends from heaven (John. VI), and we enjoy that food, of which the Psalmist sings: Man eats the bread of angels (Psalm LXXVII, 25); living not by the flesh of the Egyptians, but by the thinness of the manna.


<h2 id='tocuniq55'>(Vers. 16, 17.)</h2>

(Verse 16, 17.) And he said to me: Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and drink water by measure and with dismay. So that when bread and water are lacking, everyone will collapse to his brother, and they shall waste away in their iniquities. The Hebrew word מתא (Mate) is translated as staff in the first edition of Aquila, and as firmament in the second edition and by Symmachus and Theodotion. But that which he had shown in his work and explained in his speech, and the sleep of the left and right sides, and the ash bread mixed with six varieties of spices, representing the evils of the world, he strives to demonstrate the famine of food in Jerusalem and the incredible shortage of water, so that everyone may turn to their brother, hoping for assistance from another, which he does not perceive in himself. For it is the nature of humans, that in times of pressing evils and the weight of distress, they have more trust in those close to them rather than in themselves: and they waste away in their own injustices, while enduring everything for the sake of injustice. And I fear that even in our own Jerusalem, where the vision of peace is seen, this breaking of bread is found, which the Lord crushes when he is angry and judges us unworthy of his bread. And I hope that at least in weight and anxiety we may deserve to receive him, and may our dry tongue, with excessive dryness, be moistened by the finger of Lazarus at the end (Luke XVI). But with the deficiency of bread and water in the Church, a man will fall against his brother, and everywhere there is discord, with us tearing apart the tunic of Christ, which not even the soldiers dared to tear in the passion of the Savior (John XIX); and with our sins festering, as we do not possess the justice of God. It is written in Jeremiah that the little ones, that is, the common people of the Church, would seek bread and there would be no one to break it for them (Lamentations IV, 4). But Paul, a man of 48 churches, knew that Christ broke the legal bread and gave it to the disciples to be distributed. He confidently says: Is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? (I Cor. X, 16.) And those who are weak and need the milk of infancy cannot eat the staff or strength of bread, nor can they receive solid food. And nothing nourishes the mind of a person eating as much as the bread of life, of which it is written: And bread strengthens the heart of man (Psal. CLXXXIII, 15).

Book Two

47. In the volume of the Explanation of Second Ezechiel, O virgin of Christ Eustochium, this is the beginning.

<h2 id='tocuniq57'>(Cap. V.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter V — Verses 1 onwards) And you, son of man, take for yourself a sharp sword, like a barber's razor, and pass it over your head and your beard, and you will take for yourself a balance of weight and divide them. One-third you shall burn with fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are complete, and one-third you shall strike with the sword around it; and one-third you shall scatter to the wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them. And you shall take from there a small number, and you shall bind them at the top of the cloak, and from them you shall take them out again, and you shall throw them into the middle of the fire, and you shall burn them. From there fire will come out into all the house of Israel. For three parts of hair and wool, one of which is burned in the middle of the city, another is cut with a sword around it, the third is scattered to and fro by the wind, from which a small amount is taken, and it is bound at the edge of the cloak, and again a small portion of the third part is thrown into the fire, from which flame comes out into all the house of Israel, LXX four parts were interpreted. And when they had said: Burn a fourth part with fire in the midst of the city, and cut a fourth part with the sword in its circuit, and scatter a fourth part to the wind, for there will be a remaining fourth part, they added from their own: And take a fourth part, and burn it in the midst of the city: as if it were not the same as the first, and as if something else was said in this part that was added. Finally, the Lord Himself will explain the riddle of the divided hairs into three parts through the Prophet, saying: A third part of you shall die by pestilence, and be consumed by famine in your midst, signifying that famine and pestilence are fire; and a third part of you shall fall by the sword in your circuit, describing external slaughters and wars. He says, 'But I will scatter a third part of you to every wind, showing that they are the ones who are to be taken captive. After them, he says he will strip or pour out his sword, so that captivity will not be the last of their troubles. And he will take from those scattered and captive ones, and bind on the top of his garment those who are to return from captivity to Jerusalem, and from them also he will take a portion and consume it with fire and flame, signifying the Macedonians under whom the inhabitants of Judea, and especially Jerusalem, suffered greatly.' But what he says, from that, that is, to the people of the Jews; or, according to the Seventy, from her; so that it is understood, from the city of Jerusalem, fire will come out into every house of Israel: The history of the Maccabees tells that a certain part of the Jews handed themselves over to Antiochus Epiphanes, and incited him to persecute the people, and many other things that are written in the same history, and in the volumes of Josephus, especially the dispute between Hyrcanus and Alexander, on account of which Cneus Pompey took Jerusalem and subjected it to Roman rule; and afterwards, under Titus and Vespasian, the city was captured and the temple was destroyed. And after fifty years, under Aelius Hadrian, the city was completely burned and destroyed, to the extent that it lost even its former name. However, just as in the case of the emperor and his beard, it is an indication of beauty and manliness, and if they are shaved, an ugly nakedness is revealed, so too Jerusalem and its people, separated from the living body of God, are handed over to famine, pestilence, slaughter, and the sword, captivity and dispersion. From this dispersion, under the form of hairs, a certain part is tied at the top of the cloak, so that a small amount is again given to the fire, from which an infinite flame and nearly the whole of it, devastating, comes out into every house of Israel.

<h2 id='tocuniq58'>(Vers. 5 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 5 and following) Thus says the Lord God: This is Jerusalem; I have set it in the midst of the nations and surrounded it with lands. But she has despised my judgments, acting more wickedly than the nations, and has gone beyond the laws of the surrounding lands. They have rejected my judgments and have not walked in my commandments. The Prophet also testifies that Jerusalem is situated in the center of the world, demonstrating that it is the navel of the earth. And the Psalmist, expressing the birth of the Lord, says: Truth, he says, has risen from the earth (Ps. XLVIII, 12). And afterwards, commenting on his passion: He has worked salvation in the midst of the earth (Ps. LXXIII, 12). For on the eastern side, there is the region called Asia. On the western side, there is the region called Europe. In the south and the south wind, there is Libya and Africa. In the north, there are the Scythians, Armenia, Persia, and all the nations of the Pontus. In the midst, therefore, of nations, placed in such a manner that the God who was known in Judea (Ps. LXXV), and his great name in Israel, all the nations around followed its examples, which, having followed the impiety of the nations around it, it even conquered them in its own wickedness. This was well interpreted by Symmachus: These, he says, are the judgments which I have changed, O Jerusalem, which I have placed in the midst of the nations, and the regions around it; I have changed my judgments on account of the impieties which it has learned from the nations, and my righteousness from the regions that are around it, because they have rejected my statutes and have not walked in my judgments. But what the Seventy have said, that my justifications are unjust from the Gentiles, and my laws from the regions that are within it, without me speaking, is clear.

<h2 id='tocuniq59'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Verse 8, 9.) Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have surpassed the nations that are around you, you have not walked in my statutes, nor have you carried out my judgments, nor have you acted according to the judgments of the nations that are around you. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, and I myself will execute judgments in your midst in the sight of the nations. And I will do to you what I have not done, and the like of which I will never do again, because of all your abominations. Regarding what we have interpreted: Because you have surpassed the nations that are around you, Symmachus translated: Because your multitude was from the nations that are around you. Aquila's second edition: Because you have been numbered among the nations that are around you. And the Septuagint: Because your opportunity is from the nations that are around you. And the meaning is, either that Jerusalem, by its own crimes, surpassed all the nations around it, or that its multitude, not the people of Israel, but the crowd of other nations, is to be called. Certainly, among the number of other nations which surround them, they have been converted, or have had every opportunity to teach the nations which they ought to have taught more favorably. 'Why,' He says, 'have you not walked in My commandments and not done My judgments, when you have even conquered all the nations around you with your wickedness, and have not done what those nations frequently did, which were written in their hearts by the natural law?' Therefore, not through Angels, nor through any ministers, but I myself will perform my judgments in you, to the sight of all that I have not done before, and I will not do furthermore. By saying 'judgments', he shows the truth of the sentence, so that it doesn't seem that anger exceeds the measure of punishments. He did not do such things in any nation as he did in Jerusalem: 'For the servant who knows the will of his master and does not do it, shall be beaten with many stripes' (Luke XII, 48). Powerful storms endure powerfully (Wisdom 6:7). And similar things, he says, I will not do anymore. It was well said, I will not do similar things. For after the killing of Christ, he will make things much harsher. For it is one thing to have occasionally worshiped idols for which they were punished before, and another to have killed the Son of God.

<h2 id='tocuniq60'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10) Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in the midst of you, and sons shall eat their fathers: and I will execute judgments in you, and scatter all your remnant into every wind. First in this way: Therefore, thus says the Lord God: behold, I am coming to you, and I myself will bring about judgments in your midst. Second: Therefore, fathers will eat their sons in your midst. Third: Therefore, as I live, says the Lord God; surely because you have violated my sanctuary in all your offenses, and the rest. However, it should be noted that where there are beauty and honorable things, and according to the merit of those who sustain them, God himself declares that he will do it. But where there are sad and unworthy things for God, he indeed says it will happen, but not by him, as at present: Therefore, fathers will eat their sons in your midst, and sons will eat their fathers. For he did not say, 'I will make the fathers eat their sons in your midst, and the sons eat their fathers.' But what was appropriate and did not seem unworthy of the majesty of God, he says that he will do. For it follows: 'And I will execute judgments in you, and I will scatter all your remnants to every wind.' We can see something similar in the curses of Deuteronomy, and especially in that place: 'Those who glorify me, I will glorify, but those who despise me will be brought to nothing.' (Deut. 28). For He who glorifies Himself, glorifies Himself. But those who despise Him, will not be despised by the Lord, or reduced to nothingness (for it follows that he says), but absolutely, reduced to nothingness: not by God, but according to their merits and sins. We read in the book of Kings, in a time of famine, a mother devouring her own son (2 Kings 6). Josephus also recounts many similar acts during the siege of Jerusalem. But when fathers eat their sons, or sons their fathers, history tells nothing, unless perhaps in many desperate evils, it must be believed that even these things have happened. This can also be referred to our Jerusalem: when masters are pitted against their disciples, that is, fathers against sons, and disciples against masters, that is, sons against fathers, they are stirred up by mutual rebellion, and that which is said by the Apostle is fulfilled: But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed by one another (Gal. V, 15). And the Prophet sang in mystical language: 'When my enemies approached me to devour my flesh' (Ps. XXVI, 2). And Job similarly speaks: 'If my maidservants have said: Who will give us some of his flesh to eat?' (Job XXXI). And concerning the masters who seek profit from their disciples and have no concern for their well-being, it is said: 'Who devour my people like bread' (Ps. LII, 5). Of these [widows] also the Apostle says: They eat the houses of widows (Luke 20; Matthew 23). We can understand, fathers, that those who eat their sons and those who eat their fathers, not only in Babylonia, but also in the Roman siege. Moreover, what is said: And I will scatter all your remnants to every wind, pertains more to the Roman captivity, when they were scattered throughout the entire world. And this is the dispersion of hair and beard to every wind.


<h2 id='tocuniq61'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) Therefore, I live, says the Lord God: unless for the reason that you violated my sanctuary in all your offenses, and in all your abominations, I will also break (or, according to the Septuagint, cast away) you, and my eye will not spare, and I will not have mercy. This is specifically said to Jerusalem, because you violated my sanctuary by forsaking me, and you worshiped idols in my temple. I will also break all your idols, and crush and overthrow them, or cast you away, because you have cast me away first. And my eye will not spare when I see you in hunger, sword, and submission to servitude; nor will I have mercy, because you do not deserve my mercy. For it is written: Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy (Matthew 5:7). The same applies in the Church, where God may daily say to teachers and priests who have acted negligently: Because you have violated my holy things in all your offenses, and in all the abominations you have committed, I will also crush and break you, and I will repay for what you have done to my people. About which the same Prophet speaks more fully against the shepherds here (below, XXXIV), that they cover the wool of the sheep and feed on milk and cheese, and do not seek the broken and sick flock.

<h2 id='tocuniq62'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>

(Verse 12, 13.) A third part of you shall die of pestilence, and shall be consumed by famine in your midst; and a third part shall fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter a third part to all the winds, and I will unsheathe the sword after them. Thus shall my anger be fulfilled, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted. And they shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury upon them. Because the seventy translators had previously placed it in four parts, which in the description of fire, sword, and dispersion had approved to be only a prophetic discourse, so that the superfluous one part of fire would be divided into two parts, in this place also they divided the same first part into two, so that they would say: One fourth part of you will be worn out by death, and one fourth part of you will be consumed by hunger in your midst, and one fourth part of you will fall around you, and I will scatter one fourth part of you to every wind: although what we have placed, 'And one fourth part of you will fall by the sword,' has been added from the edition of Theodotion under asterisks. However, it is clear that the Hebrew truth contains three parts. Of the first of which it is said: 'And a third part of you shall die of pestilence, and be consumed with famine in your midst.' And it would have been much better to translate what is written, rather than seek support for a badly translated matter. And we do not say that this was done by those to whom antiquity gave authority, but it was corrupted by the fault of many centuries of scribes and readers. Although even Aristeus, Josephus, and the entire school of the Jews assert that only five books of Moses were translated by the Seventy-two. The chapter that we mentioned above seems to be omitted now. I will only add this, which is necessary in what he says: 'And I will pour out my wrath upon them and make my anger rest upon them, and I will comfort myself, and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have poured out my indignation upon them.' We have often explained how the wrath, anger, and zeal of God should be understood, that God speaks in human emotions: not that he is angry, but that we may perceive through punishment and torment that God is angry. However, zeal is to be understood under the metaphor of a husband and wife, who as long as he loves his wife, is jealous; if he neglects her, he says that which we are going to say in the following: My zeal shall depart from you, and I will no longer be angry with you. And that which is joined: And they shall know that I the Lord have spoken in my zeal, not to those who have been consumed by famine and pestilence, nor to those who have fallen by the sword in the midst of the city, but to those who shall be scattered into every wind, they shall feel the anger of God for the deaths of others and their own miseries, which they have not wanted to perceive as God's mercy.


<h2 id='tocuniq63'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) And I will make you a desert; and what follows: and a reproach to the nations that are around you, it is not found in the Septuagint: for which they added from their own, and your daughters around you. And again, according to both editions, in the sight of everyone passing by. But it is profitable for Jerusalem to be desolated in all its vices, and to be reduced to a desert, and to recognize its own sins, so that what should have been an example of virtues to other nations may be an example of miseries. But we can understand his daughters, small cities, or Churches scattered throughout the world, as whoever is a stranger of this world, and says with the Psalmist: I am a stranger and a sojourner like all my fathers (Ps. 39:12); and of whom it is said: Those who pass by do not say: The blessing of the Lord be upon you (Ps. 129:8), let him see his reproach and be grieved.

<h2 id='tocuniq64'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) And you will be a reproach and blasphemy, a example and wonder among the nations that surround you. For this, in the Septuagint, it is written: And it will be στενακτὴ, which means mournful. And in Theodotion it is added, καὶ δηλαἳστὴ; the meaning of this word is unknown. For this, three other interpreters have translated it as blasphemy, which in Hebrew is called Geddupha (). It follows:

When I bring judgments upon you in my wrath and indignation, and in the rebukes of my anger, which I, the Lord, have spoken, Jerusalem laments, when she offends God, that he may bring judgments upon her in his wrath and indignation. This is testified by Paul, who says: We were by nature children of wrath, like the rest (Ephesians 2:3). And again: For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdened (2 Corinthians 5). And we say with Jerusalem: I will bear the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against him. Some interpret Δηλαἳστὴν as unhappy and miserable; others understand it as clear and exposed to miseries.

(Verse 16) When I release the arrows of the worst famine (as is added in the Vulgate), which will be deadly: and when I send them to destroy you, and I will gather famine upon you, and I will break the staff (or rod) of bread. It is evident that we suffer famine and pestilence, and the worst beasts, and whatever other evils in the world, because of our sins. Therefore, that famine, of which mention is made in Ruth (Ruth 1), and in the book of Kings under Elijah (3 Kings 17), when the sky was closed for three years and six months, and under Elisha (4 Kings 6), whose incredible poverty was compensated by sudden abundance, was sent by the judgment of God. Not only was this done then in Jerusalem, but our Jerusalem also experiences it, in which, because of the magnitude of sins, hunger for hearing the word of God is sent first. Then hunger is followed by death; so that those who have not heard may taste and see that the Lord is sweet. (Psalm 33:9), afterwards let us feel: The death of sinners is the worst. (Psalm 22). We have already spoken about the firmament and the staff of bread. (Above, Chapter 4).

<h2 id='tocuniq66'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) And I will send famine upon you, and the most evil beasts to destroy you; and pestilence and blood will pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I, the Lord, have spoken. The most evil beasts will be brought upon the deserted land which has been devastated by famine, sword, and disease. These present times also reveal when familiar animals, such as dogs, are driven into a frenzy to attack their masters, and the land is filled with bears, wolves, and all other kinds of beasts. The passing of pestilence and blood signifies disease and the sword. But even in our Jerusalem the worst beasts are sent, when we are handed over to ignominious sufferings, and to a perverse sense and consciousness of sins, which torture and tear apart our souls (Rom. I). Dissensions, heresies, schisms, rivalries, envies, sorrows, detractions, evil desires, and greed, which is the root of all evils (II Cor. XII), are the worst beasts. When they are in us, we deserve to hear: Your transgression shall reprove you (Jeremiah). And we pray and say: Do not deliver the soul of the one confessing to you to the beasts (Ps. LXXIII, 19).


<h2 id='tocuniq67'>(Cap. VI.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter VI—Verse 1 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face towards the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them. And you shall say: Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God. Thus says the Lord God to the mountains and hills, to the cliffs and valleys. The frequent use of 'Adonai Dominus' in this Prophet seems to be explained briefly for the Greeks and Latins, who do not have knowledge of the Hebrew language. Adonai is one name out of the ten names of God, and it signifies Lord, which we often use to refer to God. Finally, when Sarah called Abraham her lord, she used this name (Gen. XVIII). And where it is said 'O my lord the king', Adonai is written (Exod. XXVIII). Therefore, when the two names, Lord and Lord, are joined together, the first name is common, the second is properly of God, which is called ἄῤῥητον (silent), that is, ineffable, and it was also written on the golden plate that was on the high priest's forehead. But the mountains of Israel, which were occupied by the idols of demons, do not hear and understand their Creator with their ears, but with the command and power of their creator. Just as the sea saw and fled, the Jordan turned back (Ps. CXIII): not with physical eyes which it lacked. And it is said to the sea: Be still, be silent (Mark IV, 39). And the winds are commanded by a word; and it is commanded to a worm, who struck Jonah's shade (Jon. IV). And from the same land it is written: He looks at the earth, and makes it tremble (Ps. CIII, 32). The Prophet speaks to those who indicate that idols are to be destroyed, as well as altars and all the ceremonies they previously served. We can understand that the mountains of Israel and the princes represent those who excelled in power, wisdom, knowledge, and wealth. And it should be noted that while the face is hardened, it is not only directed towards mountains, but also hills, rocks, and valleys, where inferior status and levels of knowledge and wisdom are known. To me, the mountains seem to represent those who have attained perfect knowledge; the hills, who are slightly lower; the rocks, who have no knowledge and rely only on conversation, presuming to interpret Scriptures for themselves, having zeal for God but not according to knowledge (Rom. X; James III); but the valleys are called the least in the Church, who are both inferior in life and knowledge, yet do not depart from the assembly of the Lord's family. Those who are commanded to hear the word of God, so that each person may understand according to their own measure and understanding what the Lord commands.

<h2 id='tocuniq68'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

(Verses 4, 5.) Look, I will bring a sword upon you and destroy your high places. I will demolish your altars, and your idols will be shattered. I will cast the slain in front of your idols, and I will scatter the corpses of the children of Israel before your idols. I will also scatter your bones around your altars in all your dwellings. It is said on the mountains of Israel that God will destroy their high places, where people worship false gods, and break down their altars and idols. The worshippers will be killed in front of their temples. The dead bodies will lie where they used to offer sacrifices. Their bones will be scattered not on mountains, but on the hills where they lie, around their altars, and in all the cities and villages of Israel. This, according to the letter. Otherwise, even against those who are exalted in pride, and of whom the Apostle speaks: Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. (1 Cor. VIII, 1), the sword is drawn, so that all their idols, which they have formed in their minds, may be destroyed and lie dead, and they may feel themselves to be dead, realizing that their idols and fictions are of no use to them. And he says that the bones of mountains are scattered around the altars, indicating that the most courageous among them should be separated from themselves. For it is beneficial for wicked people to be divided from wicked people by perverse knowledge. And just as those who were building a tower with the worst consent were scattered for their own benefit, and their language was divided (Genesis 11), so will the bones of the mountains be scattered, so that they may understand their futile efforts. This is what we have established: 'And I will give the corpses of the children of Israel before the face of your idols,' which is not found in the Septuagint.


<h2 id='tocuniq69'>(Vers. 6, 7.)</h2>

(Verses 6, 7) The cities will be deserted, and the high places will be demolished; your altars will be scattered and your idols will cease to exist; your temples will be broken down and your works will be destroyed. And the slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the Lord. The clear reason why the cities of the mountains are to be deserted is this: so that the high places, altars, and idols may be destroyed, and the temples may perish, and all worship of idols may cease; and let the slain fall in the midst of the mountains; and let them know that He alone is the Lord. Through which occasion is given to us, to follow more closely spiritual understanding, so that the cities of heretics, which are interpreted as Churches, and the lofty pride of them, and the altars of perverse doctrines be shattered, and the idols perish, which they had feigned to themselves in their own hearts, and the shrines be crushed, not temples, which have risen up against the temple of the Lord, and are called in Greek language τεμένη, that is, shrines and temples, and all the works of the mountains be crushed, which are not the works of God, but of the teachers of false knowledge. And when the slain shall fall among the mountains, either those whom the mountains themselves have slain, or the religious men who have killed them in their wickedness for their own salvation: then shall be the end of the proud mountains, that they may know that He is the Lord. And it may happen that from one people of the mountains of Israel, when others are slain, the others may come to know. For when the pestilence has struck, the fool will be wiser." }

<h2 id='tocuniq70'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) And I will leave among you those who have escaped the sword among the nations, when I scatter you among the lands, and they will remember me among the freed captives to whom they were led captive. That which the Lord speaks to Elijah: I have left for myself seven thousand men who have not bent the knee to Baal (3 Kings 19:18); and the Apostle Paul writes: And now in this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace, 59 who have been saved (Romans 11:5), which can be applicable to this chapter. And indeed the Apostles, who were of the seed of Israel and had fled the sword, were reserved for this reason, that they might be dispersed into the lands and preach the Gospel among the Gentiles, and be remembered among the Gentiles as God's people, among whom they were living in the time of captivity. And this can also be said, that some of those reserved from the captivity of Judah were reserved for the purpose of proclaiming his name among the Gentiles and proclaiming his power. The peoples of heretics who were able to escape the sword of their destruction and the worst faction that had been stirred up against God, dispersed here and there, will remember the name of God, by repenting and they will rejoice by considering themselves captured by ecclesiastical men.

<h2 id='tocuniq71'>(Vers. 9, 10.)</h2>

(Verses 9, 10.) Because I have broken their hearts by committing adultery and departing from me, and their eyes commit adultery after their idols. And they will be displeased with themselves for the evil they have done in all their abominations. And they will know that I, the Lord, have not spoken in vain, to bring this evil upon them. Many things from this chapter in the Septuagint are omitted, and it is changed. I swore to the heart of the one committing adultery: therefore we have put forth: I have broken their hearts by committing adultery. He swore and decreed to do what he demonstrated by his actions; whether he has corrupted his heart by fornication and turned away from God, of whom the Lord speaks through Hosea: They are seduced by the spirit of fornication (Hosea IV, 12). And they fornicate with their eyes after idols, through whose windows it is said that death has entered. For this reason, in the book of Daniel, two elders ordered Susanna to be revealed, so that they could enjoy the beauty of her naked body (Dan. XIII). And it was not in vain that the Lord spoke, in order to bring about evil or evils, when those who were subject to his sentence turned to repentance. But if the heart is hard and untamable, not even feeling the penalties of correcting kindness, it is said to them: I struck your children without cause: you did not receive discipline. (Jeremiah 2:30). And it is also profitable for heretics that their hearts be broken, the worst treasure of perverse teachings, because they have turned away from the Lord, and their eyes commit adultery, pursuing their own inventions. Those who, when they have been reminded of the Lord, will be displeased with themselves in all their abominations, and understanding the truth of true faith, will know that He is the Lord. Therefore, he often brings tribulation, which seems destructive and harmful to the patient, in order that they may repent.

<h2 id='tocuniq72'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) Thus says the Lord God: Strike your hand, and stamp your foot, and say: Alas! for all the abominations of the evil house of Israel. The Prophet is commanded to show the magnitude of sins with his hands, feet, and words, so that by the gesture of his body and the indignation of his voice, he may display the appearance of one astounded, amazed, and weeping. For just as when we perceive something new and remarkable, we tremble both in body and soul, so much so that we applaud with our hands, and stamp our feet on the ground, and bend our voice to weeping, in the same way, now, the prophet seeing with the eyes of his soul the coming punishments, speaks of all the abominations of the evil house of Israel that follow. We strike spiritually with the hand, when we separate ourselves from evil deeds. We tread with the foot, when we do not walk the path of sinners. We lament and weep, when we are displeased with what is happening. What is shown by the word, alas. For which Aquila interpreted as ἂ ἂ, Symmachus σχετλίασον, which means lament or wail. LXX and Theodotion εὖγε, which is more of an insult than a lament.

Those who will perish by sword, famine, and plague. This is the cause of mourning, because the inhabitants of the mountains, and the worshippers of altars and idols will perish by sword, famine, and plague. Those who are led astray by various errors, and change their faith daily, are carried along by every wind of doctrine: they are struck down by the sword, and divided into factions, abandoning the unity of the Church's faith. But whoever does not have spiritual food, dies of hunger, not knowing Him who said: I am the life (John XIV, 6). Furthermore, one who is devoted to either individual or multiple vices cannot be separated from them, as it once fell due to a certain ancient pestilence (alternatively called uterine pestilence).

<h2 id='tocuniq73'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(V. 12) He who is far away will die from the plague; but he who is near will fall by the sword, and he who remains and is surrounded by famine will die, and I will pour out my anger upon them. He who escapes the siege of the city and migrates to the desert will die from the plague; but he who is near will fall by the sword of the enemy. And he whom the enemy army surrounds will die from hunger and lack, and in all these things the anger of God will be fulfilled, so that those who remain may know that He is the Lord. Whoever departs from the Church will immediately die by the plague. Whoever seems free and diligent will be struck by the sword of their enemies if they do not take caution. Whoever is satisfied with simple faith behaves like a beast and does not make progress in any good work. They are not imitators of the ant, which prepares and gathers food in the harvest. This person will die of hunger and will be filled with the wrath of the Lord in all these things.

<h2 id='tocuniq74'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) And you shall know that I am the Lord, when your slain ones shall be among your idols, around your altars on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every leafy oak, the place where they offered pleasing aroma to all their idols. It is clear from the text itself, and it does not require interpretation, that the army of Israel was cut down in the mountains of Israel and on the high hills, among the very altars and groves of the idols, which are called green trees. They were punished where they had sinned. According to the anagoge, let us follow the proposed order. When the masters of the heretics have been crushed and overcome by the ecclesiastical men who are instructed in the knowledge of the Scriptures, we see them lying dead among the idols they had invented, as well as those who exalted themselves against the knowledge of God, lying low in the mountains and hills beneath every leafy tree; those who had grandiose words and the shadow of leaves, but not the fruit of good works; those who were under every leafy oak tree that does not bear the fruit of men, but of pigs: where they burned fragrant incense not to God, but to their idols. And they could not say what is written about Noah: 'The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma' (Gen. VIII, 21): and what Paul says: 'We are the pleasing aroma of Christ to God in every place' (II Cor. II, 15). But just as a holy odor delights God, so sin is committed by the person from whom that psalm is chanted: 'My wounds stink and fester because of my foolishness' (Ps. XXXVII, 6), he kindles foul incense for his idols. That which we interpreted, in all 62 mountain peaks: and after a little while: And below the entire leafy oak, they left 70.

<h2 id='tocuniq75'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) And I will stretch out my hand against them, and I will make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness of Deblatha, in all their habitations; and they shall know that I am the Lord. O mountains of Israel, when your slain men are among your idols, around every high hill, on all the mountaintops, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they offered sweet aroma to all their idols. Then I will stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land a desolation and a waste, from the wilderness of Deblatha, throughout all their habitations; so they shall know that I am the Lord." } Many believe that it is the same place, about which it is written in Jeremiah: 'And they took Zedekiah in the desert that is near Jericho, and all his army fled from him. And when they had taken the king, they brought him to the king of Babylon in Riblah, which is in the land of Hamath' (Jer. XXXIX, 5). It can also be called Deblatha or Reblatha, due to the close similarity between the Hebrew letters Daleth and Res, which are distinguished by a small apex. But according to mystical understanding, the Lord extended His hand over all those who had been deceived by heretical error, in order to make their land, which is interpreted as the Church, desolate from the desolation of Deblatha, which in our language means 'mass of figs' and 'bunch of figs' compacted together, so that after experiencing a simulated sweetness, which was not the cultivated land, but the wilderness, they may discover bitterness and then realize that He is the Lord. Honey indeed drips from the lips of a harlot, who for a time fattens the throats of those who eat, and afterwards is found to be bitter with gall (Proverbs 5:3-4). This also signifies the two baskets of figs, which were placed in Jeremiah in front of the temple (Jeremiah 24): one of good figs, and one of bad figs: of which one is referred to the Church of Christ, the other to the congregation of the wicked.

<h2 id='tocuniq76'>(Cap. VII.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter VII, Verses 1, 2.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, thus says the Lord God of the land of Israel: The end, the end has come upon the four corners of the earth. These corners of the world we have interpreted as the East and the West, the South and the North. Concerning these corners, Isaiah also speaks: Lord, from the corners or ends of the earth we have heard wonders (Isaiah 24:16), which were carried out throughout the whole world by the apostles. And it is written about the saints: 'If you sleep among the middle ranks of the silver-winged clergy, and the back of the dove is pale with gold' (Ps. 67:14). Therefore, when the Lord approached and saw Jerusalem, he wept and said: 'How many times have I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing!' (Matthew 23:37). This is he who, in the song of Deuteronomy, spread his wings and received them, and carried them on his shoulders' (Deut. 32). There are certain spiritual wings of the earth, by which we fly up to heavenly things. There are four types of believers: the house of Aaron, the house of Levi, the house of Israel, and those who fear the Lord. Concerning them the Psalmist sings: House of Israel, bless the Lord; house of Aaron, bless the Lord; house of Levi, bless the Lord; you who fear the Lord, bless the Lord (Psalm 134:19-21). In Aaron, there is the priesthood; in Levi, there are the priests and ministers; in Israel, there is the entire people; in those who fear the Lord, there are the converted proselytes. However, we believe that after the threat of the mountains of Israel, the prophetic message is directed to all the land of Israel, whether it be the ten or twelve tribes: and the prophet does not predict future events, but rather sees the impending captivity. For in the fifth year of the reign of Zedekiah, Ezekiel began to prophesy to the captives in Babylon; and in the ninth year, Nebuchadnezzar came and besieged Jerusalem, and he took it in the eleventh year of Zedekiah. From which it is clear that the end has come and is approaching, not over mountains and hills and rocks and valleys, but over the four corners of the earth from every part of Israel: not all of the earth: for if he had said that, it could be believed of the whole world; but simply of the earth, which signifies the Israelites. For thus he had begun: Thus says the Lord God of the land of Israel: The end has come, the end has come upon the four corners of the earth.

<h2 id='tocuniq77'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(V. 3, 4.) Now my anger is upon you, and I will unleash my fury upon you, and I will judge you according to your ways, and I will bring all your abominations against you. 64 And my eye will not spare you, and I will have no mercy: but I will place your ways upon you, and your abominations will be in your midst: and you will know that I am the Lord. In this chapter the order has been changed and confused according to the LXX Interpreters, so that the first are now the last, and the last, or the first or middle, are transferred to the extremes. From this, following the order of truth, we have set forth the Hebrew text itself and other interpreters. So the speech is directed towards the land of Israel, that the end and consummation may come upon it, and the Lord may send forth his anger upon it, not an unjust anger, but one that comes solely from indignation; but it is full of equity and reason, so that he may judge it according to its ways and show it all its abominations: so that he may remember his works and understand what evil he has done. But when he says, 'My eye will not spare you, and I will have no compassion,' like a most merciful physician who cuts away putrid flesh and cauterizes diseased wounds, he does not spare in order to spare; he does not show mercy in order to show greater mercy; lest any rottenness and corrupting flesh remaining in the body should corrupt it. The Lord strikes those whom he loves, and he chastises every son whom he receives (Hebrews XII, 6). To understand this is: 'I will strike, and I will heal' (Deuteronomy XXXII, 39). For every medicine has bitterness at the time, but afterward the fruits of pain are shown in health. Such a thing is also spoken by God through Amos: For I have known you from all the tribes of the earth, therefore I will avenge all your sins. For the Lord knows those who are his. And concerning his ways (or goings out), it is said (2 Timothy 2), I will place abominations and blemishes in the midst of it: so that the former sins may be placed before the eyes of the sinner, who is punished for his health. And when the Lord does this, those who have been oppressed will know that He is the Lord. This is what is meant by the following testimony: 'I will avenge Jacob according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds' (Hosea 12:2).

<h2 id='tocuniq78'>(Vers. 5, 6.)</h2>

(Ver. 5, 6.) Thus says the Lord God: One affliction, behold, comes: the end comes, the end comes. It has awakened against you, behold, it comes. Constriction comes upon you, who dwell in the land. These are not found in the Septuagint, but in their edition of the translation of Theodotion, they have been added under asterisks. But let us follow the Hebrew. Instead of affliction, which according to Symmachus, who interpreted it as κάκωσιν for the sake of clarity, we have put: and in Hebrew and in Greek it is written κακία, or πονηρία: that is, malice. It is said (Al. Dicit) that the final time of the sins of the land of Israel has come: so that it may no longer escape the sentence of God, which it has deserved for a long time. And because it had not yet fully committed its sins, therefore the punishment was delayed; according to that which is written: For the sins of the Amorites are not yet complete (Gen. XV, 16) . Hence the Lord also said to the Jews: And you, he says, fill up the measure of your fathers (Matt. XXIII, 32) . Therefore, misery comes to you; affliction comes, and captivity comes. And lest you think I am threatening future things, I show with my finger and demonstrate. Behold, it comes, the end comes, the end comes. He who until now seemed to be sleeping and resting to you, suddenly woke up against you and arose. Constriction comes, which in Hebrew is called Sephphira, and which Aquila interpreted as προσκόπησιν, that is, contemplation and foresight, which you always fear will come to you in a timid manner; and which Theodotion interpreted as πλοκὴν, that is, the order and connection of all evils. Furthermore, what is said about you who dwell on earth, we must take according to the Book of Revelation by John: Woe to all who dwell on earth (Rev. 8:13). For the holy one is not an inhabitant of the earth, but a stranger and a pilgrim; and he says: I am a stranger and a pilgrim, like all my fathers (Ps. 38:13). Therefore even Abraham the Hebrew, that is, the crosser and the sojourner, is mentioned; hastening to pass from the present age to the future. We can interpret this place spiritually against the Jews, upon whom comes the end and consummation from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom they killed between the temple and the altar (Matt. 23). For as long as they did not lay hands on the Son of God, the sentence of the Lord slumbered and was delayed. But when they killed the heir, so that the inheritance might perish, then all the order of miseries and perplexity awoke against them; for they did not seek heavenly things, but desired to cling to earthly things.


<h2 id='tocuniq79'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) The time has come, the day of slaughter is near, and not the day of glory of the mountains. The word 'Adarim' in Hebrew, which we divided into two words, 'Ad' and 'Arim', is interpreted by Theodotion as 'the glory of the mountains'. Symmachus translates it as 'the time of restoration' and says: 'And the time is near: the day of haste, not of restoration.' The Septuagint, on the other hand, translates it as: 'The time has come, the day is approaching, not with disturbance or pains.' Theodotio: The time has come, the day of hunger is near and not the glory of the mountains. It is a time of slaughter, and even now famine is evident among the Jewish people who have neither prophets nor the word of God by which the souls of believers are nourished. But understand, O mountains, those who have knowledge of the Scriptures. Concerning them, it is also said in another place: 'You shine wondrously from the eternal mountains' (Psalm 75:5). Moreover, the Seventy who said: 'Not with disturbance, and not with pains,' signify that they have only such ignorance of God and blindness of mind, so that they are neither disturbed by their sins nor tormented by the pains of repentance.


<h2 id='tocuniq80'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) Now I will pour out my anger on you and unleash my fury against you; I will judge you according to your ways and punish you for all your detestable practices. If we calculate from the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin to the ninth year of the reign of King Zedekiah, when Nebuchadnezzar came and besieged Jerusalem, it will be three and a half years. Therefore, it is rightly said: Now I will pour out my anger on you. I will never predict what is coming to you, nor will I threaten things that are far in the future: now I will unleash my rage upon you. This rage and anger are not without judgment: but to bring your ways upon your own head, and to make you feel all your abominations. However, we can also speak about the ultimate captivity, that after the killing of Christ, when the end came to them and sin awoke against them, that was fulfilled which is written: Now the wrath of God has come upon them to the end (I Thess. I, 16). When Jerusalem was surrounded by Titus and Vespasian and its desolation came, and it was fulfilled: 'Behold, your house will be left to you desolate' (Matthew XXIII, 38). Then they were judged according to their ways and blasphemies, by which they denied the Lord; and they felt the wrath of God: and all His indignation was poured out upon them, and they received the punishment for their crimes, so that the destruction of the temple may remain until the end.


<h2 id='tocuniq81'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) And my eye will not spare, nor will I have mercy: but I will impose (or give) your ways to you, and your abominations will be in your midst, and you will know that I am the Lord who strikes. He adds that the causes of severity and harshness, or as heretics suppose, the cruelty of God, in not sparing His eye nor showing mercy, saying: I will give you your ways, and your abominations will be in your midst; that you may feel what you have done, and seeing your abominations either before you or placed in the midst of all, you may correct your error with repentance, and by departing from your former works, when you hate what you have done, then you will realize that He Himself is the Lord. (Heb. XII). He strikes in order to correct and discipline every son whom he receives.

<h2 id='tocuniq82'>(Vers. 10, 11.)</h2>

(Verse 10, 11.) Behold the day, behold it comes, the contraction has gone forth: the rod has blossomed, pride has sprouted. Iniquity has risen in the rod of impiety, not from them, and not from the people, nor from their noise: and there will be no rest for them. LXX: Behold the day gives birth, behold the end comes, the complex has gone forth, and the rod has blossomed, pride has sprouted, injustice has been aroused, and it will crush the strength of the wicked, and not with disturbance nor with haste, and they are not from them, nor is beauty in them. The day has been shortened, he says, and the impending captivity is near. The rod that threatened you for a long time has flourished, and it has given birth to the fruit of wounds. Your pride has sprouted what you deserved, so that the injustice, which is not from a pitiful people, nor from those who are led like dumb animals by their masters, nor from their clamor and noise, in which they cried out in vain, deceived by the priests and Pharisees, may rise up against your wicked rod with a united voice and say: 68 Crucify, crucify such a one (John 19:6). Where they will not have rest, but eternal captivity. Moreover, the Seventy interpreted it in the sense in which it is written: for you do not know what the coming day may bring forth (Prov. XXVII, 1). They said: Behold, the day brings forth what it had conceived long before: and the end has come, and the bond that embraces all your evil deeds shall be broken and shall no longer imprison, or as Symmachus interpreted it, inspection, so that God may see all that you have done and consider your works, and render to each one according to what they deserve. But in that which they themselves have also translated similarly, the rod has flourished, as we can use that testimony: Do not take the rod away from your son (Prov. XIII, 13). And the Apostle: What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness (I Cor. IV, 21)? But even God resounds in the mouth of the Psalmist: I will visit their iniquities with a rod and their sins with scourges: but I will not take away my mercy from them (Psal. LXXXVIII, 33, 34). Therefore the Lord visits and strikes, so that all pride, which has long been hidden and enclosed, may arise and be revealed; and injury may be aroused against the arising and burgeoning pride, and the strength of the wicked may be crushed, not with disturbance or haste. For the end of a flourishing rod is healing and correction, which does not come by merit to those who are corrected, nor by the beauty that they do not possess in themselves, but by the mercy of the Lord. This passage is difficult and differs greatly between the Hebrew and the Septuagint, with many additions from Theodotion's edition, in order to make it appear more coherent.

<h2 id='tocuniq83'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) The time has come, the day is near. It is not only said to Jerusalem that the time of captivity has come and the day has approached when it will be besieged by the Babylonian army; but also to the one who rejoiced in his built and expanded barns, the Lord speaks: Foolish one, tonight your soul will be taken away from you. And the things that you have prepared, whose will they be? (Luke 11:20) This is also what the Apostle says: The time, he says, has been shortened (1 Corinthians 7:29). And in another place: For the figure of this world passeth away (Ibid., 31). It should be noted that He did not postpone this for the future, but spoke of the present, saying, 'passeth away,' and daily the figure of the world slips by. For it never remains in the same state; but the figure of things that grow and decay always flies by and changes. Hence also the Lord says: Heaven and earth shall pass away (Matth. XXIV, 35). But if these things, in which all that is in the world is contained, pass away and pass by, what can be perpetual in human affairs?


<h2 id='tocuniq84'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) The one who buys should not rejoice, and the one who sells should not mourn. It is natural to rejoice in the acquisition of possessions, but to mourn in their sale. However, in the face of slavery and captivity, both joy and sorrow are in vain. Hence the Apostle says: 'Time is shortened.' Moreover, those who have wives should live as though they do not have them, and those who weep should live as though they do not weep, and those who rejoice should live as though they do not rejoice, and those who buy should live as though they do not possess, and those who use this world should live as though they do not make use of it (1 Corinthians 7:29-31).' For they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all, as the Lord said in the Gospel (Matthew 24).

Because his anger was against all his people. This is found in the Septuagint. For 'populus' can denote both a multitude and a crowd according to the Hebrew interpretation; for it signifies 'Amona'. And the reason is clear, because therefore the one who buys should not rejoice, and the one who sells should cease to mourn, because the anger of God will soon come upon the whole multitude of the land of Judaea, or Jerusalem. For it is understood from the preceding statements, in which it is written: Thus says the Lord God of the land of Israel, etc.


<h2 id='tocuniq85'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13) Because the one who sells will not return to what he has sold. This is spoken according to the Hebrew custom. For every sale returned to the seller in the fiftieth year of remission, which among them is called the Jubilee. Therefore, before the year of remission arrives, when possessions return to their previous owners, captivity will arise, which will take away the whole custom of the city. Moreover, what the Seventy translated, 'Because the one who buys will not return to the seller,' since it does not agree with the history at all, according to the allegory, can have this meaning: that we say that the one who was deceived by the error of a heretic, when he understands the deception of the teacher, will not at all return to the seller, that is, to the teacher, but despises and disregards him.


And even in their lifetime, their life will not return to them because the vision will not return to the whole multitude. Just as possession does not revert to the previous owner when the city is destroyed, so too the prophetic vision and warning that is directed to the whole multitude of the city will in no way return and will be in vain. Rather, it will be fulfilled in the remaining few to whom the prophecy is directed. He says this in order to indicate the impending captivity, so that they would not say according to their usual manner: This vision will be for many days and will be fulfilled after a long time. We can say this, that after the prophetic vision has departed from the Jews: For the law and the prophets were until John the Baptist (Matt. 11:13), after the killing of the Savior, it will never return to them, nor will they deserve to have prophets anymore. And significantly, he says, the vision will not return to the whole multitude. Therefore, it will return to those who believed in the Lord from the Jews, namely the apostles, and the remnants of the Jewish people who were saved from Israel. But these two verses are not found in the Septuagint edition.

And a man will not be strengthened in the wickedness of his life. LXX: And a man will not obtain in the eyes of his life. And the sense according to the Hebrew is: His wickedness will not profit a man, nor will it provide any strength to him. According to the Septuagint: And a man, who desired what he thought was precious in the world, will not obtain it; but with freedom perishing, all that is beautiful will be lost. However, the ambiguity of the Hebrew letters Yod and Vav, which are distinguished only by their size, caused some to interpret wickedness and others to interpret eyes.


<h2 id='tocuniq86'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) Sound the trumpet, let everyone prepare. LXX: Sound the trumpet, and judge all things. We read in many places about the sound and noise of trumpets, such as there: 'Raise your voice like a trumpet' (Isaiah 58:1); and elsewhere: 'Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the appointed time on our festive day' (Psalm 81:3); and in the Apostle: 'For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God' (1 Thessalonians 4:16). And in the Gospel: Do not sound the trumpet before you (Matt. 6:2). And the history of Numbers tells of trumpets made of gold and silver (Num. 10 and 31), which are compared to prophetic speech and the teaching of the Apostles. It is now commanded that everyone be prepared for battle at the sound of the trumpet and the horn. Moreover, what the Seventy have said, 'Judge all things,' there is no doubt that it applies to the authority of the apostles. After the trumpet of the angels has sounded, they will judge in twelve thrones, over the twelve tribes of Israel. Of whom Paul was speaking: We will judge angels (I Cor. VI, 3); and elsewhere: The world will be judged in you (Ibid., 2). However, according to the current sense, those who are entrusted with this office are commanded sarcastically to blow the trumpet, so that everyone may prepare against the army of Babylon.

And there is no one who goes to battle. For my anger is over all his multitude. And these are not found in the Septuagint. God had commanded (Num. X) that the trumpet sound to prepare the army, which could resist the strength of the Babylonians; but it was of no avail to command, since there is no one in the people who dares to go forth to war. Therefore, the people is weakened and lacks the strength to fight, because all the anger of God is over all his multitude, understood to be the city of Jerusalem, or the land of Judah. But both in our land and in Jerusalem, when either public persecution or the various incentives of vices try to overcome us, the teachers sing in vain and hurry to prepare us for war, when there is no strength in the people, which has been taken away on account of the sins deserving the anger of God.

<h2 id='tocuniq87'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Vers. 15, 16.) The sword is outside, pestilence and famine are inside. Those who are in the field will die by the sword; and those in the city will be devoured by pestilence and famine. And those who flee from them will be safe, and they will be like doves of the valleys trembling on the mountains. Each one in their own wickedness. Seventy, the doves of the valleys, or as Theodotion translated, those contemplating, were completely silent. And what we have interpreted, everyone is trembling: each one in their own wickedness, as Theodotion translated it, everyone murmuring, each one in their own wickedness; so that under the metaphor of meditating doves, it signifies that each person from the people mourns their own sin, and understands and feels why they suffer these things. But we have discussed above the three parts of others who die in the city, namely, those who perish from pestilence and famine, those whom the sword kills outside, and those who escape captivity by flight: of whom he who is saved will pass over to the mountains, and, like murmuring doves, he will tremble while bewailing his sins. And tropologically (to take it in a moral sense), we must interpret that he who is in the field and the countryside, outside the borders of the Lord's city, which is interpreted as the Church, will be struck by the enemy's sword. But he who lives negligently in the city and does not prepare food for himself, of which it is written in Proverbs: 'He who works his land will be filled with breads.' (Prov. XII, 11.) This one will die from famine and pestilence. However, only a few who have avoided the sword of heretics or the hunger of their own laziness will be saved, unless they are in the mountains and take on the wings of a dove, and fly away and find rest. These doves, as long as they are in the valleys, tremble and fear everything: we are commanded to imitate their innocence, of which it is written in the Psalm: 'If you sleep among the ranks, the wings of a silver dove, and its hindparts in the whiteness of gold.' (Ps. 67:14) In whose likeness the Holy Spirit descended and remained upon the Lord and Savior. And rightly according to Theodotion we shall call the meditating dove (Matth. III), he who meditates day and night in the law of the Lord, and of whom it is written: The mouth of the just will meditate wisdom (Ps. XXXVI, 30).

<h2 id='tocuniq88'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) All hands shall be dissolved, and all knees shall flow with water. And they shall gird themselves with sackcloth, and terror shall cover them. Before the knees flowing with water, Seventy shall be carried away, their thighs shall be defiled with moisture. But when all shall tremble and flee to the mountains, all hands shall be dissolved, and no one will be able to resist the enemies, and with the magnitude of fear, urine shall pollute the knees, and the bladder will not be able to hold back the flowing waters. They will gird themselves with sackcloth, and trembling will possess everything. This happened among that people, not only among the Babylonians, but also among the Romans, when the wrath of God came upon them to the very end. Moreover, it happened in our own Judea, in which is the confession of the Lord, when transgressions have multiplied, and the love of many has grown cold, all the hands of good works will be dissolved, and all knees, or rather thighs, will flow with the waters of those who sought unlawful unions, and whom Scripture names 'eunuchs', that is, those enduring a seminal discharge and are unclean. Therefore, those who are such should gird themselves with the sackcloth of repentance and fear the impending judgment. And he who does so will deserve to hear Isaiah saying: Strengthen the weak hands and make firm the feeble knees (Isaiah 35:3).

<h2 id='tocuniq89'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18) In every face there is confusion, and in every head there is baldness. The redness of the face is a sign of shame, and the consciousness of sins shines on the face: and the hope of salvation is when shame follows the sin. Therefore, it was said to her who boasted in her sins with a hard heart: Your face has become like that of a prostitute, you do not know how to blush (Jer. III, 3). Baldness of the head is also a sign of sorrow, when the hair loses its beauty, and we lose the beauty of our hair. And it is also said about Jerusalem: You will have baldness for the ornament of your head, because of your deeds (Isaiah III, 17). And another prophet says: All heads will be shaved in every place, and every beard will be cut (Jeremiah XLVIII, 37). Micah also says about the same Jerusalem: Shave and cut the hair of the sons of your pleasures, enlarge your baldness like an eagle (Micah I, 16). And it is ordered to have baldness over the dead. But only the holy ones, that is, the Nazirites, and those who have deserved to reach the priesthood of the Lord, do not shave their heads (Num. 6). For they do not have the works of death, nor are they unclean, because they are Nazirites, that is, the holy ones of the Lord. But if anyone has died in their presence, all the previous days will not be counted as their sanctification. Samuel, the holy one of God, possessed the eternal ornaments of the head: and he heard this from the Song of Songs: Your locks are black as a raven's (Cant. 5:11)."    } Furthermore, Samson, because he lost his hair, lost his strength (Judges 16): and gradually, as his hair grew back, his former strength returned so that he killed more in his death than in his life. But Elisha, though he was bald in body, still enjoyed the curls of the head because he was a Nazirite of the Lord. Hence, little boys, because they were little and had not yet reached the age of manhood, mocked his baldness and said, 'Go up, bald head! Go up, bald head!' (2 Kings 2:23). 74 of them were torn apart by the bites of wild beasts; their leaps and the woods were their dwelling place.


<h2 id='tocuniq90'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19) Their silver will be thrown outside, and their gold will be as dung. LXX: Their silver will be thrown on the streets, and their gold will be despised. When forced to flee and be captured, they will throw away their riches and the weight of gold and silver on the streets, desiring only to save their own lives, lest they be burdened with what was once luxury. Otherwise, according to the anagoge, all the silver of the captives and those fleeing from Jerusalem will be thrown on the streets, on the wide and spacious road that leads to death, because they have forsaken the narrow path of salvation. But every gold will be despised, or considered as dung and filthiness. For he cannot have purity, who is outside the Church of the Lord.

Their silver and their gold will not be able to save them on the day of the Lord's wrath. And this is not found in the Septuagint. But there is no doubt that during the time of siege and famine, it does not deliver those hungry for gold and silver: and their teeth are crushed like the hardest stones with this most precious metal. Finally, it follows:

They will not satisfy their souls, and their bellies will not be filled. In the presence of evil, we have learned that many rich people, exhausted by poverty, have had the outcome of beggars, between silk, gems, and the weights of gold and silver. But their silver and gold, those who are outside the Church, are not able to free the souls of the possessors on the day of the Lord's anger, but it shows that they will have eternal hunger and suffer with empty stomachs, as that testimony says: The redemption of a man's soul is his own riches (Prov. XIII, 8). Our true riches are those that the truth of Christ has taught us (Luke 16), who commanded us to make friends for ourselves with unrighteous mammon, so that they may receive us into eternal dwellings.

Because a scandal of their wickedness has occurred. Therefore, he says, neither the soul will be satisfied, nor the stomach filled, because this very gold and silver has become a stumbling block of their crimes. But it signifies idols, which are made of gold and silver, condemn their own craftsmen. For which reason the Seventy translated it: because the tortures of their wickedness were, so that they should be tormented in their own wickedness, and understand that they have turned God's gifts into blasphemy.


<h2 id='tocuniq91'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) And they have placed the ornament of their necklaces in pride, and they have made images of their abominations and idols from it. LXX: They have placed the chosen ones of the world in pride, and they have placed images of their abominations and stumbling blocks from them. And those things which I had given as adornment to those who possess them and riches, they have turned them into pride, so that from those things they could liberate their own soul through acts of charity and good works, they had material for arrogance. Finally, they made idols out of gold and silver, and turned my gifts into the images of demons. Furthermore, as the Seventy say, they put the chosen ones of the world into pride, referring to gold and silver, which is considered the most valuable thing in the world. And that which follows: Let us know that the addition by Theodotion is easy to understand according to the allegory, that the heretics placed gold and silver, the senses and the teachings of the Scriptures that have been chosen by the world, and which have been given to us as adornment, as fuel and material for pride, and made images of various teachings and abominations and their offenses from them, so that through what they could worship and adore God, they would offend God by means of these.


<h2 id='tocuniq92'>(Vers. 21.)</h2>

(Verse 21.) Because of this, I gave them over to uncleanness, and I will give them into the hands of strangers to plunder, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil, and they shall defile it. LXX: Because of this, I gave them over to uncleanness, and I will deliver them into the hands of strangers, to plunder them, and to the pestilential of the earth for a spoil, and they shall pollute it. For they made for themselves images of their abominations and of their idols from the gold and silver and ornaments that I had given them; therefore, I gave them over to uncleanness and to excrement. For which Symmachus translated, unwilling to express the filth of idols. And he said, I will deliver these into the hands of the enemy, so that they may plunder everything,and not so much defile, as demonstrate that which seemed to be most holy before to be contaminated. We too are handed over into the hands of enemies and strangers to God, when we make our ornaments images of demons, and all our glory is possessed by the impious or pestilent of the earth, so that they may subject us to their power.


<h2 id='tocuniq93'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) And I will turn my face away from them, and they will violate my sanctuary, and emissaries will enter into it (either as the Septuagint has translated rashly, or as Symmachus and Theodotio have translated, by breaking in and being pestilential) and defile it. For when, he says, because of the previous abominations of the people, I turn my face away from them, and I will not judge them worthy in my eyes, then they will violate my sanctuary, which signifies the Holy of Holies, for which the Septuagint has translated 'visitation' (so that they might demonstrate the presence of God in the holy things) and the wicked and pestilential ones will break in: except for the priests and the high priest, no one else dared to enter. What we know from the Babylonians, and from King Antiochus and Gnaeus Pompeius, and finally was done under Vespasian and Titus, when the temple was captured and destroyed, and all the things that the following prophecy encompasses. God also turns His face away from our evil deeds: and because His face is turned away, therefore the secret of God is violated, so that the pestilence may enter for the priests and saints of God, and contaminate everything: so that the place that should have been holy becomes a place of impurity, according to the Gospel: My Father's house shall be called a house of prayer: but you have made it a den of thieves (Matthew 21:13).


<h2 id='tocuniq94'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23.) Make a conclusion, for the land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of injustice. LXX: And I will bring disturbance, for the land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of iniquities. The Hebrew word 'Arethic' (), Aquila interpreted it as 'conclusion', Symmachus and Theodotion as 'crucifixion'. For this reason, the Seventy put 'φυρμὸν', which we translate as 'disturbance'. Therefore, O prophet, conclude my anger against the land of Judah and against the city of Jerusalem in a short discourse, so that just as the land is full of bloodshed, for all are judged in blood, pouring out innocent blood: which the Scripture also records that the Jews did to Naboth's person. Thus their own blood is founded, and the city is shown to be full of iniquity. For the city of Jerusalem is also filled with the blood of the prophets from one gate to another, even under Manasseh's reign (1 Kings 21). And a conclusion, disturbance, and affliction will come upon them, so that no one can escape the imminent miseries.

<h2 id='tocuniq95'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24.) And I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses. And these are not found in the Septuagint. For priests and prophets, I will bring the worst of all nations, the Babylonians, to possess your houses and to subject you to servitude. But the worst demons will also possess our houses, that is, our souls (for we are the temple of God and the Holy Spirit dwells in us - I Cor. VI), if our land is full of bloodshed and our dwelling is full of wickedness.


And I will make the arrogance of the powerful rest: and their sanctuaries shall be possessed. LXX: And I will turn away the noise of their strength: and their sancta shall be defiled. All arrogance offends God. Therefore, the worst of the nations shall possess the houses of the powerful and the proud, and they shall obtain their sanctuaries, because a defiled place of holiness enters, and its impurity contaminates it. However, it is significant that the sanctuaries of God were polluted and his secret violated, he did not say, they shall possess my sanctuaries, but their sanctuaries: because after the contamination they withdrew from me.


Distress is near. Seventy: Atonement will come. According to the previous order, Aquila and Theodotio are rightly interpreted as distress, and Symmachus as grief. However, the Seventy placed the word of joy in the midst of all the sorrows: so that the mind of the mourner may be sustained, and he may hope for better things amidst adversity, and the Lord may be propitious; of whom it is written: The Lord raises up the downtrodden (Ps. 145:8). But we, following the previous opinion of Symmachus, have joined it with the latter, so as to say:

<h2 id='tocuniq96'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) With the approaching distress, they will seek peace, but it will not be found. This cannot possibly be reconciled with the Septuagint. For if reconciliation comes, how will they seek peace and not find it? Indeed, those who have heard from the apostles will seek peace and not find it, for they did not keep the peace in their house (Matthew 10:12), nor did they let it rest in their minds, but by their evil deeds, they cannot find it. But the peace itself is that which surpasses all understanding (Philippians 4:7), and which the victorious Savior, ascending to the Father, left to the apostles (John 14).


<h2 id='tocuniq97'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26) Disturbance upon disturbance will come, and hearing upon hearing. LXX: Woe upon woe will be, and message upon message. Just as it is said to the saints: Rejoice, I say again rejoice (Philippians 4:2); and it is written about them: They will go from strength to strength (Psalm 84:7), so that present blessings may abound to future blessings. Similarly, for those upon whom distress comes, and those who have sought peace and have not found it, disturbance will come upon disturbance, or woe upon woe, as it is also written in the Apocalypse: one woe has passed, and behold, another woe is coming quickly (Revelation 9:12). And the one who heard about it will come upon the one who heard about it, and the messenger upon the messenger; according to the blessed Job: While this one was still speaking, another messenger came (Job 1:16), increasing evils with evils, and describing the noise and turmoil of the approaching Babylonians.

And they sought a vision from the Prophet: and the law shall perish from the Priest, and counsel from the elders. Specifically, each individual seeks out specific things. The Prophet seeks prophecies of the future. Interpreting the law is the duty of the Priest. Mature age seeks wise counsel; according to what is written: 'In the council of the saints (or the just) and the congregation, great are the works of the Lord' (Ps. 110:1-2). But these things were not only sought by the prophets, priests, and elders at the time when the Babylonian army was coming against Jerusalem; but they are sought daily in the Churches. If they have lost vision, law and counsel, in vain do they boast of having prophets, priests, and elders.

<h2 id='tocuniq98'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27.) The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed in sorrow, or, according to the Septuagint, in death: those who desired something, namely what we have expressed from the Hebrew text, completely remained silent about the king mourning. However, the Holy Scripture commemorates that Zedekiah and all the princes of the people of Judah were consumed with sorrow. And we can, although this may seem blasphemous at first glance, say that the king mourning for our sins and transgressions is Christ, who speaks in the Psalms: 'What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?' (Psalm 30:10). And when he came near Jerusalem, he wept over it, and said, 'Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to you! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing. (Matthew 23:37)! In addition, the princes will either be apostles in a good way, mourning for sinners, or they will be the opposite, those to whom it is said: 'Hear the word of the Lord, you princes of Sodom!' (Isaiah 1:11). And he shall be clothed, according to the Septuagint, with destruction, he who does not have the armor of God, nor is clothed in Christ. For as many as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ (Galatians 3:27).

And the hands of the people of the earth will be troubled, or, according to the Septuagint, dissolved. When there is no vision in the prophet, and knowledge of the Law in the priest, and counsel in the elders; and the king mourns, and the prince is in sorrow, or in destruction, subsequently the hands of the people will be troubled, losing their order, or dissolved, not having ancient strength. And it is rightly said that the people of God, whose hands are troubled, and who do not have a citizenship in heaven, but are people of the earth, of whom it is written: 'Those who depart from you shall be written upon the earth' (Jeremiah 17:13).


I will deal with them according to their ways, and judge them according to their judgments, or as the Septuagint has translated, I will avenge them. God renders to sinners according to their ways, in order to hold to the truth of judgment. However, in the saints, the measure of mercy exceeds. For the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us (Rom. VIII, 18). For the wages of sin is death (Ibid. VI, 23), which the sinner receives according to their ways and deeds. Moreover, the virtue of the just enjoys the largesse of the Lord, of which Paul speaks: The gift of God is eternal life. And he added: And I will judge them according to their judgments, that Gospel saying sounds: with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged (Matthew 7:1). And the Apostle: For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things (Romans 2:1).

And they shall know that I am the Lord. This verse is often used in this prophet, that the knowledge of God may be followed by punishments and torments, so that those who did not understand through blessings may come to know through sufferings.

Book Three

79-80  Nothing long lasts that has faith, and all the past series of times do not profit: unless perhaps it has prepared the support of good works, which always look to the future, indeed to the eternal, and are not limited by any boundaries. The true saying is: All that rises falls, and all that grows old ages. And elsewhere: For there is nothing made by work and hand, which old age does not accomplish and consume. Who would believe that Rome, built with victories from the whole world, would fall, that it would become both mother and tomb to its own people, that the coasts of the whole East, Egypt, and Africa, would be filled with the number of slaves and servants of the once dominant city, that daily Bethlehem, once noble for both sexes and overflowing with all wealth, would receive beggars? Since we are unable to provide assistance to those, we sympathize and join tears to tears: burdened with the task of the holy work, while we do not allow ourselves to see the converging streams without groaning, we have dedicated almost all our effort to explanations in Ezekiel, and we desire to translate the words of the Scriptures into action, and not just speak of holy things, but do them. Therefore, once again reminded by you, O virgin of Christ Eustochium, we resume the interrupted work, and undertaking the third volume, we desire to satisfy your desire: praying for you and all who will read, that they may consider not our abilities, but our intention, one of which is human frailty, the other is a holy will in the Lord.


<h2 id='tocuniq100'>81 (Cap. VIII.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

Chapter 8, Verse 1: And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting before me. In the fifth year of the exile of Jehoiachin, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, a superior vision was given to the prophet. But the vision which we now want to explain occurred in the sixth year of the same king, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month. From which it is clear that after a year and two months, these events that are written occurred, and either the prophecy was interrupted for a year and two months, or it was carried out for the entire fourteen months that the previous discourse includes. But in the sixth year and in the sixth month, and on the fifth day of the month, which are numbers referring to the creation of the world, and to the carnal senses, which perceive earthly things and have not yet contemplated heavenly things, the one who understands that the prophecy is directed to the elders of Judah will not be amazed. Among them seventy held censers, and twenty-five worshipped the sun in the temple, and the prophet sat in his house fleeing from the crowd; and the elders of Judah sat before him, either desiring to hear the prophet's words or plotting against him. And by 'elders of Judah' we should understand not those who belonged to the ten tribes of Israel that were previously captured, but rather those who, from the tribe of Judah, were led into captivity with Jechoniah.

<h2 id='tocuniq101'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Verse 2) And the hand of the Lord God fell upon me there. And I saw, and behold, a likeness resembling the appearance of fire, from the appearance of His loins and downward, fire; and from His loins and upward, a splendor resembling the appearance of lightning. The Hebrew language does not contain the word 'man'. However, we have added a vision of the aura, which is not found in the Septuagint, from Theodotion. And because of what we have said, the hand of the Lord fell upon me, as translated by Symmachus. The hand of the Lord came upon me 82 times, which in Hebrew is called Tephphol (). But the hand signifies action, that is, works, so that one may understand the mysteries of the vision. And it should be noted that he does not see the truths themselves, but the likeness of fire, because fire appeared from the loins downward; and from the loins upward, it appeared like the splendor of a vision. For the brightness, which is called Zor in Hebrew, translated the aura to Theodotus, to show the refreshments of God in the heavens. Finally, in the book of Kings, the blessed Elias contemplates the coming of the Lord not in a storm and whirlwind, not in the burning of fire, but in the appearance of a thin and gentle breeze, to prove the gentleness of Almighty God. However, the works of sexual intercourse, which are symbolized in the loins, are purged downward by fire. And the works of virtues, which rise from the loins to the uppermost parts, have splendor and brightness, and yet it is not said that fire reaches all the way to the feet, nor does the brilliance of lightning reach all the way to the head, but it goes downward and upward, so that, depending on their merits, there is one part that extends to this and that member, and another that reaches to those and these. And just as those who attain to the perfection of holiness reach all the way to the summit, so those who are in the depths of sin are to be believed to hold the fiery feet of the wicked.


<h2 id='tocuniq102'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) And a likeness of a hand was sent forth and it took hold of me by the hair of my head. LXX: And the likeness of a hand extended and took me by the fringe of my head. And this likeness of a hand, the hand itself is not extended, for there is nothing corporeal in God. And it appears like a hand, as a member of the human body and familiar, not at all terrifying the one who is assumed and seized. For if it had touched the prophet in the likeness of a snake or any other beast, the very dissimilarity of the limbs would have terrified the one who was assumed." } And the part of the hair is called a κράσπεδον, which means a fringe: one of which is usually taken on the hair, the other on the clothes.

And the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the sky. First, by the likeness of a hand, I am grasped; afterwards, I am lifted up by the spirit, which does not immediately raise me up to heaven, but between the earth and the sky, so that, leaving behind earthly things for a while, I may hasten towards heaven. Moreover, we can also say this, that by virtue of good works, the prophet is grasped by the likeness of God's hand, and by knowledge of spiritual things, he is lifted up by the spirit.


<h2 id='tocuniq103'>(Vers. 4)</h2>

(Verse 4). And he brought me to Jerusalem in the vision of God, near the inner gate that faces north, where the idol of jealousy was located to provoke rivalry. And behold, there the glory of the God of Israel was, according to the vision that I had seen in the plain. LXX: And he brought me to Jerusalem in the vision of God to the entrance of the gateway that faces north, where the statue of the ruler was. And behold, the glory of the Lord God of Israel was there according to the vision that I saw in the plain. But this, which is found in some codices. And in the statue the image of Zel ** is added from Theodotion. The rest similarly. When he says: 'He brought me to Jerusalem in a vision of God,' he shows that he was not transferred in body, but in spirit. According to this vision, we can see both the heavens and the depths of the sea and the underworld, while we embrace the rationalities of each thought. But first he comes to the entrance, which faces the North, so that he may see there the statue of the idol of Zel to provoke emulation; so that he may be able to penetrate to the inner chambers from that place, and behold the rest, which are described afterwards. The history tells that a statue of the idol Baal was placed in the temple of God. This idol is beautifully called the idol of Zel, because it provokes emulation and zeal for the Lord, as it is said in Deuteronomy: 'They have provoked me to jealousy with that which is not God: they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will provoke them to jealousy with those which are not a people' (Deut. XXXII). And because zeal and possession, which is called Cena in Hebrew, are called by the same name, the Seventy have interpreted the statue of Zel as the statue of the possessor. Finally, when Cain was born, his parent said, by God's power, I have obtained a man (Gen. IV, 1), alluding to the possession of a man, and gave the name Cain. And there was the glory of the God of Israel, not because He delighted in such proximity, but to destroy their idol of Zeal and their temple. Therefore, the city and the temple were soon destroyed. And it is written in Isaiah, that a narrow bed cannot hold two, and a short cloak cannot cover both (Isa. XXVIII); the Scripture signifies what the Apostle said: What agreement is there between Christ and Belial? Temple of God and idol (2 Corinthians 7:25).

<h2 id='tocuniq104'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5) And he said to me, "Son of man, lift up your eyes toward the north." So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, was this idol of jealousy. Because we have set up the idol of jealousy north of the altar gate, seventy elders of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them, have entered into it. He said, he said to me, either the glory of God, which I had seen in the field, or the spirit that lifted me up between heaven and earth. And he spoke to me, after he had transported me to Jerusalem, and made me see either the city or the temple, and commanded me to lift up my eyes towards the way of the North. For there, a statue of Baal was placed, which he called the idol of Zeli, at the very entrance of the gate. But those who attribute the idol of Zeli, whether to the glory of God or to the spirit, unjustly change the person of the idol, altering the majesty of God.


<h2 id='tocuniq105'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) And he said to me: Son of man, do you see what they are doing? The great abominations that the house of Israel is committing here, to cause me to withdraw from my sanctuary? And yet, when you turn back, you will see even greater abominations. Do not think that I am unjustly leaving the temple and abandoning the city, look at what they are doing in the temple. And when you see that, do not think that the end of their wickedness has come, you will see even greater things. Indeed, what can be understood about our Jerusalem and our temple can also be understood as an example of Ophni and Phinees (2 Kings 2), when we carry out the crimes of idols in the tabernacle of God; and we engage in sexual immorality with those who have dedicated themselves to the service and ministry of God; and we take the first fruits of his sacrifices, giving them to the use of clients and slaves, and we do everything for the sake of profit. But if these things that we see are so great, how much greater should those things be that escape human consciousness?


<h2 id='tocuniq106'>(Vers. 7 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 7 and following) And he brought me to the door of the court, and I saw, and behold, there was a hole in the wall. And he said to me, 'Son of man, dig in the wall.' And when I dug in the wall, there appeared a door. And he said to me, 'Go in and see the evil abominations that they are doing here.' This is what I have translated: 'And I saw, and behold, there was a hole in the wall,' which is not found in the Septuagint. And because everything is shown as if in an image or picture, he says that he saw a hole in the wall and was commanded to dig it and make it larger, so that with the hole opened wider, he could enter and see what he could not see from outside. By which it is shown, both in the Church and in each one of us, that greater sins are indicated by small vices, and as if through certain openings, one reaches great abominations. For by the fruits the tree is known (Matt. 12:33, 34), and out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. As a sign of the inner person, words burst forth: as how a lewd speech, for it cleverly conceals its vices, sometimes reveals an obscene conversation; and the hidden greed inside is indicated by the desire for a small thing. For greater things are shown by lesser ones, and the conscience cannot be hidden by expression and eyes, while a luxurious and lascivious mind shines forth in the face; and the secrets of the heart are revealed by the movement of the body and gestures.

<h2 id='tocuniq107'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10) And when I entered, I saw that the entire likeness of reptiles and abominable animals and all the idols of the house of Israel were depicted on the wall all around. Not only was the idol of Zeli standing at the entrance of the North Gate, but also all the walls of the Temple were painted with various images of idols, so that there was no beast that the wall painting did not show. So far, we see this in the shrines of idols and the temples of the pagans, that foolish religion worships all kinds of beasts. And so Virgil says:

All kinds of gods and monsters, and the barking Anubis, As if those monsters that it praises are not monsters.

Against Neptune and Venus, and against Minerva. We can also show in the walls of our temples idols depicted, when we are subject to all vices, and we paint in our hearts the consciousness of sins, and various images. Of which it is also said in the Psalm: Lord, in your city you will scatter their image (Psalm 72:20). And in another place: Nevertheless,  man walks in image (Psalm 38:7). For it is certain that there is no man who does not have some kind of image, whether of holiness or sin. Therefore, it is said of the furious and the wrathful: Their fury is like that of a serpent; like the deaf adder that stops its ears, which will not hear the voice of the charmers (Psalm 58:5). And concerning wicked men: O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come? (Matthew 3:7). And concerning the deceitful and cunning: Go, tell that fox (Luke 13:32). And concerning the lovers of women: They have become mad like horses towards women: each one neighs after his neighbor's wife (Jeremiah 5:8). Concerning animals and foolish people: Do not be like a horse or a mule, which have no understanding. And again: Put a bridle and a bit in their mouths, those who do not come near to you (Psalm 32:9). And many similar things. But this that we have mentioned: And behold, no representation of reptiles and animals is found in the Septuagint.


<h2 id='tocuniq108'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11) And seventy men from the elders of the house of Israel, and Jezonias the son of Saphan stood in their midst, standing before the paintings, and each had a censer in his hand, and the vapor of incense rose up. When it says that seventy men were from the elders of the house of Israel, who held censers in their hands, it indicates that there were many other priests who did not do this, but perhaps they were held captive by other sins. And it is said that Jezonias the son of Saphan stood among them, as if the leader of their wickedness and sacrilege, who, having abandoned the religion of God, worshiped idols, and in the temple, did not adore God, whose temple it was, but the paintings on the walls. And it is beautifully said: Jezonias, the son of Saphan, stood in the midst of the standing elders, the judges and condemners, because he was both a prince and one of those whose prince he was, and they stood firmly in their crimes and did not waver in evil; but they persisted most strongly. And the smoke of incense, which rose from those offering sacrileges, showed the vapor of confusion and turmoil. This event happened at that time according to the letter. Furthermore, it is necessary for us to pray that the elders of the house of Israel, multiplying the sacred number seven by seven tens, do not remain in their errors and worship the images of idols, and that the sacrilege does not rise up against God. When we see the most wicked people gathered, of whom it is written: 'I hate the congregation of evildoers' (Psalm 26:5), and worse leaders, and a ruler who is both in charge of the people and the elders, let us say that Jezonias is standing before the images, and that each of them has a censer in their hands, worshiping not the majesty of God, but their own opinions, and not offering a pleasing fragrance to God, but a foul stench to the idols.


<h2 id='tocuniq109'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) And he said to me: Surely you see, son of man, what the elders of the house of Israel do in the darkness, each one in the hiding place of his chamber. For they say: The Lord does not see us; the Lord has forsaken the land. From this, he says, it is shown what each one does in his own chamber when they gather together in the temple. But according to the anagoge, it can be better understood that some leaders of the Churches do in the darkness things that are even shameful to speak of. This is the hidden man of the heart, of whom it is said: Enter into thy chamber (Mich. VI, 4). And again: He who sees in secret shall repay thee. Let each one recall his own conscience, and let him remember the works of darkness in the darkness, and let him know the scripture: Everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest he be reproved by the light (John III, 20; I Thess. V). And in himself he shall understand this to be fulfilled: He who is intoxicated is intoxicated at night (Prov. II, 25). Because standing according to the letter cannot. For how many are intoxicated with days of feasting and banquets? But because the drunkenness of the heart offends God, it is of darkness, not of light, therefore whoever is intoxicated, is intoxicated at night. However, when the elders of the house of Israel have done evil in darkness and in the hidden places of their chambers, and have thought that they could hide from God, then they will consequently say: The Lord does not see us, the Lord has forsaken the land. There are many sinners who walk according to their own thoughts, who do not consider that God cares about mortal things, nor that our vices pertain to Him. Certainly, if we were to think that God sees and is present when we sin, we would never do what displeases Him. Furthermore, what follows is, 'The Lord has forsaken the earth', which is also the opinion of some philosophers who, from the movement and constancy of the stars, suspect that there is providence in the heavens, and that earthly things are despised, since nothing virtuous or in accordance with order is done on earth.


<h2 id='tocuniq110'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verse 13, 14.) And he said to me: Yet you shall see even greater abominations which they ((or these)) do. And he brought me to the entrance of the gate of the house of the Lord, which faced north; and behold, there were women sitting there ((or they were sitting)) mourning for Adonis. We interpreted him as Adonis, and in the Hebrew and Syrian language he is called Thamuz (). Because according to a Gentile fable, in the month of June, the lover of Venus and the most beautiful young man was killed, and it is narrated that he revived afterwards, they call the same month June by the same name, and they celebrate an annual commemoration for him, in which he is mourned by women as if dead, and afterwards he is sung and praised when he revives. And after that, 89, when the leaders and elders of the house of Israel were shown what they had done in the temple and in the darkness of the chambers: even the vices of women are described, who mourn in private the society of lovers, and rejoice if they can obtain them. And because the same paganism interprets subtly such fables of poets that have obscenity, it thinks that the killing and resurrection of Adonis, with mourning and joy, are shown: the former of which it thinks is demonstrated in the seeds that die in the earth, the latter in the crops, by which the dead seeds are reborn; let us also call those women who are either saddened or rejoice at the evils and goods of the world, with a soft and effeminate mind: and let us say that they mourn for Thammuz, those things namely that are considered the most beautiful in the things of the world.


<h2 id='tocuniq111'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Verse 15, 16.) And he said to me: You have certainly seen, son of man: yet you shall see even greater abominations than these. And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord, and behold, at the entrance of the temple of the Lord, between the vestibule and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east, worshiping the sun. We interpreted this vestibule as referring to Symmachus, who placed a πρόπυλον (gate) there, because the Septuagint and Theodotion translated the Hebraic word as Aelam. The first edition of Aquila translated it as προστάδα (forecourt), and it was interpreted as the temple of Aelam, which we can express as the portico of the temple or the covered court that was between the temple and the altar. And as we read above, after the idol of Zeli, which appeared at the gate of the North: Still turned, you will see greater abominations; and with the pictures of all the beasts that the seventy elders and Jezonias the son of Saphan worshipped, holding censers in their hands, it is said a second time: Still turned, you will see greater abominations that they do, because the weeping women sat for Adoniden; and after the third sin, it is said: Still turned, you will see greater abominations than these. But what is the greater abomination of the three previous crimes? Namely, the fourth which follows: Behold, at the entrance of the Lord's temple, between the vestibule and the altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs towards the temple of the Lord, and their faces towards the east, and they were worshiping the rising sun, because, despising the Lord, that is, the Creator, they were worshiping the sun, that is, a creature of the Lord, as commanded by the Lord Himself through Moses (Deut. XII), that they should not worship God against the East, as the manner of the Gentiles, but wherever they were in the world, whether to the East, or to the West, or to the South, or to the North, they should worship against the temple, where the Lord was believed to dwell in the Holy of Holies. Indeed, we read that Daniel also did this in Babylon (Dan. 6), who, with the windows of his upper chamber open towards Jerusalem, worshipped the Lord contrary to the temple. Concerning the literal meaning, no one doubts that this was sacrilege. As for the allegorical meaning, he will be able to know that all heretics are worse than their predecessors, that is, than the idol of Zeal and the painted figures of animals on the wall, and the weeping of Adonis, through which idolatry and pleasures are shown, who understands the prophet saying: But you have hated discipline, and have cast my words behind you (Ps. 49:17). And in another place: They have turned their back to me and not their face; though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they did not listen to receive instruction."  } But we worship the sun of justice in such a way that we worship God in the temple of the Old Testament, where the Law and the Prophets are, where the Cherubim and the mercy seat are. Twenty-five men translated it, seventy placed it, twenty; and in some copies, five from Theodotion were added.

<h2 id='tocuniq112'>91 (Vers. 17.)</h2>

91 (Verse 17.) And he said to me: Surely you have seen, son of man: Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they should commit these abominations which they have committed here? For they have filled the land with wickedness and have turned to provoke me. And behold, they put the branch to their nose. Because we have said: And behold, they put the branch to their nose, the LXX translated: and behold, they stretch the branch, to be all in agreement: And behold, they stretch the branch as if mocking. Symmachus interpreted it as though they were emitting a sound resembling a song through their nostrils. However, it signifies twenty-five men who are firmly established in a square formation, and through the five senses multiplied by five, they form the shape of a square, not only having a temple behind them, but also applying a branch to their nostrils, similar to idols. Without a doubt, it signifies that they are worshiping idols, namely the palm branches, which are called βαΐα in the Greek language. Finally, Job also says that he had this virtue among others, that he never looked at the sky, the sun, the moon, and the shining stars, and kissed his hand (Job 31), that is, he worshiped creatures. However, Symmachus' interpretation signifies a foul and hoarse sound coming from his nostrils in contempt of God. And all heretics, who have filled the earth with iniquity, and turned to false knowledge in order to provoke the Lord to anger, are to be considered: when they want to praise God, they rather blaspheme with an ugly sound, or consider the God of the Old Testament of little importance, mock, and scorn Him.


<h2 id='tocuniq113'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) So I will also do in my wrath; my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. And when they cry to my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them. And what follows, And when they cry to my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them, is not found in the Septuagint. For all these things, says the Lord, that they have done, I will do in my wrath; my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity. When the ancient heretics hear this, they accuse the Creator of being cruel and bloodthirsty; and they do not consider the Apostle Paul, who certainly, according to their own words, is an apostle of the good God, writing to the Corinthians, If I come again, I will not spare (2 Corinthians 12:2); so that the rod may discipline the wrongdoers and the wanderers may be brought back to salvation. For those who do not understand what is beneficial for themselves, and frequently ask for things contrary to that, it is expedient for them to not be heard by the Lord. Hence, in the Lord's Prayer, we say: Thy will be done (Matthew 6:10). Not our will, which is accustomed to err, but Thy will, which knows the future. And it is sometimes a great happiness to not deserve mercy in the present. And therefore, the Lord will not spare those who are from the house of Judah and have departed from the confession of the Church. And when they cry out with a loud voice, of which the Lord said: Their cry has come to me (Gen. 18): yet the Lord will not hear them, so that, compelled by their evil deeds, they may understand what they have done.

<h2 id='tocuniq114'>(Cap. IX.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 9, Verse 1) And he cried out in my ears with a loud voice, saying: The visitations of the city have drawn near. The Seventy have transferred vengeance for visitations. For I will take vengeance and repay, says the Lord (Deuteronomy 32:35). And every vengeance is like that of a sick person, like one who has wounds, like one waiting for healing hands, according to what is written elsewhere: I will visit their iniquities with a rod, and their sins with scourges, but I will not take away my mercy from them (Psalm 88:33-34)." } And rightly (as we have said above), the visitation or punishment is said to be approaching in close proximity to captivity.

And everyone has a vessel of destruction in his hand. He did not say, 'he had', as the Septuagint translated. For he does not narrate things past, but shows things present and future. Therefore, the one who strikes evildoers because they are evil, and has vessels of destruction in order to kill the worst, is a minister of the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq115'>(Vers. 2, 3.)</h2>

(Verses 2, 3.) And behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which faces toward the north, and each one had an instrument of destruction in his hand. There was also one man among them clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn at his side. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar. Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub, where it had been, to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed with linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn at his side. Regarding the lines that we have interpreted next to Symmachus 93, LXX, ποδήρη; Theodotion itself is the Hebrew word Baddim (); Aquila, the principal translators. Again, when we said, and the writer's inkwell at his kidneys, LXX put: And a sapphire belt on his kidneys; Theodotion, κάστυ in his hand; Aquila, μελανοδοχεῖον, that is, the scribe's inkwell at his loins; Symmachus had writing tablets on his kidneys. And when we had transferred ourselves, the threshold of the house, Seventy and Theodotion, the courtyard, that is, under the open sky, we set as the entrance. As for the destruction of the vessels that each man held in his hands, only Seventy interpreted the axe. Therefore, in order to atone for the sins of humanity, who were created on the sixth day of the creation of the world, six men come and descend from the upper gate, or as the Seventy translated, from the high place to the North. And each person had a hatchet in their hands, about which John speaks: For now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire (Matt. III, Luke III, 9). And in the middle there was one of the six men, that is, the seventh, dressed in the garments of a priest, and he had a scribe's inkwell at his waist, with which he would write down the sins of all and separate the number of the saints from the sinners, or a sapphire belt of sapphire-colored stone, which is among the ornaments of the high priest. Six men went out and stood next to the bronze altar. For there were two altars: one of incense, made of gold on the inside, and the other in front of the temple, made of bronze for burnt offerings. It is said that those who stand next to the altar are prepared to carry out the command of the one who gives orders, so that if they see anyone there who has not had their sins forgiven, they know that they are subject to the judgment and execution of the Lord. The glory of the God of Israel also ascended, whether it was taken up by one of the cherubim, and went to the threshold, or to the inner part of the courtyard of the house and vestibule, which is not covered, but enjoys the freedom of the air. The glory of the Lord itself, who was in the form of a pontiff, and had an inkwell in his loins, called out, and said what the Scripture testifies. Some interpret the six men, who are called Angels, as those who obey the will of God; and they understand the one who had the vestment of the pontiff as the Savior; according to that, he is the Priest and Angel of great counsel, and that which is said: You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek (Psalm 109:4). But the talaris, which the Septuagint translated, is one of the eight vestments of the high priest, which is called talaris in Latin; and it gets its name from descending to the feet. I know that I published a book about the vestment of the high priest many years ago, and I am sending the reader for an explanation of it. For I cannot say everything in all places, and what Aquila's first edition and Theodotion said κάστυ, for which in Hebrew it is read Cesath (), when I asked in Hebrew what it meant, he responded to me in the Greek language that it is called καλαμάριον, because reeds are stored in it. We call ink, from the fact that it has ink. Many people call them inkwells, from the fact that they are containers for writing quills. Of the four Cherubim, one Cherub is sent from the glory of the Divine Majesty to speak to the one who was clothed in the garments of the high priest. And although many people think that Cherubim is a neuter gender and plural in number, we must know that Cherub is singular in number and masculine in gender, and its plural is Cherubim of the same gender: not because there is gender among the ministers of God, but because each thing is called by different genders according to the properties of its language. The angels are called in the plural number Malachim, and Cherubim, and Seraphim of the same kind and number. Furthermore, sabaoth, which is interpreted as hosts or armies and powers, are called in the feminine gender, plural number, and end in the final syllable Oth. Those, however, who wish the Savior to be understood under the figure of a high priest, use the example from the Apocalypse of John, in which it is written: 'And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me.' And when I turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks: and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, (Apoc. II, 12, 13), etc.

<h2 id='tocuniq116'>(Vers. 4 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse. 4 and following) And the Lord said to him: Pass through the middle of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who groan and lament over all the abominations that are committed in the midst of it. And to the others he said in my hearing: Pass through the city after him, and strike. Your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity. Kill old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but touch no one on whom is the mark. But do not kill anyone on whom you see the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.\" So they began with the elders who were before the temple. Then He said to them, \"Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!\" So they went out and killed in the city. Or, as the Hebrews believe, because the Law is called Thora among them (), which is written with the letter at the beginning of its name; they received this sign who fulfilled the precepts of the Law. And to come to our own, the ancient Hebrews used 96 letters, which the Samaritans still use today, the final letter being Thau, resembling a cross, which is painted on the foreheads of Christians and is frequently marked in hand inscriptions. There are some who think, because according to the Hebrew alphabet this is the last letter, it is shown that there would be a multitude of sinners, remains of saints. Therefore, those who groan and sorrow are saved; who not only did not consent to evil works, but also mourned the sins of others, according to how Samuel mourned for Saul (3 Kings 16), and the apostle Paul mourned for those who did not repent after sin. And he himself said: 'For in this tabernacle we groan' (2 Corinthians 5:2). And elsewhere: 'Great is my sorrow, and unending is the pain in my heart' (or 'in my heart') (Psalms 4:7). And it is commanded that the six men should kill everyone except those who are able to say: 'The light of your countenance is signed upon us, O Lord' (Psalms 4:7), sparing not the old man, nor the young man, nor the virgin, nor the child, nor the woman. According to mystical interpretation, the old men are those who are in the Church, of whom it is said: 'The grey hair of a man is his wisdom' (Wisdom 4:8); the young men are those who are most ready for battles of faith; the virgins are those who keep their chastity with their whole mind; the children are those who drink milk of infancy and do not yet understand solid food; the women are those who testify to the weakness of their souls by the frailty of their sex. To all of whom no mercy is shown if they believe themselves to be something without the seal of Christ. And what follows: 'And begin from my sanctuary,' that is, as the Seventy translators have rendered it, 'begin from my saints,' or it signifies the priests, who were engaged in the temple and worshipped idols; or those who, by the merit of their priesthood, were called holy in the people, and who, for the sake of sin, were the first to deserve punishment in the sight of the people. For the time has come (I Cor. VII), for judgment to begin at the house of God.

<h2 id='tocuniq117'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) So they began with the elder men who were in front of the house. And he said to them: Defile the house and fill the courts with the slain. Fill the courts with the slain. For the courts, which are called 'Aseroth' in Hebrew (LXX), they laid out roads. But the elder men, about whom we read earlier that they had censers and offered incense to idols, were killed. There is no longer any religious worship in the temple, for, having offended God's religion, everything has been defiled so that judgment comes from where sin comes. The atria are filled with corpses in the temple, and not the streets, which were certainly outside, unless perhaps we can understand the streets ((or perhaps we can understand the streets)). And the angels could not dare to defile the temple with the blood of the dead, in which the glory of God previously dwelt, unless the Lord had commanded this for the departing ((or believing)) glory. Everyone who is dead in sin defiles the atria of the temple, and the streets of the city of the Lord, in which he lives: but when rising with Christ, he ceases to be dead.


And they went out and struck those who were in the city. Or, as others have reported, they struck the city; calling the city itself the city.

(Verse 8.) And when the slaughter was complete, I remained: and I fell upon my face, and crying out, I said: Alas (Vulg. Alas, alas, alas), Lord God, therefore do not destroy all the remnants of Israel, pouring out your wrath upon Jerusalem? With all those who did not have the seal, fallen by slaughter, the prophet fell upon his face, thinking that no one had survived except himself from the multitude of those killed. And because this seemed to be contrary to the sentence by which the Lord had ordered that the men with sealed foreheads should not be killed, therefore it was subtracted in the Vulgate edition. But we, following the Hebrew truth, have put, I remained. And it should be noted that he did not say alone: what he had said seemed to be the opposite, but I remained, so that it may be understood with the others who had marked foreheads. But in order to know clearly what was said, I remained, in the book of Kings, when Elijah speaks to God: Your altars have been destroyed, and I am left alone, and they seek to take my life (3 Kings 19:14); he used the word alone because he did not know that others had remained. Some think that this can be understood about the people of Judah, in whose likeness Ezekiel came before; namely, when all had turned aside, they had become altogether useless. And the Prophet testifies: Save me, O Lord; for the Holy One has failed. For only the Lord has been found who has not committed sin, and no deceit has been found in His mouth. But what is said: pouring out Your fury upon Jerusalem, signifies the magnitude of the outpouring of punishment, as we read elsewhere: Contempt has been poured out upon princes. And again: My steps have nearly slipped (Psalm 73:2). And in a good way. The love of God has been poured out into our hearts (Romans 5:5). And: Grace has been poured out on your lips (Psalm 45:3). And on the contrary: Pour out your fury on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that have not called upon your name (Jeremiah 10; Psalm 79:6). And: Draw out the spear and close up against those who pursue me (Psalm 35:3).

(Vers. 9, 10.) And he said to me: The wickedness of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. And the land is filled with blood, and the city is filled with perversion. For they have said: The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see. Therefore, my eye will not spare, nor will I have mercy: I will repay their ways upon their heads. Seeing his prophet weep for the people, and marveling at the magnitude of his anger, the Lord gives reasons: not as he thought, unjust or excessive punishment, but deserved and just sentencing. Iniquity, he says, of the ten tribes of Israel and the two tribes of Judah is great, and not only great, but excessively great. And he does not suffice to say this, but he repeats it, strongly, so that the magnitude of the punishment is in proportion to the magnitude of the iniquity. From this we learn, contrary to what most people think, and especially the Stoics, that sins are not equal; but rather, they are either great or small, and punishing judgment varies according to the quality and measure of the sinners. The land, he says, is filled with blood, or as the Septuagint translates, with peoples; and the city is filled with aversion, or as the Vulgate edition has it, with iniquity and uncleanness: much blood has been shed, not just a little, but from one gate to the other; and the whole city has turned away from the worship of God, and instead it is filled with impurity, namely the filth of idolatry. But the cause of such crimes is that they believed there is no providence over the earth, and that God does not care for mortal things, according to what we read elsewhere (Virgil. book IV, Aeneid).

Undoubtedly it is the task of the gods, that concern disturbs their tranquility. Therefore, because they either thought that there was no providence, or that which had been before in the peoples at this time had abandoned their own people, for this reason the eye of God will not spare, nor will he have pity, so that, raging against vices, he may be appeased by virtues, and may bring down upon their heads the ways and sins of those, either upon the principal (ἡγεμονικὸν) of their heart, or upon the rulers of the people, as the book of Numbers says, in which the rulers of the people are said to be the heads of the peoples.

(Verse 11) And behold, a man clothed in linen, who had a writing case at his waist, answered, saying: I have done as you commanded me. LXX: And behold, a man clothed in a white garment (that is, a tunic) and girded with a belt around his waist, answered, saying: I have done as you commanded me. He is the man to whom it was commanded to pass through the midst of Jerusalem, and to set a mark on the foreheads of the men sighing and crying for all the abominations that are done within it. He says that he has fulfilled the Lord's commandments and has marked the foreheads of mourners with the seal of the letter Tau (or armed them, as others interpret). But the six men whom the Lord had commanded, saying, 'Go through the city following him, and strike; show no mercy to anyone, and do not announce such things.' For they have filled the sentence of sorrow, not with words, but with deeds. And in this place, for ποδήρη, that is, a long robe, which the Septuagint has interpreted, Theodotion put the Hebrew word Baddim (); Symmachus, a line; Aquila, a distinctive garment, or robe. Symmachus placed 100 tables; Aquila, an inkwell; Theodotius, a helmet.

<h2 id='tocuniq121'>(Cap. X.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 10, Verses 1-2) And I looked, and behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim, there appeared something like a sapphire stone. And there was a likeness of a throne above it, like the appearance of a sapphire stone. And he said to the man clothed in linen, 'Go in between the wheels, beneath the cherubim, and fill your hands with coals of fire from among the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.' Concerning the firmament that was above the cherubim, the sapphire stone that had the likeness of a throne, and the wheels that the living creatures followed, it is enough to have mentioned them, and let the reader be satisfied with their explanation. But now, what is commanded to the man clothed in linen, for whom the Septuagint in this place have interpreted as 'the stole,' that he should take coals of fire from the midst of the cherubim, and scatter or spread them over the city, seems to me to signify this: that after the killing and slaughter of many, and the dead bodies in the streets, the coals of fire are taken in order to punish or cleanse Jerusalem, according to what is written in Isaiah: 'He has made him holy in the burning fire, and it shall devour as straw' (Isaiah 10:17). These are the coals which, as a remedy for the inflaming and corrupting of the tongue, the Prophet desires, saying: 'What shall be given to you, and what shall be added unto you, deceitful tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of desolation' (Psalm 119:3-4). And many other things of this kind may be found in the holy Scriptures, of which we have frequently spoken. It is only to be noted here that in Isaiah, who had sinned so much in his speech, and had declared that he had unclean lips, a coal is taken to purify him. But here, because the city was full of wickedness and after the punishment, dead bodies, many coals of fire are taken, not with one hand, but with both, in order to purify all of Jerusalem. However, it should also be understood that these coals of fire are taken not for purging, but for punishment and torment, which are scattered over Jerusalem.

<h2 id='tocuniq122'>(Vers. 3 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 3 onwards) And he entered into my sight. And the cherubim stood at the right side of the house when the man entered, and the cloud filled the inner courtyard. And the glory of the Lord rose above the cherub at the threshold of the house, and the house was filled with a cloud, and the courtyard was filled with the splendor of the glory of the Lord. And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer courtyard, like the voice of the almighty God speaking. And when he commanded the man, who was clothed in linen, saying: Take fire from among the wheels that are between the cherubim; that man entered and stood beside the wheel. And the Cherub stretched out his hand from the midst of the Cherubim to the fire that was between the Cherubim, and took it and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen. And he took it and went out. And the likeness of a hand of a man appeared under their wings. Seeing this, the prophet entered, and the man who was clothed in a long robe or linen, and as the Septuagint now changes its interpretation, holy stole, as among the Hebrews one word is held to be Baddim (), and the other interpreters persist in their initial translation. However, as it is said, he entered into the midst of the wheels, which are underneath the Cherubim, to fill his hands with fiery coals. When he had entered, he stood only beside the wheel, and either because of the sadness of punishing Jerusalem, or because of the greatness of glory, he did not send his own hand into the fire, but one of the Cherubim, that is, the Cherub sent his hand, and took the fire, which was in the midst of the Cherubim, and put it into the hand of the one who was clothed in linen garments. The one who entered was accepted; and yet Scripture does not say what the one who entered did, so that he would leave the sad narrative to our understanding rather than subject it to our eyes. But as the man entered, who was wearing linen garments, the Cherubim stood on the right side of the house, so that the holy and heavenly virtues seemed to hold the right side of the house of God, and those that are sent for punishment, of whom it is written: 'He sent against them the wrath of bad angels' (Ps. 77:49), are believed to possess the left side. And when the glory of the Lord was lifted up from the Cherub, who was about to deliver the firebrands to the man, and had passed over to the threshold of the house, immediately the cloud, darkness, and thick smoke filled the inner courtyard. For in the presence of the majesty of the Lord, no punishments are carried out, and the glory of the Lord is seen in the courtyard, about which it is written: The sound of the wings of the Cherubim could be heard all the way to the outer courtyard. For the sound, in Hebrew, is written as voice: a voice that had a resemblance to the voice of the Almighty God speaking. For what reason they translated it as 'Saddai', the voice of God; and Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotio translated it as 'capable', which signifies strong and powerful. Note, reader, in which they agree or disagree, so that from the comparison of both without our prompting, you may understand the divine mysteries, and that which I previously mentioned, namely, that the 'nonveritas' (falsehood) is not said, but the 'similitudo' (similarity) in the firmament, and on the throne, and in the hand of man. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood.

<h2 id='tocuniq123'>(Vers. 8 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 8 and following) And I saw, and behold, four wheels beside the Cherubim. One wheel beside one Cherub, and another wheel beside one Cherub. And the appearance of the wheels was like the vision of a chrysolite stone, and their appearance was the same, four of them as if one wheel in the midst of another wheel. And as they went, they went in the four directions, and did not turn back as they went, but followed the direction to which the first went, and the others followed, and they did not turn. And the whole body of them, and their necks, and hands, and feathers, and circles, were full of eyes round about the four wheels. And he called these wheels voluble, as I heard. And it had four faces: one face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and in the third was the face of a lion, and in the fourth was the face of an eagle; and the cherubim were elevated. Consider what was before, or how many species of wheels, according to the Septuagint, like a vision of tharsis: but now according to the same, like a vision of a carbuncle; so that the likeness of wings through fire, which is transmitted by the cherub, may be shown: although in Hebrew, both above and here, it is written 'tharsis,' but the eagle translated it as 'chrysolite,' Symmachus as 'hyacinth.' And again, wherever we turn: And every body of theirs, which is implied by the wheels, is written in Hebrew: And all their flesh, and necks, and hands, and wings, and circles. Note that flesh is called in the heavenly powers, so that when we read: Flesh and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God, nor does corruption possess incorruption (1 Cor. XV), we know that it is not the substance of flesh, but works that are being condemned: For Basar (), which is written in this place, signifies not a body, but flesh. But those 103 circles of wheels, he called them "cast iron", by which the roundness of wood is confined and compressed. But these wheels have not only flesh, or a body, or limbs: but also necks, and hands, and feathers, so that we may perceive the efficiency of things in each, not just the images of limbs. These wheels themselves are also called in the Hebrew language 'Gelgel' (גֶּלְגֶּל), which Symmachus interpreted as 'rolling', and Aquila as 'wheel'. Furthermore, what follows: Hearing me, until that place where it is written: Cherubim were lifted up, in the Septuagint it is not found; but it is added from the Hebrew. In which it is to be observed, that by no means, as it is said above: The face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side of the four, and the face of a calf on the left side of the four: and the face of an eagle four; so that they are believed to be different on the left and right: but an equal order of all is described, with the Scripture saying: The four faces had one: One face, the face of a Cherub, and the second face, the face of a man: and in the third face, the face of a lion: and in the fourth face, the face of an eagle; so that the first and second, and third, and fourth face, are described not by the diversity of places on the right and left, but by one order through degrees. But he called one face, namely the first, Cherub, for which he said above, the face of a calf. From this it is understood that the face of a Cherub is the face of a calf. The explanation of all these, except for the vision that has passed, contains their meaning.

<h2 id='tocuniq124'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 15 onwards) It is the living creature that I saw by the river Chobar. And when the Cherubim walked, the wheels went beside them. And when the Cherubim lifted up their wings to be lifted up from the earth, the wheels did not resist, but they were also beside them. As they stood, they stood, and when they were lifted up, they were lifted up. For the spirit of life was in them. All things live for God, and feel their Creator. For God is not the God of the dead, but of the living (Matthew 22:32). And all the bodies of the celestial orbs are full of eyes (Supra I). And in the psalm it is said: The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands. Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night reveals knowledge (Ps. XIX, 1, 2). The sun and the moon, the sea and the rivers, the mountains and the hills praise God, and the elements revolve in their own cycle year after year, and on earth we understand the order of the heavens, so that they may revolve and run according to the order of the ancient law; and we perceive nothing new upon the earth. But what is said: It is an animal, which I saw next to the river Chobar (Eccles. I), Scripture shows that we should understand the same thing in the exposition of the animal, which we understood above.

<h2 id='tocuniq125'>(Vers. 18 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 18 and following) And the glory of the Lord went out from the threshold of the temple and stood over the cherubim. And the cherubim lifted up their wings and were exalted from the earth in my sight. And as they went out, the wheels also followed them. And they stood at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the Lord, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them. It is the creature that I saw beneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar, and I understood that they were cherubim. Four, by four faces to one: and four wings to one, and the likeness of hands of a man under their wings: and the likeness of their faces, the same faces which I had seen by the river Chobar, and their looks and the impulse of every one of them to go straight forward. The glory of the Lord, or majesty, which had stood by the threshold of the temple, stood over the cherubims. They lifted up their wings, and the wheels also with them: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them. And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mount that is on the east side of the city. First, he was in the temple, then he stood in the atrium of the temple or on the threshold. As he left the temple, clouds and darkness filled the inner sanctuary of the temple. And once again, the glory itself sat above the cherubim, and as they immediately flew away and went out, the wheels followed. And the glory stood at the eastern gate of the house of the Lord, not at the temple entrance, but behind the atrium and threshold at the entrance of the eastern gate of the house of the Lord. When the prophet saw this, he said, 'It is the creature that I saw under the God of Israel, next to the river Chebar, and I understood that they were cherubim.' For what new thing had he seen that he understood to be Cherubim, which he had not understood before? Cherubim in our language is a multitude of knowledge: the knowledge of the sacraments of God, and his throne and rest. Hence it is also said in the psalm: You who sit above the Cherubim, make it manifest (Ps. LXXIX, 2). For the glory of the Lord always dwells in the multitude of knowledge, and it is made manifest when all things are demonstrated by royal providence; nothing happens by chance, nor does anyone speak without reason: The Lord has forsaken the earth, and the Lord does not see (Supra IX, 9). And their gaze and desire, is to forget the past, and extend themselves into the future (Philippians 3).

<h2 id='tocuniq126'>(Cap. XI.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 11, Verse 1) And the spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the Lord, which faces east and looks towards the rising sun. For the glory of the Lord had departed from the threshold of the temple and stood above the cherubim. And as the cherubim were flying, the glory itself stood at the entrance of the gate of the east side of the house of the Lord. And the prophet, who could not go near it, was lifted up by the spirit and brought to the same gate of the east side of the house of the Lord, which faces the sun of righteousness, as it is written: Behold, a man whose name is the East (Zechariah 6:12), so that it would no longer remain in the temple, which was clouded by the fog of ignorance; but standing at the gate of the east side of the house of the Lord, it would understand the following sacraments.


<h2 id='tocuniq127'>(Vers. 2 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 2 seqq.) And behold, at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men, and I saw among them Jezoniah the son of Azur, and Phaltiah the son of Benaiah, leaders of the people. And he said to me: Son of man, these men who devise wickedness and give evil counsel in this city, saying, 'The houses have recently been built. This city is a cooking pot, and we are the meat.' Therefore, prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man. And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon me, and he said to me, speak: Thus says the Lord: So you have spoken, O house of Israel, and I know the thoughts of your heart. You have killed many in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain. Therefore thus says the Lord God: Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it are the meat, and this city is the pot, but I will bring you out of the midst of it. You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, declares the Lord God. And I will bring you out of the midst of it, and give you into the hands of foreigners, and execute judgments upon you. I will judge you with the sword: in the border of Israel I will judge you, and you shall know that I am the Lord. This shall not be for you a pot, neither shall you be in the midst of it as flesh. In the border of Israel I will judge you, and you shall know that I am the Lord. What follows is not found in the Septuagint, but is added from the Hebrew: Because you have not walked in my commandments, and have not kept my judgments, but have done according to the judgments of the nations that are around you. The prophet is taken according to what is written: 'The Lord takes pleasure in those who fear him' (Ps. 146:6); or he is lifted up from the earth and brought into the gate of the eastern house of the Lord, so that he may know the oaths of the twenty-five men who were at the entrance of the gate, and the sons of Jezaniah son of Azzur, and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, the princes of the people. Therefore, those who were at the entrance of the gate of the eastern house of the Lord, despairing of salvation and ready for destruction with a guilty conscience, and unwilling to correct their sins through repentance, say: 'Although houses have been rebuilt after the first captivity which had fallen, we know that this city is like a cooking pot, and we are the meat to be consumed and burned in it,' according to what is written in Isaiah: 'If a storm passes through, it will not come upon us' (Isa. 28:15). While they were saying these things, the spirit of the Lord rushed upon the prophet, and a second time commanded him to prophesy, saying: 'Because you have said these things, and the secrets of your hearts are not hidden from me, I will interpret to you how the city is like a cauldron, and you are like meat: not in the sense that you spoke, but in another sense that you do not fear. Indeed, the city is like a cauldron in appearance, but it will not be filled with your flesh, but with the flesh of those whom you have killed.' But as for you who think that you will die in this city, I will bring you out from the midst of the city and deliver you into the hands of the enemy, and I will execute judgments on you. You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you at the border of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord. And it is also said: I will judge you at the border of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord. But you shall endure all these things, because you have not walked in my commandments and have not done my judgments, but have acted according to the wickedness of the nations around you. And when it is clearly stated according to the letter, omitting for a moment the names of Jezoniah, Azur, Phaltiah, and Benaiah, which we reserve for another time, it must be said that even today in the Church, which is the house of the Lord, and before the gate, and at the entrance, or on the way of the gate, which signifies the Savior, through whom we enter to the Father, there are twenty-five men, representing all senses. And as far as my memory does not fail me, I could never find this number in a positive light; although in the Book of Leviticus, twenty-five years are chosen for the priestly ministry; for in Hebrew, it does not have this number, which is stated in the Septuagint, but thirty, which is contained in the beginning of this prophet's and the Lord's age, when he came to the banks of the Jordan, and was baptized by John (Luke 3). But if in the Gospel there are found five wise virgins and five foolish ones (Matt. 25), let us know that this number is placed in the middle, and depending on the quality of the users, it can be attributed to the good or the bad. Therefore, these men, who refer everything to the senses and have two principles, as we have said above, are contained in the dual number, which divides unity, and in the number of the second day they do not seem to be from the Lord, according to the Hebrew truth. And in Noah's Ark, two by two, unclean animals are brought in (Genesis 6). But the Lord, by bringing together what was divided, made both one and broke down the middle wall, condemning enmity in his flesh (Ephesians 2). Therefore, he speaks in a more noble and lofty way: I and the Father are one (John 10:30), to call us from the Jewish duality into the unity of the Christian faith. Finally, with the destruction of the Jewish priesthood, the Lord suffers not under one ruler but under two, Annas and Caiaphas: to show the division of their religion and the error of it. There are many at the entrance of this gate before the house of the Lord in the East, who are compared to their nations by their own vices, and they despair of salvation because of the consciousness of their sins, and they say: The city in which we live is a sieve, and we are all flesh, and we will be consumed by the burning of Babylon, whose fiery arrows are: unwilling to repent and despairing of salvation. Therefore, they hear that they themselves are not the lost and destroyed flesh of the city, but those whom they have scandalized and killed. And thus a sword is imposed upon them so that, after they have been judged not among the nations but among Christians within the borders of Israel, they may then recognize that he himself is the Lord according to what is read in the Psalms: When he killed them, they sought him (Psalm 77:34), so that they may recognize through torments the one whom they have not recognized through benefits.

<h2 id='tocuniq128'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) And it came to pass when I prophesied, Phaltias the son of Banajae died. And I fell on my face, crying out with a loud voice, and said: Woe, woe, woe, Lord God! Are you bringing an end to the remnant of Israel? As the prophet prophesied, one of the two princes, Phaltias the son of Banajae, dies, whose name means falling ruin, and he is the son of a builder or mason. For οἰκοδόμος cannot be translated into our language as anything else." } The son of Azur, called Jezonias, is being saved from the changing of princes. Jezonias's ears are ringing, because the soul is understood. But Azur, on the other hand, is the support or assistance. Therefore, if someone falls away from the Lord and was of very poor building, they rightly fall, and God's prophecy confirms this. However, the one who obeys God's commands and is sustained and supported by His help, rightly remains in power among the people. We read in Exodus (Chapter II) that after Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, died, the children of Israel groaned because of the works of mud, straw, and bricks, and cried out to the Lord, whom they could not cry out to while he was alive. Isaiah also (Chapter VI), after the death of King Uzziah, who had leprosy, saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the seraphim standing around him; and understanding that he had unclean lips, and dwelling among a people with unclean lips, he deserves to have a burning coal from the altar put on his lips, and his unclean lips be purged. Here, through the strength of God prophesying, the prince who had turned away from the service of the Lord falls in order to be lifted up by Christ. For if the resurrection is from the Lord, the devil is in ruin. In this, it is sought how the Savior is spoken of. Behold, here He is placed in ruin, and the resurrection of many in Israel (Luke 2:34). In the ruin of those who stood wickedly, and the resurrection of those who have fallen. When the prophet saw this, he fell on his face, not from the merit of sinning, but from the affection of mourning; and with a loud voice, which came from great fervor of faith, he cried out three times, and said, Alas, alas, alas, Lord God, are you bringing about the end of the remnant of Israel? And there is this feeling: Even the very remnants that seemed to exist in the people, with you being indignant, will be obliterated.

<h2 id='tocuniq129'>(Vers. 14 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 14 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, your brethren, your brethren, the men who are near to you, and all the house of Israel, to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said: Get far away from the Lord, to us this land has been given as possessions. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: because I have cast them far away among the nations, and because I have scattered them among the lands, I will be a little sanctuary for them in the lands where they have come. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, your brothers and the men of your captivity, and all the house of Israel are finished; to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said: You are far away from the Lord: to us is given the land for an inheritance. Therefore he says: Thus says the Lord Adonai, because I will scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in all the land, and I will be a little sanctification to them in the regions where they have entered there. First, we must speak about the variety of interpretation. Because it is found in Hebrew, the men closest to you (for this is what Goliath means) translated it as the men of your captivity. Then it follows: all to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem said; for all, they put those, it is accomplished, because of the ambiguity of the letters and words: Chullo, for which Aquila and Symmachus and Theodotion translated as all; they translated it as it is accomplished, which does not at all resonate according to the meaning. Therefore, the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel, who had said: Alas, alas, alas, Lord God, are you bringing the end to the remnant of Israel? Specifically through the death of Phaltiah and those who were killed with him, because they are not the remnant that the prophet believed to be in Jerusalem, but rather those who appeared to be captives in Babylon. And the meaning is this: O son of man, your brothers, born of the same lineage as you, your brothers, I say, whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem said had turned away from the Lord because you are captives, and you had handed yourselves over to Jechoniah, but the land of Israel has been given to us as an eternal possession. So I say to them, that although I have sent them far from the land of Israel and scattered them among nations and made them live in foreign lands, I will still be with them even in foreign and hostile places for a small sanctification, as long as there are some among them who do not submit to idolatry and remember God's commandments, just as Daniel and the three youths did, and it is believed that there were others like them, in the likeness of the great princes mentioned in the Scriptures (Dan. III). From all these things we learn that we should not insult those who have been condemned by God's judgment to punishments; nor should we reproach a man who has turned away from his sins; nor should we ever say to those who repent and leave the Church: 'You have gone far away from the Lord; the land has been given to us.' For thus says the Lord: Although I may separate them for a short time from my Church, and disperse them among the nations, yet I will be for them a small sanctification, as long as they remember their sins and hasten to return to their former seats because of repentance." }

(Verse 17 and following) Therefore say: Thus says the Lord God: I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. And they shall go there, and they shall remove all the offenses and all the abominations from it. And I will give them one (or another) heart and put a new spirit within them; I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, so that they may walk in my statutes and keep my ordinances and obey them. Then they shall be my people, and I will be their God." } But as for those whose heart follows their offensive and abominable ways, I will place their path upon their own head, says the Lord God. This divine message speaks to those who were captives in the land of Babylon, to the 111 brothers of the prophet Ezekiel, and to the nearby ones whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem ((or Israel)) said: You have strayed far from the Lord, the land has been given to us as our possession. But these following words speak: I will gather you from the peoples and restore to you the land of Israel. And when you have entered, you shall remove all idols, on account of which you have offended God, and I will give you a heart that fears, and the service of God, so that you may by no means serve different idols, or any other than what you have had before. And I will give a new spirit in your inner being, according to what is written: Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me (Ps. 50:12). And I will remove from you a heart of stone, that is, a hard heart, according to what Stephen, the first martyr in Christ, speaks: You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart (Acts 7:51). And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, so that he would not let the people of Israel go (Exod. VII). And I will give them a heart of flesh, soft and tender, and able to receive the commandments of God, so that they may be written on the tablets of their carnal hearts. Therefore, a soft heart is given, and a hard heart is taken away, so that they may walk in my precepts, keep my judgments, and be a people of God; and the Lord, who was once their adversary, may be their God. But those who do not repent of their previous sins and continue to walk after their abominations, I will repay them, says the Lord, according to what they deserve, so that their ways may be upon their heads. These things are thought to have happened under Zerubbabel, the son of Salathiel, and under Jesus, the son of Josedec, the high priest, and under Ezra and Nehemiah, to the tribe of Judah, and to those who returned with them. It is also believed that the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who were taken captive under King Zedekiah of Judah, or who fled with Jeremiah to Egypt, were dispersed to all lands and did not return to the city of Jerusalem. However, the full conversion of those who were captive and the remnant of Israel is understood in Christ, when the remnants were saved and on one day three thousand believed, and again five thousand (Acts 2). And others, about whom James speaks to the apostle Paul: Do you see, brother, how many thousands of believing Jews there are? hi omnes aemulatores Legis sunt (Act. XXI, 20) . Sed et quotidie superbi 112 habitatores urbis Jerusalem, quorum cor post offendicula et abominationes suas ambulat, Dei merentur offensam, ethi qui foris erant, ablato corde lapideo, et accepto corde mollissimo, per poenitentiam revertuntur ad Ecclesiam; et ambulant in praeceptis Domini, judiciaque ejus custodiunt, fiuntque Domini populus, et Dominus, quem prius offenderant, fit eis Deus.

(Verse 22, 23.) And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and the wheels were with them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them. And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain, which is east of the city. Gradually, the glory of the Lord departed from Jerusalem. First leaving the temple, it stood in the courtyard or at the threshold of the house, and then at the entrance of the eastern gate. Finally, with its wings and accompanying wheels lifted up, it stood upon the mountain, which is east of the city, undoubtedly signifying the Mount of Olives, from which the Savior ascended to the Father. And the glory of the Lord stood still, which had departed from the city of Jerusalem and had come upon the Mount of Olives, as a sign of resurrection and light, so that from there it would see Jerusalem being destroyed and burned. And what is said: 'The glory ascended from the midst of the city' (John 14:31), the Lord speaks to the disciples in other words: 'Rise, let us go hence' (Luke 13:35). And to the Jews: 'Your house shall be left desolate' (Matthew 23). Josephus also reports that a voice was heard in the temple of the angels and heavenly powers, which were previously in the defense of the city: 'Let us depart from these dwellings' (Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews). And in a marvelous way, even to the present day, the glory of the Lord, which departed from the temple, stands shining on the Mount of Olives and gazes upon the formerly Jewish temple, dissolved into ashes and ruins, with the sign of the cross.

<h2 id='tocuniq132'>(Vers. 24, 25.)</h2>

(Verse 24, 25.) And the spirit lifted me up and brought me to Chaldea for the transmigration in a vision in the spirit of God, and the vision that I had seen was taken away from me. And I spoke to the transmigration all the words of the Lord that He had shown me. Because we have translated from the Hebrew truth: 'And the vision that I had seen was taken away from me,' the LXX translated: 'And I ascended from the vision that I had seen.' Both of which mean that the prophet was not physically transported from Babylon to Jerusalem, but in spirit, the vision that had led him in spirit to Jerusalem was taken away, and he returned to himself and spoke to the transmigration all that had been shown to him, specifically to those of whom it is written above: 'I was sitting in my house, and the elders of Judah were sitting beside me, and the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me, and I saw.' (Above, Chapter 8, Verse 1). And in a wondrous way, while these people who had come to visit were sitting, the prophet saw mystical visions and was absent from those who were sitting in front of him, but present in body without spirit. And everything is happening so that those who were captive may receive consolation, that they may be brought back to the land of Israel and walk in the commandments of the Lord, and he will be their people and they will be his people. But those who do not turn to repentance, but continue to walk in their abominations, will receive what they have done. However, we often remind that words are often spoken in the Holy Scriptures for things.

<h2 id='tocuniq133'>(Cap. XII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter XII - Verses 1 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see and do not see, who have ears to hear and do not hear, for they are a rebellious house. Because we translate: You dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, the Septuagint put: You dwell in the midst of their iniquities. But from what follows, Because they are a rebellious house, we understand that the previous sentence also applies to this verse. Furthermore, we frequently learn from experience, concerning anger also, that it is a sensation which, when it is excited in the middle of the house, you experience, which, owing to the bitterness of its vices, makes God, who is naturally sweet and merciful, bitter and cruel. Otherwise, we read of God: 'O taste and see that the Lord is sweet' (Psalm 33:9). However, the prophet dwells in the midst of a people who provoke God to bitterness, who has eyes and does not see, ears and does not hear, not from a defect of the senses, but from the obstinacy of wickedness. And so the Lord said to the Jews: If you were blind, you would have no sin (John 9:41), accusing and condemning their voluntary blindness. Therefore, because they have eyes to see, and do not see: ears to hear, and do not hear, and they despise your words, teach them through images and pictures; and show them with physical figures, so that they may recognize the coming captivity not only by hearing, but also by seeing.


<h2 id='tocuniq134'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Version 3.) Therefore, son of man, prepare for yourself vessels of migration: and you shall migrate daily before them. You shall migrate from your place to another place in their sight, if perhaps they may look upon it: for the house is rebellious. LXX: And you, son of man, prepare for yourself vessels of captivity; and you shall capture daily before them: and you shall capture from your place to another place in their sight, so that they may see that the house is rebellious. There is no doubt that the whole content of this place indicates the future captivity of King Zedekiah of the tribe of Judah, who was captured with Jerusalem. But since some want the captivity of Zedekiah, which is interpreted as the righteous Lord, to precede the type of the Savior, who descending from heaven to earth, assumed a human body, and these are the vessels of captivity, I therefore think it necessary to warn the prudent and cautious reader, and indeed to present these things, so that we may not seem to omit anything, but not to approve. For an impious king cannot surpass in form the one who is the perfect example of all piety. But it is narrated in the history of Jeremiah the prophet and the Kings that Sedeciah was captured by the Babylonians and Chaldeans and was led from place to place (Jeremiah 39 and 2 Kings 25), that is, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and other things that Ezekiel speaks of in the following. However, those who refer to the Lord Jesus Christ believe that his captivity and migration from place to place signify his descent from heavenly to earthly realms.


<h2 id='tocuniq135'>(Vers. 4 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 4 and following) And you shall bring out your vessels like the vessels of one who moves by day in their sight. But you shall go out in the evening before them, like one who migrates before their eyes. Dig a hole in the wall for yourself, and you shall go out through it in their sight. You shall bear it on your shoulders (Vulgate: you shall be carried), you shall escape in the darkness (Vulgate: you shall be brought out). You shall cover your face, and you shall not see the ground, for I have appointed you as a sign to the house of Israel." } LXX: And you shall bring forth your vessels of captivity by day in their sight. And you shall go out in the evening in their sight, as one goes out into captivity. You shall dig through the wall for yourself, and you shall go through it in their sight. You shall be carried on your shoulders, and you shall go out in hiding. You shall cover your face, and you shall not see the ground: for I have set you as a sign to the house of Israel. The prophet is commanded to do this as a symbol of what Zedekiah will do in reality. Collect, he says, your belongings (for these are the vessels of a traveler) while they watch. And after they have seen what you will do, you will go out in the evening in the likeness of a traveler. We read that Zedekiah fled by night with the wall secretly bored through, to the deserts of the Jordan, and there he was apprehended by the Babylonians, and this signifies the pierced wall. But what he says: On your shoulders you will carry, implies your belongings, and whatever those fleeing on a journey are accustomed to carry for comfort on the way. In the darkness you will escape (or carry off); you will not be seen by anyone. You will cover your face, or by the blindness that happened to it, your eyes will be plucked out by Nebuchadnezzar; or so that it is not known that he himself is the king, and the care of those serving will become greater. And what follows: And you will not see the land, that signifies that the blind one will be led to Babylon and will not see it. For I have given you as a portent to the house of Israel: for indeed the things said and done by the prophets have been both words and deeds. And in Zechariah, men of wonders are called, because they portend the future (Zech. III). And in Hosea, God speaks: 'I am like a prophet's hand' (Hosea XII, 10). But those who wish to understand Christ in the person of Ezekiel, take the vessels of captivity to mean the human body, and the pierced wall, by which He broke the gates of hell, and rising, appeared to the believing suns; and He was carried on the shoulders when He ascended as a victorious conqueror to heaven with angelic powers; and He goes forth concealed, and veils His face, so that the divine majesty is not seen in mortal flesh, and He does not see the earth, so that His eyes may not be dazzled by that which does not deserve His gaze. For the eyes of the Lord are upon the just (Psalm 33:16), and his face is against the wicked. They say that all these things were done so that, by way of a likeness to man, he might soften the hard hearts of the Jewish people towards the faith. And this is given as a sign to the house of Israel; according to that which is written: Behold, this child is set for the fall, and for the resurrection of many, and for a sign which shall be contradicted (Luke 2:34).

<h2 id='tocuniq136'>(Vers. 7, 8.)</h2>

(Verses 7, 8.) Therefore, I did as he had commanded me: during the day, I brought out my vessels like the vessels of a migrant, and in the evening, I dug a hole in the wall with my own hand. In the darkness, I went out and carried on my shoulders 116 (or was carried on their shoulders) before their eyes. LXX: And so I did according to all that he had commanded me: during the day, I brought out the vessels like the vessels of captivity; and in the evening, I dug a hole in the wall with my hand and went out and went into hiding: I was taken upon their shoulders in their sight. He testifies that he has completed the things he was ordered to do, and he does not need interpretation according to both opinions, as was explained above. However, it should be noted that at the same time Jeremiah prophesied in Jerusalem, and Ezekiel in Babylon, and his prophecy was sent to the captives; and his to those who lived in Jerusalem; so that by God's providence the unity of the two would be proven in different regions, and those who heard would understand that whatever happened to the people was not by the power of idols, but by the command of the Lord.


<h2 id='tocuniq137'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) And the word of the Lord came to me in the morning, saying: Son of man, did not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, say to you, What are you doing? Say to them: Thus says the Lord God. If the rebellious house asks you, Why are you doing this? Or according to the Septuagint, even if they do not ask, you shall go in, so that they may know why you did these things. Say to them: Thus says the Lord God.

<h2 id='tocuniq138'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 and following) This burden is against the prince who is in Jerusalem, and against all the house of Israel who are in their midst. Say: I am your portent: as I have done, so it will be done to them. They will go into exile and captivity. But the prince who is in their midst will be carried on shoulders, he will go out in darkness; they will dig through the wall to bring him out; his face will be covered, so that he may not see the land with his eyes. And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Chaldeans, and he shall not see it; there he shall die. And all who are around him, his helpers and his troops, I will scatter to every wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them, and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them in the lands. And I will leave a few of them remaining from the sword, from famine, and from pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations where they go, and shall know that I am the Lord. First, let us explain the history. Say, he said, to those, o son of man, whether they ask or not. What are you doing with this? that burden and vision are about the leader, who is in Jerusalem, signifying the leader Sedeciah. And say: I am your omen, or as the Septuagint translated, I am the one who performs wonders; so that from the present things, the future can be known. As I have done, so it shall be for them, to the leader and all those who are with the leader. In the transmigration to Babylon, the captives will be led, and the leader who is in their midst will be carried on shoulders, either by animals or by those who fled with him. In darkness and in the shadows of night he will go out; his companions will dig a wall so that they may bring him out. His face will be covered, either out of fear of the pursuer or due to the injury of blindness, so that the blind man may not see the land of Babylon. And I will spread my net over him, and he will be captured in my snare. For indeed, by the consent of the Lord, he was captured by the Babylonians; and he testifies that these things that he suffered were done by the enemy. And being led into Babylon, he will not see the land of the Chaldeans, and there he will die as a captive. However, all his companions and helpers and associates in his escape, when he is captured, I will scatter them here and there, and I will not allow them to depart in safety. But I will unsheathe my sword in the hands of the enemy, so that when they are dispersed among the nations, they will understand that I am the Lord, and that all things have been done according to my will. And I will leave, he says, some of his companions who have fled with him, and who have been able to escape, a few who have escaped the sword, and famine, and pestilence, so that when they have come to various regions through flight or captivity, they may recount all their crimes either by word or by example; because of which they have deserved such great evils, and understand that I myself am the Lord. But the one who attempts to explain the allegory and the beginning of the explanation concerning the Savior, the leader who is in the midst of Jerusalem, interprets himself, who has preceded as a portent and a sign, that both he and his companions are captives of this world, and who, emerging from the underworld as a victorious conqueror, is carried on the shoulders of angels: he has come forth in darkness, unrecognized by unbelievers, having destroyed the middle wall, he has made both one: his face is covered, so as not to regard the land of the Jews (Ephesians 2). It is no wonder if the Lord has hidden his face; since even until this day the veil is placed before the unbelieving people. And the Lord has spread his net over him, as the bride speaks of him in the Song of Songs: Behold, he is standing behind our wall, looking through the windows, appearing through the lattice (Song of Songs 2:9). Also, Jeremiah says: The spirit of our face, Christ the Lord, has been captured in our sins (Lamentations 4:20). And: Though he had not committed sin, he was made sin for us (II Cor. V, 21). And he shall be brought into Babylon, the confusion of this world, into the land of the Chaldeans, who are interpreted as demons, so that he may draw back to salvation those who had been enslaved by demons, and lead captive the ancient captivity. And he says that he will not see the land of the Chaldeans, and he will die there, so that he may give us all life through his death. But he dispersed all his helpers and companions, the apostles and the apostolic men, throughout the whole world. And he drew the sword after them, so that they might be crowned with various martyrdoms, and then they themselves, or those who had believed in them, might understand that he is the Lord, and therefore he dispersed them among the nations, and scattered them in the lands, so that they might bear much fruit. And he left from them a few men, like the Apostle John, and others, freed from the sword, and from hunger, and from pestilence, and avoiding the assault of persecutions, so that they might recount the crimes of the Jews and the injustices of all the nations into which they had entered, so that, having performed acts of penance, they might know that he himself is the Lord. We have spoken these things, leaving judgment to the reader's discretion. However, there is no doubt that it is dangerous to compare the captivity and death of the impious king to the sacrament of the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq139'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 17 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, eat your bread with trembling (Vulgate adds 'but'); and drink your water with haste and sorrow. And say (Vulgate says 'you shall say') to the people of the land: Thus says the Lord God to those who dwell in Jerusalem, in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with desolation, so that the land may be desolate because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it. And the cities that are now inhabited will be deserted and the land will be deserted, and you will know that I am the Lord. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, you will eat your bread with sorrow, and drink your water with torment and anguish. And you will say to the people of the land: Thus says Adonai the Lord to the inhabitants of Jerusalem on the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with poverty, and drink their water with dispersion, so that the land and its fullness may be dispersed. For all who live in that impiety and their cities will be desolated, and the land will be scattered, and you will know that I am the Lord. After the prophecy of the prince and his allies, which was shown in a physical image, came to the people: and whatever is said by the prophets is referred to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who, in the evil of siege, will eat their bread in distress and poverty, and drink their water with torment and tribulation. But these things, he said, O prophet, are said to you, that you may speak to the people of your land, and say: Thus says the Lord to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who are in the land of Israel: You will endure the evil of being besieged by Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldeans, famine and thirst, so that the whole land with its abundance may be destroyed, signifying the inhabitants through what is inhabited. And lest they think that this happens to them without cause: Say to them, he says, that because of their crimes and impieties, all the cities of Judah will be reduced to desolation, and the entire cultivation of the land will perish, so that they may know the raging God, whom they refused to recognize as merciful. Can the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who believe in Christ, say this in accordance with the anagoge, dwelling in the Church? And if they have incurred offense through their sins, let them eat bread with poverty, and drink water with sadness and distress: not the food of bread, nor the drink of water, but sustaining the hunger for the word and doctrine of God (Amos VIII). For when, either through the fault of princes who are to be captured and handed over to the Babylonians, or through our hardness, we have lost the word of God, and have not deserved to have useful waters: then in sorrow and want, we shall take our food, and the earth will lose the multitude of believers, and the cities, which are understood in the entire world as the Church, will be desolate, and the earth will be a wilderness, so that all may know that there has been offense to the Lord. Indeed, we can understand this even in a time of persecution.

<h2 id='tocuniq140'>(Vers. 21 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 21 onward) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying: The days are prolonged, and every vision shall fail? Therefore say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: I will make this proverb to cease, and it shall be no more proverbs in Israel.  And speak to them, that the days are at hand, and the word of every vision. For there shall be no more any vain vision, nor doubtful divination in the midst of the children of Israel. Because I, the Lord, will speak, and whatever word I speak will be done. It will no longer be delayed, but in your days, rebellious house, I will speak a word and make it happen, declares the Lord God. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, behold the house of Israel, who say, 'The vision that this man sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of times far off.' Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord God: None of my words will be delayed any longer: the word that I speak will be fulfilled, declares the Lord God. What we have said, according to Symmachus, all other interpreters have rendered as a proverb, which is called Masal in Hebrew. Again, where we have said: 'There will be no ambiguous divination,' the Seventy translate it as: 'And the soothsayer according to grace:' for which reason all have interpreted it as slippery, whereas we have said ambiguous, so that, listening to the deceiving words of their prophets, we may know them. Now the meaning of this whole chapter is: He had prophesied against the prince who was in Jerusalem, and then announced to the people that there would be famine and the burning heat of drought. Because the unbelieving multitude accepted the old and worn-out proverb: The threat of the prophets is delayed for a long time, and every vision will perish, since it is seen in vain: or according to Symmachus, it will vanish into thin air and wind. Therefore, say to them, he says, that my threat will by no means be delayed, nor will false and ambiguous divination be brought forth among the people that has an uncertain end, so that it is said at one time and fulfilled at another: but now, as long as you who speak and those who listen are alive, let the word that I have spoken be fulfilled. But it signifies the imminent captivity of the city of Jerusalem, and the imminent capture of Zedekiah with the people of Judah. Not only at that time, but even today, the unbelieving crowd and the stubborn hearts of mortals do not accept the prophecy of God: but they consider all that the prophets threaten, all that the Gospel proclaims, to be postponed to another time. And let us understand here the parable that is mentioned by the Seventy, to be taken as a proverb, according to what we read in the psalm: and I became a byword to them (Psalm 68:12). And in this same prophet: What is this parable to you in the people of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are set on edge?

<h2 id='tocuniq141'>Book Four</h2>

Book Four

I wish, if it were possible, Eustochium, to weave explanations in Ezekiel through each of the books with their own prophecies, and not to divide what is connected with prophecy by exposition: so that the course of the one dictating and the one reading would be easier; and to separate the long and immense journey of interpretation at certain intervals, as if by titles and indexes, and, to speak more properly, by arguments, to show what each book contains. But what should I do, when some prophecies are short and others long: so that often by necessity we are compelled to compress many into one book, and divide one into many? Hence now also against the prophets and prophecies, against the elders of the people of Israel and against the land upon which they are being led, we want to include in the fourth book a catalogue of the worst plagues, and also about the vine wood, which when it has been cut off, is useless among all the woods of the forest. Because it does not fit into one volume, we reserve the other part of it for the fifth volume: warning the most prudent reader's concern, so that he knows what we explain in this and what he should read.

<h2 id='tocuniq142'>(Cap. XIII.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 13, Verse 1, 2.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart: Hear the word of the Lord: Thus says the Lord God. This is what we have added: Those who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy out of their own heart, the LXX omitted, and because it is not in Hebrew, they added, and you will prophesy, and say to them. This is a message against false prophets who deceived the people and prophesied something other than what God commanded." } And let it not move anyone that they are called prophets, for holy Scripture has this custom, to designate each one of their prophecies and speeches as a prophet: just as the prophets are called Baal, and the prophets of idols, and the prophets of confusion. Hence even the apostle Paul calls a Greek poet a prophet: A certain one of their own prophets has said: Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons (Titus 1). And in Hosea we read: 'Like a prophet, a madman carrying the spirit' (Hosea 9:7). But whatever was said to the Israelite people at that time is now applied to the Church: that the holy prophets are the apostles and apostolic men. However, false and insane prophets are all heretics, whose leaders fabricate lies from their own hearts, and those who are led astray by them believe in the lies of others.

<h2 id='tocuniq143'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit and see nothing. LXX: Woe to those who prophesy from their own heart and see nothing at all, abandoning what is proposed by us, who follow their own spirit. While the name of prophets is common to both the good and the bad according to the rule of the Scriptures, they differ in that the good prophets are said to be wise, but the bad ones are foolish and ignorant. The former refers to ecclesiastical men, the latter to all heretics, who abandoning the spirit of God, follow their own spirit, for they prophesy not by divine inspiration, but from their own heart, therefore they see nothing. But the one who is wise follows not the thoughts of his own heart, but the spirit of God, as it is written in the book of Wisdom (Wisdom 9:17) 'And your counsel who has known, except you give wisdom and send your Holy Spirit from above?' And the prophet also says in another place: 'You shall walk after the Lord your God' (Psalm 27:11). And in another place: 'Lead me in a straight path' (Psalm 143:10). And again: 'Let your good spirit lead me into the land' (Psalm 143:10). And to the people of God, the pillar of fire and the cloud were guides in the wilderness (Exodus 13:21). And Jeremiah speaks: I have not labored following you (Jeremiah XVII, 16). But will not the heretic who follows his own spirit, stumble in darkness, and the blind lead the blind into the pit? Although they may seem to see more in their mysteries, or rather their orgies, than the ecclesiastical teachers, they see absolutely nothing: because they have lost the sun of justice, and in vain imitate those who were once called seers, and to whom it is said: 'Go, you who see: return into the land of Judah; and in Bethel you shall not prophesy' (Amos VII, 12, 13). Therefore, the visions of Isaiah and Obadiah are placed in the titles. And the Lord commanded the apostles: Lift up your eyes and see (John IV, 35). And the prophet humbly prays: Open my eyes, and I will contemplate the wonders of your law (Psalm CXVIII, 18).

<h2 id='tocuniq144'>(Vers. 4 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 4 and following) Your prophets, Israel, will be like foxes in the desert. You did not stand up against them or build a wall for the house of Israel to stand strong in battle on the day of the Lord. They see false visions and speak lies, saying, 'The Lord says,' when the Lord has not sent them; yet they expect their word to be confirmed. Have you not seen false visions and spoken deceptive divinations? But you say, 'The Lord declares,' when I have not spoken. LXX: Like the foxes in the deserts are your prophets, Israel ((Al. they were or will be)). They did not stand firm, but gathered flocks against the house of Israel. Those who say in the day of the Lord: seeing lies, divining vanity, who say, says the Lord, and the Lord did not send them: and they began to stir up discourse. Have you not seen a false vision, and spoken vain divinations? And you would say, says the Lord, and 124 I have not spoken. Let us first speak according to the Hebrew. The prophets of Israel are like foxes, committing daily the thefts of domestic birds: those who dwell, according to Aquila and the Septuagint, in the deserts; according to Symmachus and Theodotion, in the walls and ruins: who cannot ascend against, nor oppose a wall for the house of Israel. We read that Aaron stood in the midst against the fire devouring the people of Israel and opposed a wall for the safety of the people (Num. XVI). In the book of Jeremiah it is also written: 'Do not come before the Lord, nor stand against His anger with persistent prayer' (Jeremiah 7). Just as a wall is set up against an enemy and one usually opposes the one coming from the front: so the will of God is broken by the prayers of the saints. Hence, it is also said to Moses: 'Leave me, and I will destroy this people'. For to whom is it said: 'Leave me' (Exodus 32:10), it is shown that he has the power to hold back. These cannot stand in battle on the Lord's day, to fight for the people with prayers and resist the decrees of God with supplications. Therefore, since they see vanity and divine falsehood, and claim to be sent by the Lord when they are not sent by Him, and persist in errors, and desire to establish their own word, they are accused of preaching all things in vain, saying that their falsehood is the word of the Lord. Furthermore, according to the Septuagint, the sense here is: all heretics are like foxes because of their deceit and wickedness, about whom the Savior speaks: Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests (Matth. VIII, 20). And it is written about Herod: 'Tell that fox' (Luke 13:32). And about those same foxes that deceive the innocent and plunder the vineyard of Christ, Solomon speaks: 'Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards' (Song of Solomon 2:15). And in the psalm about those who are deceived by their treachery, it is sung: 'They shall go down into the depths of the earth, they shall be delivered into the hand of the sword, they shall become the portion of foxes' (Psalm 63:10, 11). Prophets who are like foxes did not stand in the firmament; nor did they deserve to hear with Peter: You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church (Matthew XVI, 18). Neither are they like Moses, to whom it was said: But you stand here with me (Deuteronomy V, 31). Nor like him who says: He has set my feet upon a rock; but they were tossed about by every wind of doctrine. They did not stand in the firmament, of which we read in the eighteenth psalm (125): The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament declares the works of his hands. These people gathered together the irrational ones, and because of the excessive innocence of the animals, they are like them, against the house of God. Hence now it is said: And the flocks gathered over the house of Israel: neither did they rise, nor were they able to raise others; but whatever they did and do, they are full of lies. And what follows: And they began to stir up talk, it signifies that they indeed want to rise up and lift themselves up to lofty things; but what they desire, they cannot fulfill: and it is said to them: Did you not see false vision and speak of vain divinations? And that which follows, and you were saying, 'Thus says the Lord, and I have not spoken', is not found in the Septuagint.

<h2 id='tocuniq145'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Vers. 8, 9.) Therefore thus says the Lord God: Because you have spoken in vain and have seen lies, behold, I am against you, declares the Lord God. And my hand will be against the prophets who see vanity and who divine lies. They shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord God. LXX: Therefore say: Thus says the Lord God. Because your words are lies and your divinations are empty, therefore behold, I am against you, says the Lord God, and I will stretch out my hand against the prophets who see lies and speak empty words. They shall not be in the discipline of my people, nor shall they be written in the writings of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel. And they will know that I am the Lord. Under the guise of prophets, this speech is against heretics, who speak empty words and see lies, and persist in establishing their own doctrine. May the Lord himself come against them and rise up, and stretch out his hand against them to strike them, and not hold back to spare them. He threatens that they will not be among the council of the Lord's people, nor in his Church, but in the synagogue of the devil, and not be written in the house of Israel. Of which it is said in another place: Let them be written upon the earth (Jeremiah 17:13): not upon the land of Israel, which is the land of the living, of which it is now said, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel; but upon the land of the dead and the shadow of death, so that after they have suffered these things, separated from the assembly of the people of God, they may understand that he himself is the Lord. For what we translate as 'they shall not be in the council of my people,' the Septuagint translated as 'they shall not be in the discipline or correction of my people.' For there is one kind of correction for adversaries and another for sons. Hence, Jeremiah also says, 'Chastise us, O Lord, but with judgment, not in your anger, lest you make us few in number. Pour out your anger on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not invoke your name.' (Jeremiah X, 24, 25).

<h2 id='tocuniq146'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 onwards) They have deceived my people, saying: peace, and there is no peace. And he himself was building a wall: but they were plastering it with mud without straw. Say to those who plaster without mortar, that it will fall. There will be a flooding rain, and I will give large stones falling from above, and a stormy wind shall scatter them. Indeed, behold, the wall has fallen. Will it not be said to you, where is the plaster that you plastered? Therefore, thus says the Lord God: I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in my fury, and there shall be a flooding rain in my anger, and great hailstones in fury to consume. And I will break down the  wall that you have plastered with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare. And it shall fall, and you shall be consumed in the midst of it. And you shall know that I am the Lord. Thus will I satisfy my wrath upon the wall, and upon those who have plastered it with whitewash. And I will say to you: The wall is no more, nor those who plastered it. The prophets of Israel who prophesy to Jerusalem and see a vision of peace, but there is no peace, says the Lord God. LXX: For they have deceived my people, saying, 'Peace, peace,' when there is no peace. And one builds a wall, and they plaster it with whitewash. Say to those who plaster it with whitewash, it will fall. There will be overflowing rain, and I will bring great stones upon their joints, and they will fall. And a destructive wind will come and it will be torn down. And behold, the wall has fallen, and they will not ask you, 'Where is the whitewash that you plastered?' Therefore thus says the Lord God: 127 And I will break the spirit that carries away in my fury, and there will be a flood of rain in my anger, and I will bring in great stones in my fury to complete the destruction, and I will dig down the wall that you have plastered, and it will fall. And I will lay it bare on the ground, and its foundations will be exposed, and it will fall. And you will be consumed in my fury, and you will know that I am the Lord. And I will vent my anger against the wall, and against those who plaster it, it will fall. And I said to you: There is no wall, nor those who plaster it, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem and see visions of peace for her: there will be no peace for them, says the Lord God. The prophets of Israel, who will not be in the council of the people of God, nor will be written in the scripture of the house of Israel, nor will enter the land of promise, they will suffer these things, because they deceived my people, proclaiming peace and prosperity without true repentance and conversion, according to what is said elsewhere: Peace, peace, where is the peace? (Jeremiah 8:11) Therefore, God metaphorically built for them a wall through the commandments of the law and the words and threats of the holy prophets. For this Hebrew word signifies these things: that it would ward off every incursion of wild beasts and hostile attack from them, while they turned to God, and were encompassed as it were by a wall and most firm barrier. But the false prophets promised them peace, not once only, but frequently: for this repeated word peace signifies. And these false prophets would build this wall, which is called 'Cir' in what follows, with untempered mortar, as Symmachus has interpreted, that is, with pure mud, and which would not have straw, so as neither to afford any strength. But indeed, LXX and Theodotion leave it in folly: but Aquila, interpreting the Hebrew word Thaphel as ἀνάλῳ, which means without salt, passing from one translation to another, just as food without salt has no flavor, so too clay without straw, which gives it strength and binds it, cannot provide any strength to the wall. Say, he says, to those who promise them vain things and offer empty help, that this wall and this barrier will fall, and I will send a very heavy rain, namely the most fierce enemies. But it signifies the Babylonians and the Chaldeans; and it metaphorically refers to the same hailstones rushing down from above, in order to depict a sudden whirlwind that overturns and demolishes an unstable wall; and afterwards it is said to them, that is, to the false prophets, Where is the plaster which you smoothed over, and where is the help which you promised? Moreover, whatever we have said about false prophets can also be applied to heretics, because all their fabrications are dissolved by the anger of God; and the edifice of false doctrines, which the Holy Spirit does not support, crumbles, and collapses down to its foundations and is reduced to dust, and it is leveled to the very earth, and it falls, and the prophets who made the promises are consumed, and the people to whom the promises were made are consumed along with them: so that after God has fully vented His anger and said to them: this wall is not, that is, it is not your defense; and there are none who plaster it, but everything is empty and will achieve nothing: then you will know by these actions that I am the Lord. But so that we may know who those are who plaster the wall, it follows, the prophets of Israel, that is, the false prophets, who prophesy to Jerusalem and see a vision of peace for her. These are the cause of sin and destruction and foolish security. For there will be no peace, says the Lord, because the Lord did not send them, nor did He speak to them. This, which the LXX translated as 'and over their joints,' is not found in the Hebrew. It signifies, however, the joints of stones in the wall or the supports of wood by which the walls are strengthened. And also that which we read above: he himself was building a wall; many report to the people of Israel, who promised themselves vainly, either the help of the Egyptians, or peace.

<h2 id='tocuniq147'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 17 and following) And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy from their own hearts. Prophesy against them and say, 'Thus says the Lord God: Woe to those who sew magic charms on all wrists and make veils for the heads of people of every height, in order to ensnare souls. They even ensnare the souls of my people while they seek their own gain. They have violated me among my people for a handful of barley and a piece of bread, killing souls that should not die and keeping alive souls that should not live, by lying to my people who listen to lies.' Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against your cushions, with which you hunt the souls of the flying ones, and I will tear them off your arms, and I will release the souls that you hunt, souls for flying. And I will tear off your necklaces, and I will set my people free from your hand, and they shall no longer be in your hands for plunder. And you shall know that I am the Lord. Because you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad, and have strengthened the hands of the wicked, so that he does not turn from his evil way and live, therefore you shall no longer see false visions or practice divination. I will deliver my people out of your hand. And you shall know that I am the Lord. LXX: And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy against them, and say, 'Thus says the Lord God: Woe to the women who sew magic charms on their sleeves and make veils for the heads of people of every height, in order to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of My people, and keep yourselves alive? And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, killing people who should not die, and keeping people alive who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies?'" } Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against your pillows, with which you hunt down souls, and I will tear them from your arms, and I will let the souls go, even the souls that you hunt to scatter. I will also tear your veils and deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall no longer be in your hand to be hunted; then you shall know that I am the Lord. Because you have perverted the righteous with your lies, and I have not caused him grief, and you have strengthened the hands of the wicked, so that he does not turn from his wicked way to save his life." } Therefore, you will no longer see your lies, and you will not divine any more divinations yet. And I will deliver my people from your hand, and you will know that I am the Lord. Above, the divine word was directed to the prophets, who lined the wall with mud, as it did not have straw, nor could it give any strength to the wall or the wall. Now, it is commanded to the prophetesses of the people to put, or direct, their faces, and, as the Septuagint translated, to strengthen. On the other hand, just as false prophets were inspired by a diabolical spirit to subvert the commands of God, so against prophetesses, such as Deborah (Judges 5) and Huldah (2 Kings 22), and in the Acts of the Apostles, the four daughters of Philip the evangelist who prophesied were inspired by a demonic spirit (Acts 21), as were others of the same sex, among whom were Prisca and Maximilla, who undermined faith in the truth with their false prophecies. But the Hebrews, however, say that they have been instructed in the arts of magic through necromancy and the spirit of Python, such as the one that was seen raising the soul of Samuel (1 Kings 28); and in the Acts of the Apostles, there was a diviner who gained much profit for her masters, from whom the unclean spirit was cast out by the command of the apostle Paul (Acts 16). But we will say this, that other heretics preach the power of their false teachings. Of whom there were Pythagoras and Zeno, from whom the Stoics; also the Brahmins of the Indians, and the Gymnosophists of the Ethiopians, who, because of their abstinence from food, are considered a wonder by their nations. They are rightly said to whitewash the wall and promise some kind of strength; but because they do not have the seasoning of Christ, their labor is in vain and their building will perish. For unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain (Psalm 127:1). Other doctors of pleasures and desires, are said to use pillows and to place their hands under every elbow, like the Epicureans and the Pyrrhonists, and among us Jovinianus and Eunomius, who say: Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. Therefore, the prophet is commanded to set or harden his face against the daughters of his people. And first it must be said, what the set or hardened face signifies. Namely, that which is written about the Lord: The face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to cut off their memory from the earth (Psalm 33:17). For just as wax melts before the face of fire, so the sinners perish before the face of God. According to this meaning, the prophet also says in the same context: Son of man, set your face against Teman and Dara and Negeb. And again: The word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face against the sons of Jerusalem. And a little later: The word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face against the sons of Ammon. And again: Firm your face upon Pharaoh the king of Egypt (below, XXIX, 2). And again: Son of man, firm your face upon Gog and Magog. And in another place: I will firm my face upon that man, and I will place him in the desert, and in destruction, and I will take him away from the midst of the people: and you will know that I am the Lord (below, XIV, 8). Therefore, woe to these heresies, and to these teachings, which deceive all ages and sexes, promising rest, in order to capture the souls of the wretched and to defile me to my people, while I am believed to love pleasure: and this not because of their, and their half-heartedness, as we read in Hosea (Hosea V), but because of a handful of barley, by which animals are made foolish, and a fragment of bread. Not whole bread, nor solid testimonies of the Scriptures, but those which have been broken, and diminished and cut off by heretical depravity; in order to deceive and lead astray even the holy ones, and to drag them to death; and they contend that they can give life to sinners with empty promises. Therefore, the merciful and compassionate God does not kill the prophetesses themselves, but breaks their snares, which like nets, capture flying souls, so that after they have been broken, they have the free ability to fly. And they would tear the veils or necklaces in which the principal part of the soul reclined and by which the heads of the deceivers were covered. For the Apostle teaches that the heads of men should not be veiled, but rather that they should gaze upon the revealed face of the glory of the Lord (2 Corinthians 3). For you, he says, were breaking the spirits of those who served God with false terrors, and you were keeping the wicked enclosed with deceitful promises, so that while they were not repenting, they would not receive the life which they had lost. Therefore, you will by no means see empty visions, nor will I call your lies prophecies; but divinations, of which it is written: There is no sorcery in Jacob, nor divination in Israel (Num. XXIII, 23): so that I may deliver my people from your hands, and you may come to know that I am the Lord who has saved the lost.

<h2 id='tocuniq148'>(Cap. XIV.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 14, Verse 1 and following) And the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, these men have set their abominations in their hearts and have set the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. Will I be inquired of by them? Therefore speak to them and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Every man of the house of Israel who sets his abominations in his heart and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet, I the Lord will answer him according to the multitude of his abominations, that I may lay hold of the house of Israel in their own hearts, because they have all turned away from me to their idols. Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Repent and turn away from your idols, and turn your faces away from all your abominations. For everyone, whether he is of the house of Israel or of the foreigners residing in Israel, who has alienated himself from Me and has set idols in his heart and placed the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and who comes to the prophet to inquire of Me through him: I, the Lord, will answer him Myself.' And I will set my face against that man, and will make him a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people: and ye shall know that I am the LORD. And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him; that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD. LXX: And men from the elders of Israel came to me and sat before me. And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: 133 Son of man, these men have set their thoughts in their hearts, and have set the torment of their iniquities before their face: shall I answer them when they inquire? Therefore speak to them, and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Every man of the house of Israel who sets his thoughts in his heart, and sets the torment of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet to inquire of him concerning me, I the Lord will answer him according to the multitude of his thoughts: that the house of Israel may be prevented from straying in their hearts, which have gone away from me with their thoughts. Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: Repent, and turn from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations. For any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me and sets up idols in his heart and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet to inquire of him concerning me, I the Lord will answer him myself. And I will set my face against that man; I will make him a sign and a byword and cut him off from the midst of my people, and you shall know that I am the Lord." } And if a prophet should err and speak a word, I the Lord have caused that prophet to err. And I will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. And they will bear their iniquity according to the iniquity of the inquirer, and the iniquity of the prophet will be likewise, so that the house of Israel may not stray from me, and they may not still be polluted with all their transgressions. And they will be to me a people, and I will be to them a God, says the Lord God. After he had spoken to the prophets who prophesied in their hearts and lined the wall without restraint; and to the prophetesses who used to wear veils and put their hands under every elbow, and made coverings and covered the heads of the whole age (through which the teaching of perverse doctrines is shown), they came to the prophet, not all of the elders, lest they all seem to err; but some of the elders of Israel, and they sat before the prophet: for what reason they had come, differing in silence; and immediately the word of God came to the prophet, indicating why they were present. For it is not the nature of man, however holy, to know the secrets of the heart. Hence it is said of the Savior alone: And Jesus seeing their thoughts, said: Why do you think evil in your hearts? (Matthew IX). And the meaning is: Son of man, these men who sit before you have placed their uncleanness in their hearts, or their thoughts; and, according to Symmachus and Theodotion, idols and scandal, that is, the ruin and torment of their wickedness, they have placed against their own face, and thus they came to inquire the word of the Lord. Should I respond to such people who come to me with their previous thoughts, not even leaving behind their impious deeds during this time, but believing in idols and fraudulent divinations, harboring the destruction of wickedness against their own face and torment, while despairing of better things and being prepared for punishment, and thus desiring to know my words through you? Therefore, because they have come to you with a perverse heart, you shall not respond to them in your own person, lest the authority of the respondent be seen as trivial; but you shall respond to them by my command, and you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God. But the overall meaning of the passage, to summarize in a brief explanation, is this: A person is not from any other nations, whose errors may be forgiven, but from the house of Israel. This person, with their previous vices that we have mentioned earlier, comes to inquire of the prophet. I will respond to them according to their heart, and according to their impurities, so that they may hear in accordance with what they desire and believe. For someone who asks not with the intention to learn, but with the intention to test, does not deserve correction. For they have departed from me and have followed idols. And this is a short warning, that they should depart from idolatrous thoughts and perverse intentions, and turn to me, leaving behind their previous (or rather, their own) sins. For he who deceitfully asks questions does not deserve to hear the truth, but should be captivated by his own heart, just as the Scribes and Pharisees, who questioned (or rather, tested) the Lord, heard: Why do you test me? And again: Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things (Matthew 21:27). But whoever is such a person, and asks in this way, God places his face upon him, or affirms; so that by the severity of his countenance, the hardness of his forehead may be softened, and he may serve as an example, and as a proverb, or for solitude, and for destruction, so that with him being lost from the people of God, others may know that he himself is the Lord who knows the secrets of the heart and understands the wickedness of the mind; he does not consider the words of those who speak, but their hearts. And that which follows seems to raise the question: When a prophet errs and speaks a word, 'I, the Lord, have deceived that prophet,' we cannot call him a true prophet, but a false prophet, who is called a prophet in a secondary sense. And this can be explained by that passage of Scripture, when King Ahab of Israel went to battle, he did not want to listen to the prophet Micaiah, but he followed the advice of the false prophets (3 Kings 22). And Michael said that he saw the Lord sitting on a throne, and the spirit of error offered itself to deceive the king. The devil is also said to go around the earth in the book of Job, and is said to stand in the sight of God and to have power over Job's substance and then over his body (Job 1 and 2). And Balaam the diviner is also sent by the Lord to deceive Balak the son of Beor (Numbers 22). But all of this is said so that the strength of false prophets is not esteemed, that the people may be deceived, and they would rather hear lies than accommodate their ear to truth. But it is because of God's wrath that the wicked and unbelieving people listen more to false prophets than to true prophets. Finally, he extends his hand over him, understood as the prophet, and removes him from the midst of his people, so that he may bear his iniquity, for similar error and similar punishment. In this way, both the one who asks and the one who is asked may bear their iniquity, and the house of Israel, those who have desired to hear the words of God, may not be deceived by false prophecies. Instead, may they be the people of God and deserve to have the Lord. In that which he said: I, the Lord, have deceived him, the words of Solomon agree, who, when speaking about God, says: He will mock the mockers (Prov. III, 34): and this is also a testimony: If the wicked have walked before me; and I will walk against them in perverse fury (Lev. XXVI, 27, 28). And that which is said secondly, man of the children of Israel, and strangers who are joined to them, shows in us, according to the Apostle, the double man, external and internal (I Cor. XV). For many, indeed, having the physical form of a man, they assume the images of various beasts, which the prophet, desiring to scatter, begs: Lord, in your city you will scatter their image (Psalm 72:20). Concerning those of whom it is written: Man, though in honor, does not understand, he is compared with foolish animals and has become like them (Psalm 49:21), they are not men, but men are beasts. Again, those who hear in the Gospel, 'You brood of vipers, how can you escape the coming wrath?' (Matthew 23:33) They are not men but serpents. And about whom it is written, ‘Foxes have dens and birds have nests’ (Matthew 8:20). And about Herod, 'Go tell that fox' (Luke 13:32), they are not men but foxes. But those who possess both the name of man, if they wander, are corrected by punishments so that they understand that He Himself is the Lord. Moreover, what we have also placed according to the LXX: "A man who has been alienated from me and has placed his thoughts in his heart, and torment, or punishment for his wrongdoing before his face, it is testified to him that which is written in Isaiah: 'Walk in the light of your fire, and in the flame that you have kindled' (Isaiah 50:11). For each person kindles the fires of his own desires, and prepares punishments, while he does not want to correct the error with repentance, but remains in errors, deserving the fire of flames.


<h2 id='tocuniq149'>(Vers. 12, 13 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 12, 13 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, when the land sins against me by acting faithlessly, I will stretch out my hand over it, and break the staff of its bread, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast. Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver only themselves by their righteousness, says the Lord God. But if I bring upon that land the worst beasts to lay waste to it and it becomes impassable because of the beasts, and these three men are in it, as I live, says the Lord (add: God), they will not deliver sons or daughters, but they alone will be delivered; but the land will be desolate. Or if I bring a sword upon that land and say, ‘Let the sword pass through the land, and I kill men and animals from it,’ and these three men are in the midst of it, as I live, says the Lord God, they will not deliver sons or daughters, but they alone will be delivered. But if I bring a pestilence upon that land, and pour out my indignation upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, declares the Lord God, they would deliver neither son nor daughter. They would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness. For thus says the Lord God: Even if I cause harmful judgments of sword, famine, wild beasts, and pestilence to come to Jerusalem, to cut off from it man and beast, yet behold, some survivors will be left in it, sons and daughters who will be brought out; behold, when they come out to you, and you see their ways and their deeds, you will be consoled for the disaster that I have brought upon Jerusalem, for all that I have brought upon it. Behold, they themselves will go out to you, and you will see their way and their inventions, and you will be consoled for the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem in all that I have imposed upon it. And you will be comforted when you see their way and their inventions, and you will know that I have not done all that I have done in vain, says the Lord God. Four plagues will be brought upon the sinful land, or as the Septuagint has translated, the land of sinners: famine, beast, sword, pestilence. If each of these plagues is brought in parts to each region, and these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, whose righteousness is proclaimed in the words of Scripture, will pray for the sinful land, they will not only be unable to save it, but not even their sons and daughters, if they commit the works of the sinful land; they will only be able to save themselves. It is asked why only Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and other righteous patriarchs and prophets are mentioned, since there were surely others of the same virtue. This is easily explained: Noah, because a great flood was imminent and the whole earth had defiled the ways of the Lord, could not prevent it, but he had his sons, who perhaps were of the same virtue, preserved for the propagation of the human race. Daniel also mitigated the imminent captivity of the Jewish people with no tears (Dan. 1). But Job, not because of sins, but because of testing, did not free his house or his children (Job. 1). Others, however, say that these three men alone witnessed both prosperity and adversity, and then prosperity again: and for this reason they are mentioned together; and this is subtly signified, so that just as those men saw both good and evil, and then joy again: so the people of Israel, who had previously enjoyed good things, and later endured the yoke of captivity, if they repent, may return to their former happiness. But if Noah and Daniel and Job were gathered together and placed in one place, they could not shield the sinful earth, that is, those who dwell on the earth, from the wrath of God. What then can be said of those who believe that through the merits of their parents and virtues, sinful children can be freed from the fires of hell? Hence, neither a sinful son (or rather, a transgressor) can be freed by a righteous father, nor can a chaste mother of good conduct bestow rewards of chastity upon her unchaste daughter. And on the contrary, the vices of parents will not harm their children; but the soul that sins, it shall die (Ezekiel 18:20). Lot, while living in Sodom, saved not only his wife but also his daughters, who perhaps had not sinned (Genesis 19). And the holy man Josiah, not only did he not save the sinful people with his virtues, but he himself died in their sins (2 Kings 23:30). But if at any time the Lord promises his mercy to their descendants because of Abraham and David, it should be noted that he does not spare those who persist in their wickedness, but rather those who repent, so that the conduct of the children might benefit from the merit of their fathers. When, he says, these things are so, and the sinful land is not saved from the punishments of such great men by prayers for mercy, thus says the Lord God: because Jerusalem has committed abominable sins, I will bring upon it four plagues at once: the sword, by which it is slain by enemies; and famine, which it endures during the siege; and beasts, which devour those who flee into the deserts and woods; and pestilence, which always follows hunger and scarcity. But the Vulgate edition translated death for her. He says, "I will bring these things upon her, so that neither men nor animals remain in her." Yet, out of my mercy, I will leave some in her who will raise their sons and daughters, and let the captives come here, that is, to Babylon and Chaldea, so that when you see them and perceive their works, you may understand that they were justly captured and that my judgment was just, and let your captivity bring you consolation. For it is through understanding that I have freed them from sword, famine, beasts, and pestilence, so that you may learn from their wickedness the reason why Jerusalem was destroyed, the temple burned down, and the people led captive, except for those whom the sword, famine, beasts, and pestilence have consumed." 139} These things were said about that Jerusalem, of which Ezekiel prophesied among the Chaldeans, captivity was drawing near. Furthermore, also upon our land, to which it is said: You are dust, and to dust you shall return (Gen. III, 19); and upon our Jerusalem, and upon each of the believers, if they have despised God's commandments and have become transgressors, famine will be brought upon them; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the word of God. The sword shall be brought forth, of which we read: They shall be delivered into the hands of the sword: the parts of foxes were (or will be). (Psalm 63:11). And to Mary: A sword shall also pierce through your own soul. (Luke 2:35). The beasts shall be brought forth, for whom it is asked that the righteous man not be delivered: Do not deliver the soul of the one who confesses to you to the beasts. (Psalm 73:19). The plague shall be brought forth (which seventy interpreters have translated as death), of which it is written: The worst death is the death of sinners. (Psalm 34:22). And: The soul that sins, it shall die. And if bitter death separates in this way? Concerning all these things, neither the teaching of spiritual parents, whom we understand as teachers, nor the rulers will be able to deliver, unless there is agreement from the sons, and their pleas have helped their efforts. For the righteousness of the righteous will be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked will dwell within him: Each one will die for their own sin, and their righteousness will save them. And the Jews say in vain: Abraham is our father (John VIII), when they do not have the works of Abraham. But if there is any confidence, let us only trust in the Lord. For cursed is every man who has hope in man (Jeremiah XVII, 5), even if they are holy, even if they are prophets. We read: Do not trust in men (Psalm CXLV, 2). And again: It is good to trust in the Lord, rather than to trust in princes (Psalm CXVII, 6). Not only in secular rulers, but also in the rulers of the Churches, those who are just will only save their own souls. However, they will not be able to save the sons and daughters whom they have begotten in the Church if they are negligent. And yet the Apostle says: If anyone's work is burned up, he himself will be saved, but only as through fire (1 Corinthians 3:15). But the hand is stretched out over the earth, which is given over to transgression, so that the rod or strength of bread may be crushed. She threatens with outstretched plagues, unwillingly extended by those who extend her, and she raises (them) to strike sinners, but (she does it) to frighten with extension, and to preserve the frightened.

<h2 id='tocuniq150'>(Cap. XV.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 15, Verses 1 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, what will be made of the vine tree among all the trees of the woods that are among the trees of the forest? Will wood be taken from it to make something, or will a peg be made from it to hang any vessel on? Behold, it is given to the fire as food; the fire has consumed both ends of it, and the middle of it has been turned into ashes. Will it be useful for any work? Even though it was intact, it was not suitable for work: how much more so when the fire has consumed and burned it, will nothing come of its work? Therefore, thus says the Lord God: As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for consumption, so I will give the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will set my face against them. They will come out from the fire, and the fire will consume them. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them and make the land desolate and deserted, because they have been rebellious, says the Lord God. Regarding the interpretation that we have provided: both parts of it were consumed by fire, and half of it was reduced to ashes. The Seventy translated: The annual purification consumes it by fire, and it is released at the end. Again, where we said: When I turn my face towards them, they turned it, when I become stiff-necked. They also interpreted transgression as a betrayal. Moreover, through various similitudes, which the Greeks call parables, the destruction of the city of Jerusalem is foretold. And just as above (in chapter IV), the siege and famine of the same city are described, in which a pan was used to cool the meat of the people, and on the side where the fortifications and the mounds of battering rams and siege engines were painted, and afterwards we read about it here: it is also written in Jeremiah (Jeremiah I, 13), 'The pot that is boiling in the face of the north wind signifies the city of Jerusalem'; and the cuts of the Negev, and Teman, and Darom, signify the same thing: thus in the present passage, the same Jerusalem is compared to fruitful vineyards and vines. Of which it is written elsewhere: I have planted you a fertile vine, all true: how have you turned into the bitterness of a strange vine? (Jerem. II, 21.) And in Isaiah: I have planted, he says, a choice vine (Isai. V, 2), which signifies both choice and beautiful. And in the Psalms we read: You have brought a vine out of Egypt: you have cast out the nations, and have planted it: you were the leader of its journey (Psal. LXXIX, 9). And we learn more clearly, Scripture saying: But the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel (Isai. V, 7). As long as this vineyard produces fruit, there is nothing more valuable than it among all the trees of the forest; but if it ceases to bear grapes, it will be useless in every way, except to be handed over to the fire along with its roots and branches. The other trees of the forests (not to mention the fruit-bearing trees, of which Scripture makes no mention at this time) may not have fruit, but when cut down, they offer great utility for all of agriculture and the use of weapons: they are made into shields, shaved into spears, used for doors, contained in chests, barrels, and provide all the household furnishings. But if the vine once ceases to produce grapes, it is so useless that not even a peg can be made from it to hang something on. And when you remove the small hammers, the fire first seizes both parts of them, then the flame consumes them: and it is of so little advantage when it has been reduced to ashes, that even when it is intact, it provides no usefulness without fruits. However, there is ambiguity in the Hebrew word Sene (), which is written with three letters, Sin and Nun and Yod; if it is read as Sene, it means two; if it is read as Sane, it means years. And it came to pass that for its two extremities, which we have interpreted as both parts of it, the Seventy interpreted as its annual purgation: when Aquila said, its two last things; Symmachus to Theodotion, its two extremities. And the order is this: Just as a fruitless vine is handed over to fire for no usefulness: so too Jerusalem, indeed its inhabitants will be handed over to burnings, so that they may go out from the fire, and fire may consume them, that is, even if they escape from the city, they will be consumed outside by the enemy's sword; and those who remain, pressed down by the weight of miseries, will recognize that I am the Lord: when I set or harden my face against them, and deliver them into eternal desolation. For sinners are not like other peoples, but they have become transgressors. For it is one thing to neglect what you do not know: it is another to despise what you have worshipped. We can understand the vineyard and Jerusalem in a spiritual sense, to mean the multitude of believers. And if it is neglected and loses the cultivation of its ancient religion, and does not bring forth the fruits of virtue, nor produce the wine that gladdens the heart of man, it will be handed over to eternal burnings and considered as nothing. For the servant who knows his master's will and does not do it, he will be beaten with many blows (Luke 12:47). Something similar the Lord speaks in the Gospel according to John: I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit (John 15:2). Indeed, the Savior is the vine, and we are the branches, and God (also called the Father) is the vinedresser. As long as we keep God's commandments, we are always being cultivated and our cultivation is a purification: For it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy (Romans 9:16). But if we bring forth fruit, we are pruned by the Father, so that we may bring forth more abundant fruit. It is shown that all our effort, with the help of God, reaches its end and bears the fruit of fullness. But whoever does not bear fruit, will be taken away by the Father. And when he is taken away, Scripture does not say what the Father does with him, unless perhaps separation from Christ's body is an everlasting punishment and destruction. What we have understood in the vineyard and the vine, the Savior teaches under a different figure in the Gospel: Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its taste, it is useless, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. (Mark 9:49). And if the eye that illuminates the whole body is blind, it can hear from the Lord: If the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness (Matthew 6:23, 13)? For in comparison to the transgressor and the one who denies God at first, the punishment is lighter for those who have never known God. And the trees of the woods or forests, according to the variety of believers, have some usefulness in a great house; in which there are not only golden and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthenware ones; some for honor and others for dishonor (2 Timothy 2).


<h2 id='tocuniq151'>(Cap. XVI.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter XVI - Verses 1, 2) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, make known Jerusalem its abominations, and you shall say: Thus says the Lord God to Jerusalem. Septuagint: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, testify against Jerusalem its iniquities, and you shall say to her: Thus says the Lord Adonai. In these verses, the summary of each prophecy was brief, so we have included the entire chapters, immediately following. But because the discourse is directed towards Jerusalem, testifying and teaching about the sins that she has committed; and it extends almost to the number of two hundred verses, until that place where it is written: When I have been appeased to you in all that you have done, says the Lord God, we must put every prophecy in parts; and we must join fitting explanations to those things which we have proposed. Under the person of a harlot woman who was first joined in the company of men, Jerusalem and her origin, and upbringing, and puberty, and marriage, and adultery, and divorce, and again restoration are intertwined; so that both the kindness and judgment of the man, and the crimes of the adulteress and harlot may be known, while after all the punishments he raises up to her an everlasting covenant: so that she may remember her iniquity, and may be confounded, and may no longer have the mouth open because of her own confusion, when he has been appeased to her in all that she has done. For it is very profitable for sinners to know what they have done. Hence the penitent speaks: For I know my iniquity, and my sin is always before me (Psalm 50:4). However, Jerusalem can be understood in four ways: Either as that which was burnt by the fire of the Babylonians and Romans; or as the heavenly Jerusalem; or as the Church, which is interpreted as the vision of peace; or as the souls of individuals who, by faith, behold God. And what many think should be interpreted as the heavenly Jerusalem, the Church does not accept, lest we be compelled to interpret all the things contained in the present prophecy as referring to the ruins and torments of heavenly powers, and their restoration to their original state.


<h2 id='tocuniq152'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) Your lineage and generation are from the land of Canaan (Vulgate: Chanaea). Your father is Amorite, and your mother is Hittite. Great is the faith and grand the audacity of the prophets, accusing one man, the whole city of ignobility. Marvelous is Daniel, who dared to speak to a aged sinner, joining adultery with murder, saying: 'The seed of Canaan, not Judah, has deceived you' (Dan. 13:56). Magnificent is Isaiah, who cries out to the princes and people of Judah: 'Hear the word of the Lord, O princes of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, O people of Gomorrah' (Isa. 1:10)." } But not lesser is Ezekiel, who speaks confidently to the whole city: Your root and your lineage are from the land of Canaan: your father is Amorite and your mother is Hittite. Although Stephen, the first martyr of the Gospel, spoke to the insane people (Acts 7:51): You resist always the Holy Spirit with stiff neck and uncircumcised heart (or you resist always, [as] other versions say). And though we may understand that the root of Jerusalem and its lineage are the land of Canaan, according to what is said that the people was called in Egypt and lived there for a long time (for Ham, the father of Canaan, was the chief of the Egyptian nation), nevertheless, according to the likeness of their crimes, we will say that the root of Jerusalem is the land of Egypt: Whence its father is also called Amorite, which is interpreted as ‘multo sermone celebratus’ (celebrated with much speech). And your mother Chethaea, that is, being out of her mind; either she herself is insane or she sends others into insanity. For everyone who commits sin is born of the devil (John 8:54). Therefore, throughout the whole world, this famous name of the ancient father exists, and it turns many into insanity. And it is commanded to Jerusalem, either according to the literal sense or according to the spiritual sense, to abandon the ancient father, and it is said to her: Listen, daughter, and see, and incline your ear; and forget your people, and your father's house; and the king will desire your beauty (Psalm 44:11). And it is promised to him that if he truly desires to return to the true Father after sin: I will restore you as you were when you were born. Whose nobility is so great, that the city of Jerusalem, which descended from the lineage of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, had God as its Father? And yet because he sinned and abandoned the true parent, he deserves to hear: Your root and your generation are from the land of Canaan: Your father is Amorite, and your mother is Hittite. If she heard this, what will happen to us who are called from the filth of the nations, having washed away every stain in the bath of the Savior, if we defile the garment of Christ and do not have the wedding garment at the banquet? Certainly, let us be handed over to eternal burnings, with our hands and feet bound, in which there is weeping of the eyes and gnashing of teeth (Matthew 22).

<h2 id='tocuniq153'>145 (Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

145 (Vers. 4, 5.) And when you were born, on the day of your birth your umbilical cord was not cut, and you were not washed in water for cleansing, nor were you rubbed with salt, nor were you wrapped in swaddling cloths. No eye had pity on you, to do any of these things for you out of compassion: but you were thrown out on the open field, for the abjection of your life, on the day you were born. LXX: And on the day you were born, they did not bind your breasts, and your umbilical cord was not cut, and you were not washed in water for cleansing, nor were you rubbed with salt, and you were not wrapped in swaddling cloths. No eye had pity on you, to do any of these things for you, and no one had mercy on you, and you were thrown out on the open field, in the corruption of your soul, on the day you were born. Let us discuss the order of reading about each. When Jerusalem was born from the father of the Amorite and the mother of the Hittite, and was poured out from the womb, her umbilicus was not cut, by which the fetus is nourished in the womb like trees and branches, which are nourished by the hidden moisture of the earth through their roots. And just as the seed of men is signified in the loins, so the female genitals are called umbilicus in honorable speech according to the custom of the Scriptures, as testified by Job, who speaks figuratively of the Devil as a dragon: His power is in his loins, and his strength is in the navel of his belly (Job 40:11). For this ancient serpent, called the devil and Satan, who deceived the world, has power over men in the loins, and over women in the belly. But this signifies about Jerusalem: that it did not immediately receive the law, nor were the beginnings of its shameful birth cut off from it: but it first lived a Gentile life; for which reason the Seventy translated: On the day you were born, your breasts were not bound (Ezek. 7), having this holy Scripture custom, that it may use the word 'heart', 'bosom' or 'breasts' according to each appropriate context. Priests in whom there must be teaching, and they require the law from their mouth, receive a small chest. John lies on the chest of the Lord in order to draw from the most abundant fountain the streams of wisdom. In the Song of Songs, the Virgin has two breasts, like two twin kids of a she-goat, which feed on lilies until the day breathes and the shadows are cast away. The loving mother immediately binds her daughter's breasts as soon as she is born, so that they cease from tender swelling and preserve virgin beauty. But when she reaches the age of puberty, it will be said of her: Will the bride forget her adornment, or the virgin her waistband? (Jeremiah II, 32) It follows: And you have not been washed in water for your salvation. The bodies of newborn infants, as soon as they are expelled from the womb, are usually washed: so too does the spiritual generation need the saving bath. For no one is clean from filth, not even if his life were of only one day. (Job XXVI, 14, 15). And in the Psalms we read: 'In iniquities I was conceived, and in sins my mother conceived me' (Psalm 50:7). The second birth cancels out the first birth. For it is written: 'Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God' (John 3:5). There are many washings which the Gentiles have in their mysteries, and the heretics promise: they all wash, but they do not wash unto salvation. Therefore it is added: 'and in which you were not washed unto salvation.' This can be understood not only about heretics, but also about members of the Church who do not receive baptism with full faith for salvation. It should be said about them that they have received water, but they have not received the Spirit. Just like Simon Magus, who tried to buy God's grace with money, he was indeed baptized in water, but he was not baptized for salvation. Thirdly, it is said: it is not salted with salt. When the tender bodies of infants still retain the warmth of the womb and first declare the beginnings of their laborious life with cries, they are usually rubbed with salt by midwives, so that they become drier and more compact. Furthermore, Jerusalem, which was born of wicked parents, has achieved nothing of taste, nothing of diligence. But those who are reborn in Christ, it is said to them: You are the salt of the earth (Matth. V, 5); and it is commanded to them by the Apostle: Let your speech always be seasoned with grace (Coloss. IV, 6). Hence, both wise people and fools are called tasteless. And in the Book of Leviticus it is decreed by the law: Your every sacrifice shall be seasoned with salt. The salt of the Testament of the Lord will not cease from your sacrifices: in all your offerings you shall offer salt (Leviticus II, 13). Whoever has been seasoned with this salt and has dried up every rotten and harmful moisture by its mixture, will no longer say: My wounds have putrefied and become corrupted from the face of my foolishness (Psalm XXXVII, 6). I know that I have read in a certain volume about the Lord Savior, that he himself is the heavenly salt; and not only does he season earthly and infernal things, but he also shares his flavor with heavenly things: so that what is written may be fulfilled: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will (Luke II, 14). The fourth thing is: to be not wrapped in swaddling clothes. And the Savior was wrapped in swaddling clothes as an infant, and everyone who is born needs God's protection through the wrapping of cloth. It is natural, however, that when parents are not lacking in care, the umbilical cord of newly born infants is first cut off, then they are washed with water to cleanse the blood. Thirdly, the moisture of the little bodies is dried by adding salt. Fourthly, so that the tender bodies of infants are wrapped in swaddling clothes for two reasons: so that the body, which is dried with salt, does not leak through the clothes, is preserved and tightened; and to prevent the most delicate limbs from easily becoming deformed. And even the bodies of the Barbarians are healthier than Roman bodies. Until the second and third year, they are always wrapped in swaddling clothes. But not such is Jerusalem, whose navel is not cut, nor are her breasts bound, nor is she washed with water for her health, nor is she salted with salt, nor is she swaddled and constrained by the garments of infancy. But why has she deserved none of these things? The following Scripture testifies. The eye has not spared you, to make one of them for you, having mercy on you. For which reason the seventy made this translation: Your eye has not spared you, in order that I might make one out of all these. And it is necessary that the double edition have a double understanding. The prior one signifies this: Your eye has not spared you, in order to make one of these out of pity for you. And the sense is: No one has had pity on you, offending God; no one's bowels have been moved on your behalf, that at least one of the four might be made for you; because you did not deserve to receive all at once. In another it is said: Your eye did not spare you, so that I may have mercy on you. And this is its meaning: You have acted in this way, and thus you were born in sin, and your mother conceived you in iniquity, so that she did not even have mercy on you herself. And when you acted in such a way that you became cruel towards yourself through evil deeds: what could I do for you, who did not even deserve to receive one of the good things of the past? Therefore, because none of the things that usually happen to infants happened to you; and this happened not without reason or without judgment, but because of your fault and sin, for which even you yourself did not have mercy: therefore you were cast down on the face of the earth, or the fields; and you were cast down because of the wickedness of your soul on the day you were born. Let us pray that we may not be cast down by the wickedness of the soul into the face of the field, in which there is a wide and spacious road that leads to death; in which the cavalry of the Chaldeans revels. And at the same time, it must be considered that no one can commit any evil on the day he is born, except at the time of the bath, when the wise generation of the faithful believer is taken in faith.

<h2 id='tocuniq154'>(Vers. 6, 7.)</h2>

(Verse 6, 7.) But passing by you: I saw you trampled in your own blood. And I said to you when you were in your blood, live: I said, I say to you, in your blood, live. I multiplied you like the growth of the field, and you came in and reached the female world. Your breasts swelled, and your hair sprouted: and you were naked and full of confusion. LXX: And I passed by you, and saw you mixed in your own blood, and I said to you, from your blood, multiply life, as I gave you the rising of the field, and you multiplied, and became great, and you entered the cities of cities. Your breasts were upright, and your hair was grown: yet you were naked and full of shame. After you were cast face down on the ground, or on the surface of the earth, because of the wickedness of your soul, I no longer deserved to help you. Nevertheless, as I passed by, I saw you trampled upon, or mixed in your own blood, that is, guilty of mortal sins. And I provoked you, granting you repentance, and I said to you: Although you are in blood, live converted; and there was such abundance of all things in you, that you had the likeness of the most fertile fields, and the blessing of Jacob, which his father gave him, saying: Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a full field which the Lord has blessed (Gen. XXVII, 27); and you would enter the innermost chambers of the Lord, and you would say with the bride: The king brought me into his chamber (Song of Songs I, 3); and you would reach the land of womanhood, for which the Septuagint translated: and you entered into the cities of cities; so that just as the Song of Songs is called the Saeculum and the world, so the cities may be called the cities of cities. Of which it is said in the Gospel: 'You shall have power over ten, or over five cities' (Luke XIX, 17, 18): so that not only the city, but also the metropolis of the city, may be called faithful Zion, according to what is read in Isaiah: 'Faithful mother of cities' (Isa. I, 26, 27). Furthermore, what Symmachus interpreted, 'and you have come to the adornment of women', or as Theodotio, 'and you have entered into the adornment of adornments', for which we have explained the Hebrew meaning: 'and you have come to the world of women', indicates the time of puberty, when girls are called nubile and can be joined to their husbands' embraces. Finally, it follows: Your breasts swelled, and your hair grew. The honorable maturity of young girls is indicated when their breasts swell or rise, and their hair grows. And when she was prepared for marriage, and had the beauty of her body, she did not have the coverings of clothing, nor was she protected by the help of God. If anyone does not have the clothing of Christ, they are naked. If anyone is not clothed with the bowels of mercy, goodness, humility, chastity, meekness, patience, they lie upon the face of the earth: and their beauty is defiled by confusion and nakedness." }


<h2 id='tocuniq155'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8) And I passed by you and saw you, and behold, it was your time, the time of lovers. And I spread my cloak over you and covered your shame. Septuagint: And I passed by you and saw you, and behold, it was your time, the time of revelers; and I spread my wings over you and covered your shame. What mercy! It was not enough to see her once trampled in blood and provoke her to repentance, but he visited her again, even though she was sinning, and because she was naked and full of shame, he came and visited her again, and behold, it was her time, the time of lovers; whether according to the Septuagint, the time of revelers, or according to the second interpretation of Aquila, the time of marriage, namely, the time of betrothal and wedding; according to the first edition of the same and Theodotion, the time of breasts, which is interpreted as the time of nursing; for which Symmachus translates it as the time of love, which signifies affection. Therefore, that was the time when women could join with men and endure marital intercourse. However, merciful God spread His wings and received them, and He carried them on His shoulders, numbering 150, according to what is written in the Gospel: 'How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing' (Luke 12:34)? Or He extended His cloak as wings, which is interpreted as the winged cover under which Ruth slept at the feet of Boaz (Ruth 3). And on the border, that is, the fringe of our garment, we are commanded to attach hyacinth fringes. This, however, was done to cover the shame of Jerusalem: showing the female genitalia under this name. Indeed, according to the Apostle: We surround the dishonorable parts of our body with greater honor (I Cor. XII, 13). Therefore, the Psalmist sings: Blessed are those whose sins are forgiven, and those whose sins are covered (Ps. XXXI, 1). As for Cham, because he did not protect his father, he is marked with eternal curse (Genes. IX). Let us apply what we have said about Jerusalem to our own soul, which, as long as it is in infancy, is free from sin. However, when the time of its maturity comes, there are many lovers of demons and heretics, and of perverse doctrines, who desire to lead it astray. They are repelled by the protection of God, so that it receives not the followers of the devil, but the ministers of the Savior. Concerning those who turn aside, there is in Hebrew the word Dodim (lovers), which, according to the meaning of their language, signifies all that has been mentioned above. The time of love and the love of God, can be understood in Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: when the Lord promised to them the liberation of his people after the servitude in Egypt.

And I swore to you; and I entered into a covenant with you, says the Lord God. LXX: And I swore to you, and I entered into a covenant with you, says the Lord God. For I spread my garment, or my wings, over you: and I covered your shame: therefore I swore to you, and I entered into a covenant, or testament, with you: that you would be joined to me rather than to others who wanted to turn to you, according to that, The Lord has sworn and he will not repent: you are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek (Ps. 109:4; Heb. 6). For the end of every controversy is an oath. And as I live, says the Lord: unless the sinner repents of his evil, he shall suffer death (Ezek. XVIII). Therefore, at the time of marriage, Israel receives the oath of God, for every dowry gift. And because David has spoken thus: Remember, O Lord, David, and all his meekness (Ps. CXXXI, 1): he who has sworn to the Lord, has vowed to God, the God of Jacob; and the Lord himself swears to him, the Scripture says: The Lord has sworn in truth to David, and he will not disappoint him (Ibid., 11).


<h2 id='tocuniq156'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) And you became mine, and I washed you with water, and I cleansed your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil. For I spread out my wings, and I covered your disgrace, and I swore to you, and I entered into a covenant with you; therefore you have become my possession: so that what belonged to another, when you appeared unclean, you began to belong to me, when I confirmed my covenant with you by oath. Or according to the custom of the prophets: you have become mine, he says, because you are united to me by the marriage bond: and I washed you, he says, with the water of saving baptism. For unless one is born again of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God (John 3:5). And elsewhere we read: He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire (Mark 1:8). This baptism is also spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: The Lord will wash away the filth of the sons and daughters of Zion; and he shall cleanse the blood from their midst, with the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning (Isaiah 4:4). But when he has washed and cleansed the blood, like the woman who had been hemorrhaging for twelve years and was healed by touching the hem of his garment (Mark 5), water alone is not enough to wash and blood alone is not enough to cleanse, unless he anoints with oil as well. Just as the Samaritan, who is interpreted as guardian, first soothed the wounds with the infusion of oil and then restrained them with the severity of wine (Luke 10). But our Lord was anointed with another oil, which did not mitigate the pain of wounds, but gave joy, as the Holy Spirit said to him: Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your companions (Ps. 44:8). And there are also counterfeit strengths that pretend to be soothing oils, promising sweet things through heretics; but they turn into bitterness, which the prophet detests when he says: But the oil of the sinner shall not anoint my head (Ps. 140:5). But if one is anointed from an anointing, that is, Christ is called, see how much Jerusalem has advanced: so that she herself, anointed with spiritual oil, has received the name of Christ; according to which we also read in the Psalms concerning Abraham: 'Do not touch my anointed ones, and do no harm to my prophets.'

<h2 id='tocuniq157'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10) And I clothed you in multicolored garments. LXX: And I clothed you in various garments: The ceremonies of the Law, in the pursuit of which you abandoned idols. These are the various garments with which Joseph was clothed: and his brothers could not sell him unless they first stripped him of his varied tunic (Gen. XXXVII). And concerning the bride, it is said in the forty-fourth psalm: The queen stood at your right hand in a golden garment, surrounded by variety (Ps. XLIV, 10). This is the clothing about which the Apostle speaks: Put on the new man, who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of the Creator (Ephes. IV, 24). We want to know what are the various clothing? Let the same Apostle teach us, writing to the Believers: Therefore, clothe yourselves with the bowels of mercy, kindness, humility, meekness, patience (Coloss. III, 12). What is more beautiful than this variety? About which even Job spoke: Who gave wisdom to women for weaving, or knowledge of various colors (Job. XXXVIII, sec. LXX)? And the high priest, once a year, when he offered sacrifice for the people, entered into the Holy of Holies, and used various garments (Exodus 39; Hebrews 9). Surely if the richness of different garments and not holiness and the diversity of virtues made distinctions, these garments would be attributed to Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar, and not to Joseph, who, under a foreign and pastoral father, could not have colorful and royal clothes.

And I shoed you with jacinth. LXX: And I shoed you with hyacinth. Aquila and Symmachus, jacinth; Septuagint and Theodotion, hyacinth. For which it is written in Hebrew, Thas. And because the speech is beautifully directed to Jerusalem, and under the persona of a woman, all her adornment is expressed, jacinth or hyacinth shoes are narrated, which do not suit the persona of men. Finally, the making of the Passover is commanded, without any variation of color, so that they may be girded with loins and shod with feet. These are the shoes about which the Apostle writes: having your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace. Philo, a most eloquent man among the Jews, compares hyacinth in the garments of the high priest to bronze, by which he believes heavenly and celestial things are signified. Neither is Jerusalem shod in hyacinth shoes until it is washed with water. Hence, the feet of the Apostles are washed by the Savior, to whom the Lord had previously commanded them to shake off the dust of their feet (Matthew 10). And the bride says in the Song of Songs: I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them? (Song 5:3). And divine scripture witnesses to both Moses and Joshua (Exodus 3) to loosen the strap of their sandals, for the place on which they stand is holy. But once their feet have been washed and cleansed of all filth, they are clad in hyacinth or purple-colored sandals, both of an airy and blue hue, so that they may be caught up into the presence of the Lord in the air and hasten to the heavenly realms.


And I have girded thee with fine linen. Jerusalem is adorned not only with diverse colors and adorned with hyacinth, but it is also girded with fine linen, from which the finest threads are woven into the vestment of the high priest. And the wife in Proverbs, who makes double cloaks for her husband, both for this age and for the future, is said to have made garments for herself from fine linen and purple (Prov. XXXI). With this fine linen, the loins are girded whenever the abundant incentives of desire need to be restrained, and nothing of gross humors ((or, of gross Venus)) is left in them: and we fulfill the commandment of the Apostle who says: Stand therefore, having your loins girded about with truth (Ephes. VI, 14); as if he were saying in other words, with fine linen. And the Lord speaks to the Apostles: Let your loins be girded, and your lamps burning in your hands (Luke 22:35). For unless we bind up the flowing rheum of the loins, we are not able to hold lamps in our hands. Hence God speaks to Job: Gird up your loins like a man (Job 38:3). And those who partake of the Lamb, having their feet shod, holding a staff, standing in the truth of the Gospel, and prepared for Christ's blood, are said to have their loins girded (Exodus 12). In the region where the loins are mortified, Elijah and John the Baptist are girded (4 Kings 1; Mark 1). Concerning them, the repentant one moans lamentably, saying: For my loins are filled with illusions (Psalm 37:8).

And I adorned you with fine clothing. LXX: And I surrounded you with threefold garments. For which Aquila translated as 'florid' or 'palpable'; Symmachus, as 'a garment'; Theodotio put the Hebrew word 'Messe' (). And when I diligently inquired what the word 'trichapto' meant, which the LXX translated, and I could not find its usage or etymology in any Greek word, I finally learned that it is a compound word from the LXX (for new things require new names), which signifies a garment of such great delicacy that it is believed to have the thinness of hair and threads. And so I, wanting to express the thinness of the garment, translated it as 'subtilibus' for 'trichapto', because it was woven with a thin thread and covering. And appropriately for those people, of whom he said in rebuke: 'This people's heart has become fat, and Jacob has eaten and drunk and become satisfied and fat, and his beloved has kicked and abandoned his Maker' (Deut. XXXII, 15), now the thinness of garments is forgiven. For even in the book of Wisdom, which is attributed by some to Solomon, the spirit of wisdom is called the only-begotten and manifold, thin and changeable (Sap. VII). And manna, of which it is written, 'Man ate the bread of angels' (Ps. 77:25), is said to have been as fine as frost and to have resembled coriander seed (Exod. 16). According to the interpretation of the second edition of Aquila, who interpreted it as flourishing, we can understand it as clothing or the fertility of the land of Judah through metaphor, or the beauty of divine worship.

<h2 id='tocuniq158'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) And I adorned you with ornaments. Now he lists the ornaments in general, which he enumerates in the following sections, armlets and a necklace, earrings and a crown, and the rest of the ornaments that he gave to Jerusalem, as it is said in Isaiah that she lost them all because of her own fault. For it is written: Because the daughters of Jerusalem are haughty and walk with an outstretched neck (Isa. 3:16-17), and the rest: instead of a belt, they are girded with ropes, instead of a head-dress, they are disfigured with baldness, and instead of beautiful and soft clothing, they are surrounded by the roughness of sackcloth." }


And I gave bracelets into your hands. LXX: And I surrounded your hands with bracelets. When God has given us good works, He encircles our hands with bracelets. Hence it is said to be likened to the hands of prophets (Hosea 13), and frequently in the hand of Haggai or Jeremiah and other similar statements we have read (Haggai 1). In Job also the lip of the dragon is pierced by a bracelet, and all of its venomous hisses, which are understood in perverse doctrines, are pierced by the circle of good works (Job 40).


And he will remove the ornament from their neck, which we have translated as torque according to the second edition of Aquila and Symmachus. The Septuagint and Theodotion translated it as κάθεμα, which is written not only here, but also in Isaiah: The Lord will take away the glory of their garments, the headbands, the crescent ornaments, the pendants, and the κάθεμα (Isa. III, 18). But I think κάθεμα is derived from various gems descending as a necklace on the chest of women, which is also the most beautiful adornment for women.


<h2 id='tocuniq159'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12) And I put a ring on your nose, or, your nostrils. The Hebrew word Nezem (), except Symmachus, who interpreted it as ἐπιῤῥίνιον, all translated it as a ring: not that rings are placed in the nostrils, which are called rings because they hang from the ears: but so that the circles made in the shape of earrings may be called by the same name, and even to this day among other women's ornaments, golden circles are accustomed to hang from the front of the face and hover over the nostrils. We receive these [mystical perceptions] when, together with the Apostle, we can say that we are a sweet aroma of Christ in those who are saved and in those who perish. To some, we are a fragrance of death leading to death, but to others, we are a fragrance of life leading to life (2 Corinthians 2:15). When we are alive and it can be said of us, 'The dead do not praise you, O Lord, nor do those in the realm of the dead' (Psalm 115:17), then God smells the sweet fragrance of our sacrifice and we have a golden circle of senses and divine doctrines in our nostrils. When we are truly dead and we are immersed in filth and the filth of disgrace, we have that nose ring, about which Solomon wrote: Like a golden nose ring on a pig’s snout, so is the beauty of a woman who is ill-tempered.

And circles in your ears. LXX: And 156 wheels above your ears. He closes his ears, so as not to hear the judgment of blood, and he covers them with thorns, so that he may not become a partaker with the envious and detractors, of whom it is written: Do not associate with detractors, for their destruction will come suddenly, and who knows the ruin of both (Prov. XXIV, 21, 22)? Specifically, this applies to both the one who detracts and the one who willingly listens: the former has circles and wheels in his ears, not the wheels that the Cherubim follow (for that belongs to angelic strength), but rather small wheels that are in keeping with human frailty. Therefore, it is said to God: The voice of your thunder is in the wheel (Psalm 76:19). Indeed, in those who pass through earthly things and barely touch the ground with their small steps, of which it is written: Holy stones roll upon the earth (Zechariah 9:16), the voice of the thunder of the Lord resounds, and the sound of lofty teachings. But those who are led astray by human errors and do not have solid footsteps, but are carried about by every wind of doctrine (Ephesians 2), and expelled from the paradise of firmness, dwell in the region of Naid, which means fluctuation, they deserve to bear eloquence of falsehood, which inflames the wheel of our birth (Genesis 4).


And a crown of beauty on your head. LXX: And a crown of glory upon your head. We have interpreted 'decor' according to Symmachus for the sake of elegant meaning. Otherwise, in Hebrew, it is called 'Thopherth', and in other translations, it is called 'καύχησις' or 'gloriatio'. The other ornaments belong to individual body parts. The adornment of the head is the dignity of the entire body. But it calls the crown the diadem of women, by which the hair is bound and ambition is adorned. We want to know what is the crown of beauty on the head of Jerusalem, let us turn to Exodus, in which it is written: And he made a plate of pure gold, and wrote on it an inscription of the seal of the sanctification of the Lord, and placed it on the head of Aaron (Exod. XXXIX, 29). The sign of the sanctification of the Lord is the name of the omnipotent God, which is written with four Hebrew letters (), and among them it is called ineffable, since his name cannot be spoken. Whose majesty even the gentiles do not ignore, and the altar of the Athenians testifies to the unknown god. Hence also the Apostle says: Him whom you worship as unknown, I proclaim to you (Acts 17:23). I consider this to be that crown, of which the Psalmist also says: You have put a seal upon us, the light of your countenance, O Lord (Psalm 4:7). And the Apostle spoke: I have finished the race, I have kept the faith, henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the righteous judge will give to me (2 Timothy 4:7-8). And in another place to the Believers: My joy and my crown (Phil. IV, 1). For the glory of the fathers, the sons. And in Solomon it is written: The crown of glory is old age (Prov. XII, 6); namely, those who have destroyed what belongs to children, and after reaching adulthood, have come to old age, and to the names of the fathers, of whom John writes after the children (I John II), and the young men who can say: When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I understood like a child, I thought like a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things (I Cor. XIII, 11).


<h2 id='tocuniq160'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>

(Verse 13.) And you are adorned with gold and silver. We have often said that gold pertains to the mind, silver to eloquence. And may the Lord grant us to deserve to receive divine understanding and wisdom, and to express with the beauty of eloquence that which we conceive in the mind, and by no means make it an idol as the heretics do, of whom it is written: 'I gave them silver and gold; but they made Baal out of silver and gold' (Hosea 2:8). And this, according to spiritual understanding, is more suitable for the decoration of women. Otherwise, silver, a cheaper material, is the adornment of country and poor maidservants, which is not fitting for Jerusalem, which is said to have advanced to queen.

And you are dressed in fine linen and purple and multicolored garments. LXX: And your robe is of fine linen, and your headband, and your cloak are of many colors. The Hebrew word Mesi (), and here Theodotion put it just as above, Aquila ἄνθιμον, Symmachus polymiton. But we, as mentioned above, said polymiton near Symmachus; the LXX translated it as τρίχαπτα, preserving the previous interpretation: to show thin garments similar to hair. But every adornment is described for women, to bathe, to cleanse, to anoint with oil, and to be dressed in colored garments, to be shod in hyacinth, to be girded with linen, to be clothed in fine garments or in thin ones, to wear armlets and a golden necklace, to have circles hanging from the ear and rings in the earlobes, 158 to be adorned with a diadem on the head, with gold and silver. Although silver is a cheaper material and is placed last of all. You are dressed in linen and polytus, and in colored garments; or, as the Seventy have translated, in attire and cloaks, for these signify outer garments, so that she might not only be adorned with the care of her body and have all the ornaments of women, but also be concerned with the arrangement of her bed and couch, so that after she has completed these she might come to the delights of food and not allow anything to be wanting even in these things. All these things we will adapt to spiritual understanding, so that they cover the delicate limbs of the spouse with a light and refined fabric, so as not to burden them with the weight of heavy cloths, but also to provide both utility and beauty.

You have eaten both honey and oil, and you have become very beautiful. After clothing, she takes care of the food, so that she may eat in Jerusalem both honey and oil, either separately, as many think, or by the mixing of the three, a sweeter bread, which is the bread that came down from heaven (John 6); and under three names, as some suppose, she indicates the sacrament of the Trinity: not that there is a difference in substance; but so that by the different names of honey and oil and bread, the sweetness of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit may be shown together. And this should be noted, that in many sacrifices fine flour is offered, the finest marrow of wheat, of which it is written: 'And he fed them with the fat of wheat' (Psalm 80:17): not barley, nor meal, which is only offered when a husband is moved by the spirit of jealousy. In the book of Judges we read about Deborah (Judges 4), who is interpreted as a bee, whose prophecies are as sweet as honey, and is related to the Holy Spirit, which is called Rua in the feminine gender by the Hebrews. In the Gospel of the Hebrews, which the Nazarenes read, the Savior is introduced speaking: 'My mother, the Holy Spirit, has taken me just now.' Furthermore, the similar thing that is done with wheat is referred to the Lord, who says about Himself: 'Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it produces much fruit' (John 12:24). But the oil, which sustains and refreshes the limbs of the weary, and is the nourishment of light, and with which the constant light of the lamps is kindled in the tabernacle of God, is said to correspond to the Father. All of these bestow grace on those who believe, as the Apostle says: There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit distributes them. There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work. (1 Corinthians 12:4-6) Whoever partakes of this food, which is so sweet and delightful, and is nourished by the radiance of the most pure bread and oil, will be transformed into beauty and will become most beautiful, not just once, but repeatedly, exceedingly so. For a duplicated adverb adds weight to the speech: to which nothing can be added beyond the greatness of beauty.

And you advanced to the kingdom. This is not found in the Septuagint, which perhaps those in Alexandria translating the Scriptures from the Hebrew truth into the Greek language were afraid to publish, lest they be seen to offend the king of Egypt while mentioning that Jerusalem was the rightful kingdom of God: although the learned approve only the five books of Moses interpreted by them (see above, chapter 5). Therefore, after multiple decorations, after the crown, after the abundance of gold and silver, after the most beautiful garments and cloaks, after incredible beauty, he advances to being the queen, because she is the city of a great king, of whom it is written: Give your judgment to the king, and your justice to the king's son (Psalm 17:1). And in the Apocalypse of John, Jerusalem is described as a bride adorned and prepared for her husband (Apoc. XXI). In the Psalms, it is also said about the same: The queen stands at your right hand in a golden robe, adorned with various colors (Ps. XLIV, 10). However, everything we say about Jerusalem, so as not to dwell on each individual case, and so that the magnitude of the books does not bore the readers, let us refer to the Church. For if Jerusalem is our mother, according to the Apostle (Gal. IV), but our mother is the Church: consequently, Jerusalem is the Church, the mother of the early believers who are described in heaven.


<h2 id='tocuniq161'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14) And your name went out among the nations because of your beauty, for you were perfect in my splendor which I bestowed upon you, says the Lord God. LXX: And your name went out among the nations in your splendor, for it was complete in the beauty which I placed upon you, says the Lord God. This passage was more clearly interpreted by Symmachus: And your name went out among the nations, which was perfect because of my dignity, which I had bestowed upon you, says the Lord God. And the meaning is: Through my kindness and incredible generosity, you have reached the title of queen, so that the conversation of all nations would speak of you, and you would be praised not for your own merits and virtues, but for my complete generosity. For unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain (Psalm 127:1-2). For neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth (1 Corinthians 3). For it is not the one who wills or the one who runs, but God who shows mercy (Romans 9:16): so that after we have done everything, we may say: We are unworthy servants, we have only done what we ought to have done (Luke 17:10). Not so that free will is taken away from man by the goodness of God, but so that freedom itself should have the Lord as its helper.

<h2 id='tocuniq162'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) And having confidence in your beauty, you have fornicated in your name, and you have exposed your fornication to all who pass by, so that you may become theirs. It is a great danger to trust not in the mercy of God, but in your own appearance. And the higher one may be, the more they should fear lest they fall and fornicate in their own name. Indeed, the adversaries rejoice in despising ordinary food and desire exotic nourishment. Hence it is said about the devil: His food is choice (Habakkuk 1:16). He does not want to deceive anyone. Saul, who was chosen by the Lord as king, hastens to supplant Judas the apostle. Therefore, let us not trust in our own beauty, nor think that God's generosity can be our virtue; but rather let us hear: Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring (Prov. XXVII, 1). And in another place: Brothers, if a person is caught in any wrongdoing, you who are spiritual should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted (Galatians VI, 1). Let us not expose or pour out our fornication to every passerby, so that we do not become not of God, in whom we believe, but of the one by whom we are defiled. He who receives all vices, and receives in his bosom the spirit of diverse sins passing by, and spreads his legs to every passerby, he pours out his fornication and begins to endure the dominion of the one whose guest he has become.

<h2 id='tocuniq163'>(Vers 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) And taking from your garments, you made for yourself lofty sewn things, and you fornicated over them, as it had not been done and will not be done. LXX: And you took from your garments, and made for yourself idols which were sewn, and you fornicated over them, and you shall not enter, nor shall it be. Symmachus interpreted this passage as follows: And when you took from your garments, you made for yourself lofty multicolored things, and you fornicated in them, not made nor to be made. Aquila and Theodotius translated Proconsutis et versicoloribus et excelsis, sive idolis, ἐμβολίσματα, which means various fabrics sewn together, and an idol made like a patch, as if it were a multicolored garment. 'I have clothed you with colors,' he says, 'and you have put on fine linen, and silk, and many different shapes. But the clothes with which you have been lavishly adorned, you took and made idols or high places,' which in Hebrew are called Bamoth, 'which have never been done before, nor will they be done again.' That which you have received for decoration, you have turned into an insult to the donor. What can be understood about Jerusalem according to the letter, is that it has attributed all the commandments of the Law and the abundance of riches and all things to idols, which no other nation has done, nor will do. For all the nations that have served idols from the beginning are not guilty of such a great crime. But our Jerusalem, which means the vision of peace, is divided by heretics, when they take one or another testimony of the Scriptures from their own places and try to apply them to those with which they cannot be connected. To them and to those above, we read in the same prophet: Woe to those who consume pillows under every elbow, and make coverings over the head of all ages (Sup. XIII, 18): which the Lord, prohibiting to be done, speaks in the Gospel: No one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the patch pulls away from it, and a worse tear is made: nor do they put new wine into old wineskins (Matthew IX, 16, 17). There are those of the Nazarene sect, who try to adapt the observance of the old Law to the grace of the Gospel. And all heretics, who seek to apply testimony in one place to a congruous meaning in another: even though the tunic of the Lord, woven throughout with a single thread, cannot be altogether torn apart, but woven with the Holy Spirit, it does not receive any tearing apart. That which is said according to the Septuagint, “you shall not enter nor it shall not be,” signifies this: when you make idols of perverse teachings, which you think are lofty, and you commit fornication with them, believing in those things which you yourself have fabricated, you will not be able to enter the temple of God. And when your idols will have no substance, nor will they exist forever, as the Apostle says: 'For we know that an idol is nothing in the world' (I Cor. VIII, 4).

<h2 id='tocuniq164'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) And you took vessels of your adornment from my gold and my silver, which I gave you; and you made male images for yourself, and you fornicated with them. According to the letter of the Law, the Lord commanded that censers, vases, candlestick, the Ark of the Covenant, and all things made of gold or gilded, and other things made of silver, were to be made, all of which were crafted in Jerusalem and turned into idols of Bel, or Baal, Chemosh and Ashtoreth, and Milcom. According to spiritual intelligence, we make idols out of gold and silver of the Holy Scriptures when we corrupt the grace of understanding and eloquence with heretical depravity, and we exalt ourselves in heaven and our tongue descends to earth. However, the images in which every heresy commits fornication are called masculine, because each one thinks that they worship the most powerful and possess what they have created, and that it cannot be overthrown by any attack. These are the images that we have created from our hearts, and which are to be destroyed in the heavenly Jerusalem, of which the Prophet declares: 'O Lord, you will scatter their image in your city' (Ps. LXXII, 20). For whoever is a man and has lost the name of God, it is said of him: 'Nevertheless, man walks in his image, yet he is troubled in vain' (Ps. XXXVIII, 7). But we have one man, and we worship one image, which is the image of the invisible and omnipotent God.


<h2 id='tocuniq165'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) And you took your multicolored garments, and covered them: it is understood images of men: so that every form which had been received for use, be turned into blasphemy. But we do this, whenever with prudence, temperance, fortitude, justice, and all virtues we surround heretical wickedness, under the pretext of these virtues, we deceive even the simple; so that, seeing the honey of virtues, they do not avoid the poison of vices.


And you have set before them my oil and my incense. And my bread (or as the Septuagint translates, my loaves) which I gave to you; fine flour, and oil, and honey, with which I nourished you, you have set them before them for a sweet smell. The oil of which we have spoken above, and the incense, or perfume, of which the Psalmist proclaims: Let my prayer be directed as incense in your sight (Ps. 140, 2); and the loaves of the proposition, which we are commanded to offer to God: also fine flour, the purest sense of the Scriptures, and honey, which Jonathan tasted, and his eyes were opened and he was strengthened (1 Sam. 14), miserable Jerusalem placed before the sight of idols, or before male images, so that they might be to them for a sweet smell, which by their nature are sweetest and most pleasing: but while they are offered to idols and false teachings, they are turned into bitterness.


<h2 id='tocuniq166'>Book Five</h2>

Book Five

163-164 In order to avoid confusion in the numbering of books, and to prevent the order of the volumes from being corrupted by the passage of time, I have included prefaces for each book. This way, the reader can easily identify which book they should read and what prophecy needs to be explained. In the previous volume, that is, the fourth one, I discussed a part of the prophecy against Jerusalem, which begins with the words: 'Your root and your generation are from the land of Canaan,' and extends to the place where it is written: 'You have set before them bread, oil, and honey, which I have nourished you with, as a sweet-smelling aroma.' I have explained this briefly in my discourse. Now the remaining part of this prophecy, along with the rest that follows, is dedicated to the fifth volume, and to your name, Eustochium. In it, you will find nothing of rhetorical art, nothing of composition, and the beauty of words: but the care of simple and careful diligence, so that this alone may be my praise, if you understand the words spoken by the prophet through me.

<h2 id='tocuniq167'>(Vers. 20 seqq.)</h2>

(Verses 20 and following) And it came to pass, says the Lord God, that you took your sons and your daughters, whom you bore unto Me, and offered them up to be devoured. Is your whoredom not enough, sacrificing my children? And you gave them to be consecrated. And after all your abominations and whoredoms, you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and covered in shame, trampled in your own blood. LXX: And it came to pass after these things, says the Lord God, that you took your sons and your daughters whom you had borne to me, and you sacrificed them to be consumed, as if you were a little harlot. And you killed your sons and gave them to be offered to them, that is, above all your adultery and abominations, and you did not remember the days of your infancy, when you were naked and dishonored, living in your own blood. That he begot sons and daughters for himself, Jerusalem, about whom it is written: I begot sons and exalted them; but they despised me (Isa. I, 2); and the Holy Scripture mentions that they sacrificed to idols: They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons (Ps. CV, 37). And again: They shed innocent blood (Ibid., 38), the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan (Exod. IV, 22). But he calls his own according to the Hebrew. For he himself had said of them: My firstborn son is Israel. Or according to the Septuagint, your children, whom you have begotten through fornication. But in the place where we have placed them, and where you consecrated them, for whom the Septuagint translated, and you gave them to appease, or to expiate, Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion also translated and led them away: because the pagans either make their children pass through fire, or force young or adult individuals to pass over. When you do these things, he says, you do not remember your infancy, when I took you covered in blood and washed you, and after many things which prophetic speech narrated, I united you to myself. Our Jerusalem also, if it is supplanted by heretical fraud, takes away her sons, who are stronger in faith, and the daughters who do not have such great strength of faith. Or certainly the sons, who know mystical things: the daughters who follow a simple history; and she delivers them to be devoured by demons, and when she kills them, she believes she can give them life and appease the idols, by whose killing they are satiated. And what is said according to the Septuagint, that is, upon all your fornication and abominations, it signifies that the doctrine of demons is worse than all sins and fornications: in fact, it will kill those whom it has either begotten to God with great labor or made its own children, whom it generated in fornication.

<h2 id='tocuniq168'>(Vers 23 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 23 and following) And it came to pass after all your wickedness: woe, woe to you, says the Lord God. And you built yourself a brothel, and you made for yourself a brothel in all the streets. At every head of the road, you built a sign of your prostitution, and you made your abominable adornment, and you spread your feet to everyone passing by, and you multiplied your fornications. And you prostituted yourself with the sons of Egypt, your neighbors, who had much flesh, and you multiplied your fornication to provoke me. LXX: And it came to pass after all your wickedness, woe, woe to you, says the Lord God. And you built for yourself a dwelling of prostitution, and you made yourself a prostitute in every street. And at the beginning of every path you built your prostitution: and you corrupted your beauty, and spread your legs to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your prostitution: and you committed adultery with the sons of Egypt your neighbors, who are of great flesh, and you multiplied your prostitution to provoke me to anger. The Vulgate edition does not have this, which is said second, but it was added from the edition of Theodotion. And again, where we said, 'And you built yourself a brothel,' the Seventy translated it as 'And you built yourself a dwelling place of fornication,' Symmachus and Theodotion translated it as 'brothel'; Aquila, wanting to express the etymology of the Hebrew word Gob (), put 'pit,' which we can say means 'pit': to signify a den and a dark pit, in which the lust of prostitutes is involved. And what follows: And you made for yourself a brothel in all the streets, for which the Seventy translated ἔκθεμα, which in Hebrew is Rama: and both Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotio interpreted it as lofty or sublime. Lastly, in the following passages, where it is written: At every head of the road you built a sign of your prostitution, for a sign and fornication, again in Hebrew it has Rama (), which we have interpreted as either brothel or sign, since among the Hebrews it is one word. However, this is put forth, that it may be high; so that for those who wish to fornicate, the place of fornication appears far away and it is not necessary to search. What we have said once and again and again, let it suffice to have said it forever, that under the guise of a woman, after many benefits from her husband, she describes Jerusalem's fornication, how she has departed from God and joined idols, and her hidden fornication has not been satisfied; but she has built for herself a brothel, and has placed a sign on every street for passersby, so that they may come to the harlot and satisfy their lust, not only their own, but also that of the one who spread her legs wide to every passerby, and defiled the greatness of beauty with the greatness of fornication; and among other things, she has also been cast down in love for the great flesh of the Egyptians, her neighbors. And in order to demonstrate every kind of depravity, it is deformed by a manifold kind of filth. However, there is no doubt that Palestine is neighboring Egypt, as the Lord said to Abraham: I will give you all the land from the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates (Gen. 15:18), so that on one side it has the Egyptians, and on the other side it has the Assyrians, with whom it is said to have committed fornication in later times. But the fornication of Jerusalem with the Egyptians is an imitation of their idolatry. But towards our Jerusalem, whether the Church or the souls of the faithful, if they are negligent and give themselves up to all vices, a twofold curse is directed, that they may hear: Woe, woe to thee, saith the Lord God, according to what is written in the Apocalypse of John: Woe to all the inhabitants of the earth (Apoc. VIII, 13). For if the saint says: I am a stranger and a sojourner, like all my fathers (Psal. XXXVIII, 13): why is not the sinner called an inhabitant of the earth? He builds for himself a brothel, who with complete freedom of forehead commits sins; according to that which is written: When a sinner comes into the depths of wickedness, he despises (Prov. 18:3). And he constructs the highest place in all the streets: For wide and spacious is the way that leads to death. And at every head of the street he builds; so that he does not leave behind any kind of sins; but imitating the harlot of Proverbs, openly in the streets and in the corners of the streets, he invites foolish young men passing by into his embraces, and pollutes the beauty of the soul, which she received as a gift from God the Creator (Prov. 5 and 7). And all his journeys are full of disgrace, and he reveals his heart to all the thoughts that provide incentives for vices, and he spreads his legs apart, and he fornicate with his Egyptian neighbors, whose examples he follows, namely the pagans who glorify themselves in their disgraceful acts, and it is so wicked that it surpasses even them in disgrace. And he does all of this to provoke God to anger. Moreover, the Egyptians are said to have large sexual organs, either because of the magnitude of their disgrace or because of the deformity of their sins. Wherefore, the holy one, of the flesh of little children, which daily decreases in it, and is thinned by virtues, so that it is not called flesh, but spirit: and speaks in the psalm: My soul thirsts for you, O God, how greatly my flesh thirsts for you (Psalm 62:2): or (as some copies have it) how my flesh is consumed: In a desert and trackless land, and without water: thus I have appeared to you in holiness (1 Corinthians 5). Therefore, the Corinthian fornicator is handed over to the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved. Concerning this flesh, it is written: All flesh is grass, and all the glory of it is like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls away: but the word of the Lord endures forever (Isa. XL, 6, 7). The Apostle also spoke about this: Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God (I Cor. XV, 50). And God speaks in Genesis: My spirit shall not remain in these people, for they are flesh (Gen. VI, 3). And it is said to the believers: Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit (Rom. VIII, 8, 9). But the flesh of the saints is different, of which it is written: Every flesh shall see the salvation of God (Isaiah XL, 5).

<h2 id='tocuniq169'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>

(Verse 27) Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon you and take away your justification, and I will give you to the souls of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are inflamed by your wicked way. LXX: But if I stretch out my hand upon you and take away your lawful rights and give you to the souls of those who hate you, the daughters of foreigners who have caused you to turn aside from your path. And what follows: ἠσέβησας, which means, you acted impiously, is relevant in relation to the following chapter of the Septuagint, and is consistent with the conclusions of the previous section. However, the Lord extended his hand over Jerusalem to correct the wrongdoer and to take away their rightful possessions, which were considered rightful by the Lord as long as they obeyed God's commandments. But when they worshiped idols and turned their religion into impiety, their possessions were no longer considered rightful. Which is to be observed not only in the law and ceremonies, but also in the sabbaths and feast days and new moons. For God says in the law: 'My sabbaths and my feast days'. But when they turned away from God, it is said to them: 'I will not accept your new moons, and sabbaths, and great day: my soul hates your fasting and rest, and your solemnities' (Exodus 31; Deuteronomy 5; Isaiah 1:14). This is also written about the people (Deuteronomy 7). For when the people who were called the people of God turned away from the Lord, it is said to Moses about them: Your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have sinned (Exodus 32:7). This stretching out of the hand is called elsewhere lifting up or visitation. For when God does not correct the one who is sinning, he withdraws his hand. But if the person has sinned and has begun to be sick in the law of God, a visitation is sent to him, according to what is sung in the psalm: If his children forsake my law, and do not walk in my judgments, I will visit their transgression with the rod (Psalm 89:31-32). And in this is written: If the earth sin against me, that it may trespass against me, I will stretch forth my hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and the rest. In which we inquire, what is meant by the stretching forth of the hand, and the sending forth thereof. However, the Devil speaks to the Lord: Put forth thy hand, and touch all that he hath: unless he bless thee to thy face (Job 2:5). And it seems to me that the hand is sent for the trial of those to whom it is sent; but it is stretched forth for the punishment of those who deserve chastisement. Not only extension and insertion; but also the spreading of God's hands is called expansion, as Isaiah proclaims from the person of the Lord: All day long I have spread out my hands to a people who do not believe and who contradict (Isa. 65:2). The Holy One is also said to lift up his hands, as Scripture says: The lifting up of my hands is an evening sacrifice (Ps. 140:2). But since the legitimate laws of God have been removed from the Jewish people, let us ask them what observance of the law they have. They can't offer victims when the temple has been taken away and destroyed; nor can the stoning of adulterers and the punishment of other crimes allowed by law be carried out, nor can the sabbatical year and other such things be observed. However, it is given into the hands of the enemies of the daughters of Palestine, when it is handed over to the Palestinians, whom the Seventy indiscriminately call foreigners: which we can understand as cities or towns of Palestine. Our own Jerusalem, too, if we abandon the ceremonies of God, and his hand is stretched out against us and all observance of the law is taken away, will be handed over to the daughters of Palestine and not to the sons. For we are not first delivered to more powerful punishments, but according to the quality of sins, to lesser ones, so that having been corrected in the lesser ones, we may avoid the greater torments. The Philistines, that is, the Palestinians, with the first part of the word changed, are interpreted as fallen with a cup, or by the act of breaking. Through which it is signified that we are to be delivered to the opposing powers, who have drunk from the cup of Babylon, and have fallen, and whose works are perverse. So great will be the correction and disgrace of wretched Jerusalem, that even the hostile powers themselves will be ashamed at the magnitude of our sins. This we have interpreted according to Symmachus as 'scelerata': Theodotion put the Hebrew word itself as 'Zemma'. But when the ceremonies of God were removed from the Jewish people, they passed over to us along with the priesthood and legislation, as the Scripture says: 'Appoint, O Lord, a lawgiver over them' (Psalm 9:21). And in another place: Set a law for me, O Lord, in your way (Psalm 26:11).

<h2 id='tocuniq170'>(Vers. 28, 29.)</h2>

(Verse 28, 29.) And you have played the harlot with the sons of Assyria: because you were not satisfied, and after you played the harlot you were still not satisfied. And you multiplied your harlotry in the land of Canaan with the Chaldeans, and still you were not satisfied. LXX: You have acted impiously, and you have played the harlot with the sons of Assyria; and still you were not satisfied: and you played the harlot, and were not filled; and you multiplied your adulteries to the land of Canaan, and the Chaldeans; and you were not satisfied in these things either. Above is written, Jerusalem fornicated with the sons of Egypt, her neighbors, who are of great flesh: here the other neighborhood of the Assyrians is indicated. And therefore both are delivered to the nations, because they worshipped the idols of both, and entering Chaldea, which is the land of Canaan, they imitated the errors of those whose authority they were under. According to the allegory, we often move from one sin to another. And when we do not repent of our previous sins, we increase sins with sins, and we are satisfied with no error, but like a long rope and the continuous strap of a young heifer, we drag sins, and we multiply our covenant, or fornication, in the land of Canaan, which is interpreted as fluctuation, and with the Chaldeans, who also sound the same as us, as if they were demons (Ps. 39:3). And always we have footsteps in the salt, and never can we say: he established my feet above the rock. And we are subjected to the wickedness of heretics, who have the likeness of demons: whether to those very Demons, about whom Paul writes: We do not have a battle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers of these dark realms, against spiritual wickedness in heavenly places (Ephesians VI, 12).

<h2 id='tocuniq171'>(Vers. 30, 31.)</h2>

(Verse 30, 31) In which shall I cleanse your heart, says the Lord God, when you do all these works of a prostitute and shameless woman? For you have built your brothel at the head of every street, and you have made your high place in every square. Yet you have not acted like a prostitute, scorning payment. LXX: What shall I do with your heart, says Adonai the Lord, when you have done all these works of a fornicating and impudent woman? And you have prostituted yourself three times among your daughters, when you built your brothel at the beginning of every street, and made your foundation in every square; yet you were not like a prostitute, gathering wages. And as the Seventy interpreted: And you have fornicated three times with your daughters, which is not found in Hebrew, nor has any of the other interpreters put it. However, God speaks all these things contentiously to Jerusalem, because He cannot find a remedy to cure her sick and ailing condition; according to what Isaiah writes: What more was there to do for my vineyard that I have not done to it? (Isa. V, 4) ? And Hosea said: What shall I do to thee, Ephraim? what shall I do to thee, Juda? Your mercy is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away. (Hosea 6:4). For your idolatry is not in secret, but is committed with complete freedom, that you would set up altars and high places in all the beginnings of the ways and at the cross-roads, and you would make a foundation or an elevated place, about which we have spoken above, in every street. Nor has she imitated cunning harlots, who used to increase the price of desire by difficulty, and from this provoke lovers to frenzy. Or according to the Septuagint: You were not like a prostitute collecting wages, but you gave what you should have received, so that neither in the fact that you committed fornication and followed demons, would you be protected by their help, but oppressed by various captivities, you would feel your calamities. Indeed, this can also be applied to every Christian soul, who, abandoning the worship of God, has indulged in vices and luxury, and followed a worldly life, in which he did not even act successfully, but lost the wealth of religion and did not receive the wealth of the world: nor was there any difficulty in defiling it, but she herself introduced herself to her lovers. There is also another spiritual fornication, when we abandon the Church and join the heretics, and build our brothel at the head of every path, as the divine word commands: Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the eternal paths of the Lord, where the good way is, and walk in it (Jeremiah VI, 16), that is, in the books of Moses, Joshua, Judges, and Kings, Isaiah and Jeremiah, and the other prophets. In all the beginnings of the paths, he builds his brothel, who abuses the testimonies of the Scriptures to support his corrupt doctrine, and says: This is what Isaiah says, this is what Hosea says, this is what Moses said, this is what Daniel said." } And he does not put his brothel in the middle of the streets, nor at the ends of the roads, but at the beginning. For if he comes to the knowledge and profound books of divinity, he will not be able to go astray. He also makes his high place, or base, in every square, allowing himself to be defiled by the debauchery and vices of the heathens, even among the heretics when he has been defiled by them, not having grace, but subject to contempt, because he easily lost the chastity of the past faith. However, what we mentioned earlier does not exist in Hebrew: You have committed adultery three times with your daughters, whether it is said literally in Jerusalem, that she has committed adultery of every kind in her towns and villages; and there is no corner or square left where she has not set up idols of idolatry: or deceiving the Church and the believers, who have not heard the words of the Apostle: Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (I Thess. 5:23); but they have committed adultery in every way, with their body, soul, and spirit. We read in Proverbs: 'But you, write them down in a threefold manner, so that you may answer the words of truth that are presented to you' (Prov. XXII, 20, 21). And it is commanded to us that we understand the words of truth, that is, the holy Scriptures, in three ways. First, according to the literal sense; second, in the middle, through tropology; third, in a higher sense, so that we may know the mystical things. According to the literal sense, it is this: 'Neither let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and fell in one day twenty-three thousand' (I Cor. X, 8). And: Do not murmur, as some of them murmured and were destroyed by the destroyer (1 Corinthians 10:10). However, in the middle and according to tropology, when we depart from the letter and ascend a little higher, as the Apostle says: It is written: You shall not muzzle the ox that is treading out the grain. And immediately after: Is it for the sake of oxen that God is concerned? Or does he speak surely for our sake? (1 Corinthians 9:9). And finally, that is, in the third and highest and sacred understanding, according to the saying of the same Apostle: Therefore, a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife. (Matthew 19:5)" } This is a great mystery. But I speak concerning Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5:31-32). The daughters, however, are the Church of the fornicating, first of the believers, and then of the deceived in the heresy of the soul, whose fault is attributed to the mother.

<h2 id='tocuniq172'>(Vers. 32 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 32 onwards) But like an adulterous woman, who brings in strangers over her husband. To all prostitutes payment is given: but you have given payment to all your lovers, and you used to give them gifts so that they would come to you from every direction to have sex with you. And it happened in you contrary to the custom of women in your prostitution, and after you there will not be prostitution. For in that you gave payment and did not receive payment, the opposite has happened to you. LXX: The adulterous woman, similar to you, received wages from her husband. She gave wages to all who fornicated with her, and you gave wages to all your lovers, and burdened them to come to you in your fornication. And it happened that you acted perversely against women in your fornication, and after you, no women fornicated because you gave wages and wages were not given to you. And it happened that you acted perversely. That which is written in the LXX, similar to you, is not found in Hebrew, and disturbs the order of reading, and raises a significant question, which woman, of whom is she similar to: when Jerusalem itself is said to be an adulterous woman. Therefore, Jerusalem took the abundance of all things, which had been given to her by the generosity of her husband, and gave it to strangers, that is, to demons and idols, according to what is written in Hosea: 'And she did not know that I gave her the wheat, and the wine, and the oil, and multiplied her silver: but she made silver and gold for Baalim' (Hosea 2:8). So, being angry, He immediately declares: 'Therefore, I will turn and take away my wheat in its season, and my wine in its season; and I will take away my clothes and my linen, so that I will no longer cover her shame. And now I will reveal her uncleanness in the sight of her lovers, and no one will rescue her from my hand.' And while all women who engage in prostitution usually receive payment from their lovers, Jerusalem did the opposite, giving more than she received. And to display the generosity of her payment, she would burden (or, honor), she said, 174 of them to come to her in rotation; so that there would be no neighbor who would not be mixed in with her disgrace. And indeed, Jerusalem surpassed other prostitutes in this as well, not only giving her own earnings, which she had acquired through the custom of depravity and toil; but also giving marital gifts to her lovers and her rapists. The explanation of adultery has been so great that it is preferred not only to those present, but also to future prostitutes. Hence, we have interpreted according to Symmachus: 'And after you there will be no fornication.' For in comparison to you, every subsequent fornication will be considered lighter. Whatever we have said about Jerusalem refers to the Church and the souls of the believers, who give their lovers the gifts of marriage - namely, gold in the sense of understanding, silver in speech, and clothing that veils our filth and shame. They give these gifts to either opposing powers or teachers of false doctrines, when they assert that lust and passive lust, according to the genital organs of the body, demand sexual intercourse in accordance with natural law, and that all foods made for this purpose should be used indiscriminately, to be consumed." } Prudence is necessary only insofar as it benefits oneself; justice has no place, for if it prevails, one would have to beg and other such things. Taking these things, miserable Jerusalem, in which the vision of peace should be, turned the sharpness of intellect and the elegance of speech into ugliness. And for her lovers, adorned against her husband, she came forth with these ornaments, in which she had been adorned for the abuse of good by her husband. And what follows: And you gave them that they may enter to fornicate with you from all sides, all kinds signify sins, so that she is not satisfied with one offense, but endures a hunger for sinning and, against the laws of nature, is defiled by all the shameful members even to the top of her head.

(Vers. 35 seqq.) Therefore, harlot, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord God: Because your brass has been poured out and your shame has been revealed in your fornication (Vulg. in your fornications) upon your lovers, and upon the idols of your abominations in the blood of your sons, whom you have given to them. Behold, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have mixed yourself, and all whom you have loved with all those whom you have hated, and I will gather them against you from all around, and will expose your shame before them, and they will see all your disgrace." } And I will judge you with the judgments of adulterers, and those shedding blood, and I will give you over to the blood (Vulgate: to blood) of fury and zeal, and I will give you into their hands, and they will destroy your brothel, and demolish your prostitution, and they will strip you of your clothes, and they will take away the vessels of your adornment, and they will leave you naked, full of shame. And they will bring a multitude upon you, and they will stone you with stones, and they will kill you with their swords. And they will burn your houses with fire, and they will execute judgments against you in the eyes of many women, and you will cease to fornicate and no longer give wages. And my indignation will rest upon you, and my jealousy will be removed from you, and I will rest and not be angry anymore, because you have not remembered the days of your youth and have provoked me in all these things. Therefore, I have given your ways upon your head, says the Lord God, and I have not done according to your wickedness in all your abominations. LXX: Therefore, harlot, hear the word of the Lord: Thus says the Lord God: Because you have poured out your bronze and your shame will be revealed in your prostitution to your lovers, and in all your wicked thoughts, and in the blood of your sons whom you gave to them. Therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers with whom you have mingled, and all those whom you have loved with all those whom you have hated, and I will gather them against you from all around, and I will reveal your wickedness to them, and they will see all your shame. And I will avenge on you the vengeance of the adulterous, and those who shed blood, and I will put you in the blood of fury and zeal, and I will deliver you into their hands. And they will burn down your brothel, and destroy your foundation, and they will strip you of your garments, and take away the vessels of your glory, and leave you naked and full of shame, and bring a multitude upon you, and stone you with stones, and cut you with their swords. And they will set fire to your houses, and the women will execute vengeance against you in front of many. And I will turn you away from prostitution, and you will no longer give rewards. And I will unleash my fury upon you, and my zeal will depart from you, and I will rest, and I will not be concerned. Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, and you have grieved me in all these things. And behold, I will bring your ways upon your head, says the Lord God; and you have done wickedness beyond all your evil deeds. We lay the foundations of this and that story. For you have done these things, which the previous discourse encompasses: therefore hear, O harlot, what you have done, and what you will suffer. You have poured out your brass that you received from me, and you have given payment to your lovers, which you should have received, and you have killed your children while offering them to idols, so that you have not only become an adulterer, but also a murderer. Therefore I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have committed adultery, both those you have loved and those you have hated. And I will expose you to the gaze of adulterers, so they may see your disgrace, and the genitals that once aroused their lust. All these things are said in metaphor of an adulterous and murderous woman, who not only committed adultery against her husband, but also killed her children. They are spoken against Jerusalem, and that all the nations, whose idols she worshipped and whom she turned God's gifts into their worship, should be gathered against her, and that the temple of Baal should be destroyed, and the altars of the whole city should be overturned by fire, and nothing should remain in her. And as it is customary, all the stones are thrown against the adulteress, and to kill the prostitute, so that she is killed by the wounds of each of them: in the same way, so that all women see the punishment of the harlot: thus in the sight of others, in the surrounding area of cities and all nations, Jerusalem is to be abandoned. And for this to happen, so that she stops committing adultery, and does not give any more wages to her lovers, and the wrath of God may rest, and He may not be angry with her anymore, since she has ceased to love. From this we perceive that there is a great offense, that God is not taken care of, but rather that he allows man to be subject to his own crimes and sins. 'My zeal,' he says, 'will be taken away from you, and I will rest, and I will no longer be angry, as if I were a stranger, and that which has departed from me, and which I have handed over to eternal nakedness.' But if Jerusalem has suffered this, because she has fornicated with idols, what do we think she will suffer when she has slain the Son of God? And you, he says, have done all these things, forgetting your former blessings, and you have provoked me to anger, or you have grieved me, whom you should have provoked to joy by good works. Therefore, I will also render to you your works into your head. And when I overthrow you, O adulteress, I will exercise less of my anger towards you than you deserve, so that divine mercy might be demonstrated, that sins might be greater than punishments. According to tropology, every soul receives spiritual wealth from God, according to that Gospel (Matthew 25, Luke 19) which is said in the parables of five and two talents, and of the ten servants receiving one mina each, who, when they act negligently, become debtors of fifty (or ten) denarii and five hundred, and because of this, in the presence of the lovers whom we understand to be demons and opposing virtues, the disgrace of Jerusalem is revealed, either on the day of judgement or in the time of repentance when they are admonished. And indeed God alone sees hidden things, as the Gospel says: And your Father who sees in secret (Matthew 6:6). And in another place: God examines the hearts and kidneys (Psalm 7:10). And in the book of Kings: You alone know the hearts of all the sons of men (2 Kings 8). But when it is fulfilled: There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not be known (Luke 12:2). And in another place: Do not judge before the time, until the Lord comes, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts, and then praise will come to each one from God (1 Corinthians 4:5); and when the time of correction comes, then what Hosea said will be fulfilled: Now their thoughts have surrounded them (Hosea 7:2). And in another place: When they accuse or defend themselves in their thoughts, on the day when God will judge the secrets of men (Rom. II, 15). And again: Behold the man and his works before his face. And all those who fornicated with her before will see her wickedness, and God will deliver her into the blood of fury and zeal. For the rage of a man is full against an adulterous wife, and she cannot be redeemed at any price. But the blood of children can be understood as we call the good thoughts, which are inherent in men by God, sons of Jerusalem; whom the adulteress kills when she turns to evil deeds. It is also beneficial for Jerusalem, that its brothel be dug up, and the entire seedbed of its fornication be destroyed. For when this has been done, it will no longer provide rewards, and the indignation of God will rest, and He will not be zealous for its chastity: namely, according to those who interpret these things in a positive way. However, others, as we have said above, interpret it in the opposite way, that it is a great sign of God's anger not to be angry once He has condemned a fornicate, and has given up on their salvation. But if heretics who do not accept the old Testament, according to the Septuagint edition, criticize in this place what has been said: And you grieved me in all these things; because God not only receives anger, but also suffers sorrow and sadness, let us ask them how they accept that, which is certainly a commandment of the good God: Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you are sealed for the day of redemption (Ephesians 4:30). Whatever they may say in defense of that testimony, we will apply it to the satisfaction of the present discourse.

<h2 id='tocuniq174'>(Vers. 44.)</h2>

(Verse 44.) Behold, everyone who speaks a proverb will apply it to you, saying: As the mother, so her daughter. You are the daughter of your mother, who cast away her husband and her children, and you are the sister of your sisters, who cast away their husbands and their children. LXX: These are all the things they have said against you in a parable, saying: Like mother, like daughter. You are the daughter of your mother, who rejected her husband and her children, and you are the sisters of your sisters who rejected their husbands and their children. He posts a catalog of vices and corrections (or corrections) in Jerusalem, through which he is drawn back to salvation, and adapts to it the well-known proverb in the common language of the people, or as the Septuagint translated it, the parable: Like mother, like daughter. However, the mother of Jerusalem, as it is written above and in the following, is called Chethaea and is interpreted as raging or turning to madness: through which the incentives of this world are shown, which lead the captive soul to destruction and separate her from her husband (without a doubt, it is said to be the word of God and his teaching). And the sister of their sisters, as we will read shortly, is called Sodom and Samaria: one of which signifies a Gentile way of life and luxury, the other the seductions of the heretics. Furthermore, what is read in the Septuagint: 'the sisters of your sisters, who rejected their husbands and their sons,' does not make sense. For what other sisters did Sodom and Samaria have that are sisters of Jerusalem? And this must be investigated: which husbands did Sodom and Samaria dismiss, and which sons did they reject? But unless we are able to say this, that the feet of those always erring fluctuate, and there are no solid footsteps which are against the truth; rather, they run here and there, and are carried about by every wind of doctrine, while they pass from falsehood to another falsehood (Ephesians IV). And when they realize that they have labored in vain at first, they move on to second and third things.

<h2 id='tocuniq175'>(Vers. 45 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 45 seqq.) Your mother is Hethaea (otherwise Chethaea), and your father is Amorrhaeus, and your older sister is Samaria: she and her daughters who dwell to your left. But your younger sister, who dwells to your right, is Sodom and her daughters. But you did not walk in their ways, nor did you commit crimes like theirs, but rather you did even more wicked things than them in all your ways. LXX: Your mother is Chethaea, and your father is Amorrhaeus, and your older sister is Samaria: she and her daughters who dwell to your left, and your younger sister, who dwells to your right, is Sodom and her daughters: and not even in her ways did you walk, nor did you act according to her iniquities, but you transgressed them in all your ways. He had said before: Your father is Amorrhaeus, and your mother is Chethaea; here the order and number are changed: Your mother is Chethaea, and your father is Amorrhaeus. For when they have committed crimes, they are divided into parts; and when their union is abandoned, they advance to a crowd and multitude, which is unable to ascend the mountains with Jesus. But the sisters of Jerusalem, Samaria and Sodom, one on the left and the other on the right, even according to physical understanding, if you look from the eastern side of the temple of Jerusalem, you will approve. Majorca is called Samaria, because she sinned first and was led into captivity by the Assyrians: and Sodom is smaller and younger, which is related to a multitude of nations. Otherwise, at that time Sodom did not exist, which was previously mentioned in the Scriptures before Jerusalem, along with Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, it was destroyed by divine fire (Genesis 19). However, between the two sisters, Jerusalem, which is also called Judea by another name, was led into Babylon by the Chaldeans: and Jerusalem sinned much more wickedly than Samaria and Sodom, worshiping the idol of Baal in the temple and later killing the Son of God. Furthermore, according to allegory, Samaria and Sodom, that is, heretics and Gentiles, often commit lesser offenses than those who are considered Jerusalem, that is, the clergy. Hence, it is said to the Corinthians, who believed in Christ but were burdened by evil deeds: It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that a man has his father's wife (1 Corinthians 5:1), and so on. The heretics, however, who nonetheless accept the old Testament, understand three natures from this passage: spiritual, animal, and earthly. And they refer the spiritual to Jerusalem; the animal to Samaria; the earthly to Sodom. Let us ask them briefly how these three natures, spiritual, animal, and earthly, which are certainly different among themselves, are said to have one mother and one father? This does not agree with their false notion. And how can the animal and earthly nature, according to the same prophet, be restored to its ancient state, that is, to the spiritual state? which is contrary to their own nature. And that Samaria is understood to refer to heresies, and in the prophet Hosea, and in many other places, especially in this testimony: Woe to those who despise Zion and who trust in the mountain of Samaria; they have plucked up the firstfruits of the nations. (Amos 6:1). For all heretics despise Zion, which is interpreted as a watchtower, and is referred to the Church; and they trust in themselves on the mountain of Samaria, namely in the pride of perverse doctrines, which they think are sublime, and through these fraudulent preachings, they plunder and devastate the foundations of the nations; so that, by the miracle of their teachings, they might draw even the powerful of the Gentiles into heretical error.

<h2 id='tocuniq176'>(Vers. 48, 49.)</h2>

(Verse 48, 49.) I live, says the Lord: that your sister Sodom herself and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done. Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, gluttony, and the abundance, and the idleness of herself and her daughters; and they did not stretch out their hand to the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and did abominations before me, and I took them away as you saw. And Samaria has not sinned half as much as your sins; but you have surpassed her in your wickedness and have justified your sisters in all your abominations that you have done. LXX: I live, says Adonai the Lord; your sister Sodom did this, both she and her daughters did as you and your daughters have done. However, the iniquity of your sister Sodom was arrogance and satiety of bread, and in abundance. She and her daughters lived in luxury and had plenty, but they did not strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. They boasted arrogantly and committed iniquities in my presence, so I took them away as you have seen. And Samaria has not half sinned with your sins, and you have multiplied your iniquities above them, and have justified your sisters in all your iniquities which you have done. That which was written by the seventy interpreters, this she and her daughters had in Hebrew, and not in the old Testament of God is an oath: As I live, says the Lord (Num. XIV, 21). But in the new: Amen, amen I say to you (Joan. XIII, 16). But if this is common with other things: the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, is not the God of the dead, but of the living (Marc. XII, 16, 27). And in another place: I will please the Lord in the land of the living (Psalm 116:9); we ask, in what way does God claim the common term for Himself properly. But how is it said that an arbor is good, and a good man, and a good shepherd, and a good servant (Luke 18); no one, however, is absolutely good, except God alone: thus, when angels and all other virtues, even patriarchs and prophets, and also apostles, are called the living in comparison with the Almighty God, they are called dead. For what man is there that liveth, and shall not see death?” (Psalm 88:49). Hence also the apostle Paul, speaking of God, says: “Who only hath immortality, dwelling in light inaccessible” (1 Timothy 6:16). And concerning the wellspring of life, he says: “For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God” (Colossians 3:3). Therefore, he who swears and speaks, saying: “As I live, saith the Lord,” describes the sins of Sodom and her daughters, and sets forth their first pride, which is the special sin of the devil and the first sin. Where the same Apostle says: 'Lest being puffed up he fall into judgment of the devil' (I Tim. III, 6), because of which he fell from heaven. For he had said: 'By strength I will do it, and by wisdom I will remove the bounds of the peoples, and I will destroy the strength of them that are mighty, and I will shake the inhabited cities, and I will take away the whole world as with the hand, as a nest, and as the eggs that are left, I will gather' (Isai. X, 13, 14). And: 'God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble' (Jacob IV, 6). We also read in another place: Why do you boast, O earth and ashes? And the Gospel recounts the Pharisee's pride, overcome by the humility of the tax collector (Luke 18): whose garden is filled with the abundance of bread and all things, and with leisure; or as the LXX translated it, with the opulence of delights and luxury. That rich man in the Gospel, clothed in purple (Luke 16), is reported to have had no other fault than that, being rich in wealth and abundance, he had burst forth in such great pride that he did not reach out his hand to the poor and needy Lazarus: and thus he forgot his own condition, to the point that he did not even give to this wretched man what was to be thrown away. For what reason and in another place is it written: Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted (Luke XIV, 11). Pride, gluttony, abundance of all things, leisure and luxury, are Sodomitic sins, and because of this, there follows forgetfulness of God, which considers present goods to be perpetual and never in need of necessary things. Therefore, it is also commanded by the law: Take heed, lest when you eat and drink and are satisfied, and build good houses and possess flocks and herds, silver, and gold, you forget the Lord your God (Deuteronomy VIII, 11). And in another place it is written about Israel: He ate and drank, and became satisfied, and grew fat, and kicked. (Deut. XXXII, 15) Knowing this, the wisest of all, Solomon, prays in Proverbs: Give me what is necessary and sufficient, so that I may not become satisfied and deny you, saying: Who will see me? Or becoming poor, I may steal and profane the name of my God. (Prov. XXX, 8, 9) And what follows: and you justified your sisters in all your abominations, which you have done, not simply asserting that Sodom and Samaria were just, but by comparing them to worse things, just as the tax collector, whom we mentioned before, is not called completely just, but by comparison to someone worse. And yet even though Sodom and Samaria are such wicked places, they did not sin even half as much as Jerusalem. For the servant who knows his master's will and does not do it will be punished severely (Luke 12:47). And: The mighty will endure torment mightily (Wisdom 6:7). Furthermore, concerning the idea that leisure is included in Hebrew for delights (or riches), it should be understood to refer to this meaning: In idle pursuits, the soul is restless; that is, there is always something to be done, so that the field of our heart does not become overgrown with the thorns of evil thoughts when our hand ceases to act.


<h2 id='tocuniq177'>(Vers. 52.)</h2>

(Verse 52.) Therefore, you also bear your own shame, as you have surpassed your sisters in your sins, acting more wickedly than them (or, done to them): for they are justified from you. LXX: And you will endure your torment in that you have corrupted your sisters in your sins, in which you have unjustly treated them, and you have justified them over yourself. The second tablet after the shipwreck is to be ashamed when you have sinned and not subject to the reproof, which is said against Jerusalem: You have become like a harlot, and you do not know how to be ashamed (Jeremiah 3:3). He carries his own torment, who is tormented by his own conscience, and in this world endures his own torment by his own will, so that he does not endure eternal torment (Genesis 4). And we corrupt our brothers and sisters, or rather, they are provoked to greater sins by our sins. What I say will become clearer: Imagine someone in a position of priesthood not living well, and tarnishing the dignity with their actions. Surely, by imitating his vices, the lay brother is corrupted? For whoever scandalizes one of the least ones, it would be better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and be thrown into the depths (Matt. XVIII, 6). Likewise, the sisters of Jerusalem are justified by comparing them to Sodom and Samaria, not because they are inherently righteous, but as we said, by comparison to the worse.

So you will also be confused; and your gate will bear your shame, which you justified your sisters. Seventy: And you will be confused, and you will bear your shame, because you justified your sisters. Confusion follows shame: shame correction: correction consolation: consolation salvation: according to the saying of the Apostle: Tribulation worketh patience: and patience trial: and trial hope: but hope confoundeth not (Rom. V, 3-5). There is no doubt that in the future: because at present he destroys his sins through confusion. This and that of the Gospel also speak: There is confusion that leads to death, and there is confusion that leads to life (Eccli. 4:25). The Holy Spirit also encourages sinners in the Psalms: Let all my enemies be confounded and ashamed: let them turn back and be confounded and very quickly (Psalm 39:15). It is written elsewhere: Declare your sins first, that you may be justified (Isa. 43:26, sec. LXX). And again: The righteous is his own accuser at the beginning of his speech (Prov. XVIII, 17). Therefore, it is not surprising if Jerusalem is provoked to confusion and shame; for she has sinned so much as to have justified her sisters. To her it is subsequently said: And you, and your daughters, return to your former state.

<h2 id='tocuniq178'>(Vers 53, 54.)</h2>

(Verse 53, 54) And I will restore their fortunes, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters. And I will restore your own fortunes in their midst, that you may bear your disgrace and may be ashamed of all that you have done, comforting them.\n\nLXX: And I will restore their fortunes, the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, the fortunes of Samaria and her daughters, and I will restore your own fortunes in their midst, that you may bear your punishment and have disgrace for all that you have done, in provoking me to anger. Great was the progress of Jerusalem, as after the confusion and disgrace, which it willingly accepted and bore inflicted upon it by the judgment of God, saying: I will bear the anger of the Lord, because I have sinned against Him, let restoration to its former state be promised to it. But yet, because in comparison with its sins, Sodom and Samaria were justified, of which one is on the right and the other on the left; first, the conversion or captivity of Sodom is restored, as Aquila has interpreted it; secondly, the captivity of Samaria, as the same Aquila and Symmachus have translated; and finally, Jerusalem, which had been oppressed by greater iniquity, and had shown its sinful sisters to be just by comparison with itself, will be restored. For who doubts that among three sinners, or rather impious, the Gentile, the heretic, the ecclesiastic, the one who is of greater dignity is worthy of much greater punishments? For the powerful, as we have said, endure torments powerfully. But the one who is of lesser dignity is worthy of mercy. And the servant who knows the will of his master and does not do it, will be beaten with many blows. Hence also Peter says: For the time has come for judgment to begin from the house of the Lord. And in this same passage, the prophet commands those who have axes to start from my holy ones (above, IX, 6), so that Jerusalem, having turned and restored to its former state before her sisters, may bear her disgrace, and be confounded, and be ashamed of the things she has sinned, and may comfort her sisters in all things, while she endures more grievous things (Jeremiah VI). Or certainly let her be confounded and ashamed, because she has provoked God to anger. From which it is clear that God does not have natural anger, but rather he is the most merciful and gentle God, provoked to anger by our own vices, as the Apostle says: Do you despise the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and patience? Do you not realize that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself (Romans 2:4-5), which God does not have naturally. And it is written elsewhere: You have let loose your anger that consumed them like stubble (Exodus XV, 7). For what is joined together and united in one body cannot be thrown, but that which is outside the body. For example, a spear, weapon, arrow, sword. We also read in the Gospel (Matthew X, 15) that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for those who do not receive the apostles.

<h2 id='tocuniq179'>(Vers. 55.)</h2>

(Verse 55.) And your sister Sodom and her daughters will return to their former state. And Samaria and her daughters will return to their former state. And you and your daughters will return to your former state. LXX: And your sister Sodom and her daughters will be restored as they were at the beginning, and Samaria and her daughters will be restored as they were at the beginning. And you and your daughters will be restored as you were from the beginning. Among other fables and endless genealogies and delusions that they invent, the Jews also dream this, that in the coming of their Christ, whom we know as the Antichrist, and in his thousand-year reign, Sodom will be restored to its ancient state, so that it will be like the paradise of God, and like the land of Egypt; and Samaria will regain its former prosperity, so that the Assyrians will return to the land of Judah (4 Kings, 17, 18). For we read that the ten tribes were captured by the kings of Assyria, namely Phul, Salmanassar, and Teglathphalassar, and to this day they remain in captivity. Also, at that time Jerusalem must be rebuilt, along with all its daughters, that is, the cities, villages, and castles that will be under its future authority, flourishing as they once did. And Jerusalem itself must be built with gold, silver, and precious stones, as Isaiah prophesies: I will restore your judges as at first, and your counselors as in the beginning, and afterwards you will be called the city of righteousness, the faithful mother of cities of Zion (Isa. 1:26); and our Apocalypse speaks: And David sings: Do well, O Lord, in your good will to Zion, and let the walls of Jerusalem be built (Ps. 50:20). And in another place: Cities of Judah will be built, and they will inhabit and dwell there, and their seed will be directed forever (Ps. LXVIII, 36). But we, leaving the perfect knowledge of these things to the judgment of God, indeed confessing with certainty, after the second coming of the Lord and Savior, that nothing humble, nothing earthly, will be future; but we say that the heavenly kingdoms which are first promised in the Gospel, are completed in the state of the Church and are continually being completed. Sodom returns to its ancient state, when it once again follows its natural inclinations and the wicked soul recognizes its Creator. Samaria regains its ancient blessedness, forsaking the error of heretics and joining the teachings and faith of Christianity. And when these have returned, and Jerusalem, the vision of peace, which is interpreted as the Church, will return to its former state. As it is written: 'His tent is in peace' (Psalm 76:2); and: 'Jerusalem, which is built as a city that is compact together' (Psalm 122:3); and in the Apostle: 'But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all' (Galatians 4:26); and in the same: 'You have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels' (Hebrews 12:22). And he returns with his daughters, who are dispersed throughout the whole world. We have discussed this more fully in the explanations of Isaiah.

<h2 id='tocuniq180'>(Vers. 56 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 56 and following) However, your sister Sodom was not heard in your mouth in the day of your pride before your wickedness was revealed, as it is now with the disgrace of the daughters of Syria and all the daughters of Palestine around you who surround you. You have borne your own wickedness and disgrace, says the Lord God. LXX: If your sister Sodom had not been in your mouth to hear in the days of your pride before your wickedness was revealed, as it is now with the daughters of Syria, and if this had not happened, what would have become of you and all the daughters of foreigners around you who surround you?" } You carry your impieties and your iniquities. Symmachus interpreted this passage as follows: Because your sister Sodom was not heard through your mouth on the day of your pride, before your disgrace was revealed, as in the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all the daughters of Palestine who surround you and encircle you. You will carry your wickedness and your vileness. Theodotion translates it as follows: And your sister Sodom was not heard through your mouth on the day of your pride, before your evil was revealed: as the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all the foreign daughters around her, who abhor you and surround you. You have borne your fornication and your contaminations, says the Lord Adonai. Our translation corresponds to the Aquila edition; I have set them all down so that, through comparing all of them, we might be able to find some trace of meaning, and in the meantime, without prejudice from others, it seems to us that the order of reading should be restored thus: In the days of your pride, when you sinned, you did not remember the downfall of your sister Sodom before your wickedness was exposed to such an extent, that you became a reproach to all the cities of Syria and Palestine that are around you. Since you have conquered in the crime against your sister and were not terrified by her example so as to endure similar things and restrain your foot, now, however, your ignominy has been revealed, listen to God's judgement. Either carry, according to the Septuagint; or you have carried, according to Aquila and Theodotion; or you will carry, according to Symmachus, your crime and ignominy, so that after you have endured punishment for sacrilege, you may obtain forgiveness not by your own agreement, but by my mercy. In the Hebrew language, Syria is called Aram, which means 'sublimity'. And according to the explanation of that passage of the prophet Isaiah, in which Aram and Ephraim conspire against Judah and Jerusalem, the clever wisdom of the heathen and that which promises itself the sublimity of knowledge, is joined to the malice of heretics and attacks Judah, in which true confession is and cannot be overcome. Likewise, this same arrogance of Syria, that is, of the philosophers with the daughters of foreigners, in whom the manifold errors of diverse teachings among nations are shown, mocks Jerusalem and holds her in contempt, by whom she is overcome in vices.

(Verse 59 onwards) 188 Because thus says the Lord God: And I will do to you as you have despised the oath, to make the covenant void. And I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. And you shall remember your ways, and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both the older and the younger; and I will give them to you as daughters, but not because of your covenant. And I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the Lord, so that you may remember and be confounded, and never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I forgive you for all that you have done, says the Lord God. LXX: Thus says the Lord God: And I will do to you as you have done, you who have despised these things, so that you may transgress my covenant. And I will remember my covenant that I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish with you an everlasting covenant. And you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your older sisters with your younger sisters, and I will give them to you as a trial, not according to your covenant. And I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the Lord, so that you may remember and be confounded and may never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I atone for you for all that you have done, says the Lord God. Therefore, I said to you: your crime and your shame you bear, whether you have borne it or will bear it; so that you may receive what you deserve: because you have despised my oath and nullified my covenant. But when it is fulfilled, I will kill, and I will give life; I will strike, and I will heal (Deut. XXXII, 39): then I will remember my covenant, which I once had with you. And I will raise up for you a covenant, not of the law that has passed, but an eternal covenant of the Gospel: so that when you remember your ways, and receive your greater and lesser sisters, or their companions, I will give them to you as daughters, or as a proof (for there must be heresies, so that those who are approved may become manifest), not according to your merit, but according to my mercy, and then you shall know that I am the Lord; and you shall remember my benefits, and be confounded, and say according to the Apostle: 'I am not worthy to be called an Apostle: because I persecuted the Church of God' (I Cor. XV, 9). And let not your mouth be opened any more because of your shame. For it is the privilege of the saints to open their mouth according to the Apostle who says: My mouth is open to you, O Corinthians (II Cor. VI, 11); and of the Lord and Savior, who, opening His mouth, taught them (Matth. V), and also in the Psalm: I will open my mouth in parables (Ps. LXXVII, 2). But to the sinner it is said: You have sinned: be silent (Gen. IV). And: Why do you take my covenant in your mouth? (Ps. XLIX, 16). And it is not beautiful praise in the mouth of a sinner (Sirach 15:9). And the holy one deserves to hear: Open your mouth, and I will fill it (Psalm 81:11). From which we understand that even when we have received the previous glory through the mercy of God, and indeed have received the eternal covenant of the Gospel, after the Lord has been appeased to us in all that we have done, we should keep the memory of our past sin and always keep our mouth shut, because we are saved not by our own works, but by the grace of God.


<h2 id='tocuniq182'>(Cap. XVII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 17, verses 1 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, propose an enigma, narrate a parable to the house of Israel, and say: Thus says the Lord God: A great eagle with large wings, long feathers, full of feathers and variety, came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar. He pulled out the top of its branches and carried it to the land of Canaan, and placed it in a city of merchants. And he took from the seed of the earth, and placed it in the earth for seed in order to establish roots above many waters; he placed it on the surface. And when it sprouted, it grew into a vine of wide breadth with low stature: its branches looked toward it, and its roots were under it. So the vineyard was made, and it bore fruit in branches, and sent out shoots. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, tell a narrative, and speak a parable to the house of Israel, and say: Thus says the Lord God: A great eagle with great wings, long in plumage, full of talons, which has a long path to enter Lebanon, and took the choicest cedar. He uprooted the tops of tenderness and brought them to the land of Canaan. He placed it in a walled city and took it from the seed of the earth and gave it a plantation in a field above many waters. He put it there to be looked at: it sprouted and became a weak and small vine, so that only 190 branches appeared under it, and its roots were beneath it. And it became a great vineyard, and it produced branches and extended its branches. When the prophets are said to say: Propose a riddle, tell a parable, or as the LXX translated: tell a narrative, and speak a parable, it is shown that what is said is obscure. For there is no doubt that to utter a riddle and a parable is one thing in words, and another thing in meaning. And the Savior indeed spoke to the people in parables, which he explained in secret to the apostles. Therefore, we must understand riddles and parables in such a way, as if riddles and parables are Two are presented now in the prophecy of Ezekiel by the Aquila. Now, first of all, we must speak: in the following we shall discuss the second. And in the meantime, let us make a simple story. The great eagle, with its large wings, long body, full of feathers and variety, or as the Septuagint says, full of claws, is King Nebuchadnezzar of the Chaldeans, of whom Hosea also speaks: Like an eagle over the house of God (Hosea 8:1). He, commanding many nations and surrounded by an innumerable army, came over the house of God, undoubtedly the temple, or as Scripture says now, to Lebanon, of which Zechariah speaks: Open your gates, Lebanon, and let fire devour your cedars. Howl, O fir tree, for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down. There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled. Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not. For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them. And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me. Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another. And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people. And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD. And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD. Of whom, as the Scripture of the Evangelist Matthew testifies (Matt. 1), our Lord and Savior was born through Salathiel and Zorobabel. He brought forth from the same land's seed, that is, from the royal lineage, Matthan the uncle of Jechoniah, whose name he changed, and called him Sedecias, and made him king in Jerusalem, and set him over many peoples. And yet he placed him on the surface, and did not establish the power of his empire on a deep root: but he appointed him to be seen, and to be under the authority of Babylon, or of humble stature, with his branches looking towards it: so that he would indeed rule over the people of Judah; but he would look towards the command of the Babylonians." } For this is what Scripture says: A small stature, with branches reaching toward it, the eagle is understood. This is more clearly translated by the Seventy, and it happened to be planted in a weak and small vineyard: so that its branches alone appeared, it seemed to indeed have a kingdom, but its kingdom itself was lowly and feeble, ruled by the authority of the Babylonian prince. This is what is mentioned in the current chapter, to which we shall add the rest.


<h2 id='tocuniq183'>(Vers. 7 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 7 seqq.) And there was another large eagle, with great wings and many feathers. And behold, this vine, as if sending out its roots toward it, extends its branches toward that eagle, to be watered by the irrigation of its shoots. It planted it in good soil, by many waters, so that it would produce leaves and bear fruit, and be a great vineyard. Say: Thus says the Lord God: Will it prosper? Will it not uproot its roots and break its fruit off, causing all the shoots of its sprouting to wither and dry up, so that it will not exert a mighty arm or have many people to uproot it completely? Behold, it is planted, so will it prosper? Will it not wither when the burning wind touches it, and be dried up, and its shoots wither in the dry ground? LXX: And another great eagle came, with large wings and many claws: and behold, this vine was entwined with it, and its roots were attached to it, and its branches spread out to it, to water it with the soil of its planting. In a good field, over much water, it was nourished: to produce shoots and bring forth fruit, and to become a great vineyard. Therefore say: Thus says the Lord God: Will it thrive? Will not its roots wither and its fruit rot, and all the vegetation that springs up from it wither and dry up? It will not thrive, even with a strong arm or a large population, to uproot it from its roots. And behold, it fattens up. Will it thrive? As soon as the scorching wind touches it, it will wither, dry up, and be dried by the heat. Will not its fertile soil dry up? The second eagle, that is, the other one, and it too is large, full of feathers, with many talons, because of its rapacity and the devastation of many nations, is the king of Egypt, Pharaoh. And behold, this vine is understood to be King Zedekiah, who had been established by Nebuchadnezzar in Jerusalem, began, he says, to send his shoots to it, that is, to the king of the Egyptians, to send messengers, and to ask for help from him against the king to whom he was subject. For this is what the Scripture now says, that it may water it from the channels of its growth. This vine, which was planted in good soil by Nebuchadnezzar, to produce leaves and bear fruit and grow into a larger vineyard, is therefore commanded by the prophet to speak to the vine, which was planted by Nebuchadnezzar, and has sent its branches to the Egyptian eagle: will it thrive because it has attempted to do this, and will not all its shoots and branches soon wither? And he said, 'Did he not flee with the powerful arm, and a multitude of people? For fleeing from King Zedekiah and being deserted by the help of the Egyptian king, he was captured by the generals of Nebuchadnezzar in the deserts of Hierichontiis (also known as Hierichuntis). And all his companions were scattered here and there, as is written in the books of Kings and Chronicles, and in the book of Jeremiah (2 Kings 25, Jeremiah 39).'

<h2 id='tocuniq184'>(Vers. 11 seqq.)</h2>

(Ver. 11 seq.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Say to the rebellious house: Do you not know what these things mean? Say: Behold, the king of Babylon is coming to Jerusalem, and he will take the king and the princes and bring them to himself in Babylon. And he will take some of the royal offspring and make a covenant with him, and he will take an oath from him. But he will also take strong men from the land, so that his kingdom will be lowly and not exalted, but will keep his covenant and observe it. When he departs from him, he sends messengers to Egypt, to give him horses and a great army. Will he succeed? Will he escape who has done these things? Can he break the covenant and yet escape? As I live, declares the Lord God, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant with him he broke, in Babylon he shall die. Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war, when mounds are cast up and siege walls built to cut off many lives. He had indeed despised the oath, to break the covenant. And behold, he stretched out his hand: and after he has done all these things, he shall not escape. This is a riddle, this is a parable, which the Scripture showed under the two eagles and the vineyard, the two kings of Babylon and Egypt; and King Zedekiah, who, against the oath, abandoned his friendship with Nebuchadnezzar and transferred himself to the king of Egypt. He shall strike a covenant with him, and he shall take an oath to him, to keep his covenant and preserve it. He who breaks a covenant, it is said, will not escape. And from this we learn that faith must be kept even among enemies, and that it doesn't matter to whom, but by whom you have sworn. For he who believed in your name for the sake of God is found to be much more faithful, and he was deceived by you, who, under the pretext of divine majesty, plotted treason against your enemy, or rather, your friend by now. For, as it is said, in the place of the king who appointed him as king, whose oath he made void, and the covenant he had with him was broken, he will die in the midst of Babylon. For we read that Zedekiah was captured, taken to Riblah, and there his sons were killed before his eyes, and then blinded like a wild animal in a cage, and transported to Babylon (2 Kings 25). Therefore, even though Scripture may seem contradictory to itself, it is nevertheless true in both instances. For it had been prophesied to Zedekiah, 'You will enter Babylon, and you will not see it' (Jeremiah 34:4). He did enter Babylon, because he was taken there, but he did not see it, because he was blinded. But that which follows, 'And he shall not engage in battle against him with a great army, nor shall he make war with a multitude of people against him; in the casting up of mounds, and in the building of ramparts, in order to kill many souls,' is understood in two ways: either the Egyptian king coming against King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon will not be able to fight, nor resist such a multitude with a small army; or King Zedekiah himself will be conquered by Pharaoh, from whom he hoped for assistance: not that Pharaoh conquered him, or that the Scripture testifies to this anywhere; but rather the conquest by Nebuchadnezzar was carried out by the intervention of the Egyptian king. And it was not this king who was seen besieging Jerusalem, but the one in whom Zedekiah had vainly hoped. Behold, he said, he reached out his hand to the king of Egypt and surrendered himself; and he committed perjury and sacrilege against God. Will it benefit him, he said? And when he has done all these things, he will not escape.

<h2 id='tocuniq185'>(Vers. 19 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 19 and following) Therefore, thus says the Lord God: As I live, surely I will bring down upon his head the oath that he despised and the covenant that he broke. I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my snare; I will bring him to Babylon and there I will judge him for his unfaithfulness in which he despised me. And all his fugitives, along with all the troops with them, will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to every wind. Then you will know that I am the Lord, who has spoken. The saying is secular.

Trickery or virtue, who seeks in an enemy? Those who say that enemies are to be deceived by deceit are accustomed to oppose us. To whom should we acquiesce? Sedecias did far worse: for he deceived not an enemy, but a friend, with whom he had been joined in a covenant of the Lord. Therefore, as long as you do not swear and enter into an agreement in the name of the Lord, it is a matter of prudence and fortitude, either to deceive or overcome your adversary in any way you can. However, when you bind yourself by an oath, it is not an adversary, but a friend who has trusted you; and under the pretext of an oath, that is, the invocation of God, he has been deceived. Therefore, the Scripture now says: I will put the oath that he despised, and the covenant that he broke, on his head. And so that we do not think that the oath, covenant, and agreement belong to the king of Babylon or to Zedekiah who made it, it follows: In the transgression when he despised me. Therefore, whoever despises the oath, despises the one by whom he swore, and he does wrong to the one whose name he trusted. For this reason, I will spread my net over him, says the LORD, and he will be taken in my snare; I will bring him to Babylon and I will bring him to judgment there. Therefore, whatever Nebuchadnezzar did against Zedekiah, he did not do it by his own strength, but by the anger of God, in whose name Zedekiah had sworn falsely. According to Agogen, although the interpretation may seem violent, it must be understood that just as all other living creatures are commonly referred to in both good and bad terms, so it is with the eagle and the lion. In a good sense, it is said: The Lion's cub of Judah (Genesis 49:9). In a contrary sense: Our adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion (1 Peter 5:8). And in Psalm it says: He lies in wait in secret places, like a lion in his den; he lies in wait to catch the poor (Ps. IX, 9). It is said in a positive sense about the eagle, that the righteous, becoming rich, makes wings for himself like eagles, so that he can return to the house of his predecessor. And in Isaiah it is written, that the righteous shall bring forth wings like eagles (Isa. XL): they shall run and not be weary: they shall walk and not faint. And rightly did he who said: With strength will I make, and with the understanding of intelligence will I take away the bounds of the nations, and their strength will I plunder: and I will shake cities which are inhabited, and the whole world I will seize with my hand as a nest, and as broken eggs (Ibid., X, 13, 14), now described under the persona of an eagle: not wanting at all to harm the Lebanon, which is interpreted as whiteness, and is referred to as incense, he lashes out at the tops of the cedars, and at princes, and at the royal lineage, according to that verse in Habakkuk: His food is choice (Abac. I, 16). And he makes a testament, that those whom he has taken captive may submit their necks to the Babylonian king, and fulfill what the Apostle speaks: Whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may not blaspheme (I Tim. I, 20). And in another place: Whom I have delivered, he says, to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved (I Cor. V). Therefore, if perhaps we are cast out from the congregation of brothers and from the house of God because of some sin, we should not resist: but with a calm mind, bear the sentence passed against us, and say with the Prophet (Mich. VII, 9), I will endure the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against Him, until He justifies my cause, and so on. And it often happens that we, who are subject to one another, pass from one to another, who promise us their help; and they do not remain in their previous opinion. This must be avoided by all means, lest our shoots wither and our seeds dry up: and we are believed to act against God's covenant.

<h2 id='tocuniq186'>(Vers. 22 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 22 and following) Thus says the Lord (God is added in the Vulgate): And I will take from the top of the cedar's branch, and I will put from the top of its branches; I will break off a tender one, and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain: on a high mountain of Israel I will plant it. And it will sprout into a shoot, and it will bear fruit, and it will become a great cedar, and all birds will dwell under its shade: every flying creature will nest under its leafy branches. And all the trees of the field will know that I, the Lord, have humbled the tall tree and exalted the low tree, and I have dried up the green tree, and I have made the dry tree flourish. I, the Lord, have spoken and have done. LXX: For thus says the Lord God: I will take from the top of the choice cedars, and from the head of their branches I will tear off a tender shoot, and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain. On the mountain height of Israel I will plant it, that it may bear branches, produce fruit, and become a majestic cedar. Under it will dwell birds of every sort, and in the shade of its branches they will nest. And all the trees of the field shall know that I am the Lord; I bring low the high tree, and make high the low tree, dry up the green tree, and make the dry tree flourish. I am the Lord who speaks and acts. This is what is read in the Septuagint: 'And I will take from the top of its branches,' which is added in the Theodotion edition. And what follows: 'And its branches will be restored,' is marked with an obelus because it is not found in the Hebrew. The true Nebuchadnezzar therefore takes from the topmost part of the cedar's trunk, from the top of its branches, so that his kingdom may be humble and not exalted. But the Lord God Almighty, who spoke to Ezekiel, takes from the royal lineage and from the lineage of David; and he plants on a high and lofty mountain, as it is written in the psalm: 'But I have been set up as king by Him on His holy mountain of Sion' (Ps. II, 6). For the ruler of Judah has failed, and the leader of Israel, until he comes to whom it belongs. And he shall be the expectation of the nations. This one has come forth as a shoot and has produced fruit, and he has surpassed all cedars by his loftiness, so that all the birds of the sky dwell under him and all the creatures of his shadow are protected. Concerning him, Habakkuk says: His power is hidden in his horns. And he desires to gather his chicks under his wings, like a hen. So that all the trees of the region may know that he is the Lord. Speaking in allegories about believers: This is the one who once humbled the exalted tree of Israel, and exalted the humble people of the nations, who dried up the green tree of the Jews, flourishing and sprouting in the Law and the Prophets; and made the dry tree of the nations bear fruit: so that he might fulfill with his works what he always spoke. The same thing is signified by the words of Simeon in the Gospel, saying: Behold, this one is set for the falling and rising of many (Luke 2:34). And the grain of mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds, when it has grown, becomes a dwelling place for birds (Matthew 13:32). Some interpret it differently, the lofty tree humbled, and the humble exalted, referring to the passion of the Lord and Savior. Who, being in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant (Philippians 2:6-7); and after the resurrection, the same tree was exalted, which was first green, dried up by death, and then revived, regaining its original greenness. Others refer both to Israel: that first he will come in humility and be dried up: and second he will be restored to his former state, with the fulfillment of what the Apostle Paul says: When the fullness of the Gentiles comes in, then all Israel will be saved (Deuteronomy 5:9-10).

Book Six

I thought that, once the serpent was killed, the new heads of the hydra would not revive, and, according to the fables of the poets, that Scylla, being dead, would not torment me with the Scyllaean dogs that do not cease to bark. And yet, even with the heretics of God struck down by His hand so that they may not be tempted, if possible, even the chosen ones of God (Matthew 24), heresy itself does not die. They have left behind their hateful puppies, who pretend to be ours but do not abandon the poisons of their ancient mother and the deceitful Ulysses. They only smear their lips with honey and, as the words of the Scriptures say (Psalm 54), they make their words softer than oil. But they themselves are arrows and fiery darts that must be repelled and extinguished by the shield of faith. I have said these things, daughter Eustochium, in order to encourage you to assist me in my prophetic work and to resist the heretics with prayers. May the Lord explain, through my mouth and with his understanding, the sixth volume of the Explanations on Ezekiel. And may the same Spirit of grace, by which the things revealed to the prophets were written, also be revealed to us as we discuss them, so that we may be able to say: I opened my mouth and breathed in the spirit (Psalm 118, 131).

<h2 id='tocuniq188'>(Cap. XVIII.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter XVIII, Verses 1, 2) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: What do you mean by turning this proverb into a parable in the land of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: ÷ Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? What the Seventy said, son of man, is not found in Hebrew. However, the divine Scripture warns of that which was said in Exodus: I am the Lord your God. A jealous God, who punishes the sins of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation for those who hate me, and shows mercy to thousands for those who love me and keep my commandments (Exod. X, 5; Deut. V, 9, 10). And again: The Lord descended in a cloud and stood with Moses, and Moses called upon the name of the Lord, and the Lord passed before his face, and called out to him, saying: O Lord God, merciful and gracious, patient and full of mercy, and truthful, and one who keeps justice, and shows mercy to thousands, forgiving iniquities, and transgressions, and sins: and he does not cleanse the iniquities of the fathers upon the children and upon the children's children, to the third and fourth generation (Exod. XXXIV, 5 seq.), it should be understood in such a way, as a proverb and a parable, so that it sounds one thing in words and holds another sense; as we have said above concerning the parable of the two eagles. And the Lord also says in the seventy-seventh psalm: I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter propositions from the beginning (Ps. LXXVII, 15). And in the Gospel, He presents the parable of the sower, the tares, and the mustard seed, which, though it is the smallest of all seeds, grows into a great tree (Matt. XIII), in such a way that He presents one thing in words and holds another in meaning. And until this present day, we believed that the two testimonies from Exodus, which we placed above (Isa. XXIX), were not a parable, but a simple explanation of the sentiment. And although we did not dare to say anything, nor did a clay vessel speak against the potter, why did you make me this way, in this way: still, we endured a hidden scandal, that the injustice of God seemed to cause one person to sin and another to pay for sins. For if the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children to the third and fourth generations, it seems unfair for one person to sin and another to be punished. But from what follows: to those who hate me, the scandal of a threat or command is resolved. For they are not punished in the third and fourth generation because their fathers sinned, since it is rather the fathers who were sinners that should have been punished; but because they became imitators of their fathers and hated God with inherited evil and impiety, even as the branches grow from the root. Heretics in this place, who do not accept the Old Testament, often say against the creator: How good and just is the God of the Law and the Prophets, who, while silent and inactive toward the sins of the fathers, repays those who have not sinned; in fact, how much cruelty is there on His part, that He extends His wrath even to the third and fourth generation! We will respond to those who accuse us, and in this the mercy of the Creator God is demonstrated. For it is not of cruelty and severity to maintain anger unto the third and fourth generation, but a sign of mercy to delay the punishment of sin. For when it says: O Lord God, merciful and compassionate, patient and full of mercy; and it adds: punishing the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children's children, it indicates that his mercy is so great that he does not immediately punish, but postpones the sentence of punishment. But if the punishment of sinners is deferred to the third and fourth generation, what more does it do for the just and holy? It follows: And keeping justice and mercy for many thousands who keep His commandments and do His precepts. It is written in Proverbs: As the sour grape is harmful to the teeth, and smoke to the eyes, so is iniquity to those who use it (Prov. X, 26). From this it is clear that it is not the teeth of others that ache and become numb, but those who have eaten the sour grape. But the meaning of this passage is as follows: just as if someone were to say, 'The fathers ate a sour grape, and the teeth of the sons were set on edge,' it is ridiculous and lacks consequence, so it is unjust and perverse for fathers to sin and for sons and grandsons to be tormented. There are those who interpret what is written in Exodus, 'visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation,' in such a way that they apply it to the human soul, saying that the father is a light touch and the source of sensory actions and vices, while the son, if the thought of sin is conceived, and the grandsons, if you conceive and commit any evil act, and the great-grandson, that is, the fourth generation, if you not only do what is evil and criminal but also glory in your crimes, according to what is written (Ibid., XVIII, 3): 'When the wicked has come into the depths of evil, he scorns.' Therefore, God does not punish the first and second impulses of thoughts, which the Greeks call 'propatheia', without which no one can exist. But if someone decides to act on their thoughts, or if they refuse to correct the actions they have taken, then punishment will follow. Hence, it is written: No one is without sin, not even if their life lasts only one day. But the years of their life are countless. (Prov. XX, 9). And in another place: Who can boast of having a pure heart? And again: Even the stars are not clean in his sight: and against his angels he found wickedness (Job 25:5). But if that exalted nature is not free from sin, what can be said of humans, who are surrounded by frail flesh? They should speak with the Apostle: Wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from this body of death (Romans 7:24)? And also, when we have done everything, we should say: We are worthless servants; we have only done what we ought to have done (Luke 17:10). And: Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain; unless the Lord guards the city, the guard keeps watch in vain (Psalm 127:1). But for the proof of this matter, that not the first impulse of thought, indeed, but the small instinct of the mind is punished by God, but if you consume in action what you have conceived in mind, it must be brought up from Genesis: Ham sinned, mocking the nakedness of his father; and it was not he who laughed who received the sentence, but his son Canaan: Cursed be Canaan; he shall be a servant to his brothers (Genesis 9). For what justice is there if a father sins and the sentence is pronounced against the son? Moreover, the statement made by the Apostle (1 Timothy 2) that a woman will be saved if her children remain in faith, sanctity, and chastity, seems to lack justice, as if good children and grandchildren would save their parents. For how many holy parents have wicked children, and conversely, how many sinful parents have righteous and holy children? Therefore, according to this interpretation, everything that we have said above must be understood as meaning that the sins of parents and ancestors should be punished in the branches, not in the root. Let it suffice for now to have said this about the proverb or parable: that the Law and the Prophets, that is, Exodus and Ezekiel, indeed God himself who has spoken here and there, should by no means seem to disagree in their teachings or correct what he said there. But if anyone can find a better or alternative interpretation that reconciles the contradictions in these testimonies, it is better to accept their opinion.


<h2 id='tocuniq189'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(Verse 3, 4.) As I live, says the Lord, there shall no longer be to you this proverb in Israel. Behold, all souls are mine: as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine. The soul that sins, it shall die. LXX: As I live, says the Lord God, there shall be no more mention of this proverb in Israel: for all souls are mine. As the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine. The soul that sins, it shall die. What it signifies, I live, says the Lord, and the parable, or proverb, above we have spoken more fully: which will never be said in Israel, but in those who do not have knowledge of God, nor can discern the truth. All, he says, are my souls; according to creature, not according to merit: as Moses was called a man of God, of whom it is written: The prayer of Moses, the man of God (Deuteronomy 33:1). And Elijah, who spoke to the captain of fifty soldiers: And if I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven upon you, and upon the fifty men (2 Kings 1:12). But a person who commits sin and is a son of iniquity is not called a child of God, as servants and slaves of God are called, of whom it cannot be said: Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin (John 8:34). And again: For by whatever a person is overcome, by that he is enslaved (2 Peter 2:19). Just as the sins of children do not harm their parents, so the sins of parents do not overflow onto their children; but the soul that sins, it shall die: not by the abolition of its substance, but from its association with Him who says: I am the life (John 14:6). And elsewhere he says: Everyone who lives and believes in me shall not die forever (John XI, 26). And: Amen, amen I say to you: If anyone keeps my word, he shall not see death forever (John VIII, 51); for our life is hidden with Christ in God (Colossians III, 3); and that which is written will be fulfilled: Amen, amen I say to you: If anyone hears my word and believes in him who sent me, he has eternal life and does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life (John V, 24). But what is said by Balaam, 'Let my soul die with the souls of the righteous' (Num. XXIII, 10): this has the meaning that he desires to die to the world and sin, and to live with the souls of the righteous, whose life is Christ, and they are able to sing: 'I will please the Lord in the land of the living' (Ps. CXIV, 9). For God is not the God of the dead, but of the living' (Matth. XXII, 32). And if Balaam, as is likely, is translated into our language, he sounds like a vain people: it is clear that a vain people of the nations desires to have fellowship with the souls of the righteous, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are called 'straight' and 'just'. And the book of Genesis received its name from their word.

<h2 id='tocuniq190'>(Vers. 5, 6 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 5, 6 and following) And if a man is righteous and does judgment and justice; does not eat on the mountains or lift his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel; does not violate his neighbor's wife or approach a menstruating woman; does not oppress anyone; returns a pledge to the debtor; does not commit robbery; gives bread to the hungry; covers the naked with clothing; does not lend money at interest or take excessive interest; turns his hand away from iniquity; judges truly between man and man; walks in my statutes and keeps my judgments to do truth: this man is righteous, he shall surely live, says the Lord God. LXX; But the man who is righteous, who practices justice and righteousness; he does not eat up on the mountains, and does not lift his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel; he does not defile his neighbor's wife, and does not approach a woman during her menstrual flow; he does not oppress anyone, he returns a debtor's pledge, he does not commit robbery, he gives his bread to the hungry, he covers the naked with clothing, he does not lend money at interest, and he does not take more than he loaned; he turns his hand away from wrongdoing, he judges with righteousness between a man and his neighbor; he walks in my statutes, he keeps my ordinances, in order to practice them; this is the righteous man, he shall surely live, declares the Lord God. He says, 'Do you want to know what has been said: I will repay the sins of the fathers in the third and fourth generation (Deut. 5:9), it does not mean what most people think it means; nor is it similar to this saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the sons are set on edge (Jerem. 31:29). Listen to what I am going to say: if there is a righteous father who did these things, and the son did not do them, and he had a wicked son who, abandoning the virtues of his father, gave himself over to crimes; will not the righteous father live because he is righteous, and will not the wicked son die because he has committed all the things that the father, by avoiding them, became righteous for?' Let us examine the catalogue of virtues of the father, which seem to me to be divided into seventeen parts. The first of which is to have made judgments; the second, similar to the first, is to have joined justice to judgment; the third is not to have eaten on the mountains; the fourth is not to have lifted one's eyes to idols, or as the LXX translated, to the thoughts of the house of Israel; the fifth is not to have violated one's neighbor's wife. The sixth is to have avoided the embraces of a menstruating wife. The seventh, not having saddened (or oppressed) a person, or as the Septuagint has it, not having oppressed by power; the eighth, having returned a pledge to a debtor; the ninth, not having seized anything by force, or according to the Septuagint, not having seized robbery; the tenth, having given bread to the hungry; the eleventh, having covered the naked with clothing; the twelfth, not having given money at interest; the thirteenth, not having taken anything more than what was given; the fourteenth, having turned away his hand from iniquity; the fifteenth, which seems similar to the first, but is different in part, having made a true judgement between man and man, or his neighbor; the sixteenth, having walked in the commands of the Lord; the seventeenth, having kept his judgments and statutes. We will explain the meanings of each of these things in what follows. If the man is just and performs judgment, it says. It is written in Proverbs: The thoughts of the just are judgments (Prov. XII, 5). Whoever possesses this virtue, to do nothing without reason and judgment, can say that prophetic word: The judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves (Ps. XVIII, 10), and when he judges all things rightly, so as not to show partiality to the poor in judgment, he will fulfill the command of the Lord: You shall judge the small and the great alike (Prov. XVIII), boldly saying: My soul has desired to desire your judgments at all times (Ps. CXVIII, 10)." } And again: I have chosen the way of truth; I have not forgotten your judgments (Verse 30). And in the same psalm: I know that your judgments are righteous (Alternate: just) (Verse 75); and so great shall be his blessedness, that he shall understand the judgments of the Lord, which are very deep; and he shall say with the Apostle: O the depths of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out (Romans II, 33). And in prayer let him mention: For thy ordinances are delightful (Psalm 118:39). After judgment comes justice, which whoever possesses will surely possess Christ, who has become for us justice, sanctification, and redemption (1 Corinthians 1); so that he may perform true justice, and not show partiality in judgment; but knowing his own righteousness, judge the righteousness of others. The third is not to eat on the mountains, which the Jews consider to be a sin related to idolatry. For we frequently read in the books of Kings and Chronicles: Nevertheless, he did not depart from the high places. Still, the people sacrificed in the high places and burned incense on the heights (3 Kings 15:22; Chronicles 20), as the Scripture signifies, that they offered sacrifices to idols in the mountains and groves, and burned incense. But we will say that he eats in the mountains, who says with the Pharisee: I thank you, God, that I am not like this tax collector: I fast twice a week: I give tithes of all my possessions (Luke 18:12), etc. And on the contrary, the tax collector, hearing him who had said, 'Learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart' (Matt. 11:29), struck his chest with his hand, that is, the treasure of wicked thoughts, and did not dare to lift his eyes to heaven. And that which is said elsewhere, 'Do not seek what is beyond your strength, and do not investigate what is beyond your power' (Ecclus. 3:22), accuses all heretics of devouring the mountains of pride and despising the simplicity of the Church, and not knowing what is written about themselves: 'God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble' (James 4:6). In the fourth place, it is set, and it has not lifted its eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, for which the Seventy translators had thoughts. But the idols, that is, the images they have fashioned from their own hearts, all heretics make, to which they lift the eyes of their hearts, those who have considered their falsehood and deceit as truth. However, the house of Israel is called idols, which are found in the Church; and through the occasion of the false name of knowledge, they deceive even the simple ones, so that they may introduce the doctrines of the philosophers into the house of Israel, that is, those who contemplate God with their minds. In the fifth place it is set forth: and he shall not violate the wife of his neighbor, or contaminate her, which openly prohibits adultery; but from that which is added, of his neighbor, unless every man is understood to be a neighbor, it appears to be a precept that we should abstain from the wives of our friends; but freely pollute the spouses of our enemies and strangers. Therefore every man is to be considered the neighbor of man, according to the parable of the Gospel, which is presented by the Savior, of a certain man who, going down from Jerusalem, was wounded by robbers: when the Pharisee asks who was his neighbor, teaching him that he is a neighbor who does good. The mystical understanding of the holy man's wife can be related to wisdom, as Solomon says: Love her, and she will embrace you; cherish her, and she will protect you (Prov. IV, 6). He who desires to defile her, criticizes the blessings of others and, ignited by the torches of envy, violates what is sacred, corrupts what is chaste, and contaminates what is pure. The sixth is: Moreover, one should not approach a menstruating woman or wife. Throughout each month, the heavy and sluggish bodies of women are relieved by the discharge of impure blood. At the time when a man has intercourse with a woman, it is said that the conceived fetus inherits the defect of the seed, so that lepers and elephantiasis sufferers are born from this conception, and both sexes have deformed bodies, with either smallness or enormity of limbs, and corrupted discharge. Therefore, it is prescribed for men to know the specific times of intercourse, not only with other women, but also with their own, whom they seem to be united with by law, as Scripture says: 'Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth' (Genesis I, 28), when they should come together and when they should abstain from their wives. Indeed, both the Apostle and the Ecclesiastes proclaim: There is a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing (Ecclesiastes 3:6). Therefore, let the wife beware, lest she provoke her husband by enticing him with the desire for sexual intercourse, and let the husband not force himself upon his wife, thinking that he is entitled to the pleasure of conjugal relations at all times. Hence, Paul says: Let each one learn to possess his own vessel in sanctity and honor (1 Thessalonians 4:4). Beautifully in the little thoughts of Pythagoras in the Xystus, it is said: He who ardently loves is an adulterer of his own wife. Some person who translated this book into Latin wanted to illustrate it with the name of the martyr Xystus, not considering in the whole volume, which he foolishly divided into two parts, that the name of Christ and the Apostles were altogether omitted. It is not surprising if he transformed the pagan philosopher into a martyr and bishop of the Roman city: just as he also changed the book of Eusebius, first called 'On Origen', by the name of the martyr Pamphilus, so that the most impious book 'On the Principles' could more easily be accepted by Roman ears with such a praiser. It follows in the seventh place: And he shall not grieve a man, or, as the Septuagint translated, he shall not oppress by power. By what fault and sin I do not know whose someone else is. For the Egyptians indeed oppressed the Hebrews by power. Hence even Habakkuk complains, why the wicked oppress the just (Habakkuk 1). And I wish this were said only of those who are outside, and not of those who are inside. For even the leaders of the Churches often oppress the people through pride. Of which it is written: They made you a leader, so that you would not be arrogant: be among them as one of them (Sirach 32:1). And the Savior commanded: Whoever wants to be first among you, let him be the last of all (Matthew 20:27). And what is said in Hebrew, and he will not grieve the man, is in agreement with the testimony of the Apostle: Do not grieve the Holy Spirit, who dwells in you (Ephesians 4:30). And in the Gospel according to the Hebrews, which the Nazarenes are accustomed to read, among the greatest crimes is considered the one who grieves the spirit of his brother. But if the sadness of another kills the one who grieves, what should be said about wickedness and a tyrannical mind, to whom applies the following: 'Why does the earth and ashes boast?' (Sirach 10:9). Like someone who has forgotten his own condition, to be filled with phlegm, bile, feces, and, after a short while, to be consumed by worms, may he place his mouth in heaven and his tongue reach down to earth, and say with the true Nebuchadnezzar: 'I will ascend into heaven, above the stars of heaven I will set up my throne, and I will be like the Most High' (Isaiah 14:12). The eighth is: The pledge shall be returned to the debtor. Not to all debtors, otherwise there will be many opportunities for receiving pledges, which will become an opportunity for accumulating wealth. But to the debtor, about whom it is written in the law that he is poor, and who has put up his own clothing as a pledge, and who should receive it back before sunset (Deut. XXIV), lest due to the cold he cry out to the Lord, who is the avenger of his injury. But if, according to what follows, we must give bread to the hungry and cover the naked with clothing (Exod. II): how much more should we give what is his own, if the poverty of the debtor is unquestionable? We can also give a pledge to the debtor, when we, who are united by love, and who owe mutual charity to each other, give our pledge, holding nothing of his debt against him. It holds the ninth place: He has not seized anything by force, or according to the Septuagint, he has not committed robbery. The Apostle speaks about robbers, stating that among other sinners we must not even eat with such people, and every robbery is mixed with violence (1 Corinthians 6). If violence is inflicted justly, robbery is not profitable. And there is a holy violence, and a desirable robbery, of which the Gospel also writes: From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and the forceful ones lay hold of it (Matthew 11:12). Of this also speaks Judas, the brother of James: But others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh (Jude 1:23). And on the contrary, the opposing powers hasten to seize prey to their own detriment, those whom they are robbing. And Jacob's saying: 'A wild beast has devoured him: a wild beast has taken Joseph away' (Genesis 37:33). Therefore, the sheep of the Lord that follow him are not taken from his hands. And he says: 'What my Father has given me is greater than all, and no one can snatch from the hand of my Father' (John 10:29). From this, it is clear that there is one power, strength, and substance of the Father and the Son. For if no one can snatch from the hand of the Son what the Father has given, and these same things are in the hand of the Father which are not taken from him, it is clearly proven that all things are common to the Father and the Son, and the Son holds the Father in his hand, just as the things that belong to the Son are held in the hand of the Father. The tenth is: He will give his bread to the hungry. By this we are taught that alms should not be given to those who are full, but to those who are hungry; and not to give bread to those who burp from fullness, but to those who are tortured by emptiness. For in bread is contained all nourishment. And it is significantly said, his bread: lest we turn bread acquired through robbery, usury, or ill-gotten gain into mercy. For the redemption of a man's soul (Prov. 13:7) is his own riches. We see that many people, both clients and the poor, and farmers do this; not to mention the violence of the soldiers and judges, who oppress through power or commit theft, so that they may give a little to the poor from the many, and take pride in their own wickedness. And let the deacon publicly recite the names of those who offer in the Churches: as much as this person offers, as much as that person has promised, and they please themselves with the applause of the people, while their conscience torments them. And we give material to the miserable, so that they may rejoice in the things they receive, and not mourn for the things they have taken away. But it is better that we understand the bread of the just man, who says: I am the living bread, which came down from heaven (John 6:51); and whom we beseech to grant us in prayer: Give us this day our substantial bread, or that which will come to us (Matthew 6:11); so that, having always received him afterwards, we may deserve to receive him daily in the present age. He gives this bread to the righteous who are hungry, of whom it is written: Blessed are those who hunger and thirst (Matth. V, 6). For the righteous person makes the common bread of all his own, as the prophet says: I will take from them strength, or the staff of bread. What we are speaking of, if indeed we are of Christ, or rather what the prophet mentions, is the bread of believers and the hungry. This bread is not to be given at all to those who have eaten and drunk and are satisfied, and have grown fat and kicked, of whom it is said: Woe to you who are satisfied now, for you will hunger (Luc. VI, 25), lest they vomit him out, as Solomon says: He will vomit and defile your good words (Prov. XXIII). What the Savior says in other words: Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine (Matt. VII, 6). It holds the eleventh place: And clothed the naked. This statement, according to the explanation of the previous verse, should be interpreted in two ways: that we give clothing to the naked, as the Savior says: I was naked, and you clothed me (Matt. XXV), and that we give the clothing of Christ to the naked in faith and virtues, of whom it is written: For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ (Gal. III, 27). He was naked in this garment, not having a wedding garment, he was cast out from the feast. Concerning this nakedness, the Lord speaks to Jerusalem: But you were naked and full of confusion. It holds the twelfth number: And has not lent money at interest, or as the LXX translated, has not given his money for interest. In Hebrew, all kinds of usury are prohibited; in the LXX, only money. According to what is written in the fourteenth psalm: 'Who has not given his money at usury' (Psalm 14:5). And how is it said: 'To your brother you will not lend money at interest, but to a stranger you will lend at interest' (Deuteronomy 15:6, 23:10). But see the progression: At the beginning of the Law, interest is only prohibited among brothers; in the prophets, usury is prohibited for everyone, as Ezekiel says: 'He has not given his money at usury'. Furthermore, in the Gospel, there is an increase in virtue, with the Lord commanding: 'Lend to those from whom you do not expect to receive' (Luke 6:35). It follows in the thirteenth place: And moreover he shall not receive more. Some people think that usury exists only in money. But divine Scripture, foreseeing this, takes away the excess of everything, so that you do not receive more than you gave. Usury is usually demanded in the form of wheat, barley, wine, oil, and other goods, as the divine word calls it, as an abundance. For example, let us give ten measures during the winter season, and let us receive fifteen measures during the harvest, that is, more than half. Whoever considers himself most just will receive a fourth portion more, and they are accustomed to argue and say: I gave one bushel, which produced ten bushels. Is it not just that I should receive a half bushel more from my own, when he, by my generosity, has nine and a half bushels of my own? Let us not be deceived, says the Apostle, God is not mocked (Galatians VI, 7). Let the merciful lender respond to us briefly: did he give to the one who has, or to the one who does not have? If he had, he certainly should not have given, but he gave as if he did not have. Therefore, why does he demand more as if from someone who has? Others are accustomed to receiving small gifts of different kinds in exchange for borrowed money, and they do not understand that it is called interest and excess, whatever it may be, if they receive more than what they gave. The fourteenth step: From wickedness, it says, he turned away his hand, so as to flee from all wickedness. For wickedness is not only committed by the hand, but also by other members, as Solomon says: Remove wicked lips far from you (Prov. IV, 24). And in the Psalms: They spoke iniquity on high (Ps. 72:8). The foot also runs to iniquity, and the eye desires another man’s wife; neither should one imitate him of whom it is said: He has done no iniquity, and there is no deceit in his mouth (Isa. 53:9). Therefore, we are commanded to make friends for ourselves with unjust mammon, so that they may receive us into eternal dwellings. The fifteenth is: He shall have made a true judgment between man and man, or between his neighbors. What seems to sound the same as before, where it is written: If he is just, and he does judgment; but with the truth of judgment added: which he does between man and man, or his neighbor, is seen to have the intensification of virtues. Hence, in the beginning of Proverbs, after many precepts, the correction of judgment is brought forth. To know, he says, wisdom and discipline, and to understand the words of prudence, to receive the subtilties of speeches, and to know true justice, and after all to correct judgment (Prov. I, 2, 3). Therefore, the Apostle (I Cor. VI) rebukes those who are established in the Church for having disputes among themselves, and the least esteemed and least respected person is chosen to judge between man and man, he who has destroyed what is small and has reached the mature man; and yet he needs a greater understanding in order to attain to the truth of judgment. It continues in the sixteenth place: Let him walk in my commandments. And in the seventeenth: He shall keep my judgments and my justifications, that he may do them, and keep also my commandments: in which commandments of the Lord are said to be precepts, and in which they are said to be justifications. The one hundred and twelfth psalm is full of precepts and justifications, and in part the eighteenth, in which it is written: The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts, and the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes (Psalm 18:9). In which it is asked, how in the same prophet God said: 'I have given them non-good justifications, in which they will not live in them' (Psalm 119:28). The easy and fuller answer is in the following, that the Jews who follow the letter die, and the Christians who understand the life-giving Spirit live. It is tedious, if we want to prove by testimonies where the precepts of the Lord are said to be and where justifications are said to be, and in what individual, or differences, or obscurities they are involved. And in the present place it is said: Here is the righteous one, he will live, says the Lord God. Whoever does these things, and does not do those, will not be punished for the sins of the father, but will live by their own virtues.

<h2 id='tocuniq191'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 10 seqq.) But if he has begotten a son who is a robber, shedding blood, and he has done one of these things (or as the LXX translated, and he has committed sins: he has not walked in the way of his righteous father), and indeed he does all these things, not doing, but eating in the mountains, and defiling the wife of his neighbor, troubling the poor and needy (or oppressing), robbing plunder, not returning a pledge, and lifting his eyes to idols, committing abomination, giving into usury, and receiving more, will he live? When he has done all these detestable things, he shall surely be put to death; his blood shall be upon him. In Hebrew, the word for thief is 'Pharis' in the second edition of Aquila, 'transgressor' in Symmachus, and 'pestilent' in the Septuagint and Theodotion. Just as a pestilence creates diseases and devastates the regions where it has spread, so does a pestilent man ravage everything. Let us first say, according to history, that you may know that the iniquities of the fathers do not overflow upon the children. If the righteous person does what the previous passage has described in order, they will live. But if they have a son who departs from the service of the Lord and exchanges the virtues of his father for vices, doing what his father did not do and not doing what his father did do, can he live? Certainly not, but he will be guilty of shedding his own blood. Furthermore, according to spiritual understanding, the righteous man, if he preaches the Gospel faith, and his son and disciple are deceived by heretical error, he will be called a plague. About which it is written in the first psalm: And he has not sat in the seat of pestilence (Ps. I, 1). And in the proverbs, the confident and audacious person is called proud and pestilent (Prov. XXXIII). This person has shed the blood of deceivers and constantly multiplies all sins; eating on the mountains of pride and polluting the Church of their neighbor, distressing the needy and poor in the knowledge of the Scriptures, oppressing and supplanting them; seizing the plunder from those whom they have deceived from the Church: not returning the pledge that they received from the master, in order to fulfill what is written: Freely you received, freely give (Matth. X, 8). And to idols and images, which he fashioned from his own heart, lifting up his eyes and committing all abominations, and giving money at interest, to increase the error of the master's disciples through diligence; and demanding more from those to whom he had given, than he had given: surely he will not be able to live, but will die in his own blood.

<h2 id='tocuniq192'>(Vers. 14 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 14 onwards) But if he has a son who sees all the sins his father has committed, fears them, and does not commit similar sins (like them): he does not eat upon the mountains, does not lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not violate his neighbor's wife, does not oppress anyone, does not withhold a pledge, does not commit robbery, gives bread to the hungry, covers the naked with clothing, turns his hand away from injuring the poor, does not take interest or excessive profit, follows my statutes, and keeps my commands: he will not die for his father's iniquity, but will surely live." } His father, who accused falsely, and used violence against his brother, and committed evil in the midst of his own people: he died in his wickedness. And, he says, do not be surprised, if the son of a righteous man, turning to vices and sins, dies by death. On the contrary, if the son of a wicked and impious man, 214 should see the perversity of his father's ways, and turn away, so that he does not do evil and does good, he should not be held responsible for his father's wickedness. And that which can be received in us, about which it says in the Psalms: Listen, daughter, and see, and incline your ear, and forget your people, and your father's house; and the king will desire your beauty (Ps. 44:11). And we, who are created from the stock of the nations, in order to leave behind the sins of our parents, and to practice judgment and justice, and to live in them. Therefore, we repeat what we have discussed above in greater detail. And thus, we quickly traverse all things, desiring to pass over to those things which are more obscure and new.


<h2 id='tocuniq193'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>

(Verse 19, 20.) And you say: Why did the son not bear the iniquity of the father? Clearly, because the son has practiced judgment and justice, he has kept and done all my commandments: he shall surely live. The soul that sins shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. He resolves the question, which the listener could have raised to the contrary. He often used to say: Why did the just son not bear the iniquity of his father? To which he himself responds: Clearly, because the son acted well and did not commit the father's offenses. And it is just that just as the sinner dies in his wickedness, so the just one lives in his virtues: and the soul that has sinned dies, and the one that has kept God's commandments lives.

<h2 id='tocuniq194'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verses 21, 22.) But if the wicked turns away from all the sins he has committed, and keeps all my commandments, and does judgment and justice: he shall surely live, and not die. All the iniquities which he has committed, I will not remember. To this extent, he says, the sins of the fathers do not pass on to the children, nor does the wickedness of the father burden the righteous son: nor are others punished for the sins of others, so that the same person who was previously wicked and sinful, if he later repents and turns to better things, his past sins shall not be judged by their age, but he shall be received into my flock, with an innovation of virtue. At the same time, it must be considered what kind of repentant sinner the wicked and sinful person accepts. If, as he says, he turns away from all the sins he has committed and keeps all the commandments of the Lord, so as to abandon all crimes and pursue all virtues; if he does all good things and forsakes all evil things; then I will forget all of his iniquities that he has committed.

<h2 id='tocuniq195'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>

(Verse 23) In his righteousness, which he has worked, he shall live. Not so much my righteousness as his shall live: although it is the duty of my righteousness to reward the good with good, and the evil with evil.

Is it my will that the wicked should die, says the Lord God, and not that they should return from their ways, and live? (I Tim. II). Therefore, it is the will of the Lord that all should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. However, wherever there seems to be a severe and harsh judgment of God, it condemns not the people, but the sins.

<h2 id='tocuniq196'>(Vers. 24.)</h2>

(Verse 24.) But if the righteous turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? All the righteousness that he has done shall not be remembered. In the trespass that he has trespassed and in the sin that he has sinned, in them he shall die. As for the righteous, his previous sins do not burden him; so the sinner who was once righteous, his former righteousness does not help him. For each person will be judged according to what is found in them.

<h2 id='tocuniq197'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) And you said: The way of the Lord is not fair. Hear, O house of Israel: Is not my way fair: and are not your ways unjust? Give reasons why the judgment of the Lord is just. Do you think, he says, that it is unjust for me to render the sins of fathers to their children (Deuteronomy 24); and for others to eat sour grapes, and the teeth of others to be set on edge (Jeremiah 31)? Behold, everyone dies in their own sin, and is made alive in their own righteousness: in both cases, judgment is based on the present, not the past. Rather, your unfair opinion is that you think a parable is not a parable, but you interpret it as if it were the truth of history, so that the crimes of others are punished in others.

<h2 id='tocuniq198'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>

(Verse 26) For when the righteous turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he will die for it. In the iniquity (or injustice) that he has committed, he will die. This can also be understood as: The righteous, who is initially the people of Israel, turns away from his righteousness because he has forsaken the author of righteousness, and commits iniquity by denying the Son of God. In the sin and wickedness that he has committed, he will die: not in many, but in one, killing the heir in order to destroy the inheritance.


<h2 id='tocuniq199'>(Vers. 27, 28.)</h2>

(Verse 27, 28.) And when the wicked turns away from his wickedness which he has done and does judgment and righteousness, he will preserve his own life. He will live because he considers and turns away from all the transgressions which he has committed; he will not die. On the other hand, says the prophet, the people of the nations who do not have knowledge of God and the wicked, if he turns away from his wickedness which he has previously practiced in idolatry and does the things commanded by the law of Israel, he will preserve his own life. And seeing that he perished in the injustices that he committed, he will believe in him who says: I am the way, the truth, and the life (John XIV, 6): he will live and not die.

<h2 id='tocuniq200'>(Vers. 29.)</h2>

(Verse 29) And the children of Israel say: The way of the Lord is not fair. Are not my ways equal, O house of Israel? Are not your ways unequal? Even until this day, Israel blasphemes God, questioning why He has forsaken His people and taken in a multitude of nations. The Lord accuses them that their ways are crooked, and with just judgment, He will send other vine-dressers into His vineyard to replace the lost tenants. This understanding is conveyed in the parable of the Gospel, as the Jews said: This will not happen (Luke 20:16).


<h2 id='tocuniq201'>(Vers. 30.)</h2>

(Verse 30.) Therefore, I will judge each one according to their ways, O house of Israel, says the Lord God. Whether they are from the multitude of nations or from the people of Israel who are being judged, there is no partiality with God (Colossians 3:25), but each one will be rewarded according to their faith, and they will be condemned for their impiety and unfaithfulness.

<h2 id='tocuniq202'>(Vers. 31.)</h2>

(Verse 31.) Turn away and repent from all your iniquities, and iniquity will not be for your ruin. Cast away from yourselves all your transgressions, in which you have transgressed. This speech is specifically directed to the Israelites, urging them to repent and abandon their iniquities or transgressions against God. However, it can also be understood to apply to both the Israelites and the multitude of the Gentiles, urging them to forsake their vices and turn to Him who can heal their contritions.


And make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. In abandoning the old ways, live in the newness of the spirit. The new heart of the Israelites is to believe in the one they previously denied. The new heart of the Gentiles is to abandon idols and disregard the worship of the dead, and to believe in the God of the living.

And why will you die, O house of Israel? It is better, as we have said above, to takes this exhortation in which it is written: Repent, and do penance, to mean the person of the Jews, whom God does not want to die, and to whom he now speaks: why will you die, O house of Israel, who have the fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, of whom it is written: God of the living, and not of the dead (Mark 12:27). Why will you die because of your fault, who owe your life to the merit of your fathers, and to my mercy?" }


<h2 id='tocuniq203'>(Vers. 32.)</h2>

(Verse 32.) Because I do not desire the death of the one dying (or the sinner), says the Lord God: return, and live. I do not want, he says, you to die, whom I have begotten for salvation. For I have begotten sons, and I have exalted them: but they have despised me (Isa. 1:2). Therefore, return and live. It is not said to return, except to those who were previously with God, and later abandoned his company. And live through repentance, you who are dead through sin. Therefore, Israel, because it does not return to its former state, is to be believed to be dead.

<h2 id='tocuniq204'>(Cap. XIX.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 19, Verses 1 and following) And you shall take up a lamentation for the leaders of Israel, and you shall say: Why has your mother, the lioness, lain down among the lions? Among her cubs, she reared her young. And one of her cubs grew up and became a lion; he learned to capture prey and devour people. And the nations heard about him, and they captured him with their wounds, and they brought him in chains to the land of Egypt. When she saw that she was weakened and that her hope was destroyed, she took one of her cubs and made him a lion." } He who walked among lions, became a lion. He learned to capture prey and devour men. He learned to make widows and lead their cities into desolation, and the land and its abundance were laid waste by the roar of his voice. And peoples from all provinces gathered against him and cast their net over him; he was captured in their wounds. And they put him in a cage, they brought him in chains to the king of Babylon, and they sent him to prison so that his voice would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel. LXX: And you take up the lamentation over the prince of Israel and say: What was your mother, a lioness, doing among lions? She lay down among young lions. And she brought up one of her cubs; he grew into a young lion and he learned to tear the prey. He devoured men, and the nations heard of him. He was caught in their pit, and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt. When she saw that she had waited in vain, that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion. He prowled among the lions; he became a young lion and learned to tear the prey. He became a lion and learned to snatch prey. He devoured men and fed on their audacity. He led their cities to the desert and laid waste to the land and its abundance with the sound of his roar. Nations from all around set snares for him and spread their nets over him. He was caught in their corruption and they put him in chains. He was brought to the king of Babylon in a cage and brought into the prison, so that his voice would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel. I know that in this place I have read many explanations, hindered by such obscurities, that they have not so much revealed as enveloped the reading, when all the writings refer to contrary strengths, and describe lions and wars in the heavenly Jerusalem: how one of them was captured, and another one was appointed in his place, and many testimonies are given: that the devil and his companions are accustomed to be called lions, as it is written about the Apostle Peter: Our adversary the devil is like a roaring lion, going around and seeking how he may enter (1 Peter 5:8); and about the Psalms: Do not deliver the soul of Your turtle dove to wild beasts (Psalm 74:19). Certainly, when it comes to history, it is said that Johanan, the son of Caraeus, was led into Egypt: how he was called lion while fleeing with a few, I do not know: and Sedeciah, another lion, who was also led into Babylon. But leaving such explanations to the judgment of the reader, let us say that, by captivity being near, the prophet narrates the past rather than prophesying the future. For after the sixth year of Sedeciah (indeed, immediately in the following we read: And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month) a lamentation is taken up concerning the princes, or the prince of Israel, and it is said: Why did your mother lie down among the lions? Therefore, the lamentation is over the princes, namely all those who are descended from the line of Josiah. The mother of the princes of Jerusalem is called a lioness, who bore and nursed 219 cubs: and she brought up one of her cubs and made him a lion, signifying Joachaz the son of Josiah, whom Pharaoh Necho led into Egypt, and in his place installed Joacim. After his death, his son Jechoniah was made king, and he, along with his mother and the nobles of the city, was led into Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. From him is born Salathiel, the father of Zerubbabel, who received his name from being born in Babylon (2 Kings 23). And it is clear that under the metaphor of the lioness, lion cubs, and lion, and again, another lion, is described what had already happened at that time when this prophet was speaking. For after he brought out from the royal line Joachaz, son of Josiah, and made him king, he became so cruel in a short time that he is remembered figuratively as having taken prey and devoured men. When an Egyptian came to him, he captured him not without wounds, either in a pit, as is specifically stated in Hebrew: in order to preserve the figurative capturing of lions, which are always captured in pits. And he brought him in chains or in shackles to the land of Egypt, and there he died. When his mother, who had given birth to him, who had nursed him, who had made him king, saw this, her expectation was destroyed. She took Jechoniah, the son of Joachim, from among the other kings and made him king. He also, imitating the cruelty of his predecessor, is described as being fierce like a lion, for he devoured men, made many widows, led cities to desolation; and at the sound of his roar, the entire province was terrified, so that nations came together and spread their nets over him, and captured him in a pit, and placed him in a cage, and in chains. This was not done to Jechoniah, for he had surrendered himself to the king of Babylon and was taken to Chaldea; but it was an allegory of a lion, who is captured in pits, bound with chains, and kept in cages. Furthermore, according to the history: we read about this concerning Zedekiah, who was made king of Jerusalem after Jehoiachin. And this has caused some to understand Zedekiah instead of Jehoiachin, because chains are mentioned, and a cage, and prison are named. Therefore, he was saved in prison, not killed, and only removed from the kingdom. However, the history narrates that Zedekiah, being led blindfolded to Babylon, was immediately killed there.


<h2 id='tocuniq205'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 seqq.) Your mother is like a vine planted in blood, by the water. Its fruits and branches have grown from many waters. And solid rods have become scepters of dominion for her, and her stature has been exalted among the branches. And she saw her height in the multitude of her palm trees: and in anger, she was uprooted and thrown to the ground, and a burning wind will dry up her fruit: they withered, and the strong rods were dried up, fire consumed her. And now she has been transplanted into a desert, in a pathless and thirsty land. And fire has come out from the rod of her branches, which consumed its fruit, and there was no strong branch in it, nor a scepter of rulers. She has mourned, and it will be for mourning. LXX: Your mother is like a vine, like a flower in an evil pomegranate planted in water. Its fruit and its bud have come from much water. And a branch of strength has become for her among the chiefs of the tribes, and she has been exalted by her greatness in the midst of her offspring. And he saw his greatness in the multitude of his palm trees, and it was shattered in anger: it was thrown down to the ground, and a burning wind dried up its chosen ones. They were avenged, and his rod of strength was dried up. Fire consumed it, and now they have planted it in the desert, in a land without water, and fire came out from its chosen ones and consumed it, and there was no rod of strength in it. It is a lamentation in three parts, and it will be a lamentation. In different speeches, one thing is said. And just as in the previous examples we read about Jerusalem being compared to a beautiful woman, and again about a lioness who nourished lions in her den, now the vine or vineyard is compared to the most beautiful thing, which is planted above the water, and because of this the branches nourished by the moisture have grown so much that one branch, which the Scripture calls a very strong or mighty rod, has become a scepter of the rulers. For what reason to translate the Septuagint into three leaders, so that kings may be made from it. But it itself was of such great beauty, that the splendor of its vigor was equal to the flowers of the pomegranate, which is said in Hebrew as if a vine in your blood, compared to the redness of flowers, therefore the vine was lifted up: Because God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble (James 4:6), it was uprooted in the fury of the Lord and thrown to the ground, so that the ruins of Jerusalem, the elegant translation of the vine, would be preserved. Although the vineyard may be beautiful and spread out with long branches, if you remove the poles and supports, the joined land dries up from the heat, especially if the burning wind, which the Greeks call καύσωμα, has dried up its fruit so that it withers and is as if consumed by fire. As for what is added in the Septuagint: They have been avenged, because it is written in Hebrew, they have withered, I cannot understand what significance it may have. Therefore, how is that vineyard of such fertility and abundance of fruits and such beauty, now transplanted into a desert, into an impassable and thirsty land? However, it signifies the land of Babylon to which they were carried away, or Egypt where they sought refuge, or the very land of Judah, in which only a few poor people remained, whom Godolias (also known as Gotholias) was appointed as governor to gather and govern the remnants of the people (4 Kings 25). Against whom he rose up, from the royal stock, from the branch of the vine of Ismael, who killed him in Maspha (also called Masepha), and devoured all the fruit of the vine, and from then on there was no strong branch in the vine, nor a scepter of rulers (Jeremiah XL and XLI). For no king remained to govern the people, but they fled with Johanan son of Carea to Egypt. Therefore, there is mourning and a parable of lamentation, to mourn the royal line that has ceased in Judaea, until the one who is appointed comes: He himself was the expectation of the nations (Genesis XLIX, 10). From this it is clear that the earlier reading, in which it is said: Why did your mother, the lioness, lie among lions? and this one in which it is written: Your mother is like a vine planted over water, with blood as its roots, belonging to Jerusalem, which lost its lions and its branches, and there was no branch left to rise up as a tribe or a ruling scepter. For it begins with lamentation and ends with lamentation. Take up the lamentation for the princes of Israel. This is, in the beginning and now in the end, a lamentation; and with lamentation and the mourning of parables, a royal lineage must be followed. Furthermore, according to the 222nd anagoge, which others refer to as the heavenly Jerusalem, they say that many have fallen in this valley of tears, and that kings have ceased to exist, and the once beautiful vineyard has been dried up by the burning wind, so that no green palms remain in it, which Jeremiah later laments in the form of the city, we understand (Matthew 24) concerning the Church, because in the last times, with multiplied iniquity, the love of many grows cold, so that even the chosen ones of God may be tested, and their leaders may be captured in the snares of the devil, who is not content with capturing only one king, but hastens to capture kings and princes daily, according to what is written: His chosen food (Habakkuk 1:16). The branches of the Church, which were once equal to flowers and the redness of blood, are later dried up by the wind. This exposition is also indicated by the parable of the Gospel, in which, after the rising of the sun, the plants that had sprouted are scorched by the heat and suddenly wither (Mark 4); so that hardly any of the branches remain that can rise up and become worthy leaders of the people. This is spoken in other words by Amos: 'I will send a famine upon the land: not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of God' (Amos 8:11). Where should we mourn and lament over the leaders of Israel, through whose fault and pride Judaea has been deserted and Jerusalem captured.

<h2 id='tocuniq206'>(Cap. XX.—Vers. 1.)</h2>

(Chapter 20, Verse 1) And it happened in the seventh year, in the fifth, in the tenth month, men from the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord and sat before me. After eleven months and five days of the previous vision, a word came again to the prophet, after the men from the elders of the house of Israel came to inquire of the Lord and sat before him. However, it was the custom of the people of Israel to seek whatever they desired to know from the Lord through the prophets, as many examples attest. Saul, seeking the lost donkeys, goes to Samuel and receives counsel from a young man to offer a quarter shekel to the prophet. When Jeroboam's son falls ill, his wife is sent to Shiloh to Ahijah (also called Abijah) the prophet, bringing gifts of bread, cakes, grapes, and a small jar of honey, in order to find out about their son's condition. David also consults another prophet, Nathan, to ask whether he should build a temple for the Lord. And Ahab inquires whether he should go up to Ramoth Gilead or not (3 Kings 22). In Isaiah also (Isa. 37) and in the book of Kings (4 Kings 19), it is foretold what will happen with Sennacherib. It is not surprising that in the Old Testament the prophets announce in advance what is going to happen, since we read that Agabus prophesied to Paul what was going to happen (Acts 21). It is written in Deuteronomy: The nations whom the Lord will destroy before you, they listen to dreams and divination, but the Lord your God has not given you that (Deut. 18:14). For it is the custom of the Gentiles to consult the Chaldeans, haruspices, diviners, sorcerers, oracles of demons, by which their error is deceived. Hence even now the elders of Israel go to a prophet to inquire of the Lord through him, and yet they remain silent about the inquiry, while he who was to be questioned knew what they were asking, so that in him there was a miracle of knowing why they had come, and answering those things which silent speech contained in the mind.

<h2 id='tocuniq207'>(Vers. 2, 3.)</h2>

(Vers. 2, 3.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Have you come to inquire of me? As I live, I will not answer you, says the Lord God. To the righteous who ask fitting questions, a promise is given. While you are still speaking, I will say: Here I am. But for the sinners, like the elders of Israel whose crimes the prophet describes, there is no answer given; but rather a rebuke for their sins. And an oath is added: As I live, the sentence of denial is made stronger."  } But if I were to respond to what the Seventy said, I would say to you: Symmachus translated it more clearly, I will not respond to you.

<h2 id='tocuniq208'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) If you judge them, if you judge, son of man. LXX: if I avenge them with vengeance, son of man: They indeed came to interrogate me, desiring to know about those things which they doubt, and future events; but you, son of man, judge them, so that the response may not be of a prophet, but the sentence of a judge for the iniquities they have committed, and for following the crimes of their fathers. Or certainly, if I avenge them with vengeance, it may be understood as follows: They are so covered in wickedness that they are not even worthy of correction and reprimand, according to what is said in the prophet: I will no longer visit your daughters, and your daughters-in-law, when they have played the harlot (Hosea 4). Where even sinners, who have gone deep in sin, are forgiven to fulfill the desires of their hearts (Prov. XVIII).

Show them the abominations of their ancestors, and say to them: 'Seventy times seven: declare to them the iniquities of their ancestors, and say to them: If the sins of the ancestors do not flow down to their children, how are the abominations and iniquities of the ancestors now placed upon the elders? Clearly for this reason, so that they may be shown to act similarly to their parents, and, with hereditary evil, drag the longest rope of sins, so that those who imitate their vices may fear their punishments.'


<h2 id='tocuniq209'>(Vers. 5, 6.)</h2>

(Vers. 5, 6.) Thus says the Lord God: On the day when I chose Israel and raised my hand for the descendants of the house of Jacob, I appeared to them in the land of Egypt and raised my hand for them, saying: I am the Lord your God. On that day I raised my hand for them, in order to bring them out of the land of Egypt into the land that I had provided for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, which is excellent among all lands. LXX: Thus says the Lord God: From the day I chose the house of Israel and became known to the descendants of the house of Jacob, and was made known to them in the land of Egypt, and I took them in saying: I am the Lord your God: on that day I took them by my hand, saying: to bring them out of the land of Egypt into the land that I had prepared for them, a land flowing with milk and honey: a land surpassing all lands. For what the Seventy said, 'honeycomb' is beyond all lands, for which we have interpreted it as 'excellent' among all lands. Aquila's first edition placed 'firmament'; the second, 'illustrious'; Symmachus, 'region'; Theodotion, 'fortitude'; that is, the foundation of all lands, because in it there is the religion of God, and the temple, and the ceremonies, and the knowledge of God. And to such an extent the people of Israel, when they were established in Egypt, were ignorant of God, that when Moses was sent to them, he said, 'If they ask me, who sent you?' What shall I say to them? Say, He who is, sent me (Exod. III, 13, 14). Therefore, he became known to the people in Egypt, and to the descendants of the house of Jacob, 225 when he raised his hand against the Egyptians for their sake, and said: I am the Lord your God, and he chose them to lead them out of the land of Egypt, to a land flowing with milk and honey. For they could not yet eat solid food: but like little children and infants, they needed honey and milk for their infancy. Surely, whoever considers the land of Judea, not only as the most famous but also as the most fertile of all lands, from Rhinocorura to Mount Taurus and to the Euphrates River, cannot have any doubt regarding the power and beauty of its cities and the pleasantness of its regions, namely Palestine and Phoenicia, Arabia, Syria Coele, Cilicia, and other regions that the Lord promised to the Israelites if they had kept God's commandments. Because they did not receive these regions, it was a fault of their disbelief. For many nations remained in the province of Palestine and Judea, who were not expelled. For the one to whom a promise is made is not responsible for the crime, if he himself has become unworthy of the promise, especially when the option of the one making the promise is presented: If you are willing and listen to me, you will eat the good things of the land. But if you are unwilling, the sword will devour you. Therefore, the present is chosen: and the one who is chosen cannot be immediately tempted or perish; for both Saul, chosen as king, and Judas, chosen as an Apostle, later fell due to their own fault. The raising of the hand, or extension, indicates the posture of the striker: to strike the Egyptians for them, and to free the people of Israel from Egypt.

<h2 id='tocuniq210'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) And I said to them: Each one must cast away the offenses of their eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the Lord your God. LXX: And I said to them: Each one must cast away the abominations of their eyes, and must not be defiled with the inventions of Egypt; I am the Lord your God. Concerning the offenses, which are called Secuse in Hebrew, Symmachus interpreted them as nausea, the second edition of Aquila as amputations, to signify that they should be cast away from the eyes like blurriness, and like nausea, which not only obstructs sight but also creates vomiting in those who see. And the Hebrew word for "gelule" is a term coined by the Septuagint; the first edition of Aquila, improperly translated; the second edition of Symmachus and Theodotion, they interpreted as idols: whom we are currently following. However, as they were leaving Egypt, they were commanded to forget the idols to which they had served for a long time, and even to cast them out of their sight so that they would not even consider them worthy of looking at, and to not continue to be polluted by the things with which they had long been defiled. I your Lord God, he says, not the Egyptian wonders, not the inventions of various monsters. But even to us, when we go out from Egypt, it is commanded that we cast off the offenses of our eyes: lest we be delighted with those things with which we were previously delighted in the world, lest we be defiled by the idols of Egypt, namely the inventions of the philosophers and heretics, which are rightly called idols. Let us also remove our eyes from the spectacles, indeed from the offenses of Egypt, the arenas, the circuses, the theaters, and all things that defile the purity of the soul and enter into the mind through the senses; and what is written is fulfilled: Death has entered through your windows (Jeremiah IX, 21).


<h2 id='tocuniq211'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) And they provoked me. LXX: And they turned away from me. Or as Symmachus interpreted: They did not find rest in me. And immediately called, they depart from God, so that there is no interval between calling and departing. And it should be noted that no one departs from God unless they were previously with him. Hence, in the book of Job, the dragon is called an apostate, a transgressor, and one who departs (Job XXXIV).

And they did not want to listen to me. Each one did not cast away the abominations of their eyes, nor did they abandon the idols of Egypt. LXX: And they did not want to listen to me. They did not cast away the abominations of their eyes, and they did not abandon the inventions of Egypt. Therefore, they provoked me, and they turned away from me, because they did not want to listen to me, while the free will of man is preserved: and they did everything that I commanded them not to do by law: immediately despairing of salvation, and murmuring against Moses, and doubting the promises of God. Unde sequitur:

And I said that I would pour out my indignation on them, and vent my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. But as soon as I commanded them to leave and cast away the offenses of their eyes, and not defile themselves with the idols of Egypt, they provoked me and refused to listen to what I said. Instead, they did the opposite of what I commanded not to be done. Therefore, I resolved to pour out my fury and indignation on them, and vent my anger that I had conceived in my mind in the midst of Egypt. For they had not yet come out of Egypt. For it follows below: 'I have cast them out of the land of Egypt, and have brought them into the desert.' From this it is shown that they had not yet come out of Egypt when He wished to pour out His indignation and fulfill His anger upon them, and strike them down in the midst of the land of Egypt.

<h2 id='tocuniq212'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9) And I did it for the sake of my name, so that it would not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived, and in whose midst I made myself known to them in order to bring them out of the land of Egypt. But I had planned to do it for the sake of my righteousness, not because of the greatness of my mercy, so that my name would not be defiled and I would appear unable to fulfill what I had promised to Israel. Therefore, I spared my name, so that the nations among whom I became known to them in the land of Egypt would not have an opportunity to blaspheme." } The prophet describes what God had promised to them while they were in the land of Egypt, how they immediately offended God, what God had planned against them, but ultimately did not do. The following events occurred after they left Egypt.

<h2 id='tocuniq213'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 and following) So I expelled them from the land of Egypt and brought them into the desert. I gave them my commandments and showed them my judgments, which a man should do and live by them. Furthermore, I gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between me and them, so that they would know that I am the Lord who sanctifies them. But the house of Israel provoked me in the desert: they did not walk in my commandments and cast aside my judgments, which a man should do and live by them, and they greatly violated my Sabbaths. Therefore I said that I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them. And I have done it for the sake of my name, that it might not be profaned before the nations, from whose presence I have cast them out. These things are said to those who were brought out of Egypt into the wilderness, that having been freed from the vices of the Egyptians, they might more easily fulfill the precepts of God in solitude, and observe his judgments and sabbaths. These were given as a sign between him who gave them and those to whom they were given, as the Scripture says: 'And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: You also command the children of Israel, saying: See that you keep my sabbaths, because it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, so that you may know that I am the Lord who sanctifies you, and keep the sabbath, for it is holy to you.' Whoever violates it shall die by death. Anyone who works on it shall be killed, and their soul shall be destroyed from among their people (Exodus 31:13, 14). Therefore, the Sabbath and circumcision were given as a sign of the true Sabbath and true circumcision: so that we may know to rest from the works of the world on the perfect and eternal Sabbath, and not to be uncircumcised in heart but to circumcise our hearts. Therefore, in six days we work, and on the seventh day we rest, so that we may do nothing else day and night except recognize that everything we live is owed to the Lord, and when the week returns, we consecrate ourselves entirely to His name, so that through the sanctification of the day, we may remember the Lord who sanctifies us. These precepts and justifications, and the observance of the Sabbath, the Lord gave in the desert, so that those who do them may live by them: not to go beyond them to greater things, as it is promised in the Gospel. Those who violated them did so not once or a little, but greatly, so that the intensity of the violation might be shown. Therefore, He spoke and in His mind decided to pour out His fury upon them in the desert and consume them, when He spoke to Moses: 'Leave me, and in my anger I will destroy them' (Exodus 32:10). But he did not want to do it, sparing the Egyptians and the other nations, so that they would not be scandalized, and waiting for the repentance of those who had converted. And it should be noted that when he spoke to the established in Egypt after the offense: I did it, he said, for the sake of my name, so that it would not be violated in the presence of the nations from whom I had driven them out. For at that time they were still in the midst, because they had not yet gone out. But now, after they have gone out, it is said, from whom I had driven them out in the presence of the nations.


<h2 id='tocuniq214'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15) Therefore, I lifted my hand against them in the wilderness, to not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, the choicest of all lands, because they rejected my judgments and did not walk in my statutes, and they profaned my Sabbaths. For their hearts followed after idols, and my eye spared them from destruction, and I did not consume them in the wilderness. Septuagint: And I lifted my hand against them in the wilderness, to not bring them into the land which I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey; it is a land of abundance beyond all lands, because they rejected my statutes and did not walk in my commandments, and they profaned my Sabbaths, and they followed after the intentions of their hearts. And my eye spared them, so that I would not destroy them, and I did not kill them in the desert. I indeed resolved to pour out my fury upon them and consume them: but I did it for the sake of my name, so that it would not be profaned among the nations, namely the Amalekites and others (Exodus XVII; Numbers XIV), who fought against them in the wilderness, in order to prevent them from entering the land that I had promised to them, a land flowing with milk and honey, which is the choicest of all lands, a land of abundance. But the cause of punishment is this sentence, because they rejected my judgments and did not walk in my commandments, and violated my Sabbaths. And the cause of this cause is that they did not do these things, because their heart followed Egyptian idols. But my eye spared them, saying, that I would not kill them and destroy them altogether. It is questioned, however, how I spared them, whose corpses fell in the wilderness, and except for Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, no one entered the promised land. From this we understand that those people are not reserved for eternal punishments, nor are they deleted from the book of the living, nor are they consumed before the face of the Lord. For if they were not admitted into the promised land, they are believed to have perished: therefore, Moses also perished, who only saw the promised land but did not enter it. Concerning whom the Lord Jesus speaks in the book of Joshua: 'My servant Moses is dead' (Deuteronomy 34:5). And in Malachi: Remember the law of Moses my servant (Malachi 4:4). And in Jeremiah, God speaks as if to a friend and intimate: If Moses and Samuel stood before me (Jeremiah 15:1). Otherwise, it must be believed that the prayers of Moses were heard when, interceding for the people, he said: If you forgive them their sin, forgive them; but if you do not want to, then erase me from the book you have written (Exodus 32:32, 33). But so that we may know that the intention of God towards His sons and servants is not for their destruction, but for their correction, let us listen to the testimonies of Scripture. Son, do not be discouraged by the discipline of the Lord, and do not grow weary when you are reproved by Him (Prov. 3:11). For the Lord corrects those whom He loves, and chastises every son whom He receives (Heb. 12:6). And in another place it is written: When He slew them, then they sought Him (Ps. 78:34). And in the Song of Deuteronomy: I will kill, and I will make alive (Deut. XII, 39). We can also say, according to the letter, that He has not destroyed them, nor consumed them with their posterity and progeny, but after killing the fathers, He spared the sons, whom He brought into the promised land.

<h2 id='tocuniq215'>(Vers. 18 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 18 seqq.) But I said to their children in the wilderness: Do not follow the commands (or laws) of your fathers, nor keep their judgments, nor be polluted by their idols (or thoughts). I am the Lord your God. Walk in my commands, and keep my judgments, and do them, and sanctify my Sabbaths, so that it may be a sign between me and you, and it may be known (or that you may know) that I am the Lord your God. After the killing of the fathers who fell in the wilderness, he gives instructions to the sons, in whose salvation the fathers had mercy. And he said, 'The eye of the Lord has spared them so as not to completely destroy and erase them, but to reserve the fathers in the sons.' And he testifies the same things that he spoke to the fathers, so that after they have walked in his instructions and kept his judgments, and have reserved the sanctification of the Sabbath, which is a sign given, then they will know that he is their Lord God. However, the precepts and legitimate practices of the fathers and their judgments signify an unusual error: that they should not imitate the sins of those whose torments they witness.

<h2 id='tocuniq216'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verse 21, 22.) And my children have angered me, they have not walked in my commandments, and they have not kept my judgments, to do the things that when a man does them, he shall live in them, and they have violated my sabbaths. And I threatened to pour out my fury upon them, and to fulfill my anger against them in the wilderness. But I turned my hand, and I acted for the sake of my name, so that it would not be violated before the nations from whom I expelled them in their sight. But the sons, he said, followed in the footsteps of their parents, and they did everything that they had done: therefore they deserved a similar sentence; but for the same reasons by which I had mercy on their fathers, they were saved by the greatness of my mercy, and for the same causes for which I had mercy on their fathers: so that as the one and same Creator of both, I could mitigate my anger with the patience of similarity. We have gone through the obvious, and we have transitioned to the more obscure.

<h2 id='tocuniq217'>(Vers. 23, 24 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 23, 24 onward) Again I raised my hand against them in the wilderness, to scatter them among the nations and disperse them in the lands, because they had not observed my judgments and had rejected my commandments and violated my Sabbaths, and their eyes had been turned towards the idols or thoughts of their fathers. Therefore, I also gave them statutes that were not good and judgments by which they could not live; I defiled them with their own gifts when they offered or passed through everything that opens the womb because of their sins (for which the Septuagint translated, to destroy them and what they had neglected). And they shall know that I am the Lord. Where in the Old Testament, when the Lord stretched out his hand to scatter their children who had fallen in the wilderness, Scripture does not say, but we must believe that it happened as is here related. Or does this mean that after they entered the promised land, at different times and for many sins, they were handed over to various nations and kings, and during that time the commandments of the Lord which were by nature good and the judgments in which believers could live, were not good for them, since they were not able to keep the commandments of the law in captivity and to do what the divine word commanded. Nor did he say, 'I gave them evil precepts,' but 'not good.' For it does not immediately follow that what is not good is evil, as the Apostle teaches: it is good for a man not to touch a woman, but because of incontinence let each man have his own wife in sanctification and chastity (I Cor. VII). If he does not do this, it is neither good nor evil. Therefore, God gave them, dispersed among the nations, not good precepts, that is, He let them follow their own thoughts and desires to do things that are not fitting. And he defiles them in his gifts, just as a priest separates lepers from the people and shows that they are defiled; while they offer to idols what they should offer to God. And they pass through every opening of the womb by fire to Baal, that is, their firstborn; so that after they have been deserted by God and handed over to the worship of idols, then they may understand that He is the Lord, whom they have provoked to anger by their own fault. This place was more clearly interpreted by Symmachus, putting the future in place of the past. Therefore, I will also give them statutes that are not good and judgments by which they will not live. I will defile them by their own gifts, by causing every firstborn to pass through the fire, so that I may make them desolate and they will know that I am the Lord. The meaning is this: Because I saw the sons of the fathers being equal to their wickedness and doing the same things for which they had offended God, I desired to divide them into nations and scatter them throughout the whole world, and to give them statutes that are not good and judgments by which they will not live, in order to defile them with their own gifts. They were consecrating everything that opens the womb to idols, and I wanted to destroy them completely so that they would know that I am the Lord. Through these things he shows that he did not give them good commandments who were dwelling in the wilderness, but those whom he wanted to scatter among the nations and make foreigners in the whole world, he gave them commands which he did not give: so that there, by their own fault, they would do good commandments of God which were not good, while they exhibit to idols what God had commanded to be exhibited to himself. This can also be said, that before the offense, they only received the Ten Commandments; but after idolatry, they also received multiplied ceremonies of the law, so that they would rather offer victims to God which they were offering to demons, and by comparison with sacrilege, it became lighter what was not inherently good, and by no means evil, because it was offered to God, and yet not good, because they had offended the author of good.


<h2 id='tocuniq218'>(Vers. 27, 29 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 27, 29 onwards) Therefore speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Even in this they have blasphemed me, your fathers, when they have despised me and rejected me, and I had brought them into the land over which I had raised my hand to give them ((the Vulgate adds 'it')). They saw every high hill and every leafy tree, and there they offered their sacrifices, and there they provoked me with their offerings, and there they placed the fragrance of their sweetness, and there they poured out ((the Vulgate is silent on 'there')) their libations. And I said to them, 'What is the high place to which you go?' And its name was called the high place until this day. Therefore speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God: "Your fathers have provoked Me to anger with their deeds, which they have committed against Me; and I have brought them into the land which I swore to give them, which is flowing with milk and honey, and it is the glory of all lands." And they saw every high hill and every thick tree, and there they offered their sacrifices. There they presented the provocation of their offering; there they also made their soothing aroma and poured out their drink offerings.' And I said to them: What is abba, that you enter there? And they called its name abba until this day. I wanted, he says, to scatter them in the wilderness, to disperse them to all the nations, and to give them not good precepts, so that they would sacrifice to idols what they should have offered to me, and consecrate all their firstborn to them through fire, so that I would kill them and wipe them out. But when he says, 'I wanted,' he shows that he did not do what he wanted. And that which follows, 'And they shall know that I am the Lord', is not found in the Septuagint. For it did not seem fitting to them that it should be known after the killing, that he himself is the Lord. But you, son of man, speak again to them, that is, to the elders of the house of Israel, who have come to inquire of you: Your fathers, of whose descent you are, have also blasphemed against me in this, and have regarded it as nothing; after I had brought them into the land which I had given them to possess, which I had given them to possess, they turned it into a provocation against me. For when they saw every high hill and leafy tree, they would sacrifice on the mountains and in the groves and thickets, and offer victims to idols and pour out libations. When I saw this, I said to them, 'What is this, Bama?' (which is translated as high place). Why do you go to such a place that you have chosen for yourselves on all the hills, so that to this day it is called Bamoth, and the ancient error holds the original name? For Bama, which we translate as 'high place,' there is an error in the Septuagint edition, where it is written as ἀββανὰ, which means nothing in Hebrew. Bama (), if you divide the word into two syllables, can mean 'in which,' but in this context, that sense does not fit. However, wherever it is written in the books of Kings and Chronicles: 'The people still sacrificed and made offerings at the high places,' Bama in the singular and Bamoth () in the plural mean 'high places.'


<h2 id='tocuniq219'>(Vers. 30, 31.)</h2>

(Verse 30, 31.) Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus says the Lord God (the Vulgate adds 'Certainly'): By the way of your fathers you are defiled, and after their abominations you commit adultery. And in offering your gifts, when you pass your children through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. Shall I answer you, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord God, I will not answer you. You imitate the vices of your fathers and walk in the same paths, so that similar sins may deserve similar punishment. And you have advanced to such an extent in wickedness that you consecrate your children to demons through fire: and it is not enough to have done this once, but you continue to do the same even now. Not because the elders do these things in captivity, but because those who dwell in Jerusalem and to whom captivity threatens do not cease to do all these things. And when you are bound by so many sins, you seek my response? As I live, says the Lord God, I will not answer you, and what follows:

(Verse 32, 33.) And the thought of your mind will not be, saying, we will be like the nations, and like the kindred of the earth, to worship wood and stones. As I live, says the Lord God, surely with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with outpoured wrath, I will reign over you. This is the meaning: Do not think that your thoughts, by which you blaspheme against me, can be fulfilled; for it is said: We do not want to be under the Lord, nor to be called his people; but like all nations in the whole world, and every nation lives according to its own will, to worship wood and stones, and to serve idols, even we will be one nation among many. To which God responds, and swears by Himself, saying: I will not forsake you nor despise you, as negligent and fleeting servants of a master often despise, but I will restore you to my rule, with my arm outstretched and striking, with fury unleashed, and I will bring you back to your former servitude, and I will reign over you: whether you want it or not, you will have me as your king, and you will feel the wrath of the king, whose clemency you have neglected.

<h2 id='tocuniq221'>(Vers. 34.)</h2>

(Verse 34.) And I will bring you out from the peoples, and gather you from the lands where you were scattered: with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with poured-out wrath I will reign over you. I will not allow you to be among the nations, nor be held captive forever, but I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where hostile necessity has dispersed you to serve. However, I will do this not to destroy and annihilate you, but to be your king. From this we understand that they also call the cruelty of the Creator the mercy: while he is angry and rages and pours out his whole fury, in order to draw them back to his kingdom, who have chosen to serve the tyranny of the demons.

<h2 id='tocuniq222'>(Vers. 35, 36, seq.)</h2>

(Verse 35, 36, etc.) And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and I will judge you there face to face. As I contended with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will contend with you, declares the Lord. And I will subject you to my scepter, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant, and I will choose from among you transgressors and wicked ones: I will bring them out from their dwelling place, and they shall not enter the land of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord. Thus says the Lord: I will make for those of you who are in Babylon, and now serve idols, what I did for your fathers in Egypt, that I will lead you into the desert of the peoples, and there I will judge with you face to face, just as I contended with them in judgment when they came out of Egypt. And after I have judged you, I will subjugate you with my scepter and authority, and I will make a covenant with you, and bring you into your own land in the bonds of love, so that bound by my love, you cannot turn away from me. But I will choose from among you the transgressors and the wicked, who persist in the hardness of their hearts in evil deeds, not for possession, but for rejection. And I will indeed bring them out of the land of their dwelling, so that when they are brought out, they may not enter the land of Israel; but they shall perish in various regions. And by the distinction between good and evil, you shall know that I am the Lord, who does all things with judgment. The rest of the prayer hastens, and we briefly go through each thing, so that we may provide only the meaning to those who read.


<h2 id='tocuniq223'>(Vers. 39.)</h2>

(Verse 39.) And you, house of Israel, thus says the Lord God: Each one of you, walk after your idols and serve them. But if you will not listen to me in this, and you will profane my holy name further in your gifts and in your idols. LXX: And you, house of Israel, thus says Adonai the Lord: Each one of you, take away your inventions, and after this, if you will listen to me and not profane my holy name further in your gifts and in your pursuits. Symmachus has interpreted this place more clearly: Each person going to his own idols, serve, because you did not want to hear me: but do not pollute my holy name with your offerings and statues. But on my holy mountain, on the lofty mountain of Israel, says the Lord God, there all the house of Israel will serve me. Symmachus' translation has this meaning: Since you do not want to serve me, go and serve idols, and trample the footsteps of your statues. For you do not wish to listen to me, that you may not offer sacrifices to me, nor burn incense, nor call yourselves my people. For my worshipers do not serve me in the places of light, and temples, and idols, as you do: but on my holy mountain, on the lofty mountain of Israel. Moreover, the Septuagint explains the meaning. Abandon your former thoughts, and remove the sins of evil inventions: and if you listen to me after this, and do not defile my name in your offerings and idols, then you shall offer sacrifices to me on my holy mountain, and all the house of Israel shall serve me. But the eagle, truly agreeing with Symmachus in part, disagrees in part: Go, he says, after your idols, and serve them, because you are unworthy of my rule, and your worship does not please me. But if you will not even hear me in this, but you will defile my holy name, while pretending to offer to me what you offer to idols, and you make blasphemy only against my name, so that you who are worshippers of idols claim to be mine; know this, that on my holy mountain, on the lofty mountain of Israel, there all the house of Israel will serve me, not you who serve idols: but all the house of Israel that will believe after.


<h2 id='tocuniq224'>(Vers. 40, 41.)</h2>

(Verse 40, 41.) But on my holy mountain, on the mountain of the height of Israel, says the Lord God, there all the house of Israel shall serve me: all, I say, in the land where they shall please me, and there I will require your first fruits, and the beginning of your tithes, in all your sanctifications: I will receive you with a sweet odor, when I shall have brought you out from the people, and gathered you out of the lands into which you were scattered, and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations: and you shall know that I am the Lord. About this mountain on which the whole house of Israel will serve God, Isaiah and Micah sang with the same voice: In the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord will be manifest on the top of the mountains, and it will be raised up above the hills, and all nations will flow to it, and many peoples will come and say: Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house (or mountain) of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem (Isaiah 2 seq.; Micah 4:1-2). And again Isaiah says: 'Ascend to the high mountain, you who proclaim Zion; lift up your voice with strength, you who bring good news to Jerusalem' (Isaiah 40). By this mountain, we understand either the Church, which is interpreted as a "watchtower" and is established on the heights of holy teachings, or the Lord Himself, the Savior, in whom the firstfruits, tithes, and all offerings are transformed into a sweet-smelling aroma. So that all nations around, seeing that the people of the Lord are saved, may glorify God and recognize those who have been saved, that He is the Lord.


<h2 id='tocuniq225'>(Vers. 42.)</h2>

(Verse 42) When I bring you into the land of Israel, the land that I raised my hand to give to your fathers, then you will know that I am the Lord. This is the land that your fathers lost because of their own fault, and you, not on your own merit, but by my mercy, have received.

<h2 id='tocuniq226'>(Vers. 43, 44.)</h2>

(Verses 43, 44.) And you shall remember your ways and all your sins with which you have defiled yourselves; and you shall be displeased with yourselves in your own sight for all the evils that you have committed. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I deal with you for the sake of my name, not according to your evil ways and corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, says the Lord God. We cannot remember our sins and vices unless we are led into the land of Israel, and there placed we may say with the Apostle: I am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God (I Corinthians 15:9). And you will displease, he says, in your own sight in all your evils which you have done. As Symmachus interpreted. And you will appear little to yourselves because of all your evils which you have worked (Jacob. IV), so that after they have become distinguished, they may believe themselves to be humble: because the Lord gives grace to the humble. And in another place it is written: Before contrition, the heart of a man will be exalted, and before height, it will be humiliated (Prov. XVIII, 12). For the breaking of pride is humility, and exaltation follows. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I do good to you. And we come to know the Lord our Savior more when He does good to us, and when He suffers for our sins, and bears our iniquities, and grieves for us; not for any merit of those who are saved, but for the sake of His name. Otherwise, our ways and most wicked crimes have not deserved mercy, but punishment. But whatever we have said about the people of Israel, who were freed from Egypt, committed many sins in the desert, and offended God, and later were led into the promised land, worshipped idols, wood and stones, and were preserved by the mercy of God: let us recount to those who were freed from Egypt by the mighty hand of the Lord in this age, and led into the wilderness of vices, they again sighed for Egypt, and did the things for which they deserved to be punished: but nevertheless, they were preserved not by their own merit, but by the mercy of the Lord through repentance.


<h2 id='tocuniq227'>Book Seven</h2>

Book Seven

239-240. Once we read as boys: Nothing is so easy, that it does not become difficult when you do it unwillingly. I confess that I promised explanations in Ezekiel a long time ago, and due to the occupation of those coming from all over the world, I cannot fulfill them. For there is no hour, no moment, in which we do not encounter crowds of brothers and exchange the solitude of the monastery for the frequent presence of guests. To the extent that either we must close the door, or we must abandon the study of the Scriptures, through which the doors are opened. Therefore, during profitable, or rather stolen, hours of the night, which have become longer with winter approaching, we attempt to dictate these things in whatever manner to a small lamp, and to alleviate the weariness of a restless mind through interpretation. We do not boast, as some may suspect, of receiving the brotherhood, but we simply confess the reasons for our delay: especially since the flight of the Westerners and the congestion of holy places surpass the rage of the Barbarians in both nudity and the wounds of the needy. Because we cannot see without tears and groaning, that former power and ignorance of wealth have come to such poverty that she needs a roof, food, and clothing; and yet the hard and cruel minds of some are in no way softened while they cast off their little cloths and bags, seeking gold in captivity. This difficulty of dictation is added to, that with eyes dimmed by old age, and sustaining something blessed Isaac (Gen. XXVII), we are unable to read Hebrew volumes by the light of the night, which are also blinded to us by the smallness of the letters even by the brightness of the sun and day. But we only know the commentaries of the Greeks through the voices of the brothers. There is no doubt that they cause nausea to those who eat food chewed by someone else's teeth. Therefore, I beg you, daughter Eustochium, to begin with those things which we write with the pen of notaries and for which we hardly have time to correct, that is, the seventh. And as I have already said, if the brevity or length of the books are unequal to each other, attribute the brevity or length to the visions, or rather to the hypotheses, since we do not want to separate what is joined together and to compress discord into a single mass." }


<h2 id='tocuniq228'>(Vers. 45 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 45 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, turn your face towards the way of the South, and drop towards the South wind, and prophesy against the forest of the South field. And say to the forest of the South: Hear the word of the Lord: thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it will burn up every green tree and every dry tree in you. The flame of the fire will not be quenched, and it will consume every face from the South to the North. And all flesh shall see that I, the Lord, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched. And I said, ah, ah, ah, O Lord God; they say of me, Does he not speak in parables? LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, set your face against Theman, and look towards Darom, and prophesy against the forest of the south field, and say to the forest of the south field, Hear the word of the Lord, thus says the Lord: Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree. The kindled flame will not be extinguished, and it will burn in it all faces from south to north: and all flesh will know that I, the Lord, have kindled it: it will not be extinguished. And I said: Certainly not, Lord, Lord: they say to me: Is it not a parable that is spoken? What does 'put' or 'harden your face' mean, above we have spoken more fully. For by the hardening of the face and the hardness of the forehead, the Prophet needs to speak boldly, especially when sad tidings have been announced to the entire multitude of the people. But our translation has expressed what they said, that 'Nageb' better conveys the meaning of 'leader' in Hebrew, or more specifically, of the southern region. For it is not 'Sare' (), as the LXX mistakenly thought, which means 'leader' or 'prince', but it is written as 'Sade', which properly signifies 'field' or 'region', and because of the similarity between the letters 'Daleth' and 'Res', the error has persisted. Now the divine word speaks metaphorically of the leap against Jerusalem, which is the dwelling place of beasts and fierce men. It sets it on fire and all its wood will be consumed, not calling them trees that needed fruits, but wood prepared for the fire. And first it burns the green wood in it, secondly what we read in this same Prophet: 'Begin with my holy ones'; and afterwards the dry wood, which could not have any life in itself, namely the saints and sinners together, so that some may escape the evils of captivity by death, and others may be handed over to eternal punishments. And what it implies: From the South to the North, this indicates from Jerusalem to Babylon: so that the complete journey of those going into captivity, falling by sword, famine, and pestilence. For those who are in Babylon, Jerusalem is situated to the South; just as in the case of the pot in Jeremiah which signifies Jerusalem, it is set on fire from the face of the North, that is, Babylon (Jerem. I). And beautifully in the beginning: a drop, he says, towards the West; so that the full wrath of God does not seem to be poured out, but rather a certain drop and part." } But if the drop of such cruelty is so great, what should be considered in all the rainstorms? That all flesh, which is going to witness the salvation of God, may recognize that He Himself is the Lord through the burning of the forests and the flame, which is not extinguished by any help. Understanding this, the Prophet responds, ah, ah, ah, O Lord God, or as the Seventy translators rendered it, by no means, O Lord, O Lord. And he adds: And they say to me: Does this man not speak in parables? And what is this parable called? And the meaning is: Speak more plainly, we do not understand what you are saying in a parable: reveal to us the meaning in clear language. However, Theman and Nageb and Darom can be understood tropologically, Egypt being referred to: for we read in Daniel that the south often signifies Egypt (Dan. XI), and Egypt is referred to the narrowness of this world. Therefore, Ezekiel prophesies the future evils that will come to the world, which he calls a desert, lacking fruit-bearing trees but inhabited by beasts. About which it is said in the 243rd Psalm: The voice of the Lord finishing the deer, and he will reveal the hidden things of the woods (Verse 9). These are the woods and groves that devoured more from the army of Absalom in battle than the sword killed (2 Kings 18). And in the groves is first kindled a green wood, and then a dry one, symbolizing those who live in evil and those who have died to righteousness. And what is said: And every face will be burned from the south to the north, this means: From those who seemed to be fervent in spirit to those who, with the increasing iniquity and the cooling of the love of many, have lost their former warmth; so that all flesh may see the flame of the Lord not extinguished. And the prophet prays that what the Lord has threatened may not happen: that is, that the forest may not be set on fire and all the trees may not be consumed; so that either they may still have the opportunity for repentance, or they may not be compelled to announce sorrowful things to themselves, especially since the people do not understand them, and by the obscurity of his words, are rather provoked to madness.

<h2 id='tocuniq229'>(Cap. XXI.—Vers. 1 seq.)</h2>

(Chapter 21, Verses 1 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face towards Jerusalem and drop [tears] towards the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel, and say to the land of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, and I will unsheathe my sword out of its sheath and will kill both the righteous and the wicked in you. Because I will kill both the righteous and the wicked in you, therefore my sword shall go out of its sheath against all flesh, from the south to the north." } And all flesh shall know that I am the Lord, for I have drawn my sword from its sheath forever. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Therefore, prophesy, son of man, and make your face strong against Jerusalem, and look towards their holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel, and say to the land of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, and I will draw my sword from its sheath, and I will cut off from you the wicked and the unjust. Thus my sword shall go forth from its sheath over all flesh from the South to the North, and all flesh shall know that I, the Lord, have drawn my sword from its sheath: it shall not return again. For it was said above: They say of me, 'Does he not speak in parables?' and the people demanded a clear explanation. Therefore, what the Lord spoke in metaphor or parable, and as others translate it, a proverb, 244 is now spoken more openly: that the Nageb and Darom and Theman are Jerusalem, and its temple, the Holy of Holies, and the whole land of Judah; and the flame which will consume the wilderness is understood as the sword that devours, which has been drawn from its sheath to destroy the righteous and the wicked. For this is a green wood and a dry wood. Hence also the Lord: If they do these things in a green wood, what will they do in the dry? (Luke 23:31). Concerning this, I do not know what they wanted, the Seventy interpreted unfairly and unjustly, as if both did not mean the same thing. And what he had said there: And all flesh shall see, that I the Lord have kindled it, that is, the forest or the flame, and it shall not be quenched, he speaks in other words here: So that all flesh may know, that I the Lord have drawn my sword out of its sheath and it shall not be put back again. Truly, there is no fire extinguished against Jerusalem, nor an extinguished fire, nor a recalled sword, because there is little time in between, and Jerusalem with its temple was set on fire by the Babylonian flame.

<h2 id='tocuniq230'>(Vers. 6, 7.)</h2>

(Vers. 6, 7.) And you, son of man, groan with broken loins, and groan with bitterness before them. And when they say to you, 'Why do you groan?' you shall say: 'Because of the hearing, for it comes, and every heart shall faint, and all hands shall be weakened, and every spirit shall be weakened, and water shall flow through all knees.' Behold, it comes and shall be done, says the Lord (Vulgate adds God). LXX: And you, son of man, groan with broken loins, and groan in pains before them. And if they say to you, 'Why do you moan?' you shall say, 'Because of the news that has come. Every heart will faint and all hands will hang limp; every spirit will become weak and every knee will turn to water.' Surely it is coming and it will be fulfilled, declares the Lord God. First he said, 'Prophesy, or drop as a dew, to the South, to the South-West and to the South-East; and to the extreme South.' Because it seemed obscure, and the people did not understand the words of the prophet, it is further clarified, that the extreme South refers to Jerusalem, and all the unfruitful trees, on whose roots the axe is placed, symbolize its inhabitants; and the sword is interpreted as fire. Thirdly, the prophet is commanded, while they remain silent and do not ask, to do those things by which he may be questioned, and to respond what the Lord has spoken. 'Groan,' he says, 'wail with a loud voice, not with moderate grief, but with contrition of the loins, so that your groaning may be brought forth from the depths of your bowels and the bitterness of your soul. And you shall do this before them, so that when they have asked you why you are worn out with so much groaning, and what evil has befallen you that you moan thus, you may respond to them in my words: Therefore, I mourn, and I cannot conceal the pain of my heart, because the hearing that always resounded in my ears is being fulfilled by action and comes to pass: namely, the impending army of the raging Babylonians.' When he comes and surrounds Jerusalem, then all hearts will faint and all hands will be dissolved, so that, with fear seizing the minds of men, no one will dare to resist. For the spirit of all warriors will be weakened, and such great trepidation and fear will occupy everyone, so that, with fear compelling them, their limbs and intestines will dissolve, and the bladder will not be able to hold urine: so that urine will pollute the knees. For it is natural, when fear compels, for the bladder to relax, and humor to flow contrary to the will of man. Indeed, this often happens in the severity of illnesses, that after the strength of the sick has failed, not only their knees, but also their beds are soiled. Look, he says, it is happening as I have often foretold, and it is being accomplished and will be done, not by me, but by the Lord who spoke. I know someone who, in the bending of the loins and flowing waters, has recounted many testimonies, so that the purity of the prophets may be fulfilled, and the bitterness of the soul and the internal pain of the mind, that the waters of the seeds may soil the knees. But this explanation does not pertain to the current place.

<h2 id='tocuniq231'>(Vers. 8 seqq.)</h2>

(V. 8 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, prophesy and say: Thus says the Lord God, speak: A sword, a sharpened sword, and polished, to slaughter victims, it has been sharpened, and to shine, it has been polished: you who wield the scepter of my son, you have cut down every tree. And I have given it to be polished, to be held in the hand: this sword has been sharpened, and this sword has been polished, to be in the hand of the one who kills. Cry out and howl, son of man, for this has happened among my people, even among all the princes of Israel. Those who fled have been delivered up to the sword along with my people. Therefore, clap your hands upon your thigh, for it has been proven, and when the scepter is overturned, it will no longer be, says the Lord God. As for you, son of man, you are a prophet, and strike your hand against your hand, and let the sword be doubled and tripled for the slayers. This is the sword of great slaughter, which causes them to be dumbfounded, and makes their hearts melt, and multiplies their ruins." } In all their gates I have set the disturbance of a sharp and polished sword to flash: clothed for slaughter. Sharpen, go to the right or to the left, wherever your face desires. Moreover, I will clap my hands hand to hand, and satisfy my indignation, I the Lord have spoken. It is much if I present both editions, and the length of the books is extended: especially where there is either no distance or a small one. Therefore, I will present some things that differ. For what we said: 'Whoever moves the scepter of my son, you have cut down all the wood,' they translated: 'Kill, despise, repel all wood.' Again, when we said: 'Those who had fled were handed over by the sword,' they and others translated: 'My guests, or residents.' And where we said: 'Applaud on the thigh,' they put: 'Strike with the hand.' And where we translated: 'And when he overturns this with the scepter, their edition is: It is rejected by the three.' But he speaks to the sword of Nebuchadnezzar, that it may come against Jerusalem, to be sharpened and polished, for many are to be slaughtered; and he addresses himself to it. You are the one who moves and overturns the scepter of my son, the kingdom of the people of Israel, and you cut down every tree, the entire multitude of the people. I have given, he says, that sword, to be held in the hand of Nebuchadnezzar; and let it be in the hand of the most powerful man. Therefore, O prophet, cry out and howl, and with the force of a mournful voice bear witness to the impending evils. This sword spared no one and left no one untouched by impending evils. It was made among the people, made among the leaders of Israel, made among my guests and priests who dwelled in my temple. Therefore, strike your thigh or your hand, and assume the attire of mourning. For this sword has been tested by me, and by it my scepter and kingdom will be overthrown, and it will not exist anymore. It will be concluded with King Zedekiah. Again, I command you, prophet, to strike the thigh, which you have struck before in astonishment and wonder, and also strike the hand, so that not only once, but a second and third time, the sword comes to kill. First, indeed, came Nebuchadnezzar when he took Jehoiachin; and secondly, when Joachim reigned for 247 years; thirdly, when Zedekiah reigned. And this is the tripled sword, when a great slaughter was made, and it multiplied ruins to such an extent that they were amazed in their minds and wasted away in their hearts, and gave confusion in all their gates. Therefore it is commanded to him, that is, with a sharp and polished sword to shine, and being clothed and unencumbered, and prepared for slaughter, to go either to the right or to the left. Whichever way, he says, your face pleases, boldly enter, having me as your leader, as your helper. I will clap hand to hand, as if I were your supporter and encourager, to urge you on against my adversaries who are raging against you. Do not hesitate, do not fear, and endure what Sennacherib has suffered: I am the Lord who spoke, you are the servant of my will, fulfill my command. We are able, according to the anagoge, to take up a sharp and prepared sword for the slaughter of the devil, about whom the Apostle says: Deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved (1 Cor. 5:5). And in another place: Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme (1 Tim. 1:20). And in the Psalms it is written: He sent forth his anger and wrath and trouble, a mission by the agency of evil angels (Ps. 78:49). Some people think that this sword was in the hand of an angel when Jerusalem was struck under David (2 Kings 24). Others suspect that it refers to the sword mentioned in the Gospel: 'I did not come to bring peace but a sword' (Matthew 10:34), to divide all affection of kinship between them, so that the wicked may fall and the holy may rise. But it is wicked to believe this about the sword of the Savior, rather than about the devil, who overturns the scepters of the Lord in the Church, who kills everyone in the people, and the leaders, and the guests of God. And it is approved by the Lord when he overturns Judas the betrayer and his like (John 13). After he ate the morsel, Satan entered into him. And the sword of the killers is doubled and tripled, in order to release the sin of Jerusalem, because he has taken upon himself his double sins from the hand of the Lord. But the Lord rejoices and exults, and he encourages the raging sword to go either to the right or to the left, and wherever his desire takes it, so that the evil ones may be killed, and the good ones may remain, and that which is written may be fulfilled: What does chaff have to do with wheat? Thus says the Lord (Jeremiah 23:32).

<h2 id='tocuniq232'>(Vers. 18 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 18 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, set yourself two ways, and let the sword of the king of Babylon come. From one land they shall both come out, and by his hand he shall take the lot: he shall throw it upon the head of the road of the city. You shall set a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah, and to the fortified Jerusalem. For the king of Babylon stood in the fork of the road, seeking divination, mixing arrows. He consulted the idols, examined the entrails. To his right a divination was made concerning Jerusalem, so that he may set up battering rams, open the mouth in slaughter, raise the voice in howling, set up battering rams against the gates, heap up a siege ramp, build fortifications. And it will be as if consulting an oracle in vain in their eyes, and imitating the rest of the Sabbath, but he himself will remember the iniquity to capture. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have brought your iniquities to remembrance, and have revealed your transgressions, and your sins have appeared in all your thoughts; because, I say, you have brought them to remembrance, you will be captured by the hand. I know that in this place, according to the Septuagint interpreters, I have read a multifarious exposition of the law, referring to the people of the Gentiles: but Judah and Jerusalem to those who gather under the name of Christ, and by their deeds give honor to his name, with the devil, the king of confusion, standing at the head of every road, and plotting in secret; and they fulfill that verse: They have placed a stumbling block for me along the path (Psalm 139); and they make him stand at the crossroads, desiring to hold those who are his own or acquire new servitude for themselves; and to always proceed to the right, namely, those who are positioned on the right, in order to conquer them, to exult in slaughter, to capture miserable Jerusalem with rams and the accumulation of earthly works; and first of all, to appear to be doing nothing, and to strive in vain. But by recalling their iniquities, those who dwell in the Church, or rather, who bring adversaries to mind through evil deeds, expose all the sins of the people and their thoughts; and for this reason they are captured, because they have added new offenses to old ones. Another person may have said this, the truth of our history must be pursued. When, he said to me, the divine word had spoken: Prophet, son of man, speak to the sword and say: Sword, sword, and the rest that the prophecy of the sword contains; a second time the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Do you want, son of man, to know who this sword is, and to learn more clearly the persona of the raging sword? Listen to what I say: set up two roads, so that through them the sword of the king of Babylon may come, who will indeed go by one route of the Chaldeans, but when he comes through the desert and wilderness to the crossroads of the land of Arabia, which is called the land of the Ammonites, one road leads to Jerusalem on the right side, but the other to Rabbath of the Ammonites, which is the capital city and is today called Philadelphia. He said, remember the massacre that happened to the Assyrian king when one hundred and eighty-five thousand were killed in one night; he will fear to turn to the right and go against the highly fortified Jerusalem. But he will stand at the crossroads and consult the oracle of his people's customs, to send his arrows into the quiver and mix them, whether inscribed or marked with the names of individuals, so that he may see which arrow comes out and which city he should attack first. The Greeks call this βελομαντία, or ῥαβδομαντία. So the idols were asked questions and the entrails were consulted. The divination turned to the right, indicating that they should march against Jerusalem, besiege it, build up ramparts, set up battering rams, construct fortifications, enclose the city, open their mouths in slaughter, and stir up the shouting and howling of a triumphant army. By doing this, he said, the inhabitants of Jerusalem will appear to consult the oracle in vain; and as if wasting the Sabbath rest, they will play, of course, and accomplish nothing. But the king of Babylon, not relying on his own strength, but on the iniquity of the people, which he knows has offended God, and has accumulated sins upon sins, and all their transgressions have been exposed; and therefore he will not doubt his victory, because he trusts in the wickedness of Jerusalem. These things, according to the Hebrew text, differ from the Septuagint not so much in meaning as in wording in many places.

(Verse 25 and following) 250 But you, profane and wicked leader of Israel, whose day has come at the appointed time of injustice. This is what the Lord God says: Remove the turban, take off the crown. Is this not the one who exalted the lowly and humbled the exalted? I will bring iniquity upon iniquity upon iniquity, and this will not happen until the one whose judgment it is comes and I will deliver it to him. Septuagint: And you, profane and unjust leader of Israel, whose day has come at the end of the time of injustice. Thus says the Lord God: You have removed the crown and set it aside. This will not be the same. You have humbled the exalted and lifted up the lowly. I will bring upon her iniquity, iniquity, and this will not be so until the one to whom it belongs comes: and I will give it to him. Symmachus interpreted this passage as follows: But you, profane and unjust ruler of Israel, whose day has come at the appointed time of iniquity: Thus says the Lord God: He has removed the crown and taken it: neither this nor that: he will lift up the lowly and humble the exalted. I will bring iniquity upon it, I will bring iniquity upon it, I will bring iniquity upon it. And it was not this one, whose judgment it is, whom I will give. After the destruction and captivity of the city of Jerusalem and of the people, the speech is directed to the leader of Israel, whom no one doubts is signified as Zedekiah, in whom the kingship of Israel from the lineage of David is ended. The day has come to you, it says, which has been appointed for a long time in you, and because of you the priesthood and kingdom of the people of Judah has perished. For the mitre is the distinctive sign of the Pope, that is, the crown or diadem, the symbol of a king. Is this not the mitre, and this the crown, which has done nothing by judgment; but in imitation of the king of Babylon, whom he wished to exalt and whom he wished to humble? Therefore, not once, nor twice according to the Septuagint, but for a third time I will place before you wickedness forever, which was not immediately reckoned to you, but until Christ comes, whose judgment it is, and the Father gives him the kingdom and the priesthood, or the Church gathered from the nations. For the Father does not judge anyone, but he has given all judgment to the Son (John 5:22). And in another place: 'Give your judgement to the king, O God, and your justice to the son of a king' (Ps. LXXI, 1). This is the one to whom authority and eternal priesthood have been entrusted, of whom Jacob spoke: 'The ruler shall not fail from Juda, nor the leader from his thigh, till he come that is to be sent, and he shall be the expectation of nations' (Gen. XLIX, 10). In the place where we have interpreted it: 'Is not this,' translated Symmachus excellently, 'whether this or that.' For as He had said, 'Take away the diadem, remove the crown,' He added, 'Neither this nor that,' that is, the kingdom will not cease and neither will the priesthood. Therefore, those who were kings and priests after that until the coming of Christ, one of whom was the high priest Hyrcanus who placed the diadem on his head in vain sought to claim both this and that when the kingdom was not owed to him after Zedekiah, but to the one to whom it was entrusted, and who was the expectation of the nations, of whom Malachi speaks, 'You priests who defile my name' (Malachi 1:6). And after a little while: It is not my will in you, and I will not accept victims from your hands. From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the nations, and in every place a clean offering is sacrificed and offered to my name. This clean offering, without the blood of goats, rams, and bulls (Ps. 49), is fulfilled in the coming of Christ, when he came as the long-awaited one for the nations, and the sun of righteousness rose, in whose wings there is healing (Haggai 2).


<h2 id='tocuniq234'>(Vers. 28 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 28 and following) And you, son of man, prophet, say: Thus says the Lord God to the sons of Ammon, and to their reproach. And you shall say: Sword, sword, unsheathe yourself for the purpose of killing; sharpen yourself to destroy and to shine. When they seemed to you to be empty and their divinations to be lies, in order that you may be given over upon the necks of the wicked butchers, whose day has come at the appointed time of iniquity. Return to your sheath, to the place where you were created: in the land of your birth I will judge you. And I will pour out my indignation upon you, in the fire of my wrath I will blow upon you, and I will give you into the hands of foolish people, and skillful craftsmen who will bring about destruction. You will be fuel for the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the earth. You will be forgotten, for I the Lord have spoken. The sword of the king of Babylon stood at the head of the two roads, at the fork in the road, where one led to Jerusalem and the other to Rabbath of the Ammonites. He consulted the oracle, and it was determined to go to Jerusalem first, as we read above. After it has been attacked and captured, it declares that his kingdom and priesthood have also been destroyed forever. The remaining portion belonged to the sons of Ammon, and even their division demanded what had been done on the left-hand side. Hence the prophet is commanded to speak to the sons of Ammon, and to their disgrace, that they themselves may be captured and the same sword directs its discourse: O sword, sword, you who are prepared for slaughter, who are polished so as to shine and kill; although idols may have responded to you, and everything that is answered by demons is vain, that is, in order that you may threaten the necks of the wounded, and through you may accomplish what the Lord had threatened long before; nevertheless, after completing your work, which you have done against the sons of Ammon, return to your sheath, that is, to Babylon, to the place where you were made and created: so that in the land of your birth I may judge you, and pour out my indignation upon you, and you may be captured by the power of the Medes and Persians. That which is said more fully in the book of Isaiah, in the vision against Babylon: Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them. And after a little while: And Babylon, that glorious city among kingdoms, that renowned city of the Chaldeans, shall be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah: it shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be settled from generation to generation (Isa. 13:17-22). And because once he spoke in the person of the sword concerning the king, or rather the kingdom of Babylon, he preserves the metaphor. In the fire, he says, of my wrath I will breathe upon you; so that I may consume you with fire, and deliver you into the hands of stupid and foolish men, who have no skill in forging swords and sharpening them; so that you shall no longer be sharpened, polished, and shining for slaying; but you shall be the food of fire, and your blood, which you poured out before all who watched, shall rather abound in you; and you shall be consigned to eternal oblivion, and shall perish forever, for I the Lord have spoken, whose word, once spoken, is fulfilled.


<h2 id='tocuniq235'>(Cap. XXII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 22, Verses 1 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, do you not judge the city of blood, and show her all her abominations? And you shall say: Thus says the Lord God: The city that sheds blood within herself, that her time may come, and that makes idols against herself to defile herself. In your blood that you have shed, you have become guilty, and in your idols that you have made, you have defiled yourself, and you have brought near your days, and have come to your years; therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mockery to all the countries. Those who are near and those who are far from you will triumph over you (or mock you), you sordid noble, great in destruction. Behold, the princes of Israel, each with his own arm, were in you to shed blood. They have treated father and mother with contempt in you (or cursed father and mother). They have slandered the stranger among you. They have troubled (or oppressed) the orphan and the widow among you. You have despised my sanctuaries (or you have rejected and defiled), you have profaned my Sabbaths. There were detractors (or thieves) in you to shed blood, and they ate on the mountains in you. They committed a crime (or, as it is more significant in Hebrew, Zemma, that is, incest) in your midst. They uncovered the more shameful things of their father in you, and they humiliated the filthiness of menstruating women in you, and each one committed an abomination with the wife of his neighbor, and the father-in-law defiled his daughter-in-law wickedly. He oppressed (or humiliated) his own sister, the daughter of his own father, in you. They accepted bribes from you to shed blood. You received interest and excessive profits, and greedily slandered your neighbors (or and I will complete the full measure of your wickedness in your oppression); you have forgotten me, says the Lord God. Behold, I will clap my hands on your greed that you have committed, and on the blood that has been shed in your midst. Will your heart endure, or will your hands prevail in the days that I will bring upon you? I the Lord have spoken, and I will do it. I will disperse you among the nations and scatter you among the countries, and I will put an end to your uncleanness. And I will possess you in the sight of the nations, and you shall know that I am the Lord. And you, he said, son of man (for I will use the customary term with you), judge the city of bloodshed, and show her all her abominations, so that she may know that she is deserving of imminent captivity and has brought upon herself the time of her ruin with much bloodshed. Firstly, among all your sins, you have worshipped idols instead of God; and you have defiled the works of your hands, and have hastened the coming of the years that were spoken of for a long time and delayed, in order to bring about repentance. But you, according to your unrepentant heart, store up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath (Romans II). Therefore, I have made you a disgrace among the nations and a mockery in all the lands that surround you, both near and far. They will triumph over you and mock you. You are filthy, noble, and great in your destruction. Filthy, because you have ceased to be pure. Noble in evil, you who once surpassed all cities in nobility in righteousness. Great destruction: the higher you were, the more strongly you fell. And in the meantime, without mentioning other things, I will mention a few that were in you. Your leaders, judging not by justice but by the strength and might of their arm, shed innocent blood in you. Others dishonored their father and mother, either by cursing or speaking ill of their parents, as Scripture says: Whoever curses father or mother must be put to death (Exodus 21:17). They oppressed the foreigner and the stranger in your midst, as if their journey and exile from their homeland were not enough for them. They distressed and oppressed the orphan and the widow, as if those whose whole estate is in the justice of the law should not only be distressed but also oppressed by you. You have despised my sanctuaries, or holy things, and you have defiled my Sabbaths, so that you do not distinguish between that which is holy and that which is profane, between the appointed day of religion and the rest of the Sabbath for the worship of God, and the other days on which it is permitted by law to work and serve the needs of the flesh. Detractors, according to Symmachus and Theodotion, were deceitful, blaspheming God or committing all kinds of deceit or violence. They feasted on the high mountains, wise and proud, committing abominable acts of wickedness or incest in your midst. They did openly what is rarely done in secret corners, when evildoers try to avoid the prying eyes of conscious men. The following passage explains what incest is: They have exposed more shameful things before you, the father and stepmother having engaged in unlawful and immoral relations, and have humiliated the impurity of the menstruating woman within, not sparing nature and not granting respite to immorality, and clinging to the wife of their nearest relative. And what is even more heinous, the father-in-law has become inflamed with desire for his daughter-in-law, and the brother has disregarded the laws of his sister: he violated his sister not as a half-sister, but as one with the same father. They accepted gifts; to shed innocent blood. They turned the need of the poor into profit, to collect interest and excess; and because of greed, they slandered friends. But you have done this, oh Jerusalem, because you have forgotten me. For the memory of God excludes all wickedness. Therefore, I have taken on the appearance of an angry Lord, and I have clapped my hands against your greed, and against the blood that has been shed among you; so that you may understand and know, whether with your mind or with your hands, if I can bear anger. For I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will act. And after you have been captured, Jerusalem, I will scatter you among the nations and fan you away in the air, like useless chaff to be tossed here and there. Such is my mercy, that my cruelty may be turned into compassion. For I will do all things to remove your impurity from you, and to restore your former purity. And when you have received it, I will possess you in the sight of all the nations, so that when you are possessed by me, then you may understand that I am the Lord. But if we follow the interpretation of Symmachus and Theodotion, one of whom says, 'And I will wound you, or strike through:' the other, 'I will defile you before the Gentiles, and all things that are to be reported to an evil purpose:' although this is contrary to the meaning here given, which says above, 'And I will cause your uncleanness to cease from you.' For the ceasing of uncleanness is the restoration of purity. I have discussed both editions equally, in order to avoid the prolixity of the books.


<h2 id='tocuniq236'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 17 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me; all of them, bronze and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace; they have become the dross of silver. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because you have all become dross, therefore behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem as silver and bronze and iron and tin and lead are gathered into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire on it to melt it. So I will gather you in my fury, and in my wrath, and I will rest, and burn you, and I will set you on fire in the heat of my anger, and you will be melted in the midst of it, as silver is melted in the midst of a furnace: so you will be in the midst of it, and you will know that I am the Lord, when I have poured out my indignation upon you. The Hebrew word Sig (), Symmachus translates as scum, the first edition of Aquila translates as grape skin and grape stalk, both of which mean grape kernel. However, its second translation, and the Septuagint version, implies a mixture. Furthermore, scum, impurities, and waste of metals are meant; so that subsequently, with the neighboring captivity, or rather with the imminent destruction of the city, fire is applied: so that during the process of mixing, pure silver remains, which had been mixed and contaminated with copper, tin, iron, and lead: of which three, copper, tin, and lead, are fusible materials and are dissolved by fire. But indeed, iron between an anvil and a hammer becomes soft and thin, and takes on various shapes, according to the will of the craftsman. Just as silver, which the aforementioned metals have violated, is placed in a furnace, so that it remains pure after the impurities and foreign materials have been removed: so, he says, I will gather you in the midst of Jerusalem, and I will surround Babylon with siege, in order to kindle a fire in you for melting. And just as there the immense heat of flames makes [silver] into liquid, so hunger and pestilence will do here: so that after I have gathered you and set you on fire with the fire of fury, then I will rest, and I will alleviate the contempt of pain, and I will restrain your punishments by their finality. And I will do all this, so that after I have poured out my indignation on you, the end of your torment will be known to me: and you shall know that I am the Lord, the judge of all and the avenger. Moreover, what is said to be the blower, we read in many other places, but especially in Malachi and Isaiah, of whom one says: Behold, the Lord is coming forth like the fire of a blower and like the herb of washers, and he shall sit down blowing like gold and silver, and he shall blow the sons of Levi. Another [passage]: 'And the Lord will wash away the filth of the sons and daughters of Zion, and will cleanse the blood from their midst with the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning' (Isaiah 4:4). And I believe it to sound like what is said in the Psalms: 'Examine me, O Lord, and try me' (Psalm 26:2). After which it is added: 'Burn my reins and my heart, so that all the harmful moisture of the loins, and their sins, may be dried up, and the covering that is placed upon [them]' (257). Let us understand about the state of souls, which were created pure by God: they have received gold in sense and wisdom, and silver in speech and eloquence, so that they may explain with words what they have conceived in their mind. Concerning silver, we read: The words of the Lord are pure words: silver tried by fire, purified seven times (Psalm 12:6). Likewise, the sixty-seventh psalm contains about gold and silver, where it is written: If ye have slept among the midst of lots, the wings of a dove, covered with silver, and her hinder parts in the paleness of gold (Psalm 77:14). For all the glory of the king's daughter inwards (Psalm 44:14), who speaks in the Song of Songs: The king has brought me into his chamber (Song of Songs 1:3). And whoever sleeps and rests between the two Testaments, immediately assumes the silver wings of a dove and shines with the brightness of gold in the treasure of his heart. I believe that this should be understood in the sense that heaven is brass and earth is iron for sinners and those who have earned the wrath of God, especially the land of Egypt, from which the Lord brought forth Israel, as if from an iron furnace. In Zacharia also wickedness sits upon a talent of lead (Zech. 5). And in the song of Exodus it is said: They sank like lead in the violent water (Exod. 15, 10). For they were weighed down by the heavy burden of sins, and they could say: Heavy burdens have been placed upon me (Ps. 38, 6). And just as the appearance of gold disguises the adulterous nature of brass, so does tin imitate the whiteness of silver, which the simple and rustic person cannot easily discern. And it often happens that gold and silver mixed with heretical wickedness are separated by the fire of the Holy Spirit and the judgment of the Lord, and pure gold remains, and silver, of which the prophet says: I gave them silver and gold; but they made Baal from them (Hosea II, 8). Similar to this is: I brought them out in silver and gold, and there was no weak one among their tribes (Psalm CV, 37): and may the end of all punishments be to know that He Himself is the Lord. We have interpreted what the stone of tin, or tin mass, signifies in its proper place, as we read in Zachariah (Zech. IV).

<h2 id='tocuniq237'>(Vers. 23 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 23 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, say to him: You are unclean earth, not washed on the day of fury. The conspiracy of the prophets in its midst, like a roaring lion tearing its prey: they have devoured souls, taken riches and treasures, and multiplied its widows in its midst. Its priests have despised my law and defiled my sanctuaries. They have not kept a distinction between the holy and the profane, and have not understood the difference between the unclean and the clean. They have turned their eyes away from my Sabbaths, and I have become defiled among them. Its leaders in its midst are like wolves tearing prey, shedding blood, destroying souls, and greedily pursuing profits. Its prophets coat them with false visions and prophesy lies, saying: Thus says the Lord God, when the Lord has not spoken. They slander the people of the land and violently seize their possessions. They oppress the needy and the poor, and mistreat the strangers without justice. And I sought from them a man who would stand in the breach and stand against me for the land, so that I would not destroy it, and I did not find one. So I poured out my indignation on them, I consumed them in the fire of my wrath. I have repaid their way on their own heads, says the Lord God. The diligent listener could inquire what the dross is, which has violated the purity of silver and has mixed it with copper, lead, tin, and iron. Therefore, what is expressed there under the person of the city and the furnace, and under the appearance of unwatered earth, which has not received rain, is preached. We must understand those rains about which it is written: I will command the clouds that they rain no shower upon it (Isa. V, 6): which we await, when temporary and late rain is given to us, about which it is written: You will make a voluntary rain, O God, to your inheritance (Ps. LXVII, 10). However, there is a day of wrath, which each person attracts to themselves with a multitude of sins. We desire to know what the scum of the city is, which is like the hardest of lands and full of thorns and foul-smelling weeds. He said, 'The conspiracy of the prophets, or according to the Septuagint, the leaders within it have the likeness of a lion, about which Peter also writes: 'Our adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goes about' (1 Peter 5:8). This lion and all its companions do not seek to devour bodies, but souls; they receive rewards and judge everything by money. There is no doubt that this happened to the Jewish people in that time. For the Lord brought evil upon them because of the priests, princes, and prophets.' But in our Jerusalem we often see this: those who, according to the Septuagint, devour souls in power, and receive payment of 259, in order to make many widows who have lost the Lord as their bridegroom. However, this is the faction and conspiracy of these prophets, that they may be supporters of each other and do all things for the sake of disgraceful gain. The priests who should be the leaders of the temple, and from whose mouth the knowledge of the Law is sought, violate the sanctuaries, and have no distinction between the holy and the profane, except for money. They turn their eyes away from the sabbath, and do not recognize the rest of God which is in the knowledge of the Scriptures; neither do they say with the prophet: Open my eyes, and I will consider the wonders of your law (Psalm CXVIII, 18). Nor that of the Apostle: But we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image (2 Corinthians III, 18). Among such prophets and priests, the middle Lord is defiled, of whom it is written: There stands among you one whom you do not know (John I, 26). Therefore, prophets or leaders are compared to lions. But the rulers whom we understand as people of lower rank imitate the rapaciousness of wolves, so that they may shed not the blood of bodies, but of souls, and greedily pursue gains, not at all content with that: 'Those who serve at the altar, live from the altar' (1 Cor. 9:13); but once they have entered into the ministry of God, they gather the riches of Croesus. Those prophets who foretell the future also anointed them without moderation, about which we have also spoken above, the prophesying prophets who anointed the wall without the mixture of chaff, which is scattered by the rain. They see such things in vain, and they do not so much prophesy as they divinely foretell falsehood, saying to the miserable earth: Thus says the Lord, the Lord promises these things, when the Lord has not spoken to them. But the people of the earth is not of God, but of earthly works, being envious of princes and priests, and by deceit and power they did everything: not oppressing the rich, but the poor, of whom it is written: But the poor cannot endure intimidation. Moreover, the redemption of a man's soul is his own wealth (Prov. XIII, 8). They also oppressed a stranger and a foreigner, who had not yet become a citizen of the Church, but only a listener, and had the beginnings of faith, in order that after they had traveled across the sea and the dry land, they would make him a proselyte and make him a child of Gehenna. Among such a multitude of vices and crimes, I sought for a man who could resist my anger, and who could oppose my fire and burning like Moses, Aaron, and Samuel; and I could not find one. Whereas he spoke to Moses: Let me alone, that I may destroy this people (Exod. XXXII, 10). And because I could not find anyone resisting and holding me back, therefore I poured out all my wrath upon them and consumed them, not without measure and judgment, but to repay their ways upon their heads, attributing their own sins to them as the authors, or certainly to the heads of the people, their leader, ruler, and prophets, none of whom dared to resist the angry Lord, and because of whom the land became barren and desolate, not deserving to receive the rain of the Lord.


<h2 id='tocuniq238'>(Cap. XXIII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 23, Verses 1 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother. They committed adultery in Egypt; in their youth, they were promiscuous. There their breasts were fondled, and their virgin bosoms were pressed. (Or, as in the Septuagint, Their breasts were crushed there, and there they lost their virginity). Their names were Oholah the elder (or older) and Oholibah her sister. And I had them (or they were made for me), and they bore sons and daughters. And their names were Samaria Oolla, and Jerusalem Ooliba. Therefore, Oolla fornicated above me, and she went insane (or went away) to her lovers in Assyria, who approached (or were approaching) her, dressed in hyacinth (blue), princes and magistrates, all the young chosen men, cavalry riders. And she bestowed her harlotries upon the chosen sons of Assyria, all of whom she had desired, with all their idols she defiled herself. Moreover, she did not abandon her harlotries which she had practiced in Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her, and they uncovered her virgin bosom and poured out their harlotry upon her. Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the sons of Assyria, upon whom she doted. They uncovered her shame, they took away her sons and her daughters; and her they slew with the sword. And she became famous among women (or became infamous among women); and they executed judgments (or avenged themselves) upon her. The Scripture attests that the twelve tribes of Israel, who were joined together in Egypt, were afterwards divided into two and ten tribes, called Judah and Israel, as recorded in the Books of Kings and Chronicles. Judah ruled from the lineage of David, Rehoboam the son of Solomon in Jerusalem, where the temple and priests were, and a large part of the tribe of Levi. However, to the ten tribes in Samaria, Jeroboam the son of Nabat from the tribe of Ephraim and Joseph; of which Samaria is now called Oolla, which in our language means tabernacle: but Jerusalem is called Ooliba, which is, my tabernacle in her. Indeed, even in the ten tribes there was a tabernacle not of God, but of idols. For Jeroboam, in order to turn the people away from the worship of God, placed golden calves in Dan and Bethel. Let us speak therefore about each of them. Those two women, Samaria and Jerusalem, were daughters of the same mother, born from the lineage of Israel, and they committed adultery in Egypt in their youth. For they would not have received the Law brought out of Egypt on Mount Sinai, which prohibited them from worshiping idols, unless they had worshiped the Egyptian abominations in Egypt. However, the mother of both can be Chethaea, of whom we read above: Your father was Amorrhæus, and your mother Chethaea (Above, XVI, 3). But also when it is said: Let each one remove the abominations of Egypt from his sight, this signifies that the Israelites served idols in Egypt, and there they fell, whether their breasts of virginity were broken, and Samaria is said to be greater and older, either because of the multitude of the ten tribes, or because after the death of Moses, Jesus the son of Nave ruled over the people of the tribe of Ephraim: hence we read that Jeroboam, who split them, was from the house of David (3 Kings, XII). And God had them, whether they were made by him, when they groaned from the works of Egypt, serving mud and clay. And later they bore sons and daughters to him, either in the wilderness or in the promised land. And first Oolla, that is, Samaria, fornicated against God when she went mad for the Assyrians, who were dressed in her hyacinth robes, not just anyone from the people, but rulers and officials, not old ones, but all young men, chosen horsemen, from whom she followed idols, and from whom she asked for help against the command of God. Those who came and defiled her, so that they would not leave whatever she had done in her youth in Egypt, 262. For even the Egyptians had intercourse with her in her youth, whose idols she worshipped; and there she was deflowered, and her breasts were broken. And there was such an abundance of fornication that it is said that they did not fornicate with her, but poured out their own fornication upon her. Therefore she was handed over to her lovers, Phul and Theglathphalassar, and Salmanasar, in whose madness they uncovered her shame, metaphorically, as if she were a prostitute (2 Kings 17 and 18, 1 Chronicles 5). But the revelation of the city is captivity, those who took their sons and daughters captive and killed the city itself with the sword, so that it was slaughtered as an example to all women; and it is celebrated in the conversation of all in a negative sense. Those who executed judgments and punishments in it left nothing of salvation in it; but even today the ten tribes are held captive in the mountains and cities of the Medes, to where they were transferred. We have discussed in more detail in the anagoge of the prophet Hosea what Joseph, Ephraim, Samaria, Jezreel, and Israel signify, and how they are contrary to the house of David and Jerusalem, which signifies the Church. Of whom the seventy-seventh psalm speaks: The sons of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle (Ps. LXXVI, 9). And again: He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim (Ibid., 67). For God has chosen the house of confession, the Church, and has rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, which is interpreted as increase. They, neglecting the Law of God, added to their golden calves of worship, and are called Oolla, that is, tabernacle, not of God, but of error and demons. And the older and elder sister, because of the multitude and captivity by the Assyrians, committed fornication against God, because she abandoned the truth of the faith, and went mad for the leaders of heretics, who were dressed in purple, promising her high and heavenly things; and companions, of whom it is said: These in chariots, and in horses (Ps. XIX, 8), choosing the sons of the Assyrians and the leaders and magistrates, who promise knowledge and eloquence to themselves. But he did this because he practiced the same fornications that he had in Egypt, that is, before he believed, and he still lived in the world, and he also engaged in heresy. And she was defiled (or 'they were defiled') by Assyrian men who persist in wickedness, 263 or by avengers. For our adversary the devil himself is an enemy and avenger (1 Peter 5). They shattered the breasts of Samaria, and they destroyed her virginity that she had in the Church. Therefore she was given over to her lovers, just as the Apostle wrote: I delivered them to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme (I Tim. I, 20). And: I delivered them to the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved (I Cor. V, 5). They uncovered the shame of wretched Samaria, and they displayed all her turpitude, leading captive the sons and daughters who were born to her, endowed with knowledge, and they deceived the simple and inexperienced, and they killed her by the spiritual sword. They are celebrated in a bad way by the entire world and become famous among all the teachings of this age, so that the turpitude of that woman may be punished as an example to all women.

(Verse 11 and following) When her sister Oholibah saw this, she became more insane with lust than she was. She shamelessly engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians, offering herself for sex to their sons. She attracted the attention of the leaders and officials who came to her, dressed in various (or precious) garments, riding on horses with riders, and accompanied by exceptionally attractive young men. And I saw that both of them had defiled the same path, and she increased her acts of prostitution. And when he saw the painted men on the wall, images of the Chaldeans depicted in colors, and their loins girded with belts, and their heads adorned with dyed turbans: in the likeness of all the nobles (or all the wise men) of the sons of Babylon, and of the land of the Chaldeans, from which they were born: and he was inflamed with desire for them, and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. And when the sons of Babylon came to her to her bed  (or to her dwelling place), they defiled her with their fornication, and she was polluted with them, and her soul turned away from them. And she uncovered her fornications, and exposed her disgrace; and my soul departed from her, as my soul departed from her sister. For she multiplied her fornications, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the harlot in the land of Egypt. And she became obsessed with desire for their concubines, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys and whose emission is like the emission of horses. And you visited the wickedness of your youth: when your breasts were pressed in Egypt, and your maiden breasts were broken. According to the letter, the easy interpretation is that Oholibah, that is, Jerusalem, where the tabernacle of God was, saw the wounds of her sister and was not warned by the example to turn her foot away from error, but rather increased her sister's prostitution. For she once made idols outside in Dan and Bethel: but she frequently worshiped the statue of Baal in the high places and in the temple of God, and fornicated with the Assyrians. But the idol of Baal, or Bel, and (to speak more plainly) Belis, is the religion of the Assyrians, consecrated by Ninus the son of Belis in honor of his father. And it shamelessly displayed its fornication to the Assyrians, to the leaders and magistrates, who were dressed in various and multicolored garments, to the horsemen and to the young men, all of them outstanding in appearance, so that the fornication of both sisters became one. Furthermore, it increased its own fornications in Jerusalem, for when it saw in the walls the images of the Chaldeans, it was driven mad with lust and, deceived by their appearance and dress, it sent messengers to them, asking for help: they came and defiled it. And because pleasure is not everlasting, but quickly brings satiety: being polluted and saturated with such things, she departed from their company. And I, seeing all the infamous acts and fornications publicly displayed by everyone, also departed from her, so that I might surpass the crimes of my sister by the magnitude of her punishments. Such was the audacity of her vice, that she committed all the errors of her youth in a more serious age: and she indulged in Egyptian vices as well as the lusts of the Chaldeans. For he once went mad in the company of the Egyptians, whose flesh resembles that of donkeys, and whose semen flows so abundantly, and their genitals are so large, that they exceed even the ugliness of horses. Nor did his wickedness cease in his youth: rather, it returned after it happened to me, so that he surpassed his former lust both in the wilderness and in the land of promise, where he lost her virginity and her breasts were broken, and all the beauty of her virginity perished. Furthermore, according to the allegory, it is difficult to understand how the Church overcomes heretical lust, unless perhaps we can say this, that the servant who knows the will of his master and does not do it, will be beaten with many lashes (Luke XII, 47): and that heretics commit abominable things outside the ark and perish in the shipwreck: but if the followers of Ecclesiastes imitate the true faith, let them imitate the vices of Assyria and Chaldea and follow the colorless images of sins, they will be worthy of greater torments. We do not send messengers to the Chaldeans, who interpret like demons, when we open ourselves to them, and offer them our breasts to be broken in the chest where the abode of the mind is, and being satisfied with pleasures, we move from one to another; and we desire not so much fornication as the number of prostitutes, and we come to such frenzy that after a long time of servitude to the Lord, we return to Egypt and do the things we did in the world before we received the name of faith.


<h2 id='tocuniq240'>(Vers. 22 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 22 and following) Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will stir up all your lovers against you, from whom your soul is satiated, and I will gather them against you from all around: the sons of Babylon and all the Chaldeans, nobles, tyrants, and princes, all the sons of Assyria with their handsome appearance, governors and officials, all the princes of princes and renowned horsemen. And they shall come against you with chariots and wheels, and with a multitude of peoples armed with breastplate, shield, and helmet from all sides. And I will give them judgment, and they will judge you with their judgments, and I will put my zeal in you, which they exercise with you in fury. They will cut off your nose and your ears, and what remains, they will cut off with a sword. They will take your sons and daughters, and your last one will be devoured by fire, and they will strip you of your garments, and they will take away the vessels of your glory. And they will make your wickedness cease from you, and your fornication from the land of Egypt: you will not lift your eyes to them, and you will no longer remember Egypt. LXX: Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will stir up your lovers against you, from whom your soul has turned away, and I will bring them against you from every side— the sons of Babylon and all the Chaldeans, φακοὺθ and συὲ and κοὺθ, and all the sons of Assyria with them, the young men, the chosen ones, the governors, and the officials, all of them riding on horses. They shall come against you with weapons, chariots, and wheels, and with a host of people; they shall set themselves against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments. And I will put judgment before their face, and they shall judge thee by their judgments. And I will set my zeal against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thy ears; and thy remains shall be cast forth by the sword; they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by fire. And they shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall take away the instruments of thy glory. And I will take away thy wickedness out of thee: and thou shalt no more bring to mind the land of Egypt. And thou shalt not lift up thy eyes to them: neither shalt thou remember Egypt any more. Because you remembered the meat of the Egyptians, and imitated the filthiness of the unclean nation, which worships the images of all beasts: therefore I will bring against you your lovers, with whom you have been satiated, and I will make you turn from the love that you had into great hatred. The sons, I say, of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, the nobles and princes; for whom in the Hebrew language it is written, Phacud () and Sue () and Cue (), which the multitudes of the East understand when such names are mentioned, but we cannot find them in the book of Kings, or in the Chronicles, or even in Jeremiah, who describes the captivity of Jerusalem, or in any place of Holy Scripture. No wonder, if the Septuagint itself used Hebrew names, since Symmachus and Theodotion also agree on the same words. They all, he says, the Assyrians, the cavalry, and the youths, in distinguished form, the leaders and officials, or the mourners, whom we have interpreted as the princes of princes. Concerning whom we also read in Exodus (Exod. XV, 4). Chosen lifters-up of the mourners (τριστάτας), for whom Latin simplicity has translated three supporters. But the name is Tristatae among the Greeks, the second rank after the royal dignity. Of whom it is written: Yet he did not reach the top three, who were the leaders of cavalry and infantry and tribunes (Or tribunes) (I Par. XII, II Reg. XXIII): whom we call magistrates of both military branches, and prefects of the grain supply. All, he says, in chariots and on horses, armed with armor, helmet, and shield, surrounded you in a circle, and I will give them judgement, so that you will be judged by those whom you have left, and by the ones whose pact you have nullified: and they will judge you with their own judgements as an adulteress. And I will set my zeal upon you, which they exercise against you in fury. For my zeal is among the enemies, even among those who have not kept faith. They will cut off your nose and your ears, like adulteresses caught in adultery, so that you will cease to please in your disfigurement. For just as all the beauty of the face depends on the adornment of the nose, and in the ears, on which women wear their earrings and pearls, so the dignity of the king and the judges, which is demonstrated in their words and in their hearing, will be cut off by their sword. They will take your sons and daughters. 'Yours,' he said, 'not mine,' because they were conceived in adultery, and they will be devoured by fire, and they will uncover you, and your adornments, with which I had adorned you, and the vessels of your glory, which I had granted to you, golden and silver, for the ceremonies of the temple, of which it is written: 'I gave them gold and silver, and they made them for Baal' (Hosea 2:8). But I will do all these things, so that with your lost beauty and your poisoned face, your wickedness may finally rest, and the fornication that you learned and practiced in Egypt: so that after you have lost your nose and ears, you will not dare to lift your eyes to the Chaldeans, and show your ugliness to your former lovers; nor will you remember any longer the lust of the Egyptians, whose abundance of flesh delighted you. Whatsoever is spoken in a figure τροπικῶς concerning Jerusalem, and may be referred to the soul, which, being joined to the embraces of God, afterward committed adultery with vices, and departed from Him, and having openly displayed all her wickedness, was stripped and defiled and shown to all, that she might desist somewhat from her wickedness; nor may she glory in the dignity of her name, but, on account of her evil conscience and the remembrance of Egypt, may she not dare to lift up her eyes to heaven. And so his nose is cut off, and his ears are amputated, because he had turned the scent of good fragrance into stench, and he had heard the judgment of blood, which we understand not only by scent and hearing, but also by sight, through which Samson and Zedekiah are deprived because they had abused it. God also made them deaf and mute (Exod. IV, 11): so that their language does not penetrate to the earth, and every sense is taken away from those who have completely lost their life. And these things will be done, so that all things may be cleansed by fire, and the fornication of Egypt may perish: and it will no longer be able to lift its eyes to evil.

<h2 id='tocuniq241'>(Vers. 28 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 28 and following) For thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate, into the hands of those from whom your soul is satisfied. And they will deal with you in hatred, and they will take away all your labors, and they will leave you naked and full of shame, and the shame of your fornications will be revealed. Your wickedness and your fornications have brought this upon you, because you have played the harlot with the nations among whom you have defiled yourself with their idols. You walked in the way of your sister, and I will give her cup into your hand. Thus says the Lord God: You shall drink the deep and wide cup of your sister. You shall be a derision and a scorn, which is full to the brim. You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of mourning and grief, the cup of your sister Samaria. And you shall drink it and drain it to the dregs, and you shall devour its fragments, and you shall tear your breasts (or as the Septuagint has translated: I will take away her feasts and her new moons); because I have spoken, says the Lord (Vulgate adds God). Therefore, thus says the Lord God. Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, you also bear your wickedness and your harlotry. It is profitable for Jerusalem to have enmity against the Assyrians and the Chaldeans and not to remember Egypt; but rather to be delivered into their hands for punishment, those who hated her: to whom she was not delivered before, unless her soul was satisfied with them, so that after she repented of her old sins, she would be cleansed by punishments, and would destroy all the labor she acquired by her harlotry; and she would see her nakedness and shame, and would know that the Lord did not do all these things to her, but rather her own harlotry, by which she played the harlot with the nations mentioned above, in order to worship their idols. On the roads, he says, you walked of your sister Samaria: therefore you must drink the cup of her, whose sins you have followed. However, there are many examples of the cup, which is often taken for punishments and torments, among which is this: The cup in the hand of the Lord is full of mixed wine, and he pours from this into that: nevertheless its dregs are not emptied out, all the sinners of the earth drink from it (Psalm LXXIV, 9, 10). And in Isaiah it is called the cup of ruin and the goblet of fury (Isaiah LI, 17). And God spoke to Jeremiah: Take the cup of wine from my hand and make all the nations, to which I will send you, drink it. They will drink, vomit, and go mad. Just as certain purgatives are given to remove harmful humors from the body, so the Lord gives the cup of most bitter torments to take away all bitterness and restore sinners to their former health. And the cup itself will be deep and wide. Deep, in the magnitude of punishments: wide in the time of captivity. But when, he says, you have become drunk and seized by sorrow, and you will drink the cup until the dregs, and you will have consumed it to the point of devouring even the fragments of the cup itself: then you will be disgusted by your former fornication, and you will tear apart the breasts that were broken in Egypt, and that were subjugated and bruised by your lovers: whether I take away all your festivities, and new moons, so that instead of celebration and joy, you shall have eternal lamentation and mourning. Therefore, because you have done these things and have forgotten about me, and have cast me behind your body, whether backwards on account of the corruptions of the body or after the genitals, by which the filthiness of immorality is indicated: therefore the gate of your wickedness and impiety, namely the punishments which you have deserved on account of impiety and wickedness, can be expressed significantly. This that is said can be understood significantly about Jerusalem, which drank the cup of her sister Samaria's last, and as it were has drunk the dregs of her torments down to the bottom.


<h2 id='tocuniq242'>(Vers. 36, 37 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 36, 37 and following) And the Lord said to me, saying: Son of man, do you judge Oolla and Oolibah, and announce their crimes (or iniquities) to them: for they are adulterous ((Vulgate: adulterated)), and there is blood on their hands, and they have committed fornication with their idols (or inventions): moreover, they offered to me the sons they had borne to be devoured (or led away) by fire. But they also did this to me, they defiled my sanctuary on that day, and profaned my Sabbaths. And when they sacrificed their sons to their idols and entered my sanctuary on that day, defiling it, they also did these things in the midst of my house. They sent for men coming from afar, to whom they had sent messengers. So behold, they have come, whom you bathed (or, when they arrived, you immediately bathed): and you painted your eyes and adorned yourself with women's attire. You sat on a beautiful bed, and a table was set before you. You have placed my incense and my perfume on her, and there was a voice of a multitude rejoicing in her (or the voice of a composed multitude resounded); And indeed, crowds of people were brought in among the men, and they came from the desert (or drunken from the desert): they put bracelets on their hands, and most beautiful crowns on their heads. And I said about her who was worn out with adultery: Now she will also commit fornication in her own fornication. And they entered into it as one goes to a harlot; so they entered into Oollam and Oolibah, the wicked women. Therefore, righteous men (the Vulgate will insert this) will judge them with the judgment of adulterers and the judgment of those who shed blood, for they are adulterers, and blood is on their hands. For thus says the Lord God: Bring a multitude against them and deliver them to tumult and plunder, and they shall be stoned with the stones of the people, and pierced with their swords. They shall kill their sons and daughters, and burn their houses with fire, and I will remove wickedness (or impiety) from the land, and all women shall learn not to do according to their wickedness (or impiety). And they will bring your wickedness (or impiety) upon you, and you will bear the sins of your idols, and you will know that I am the Lord God. As I have often mentioned, I have connected the slight discrepancies between the Hebrew and the Septuagint edition, taking care not to bore the reader. Consequently, the one who described the adulteries of Samaria and Jerusalem separately would also announce their punishments together. 271 However, everything is said as if to adulteresses, and the crimes are briefly presented, so that stoning by the people may be rightly carried out against them, according to the command of the Law. Therefore, since they are adulteresses, bring forth a just sentence. For they are committing adultery in idols, and blood is on their hands, namely the blood of those whom they offered to idols, so that the children whom they had borne to me would be consecrated to demons. They did not do this outside and in the mountains and groves, as they often used to do, but in the end they defiled my temple, so that they would set up a statue of Baal in it. And they profaned my Sabbaths, so that neither the place, nor the time, nor the religion would be observed among them. But they were not satisfied with present adulteries alone, nor was it enough for them that they sacrificed my sons to their idols or demons; but they also indulged in foreign pleasures, venerating the images of the Assyrians and Chaldeans. When they came, Oholibah, you filled every adulterous attire and adorned yourself with makeup, so that you might wash your body, line your eyes with antimony: so that you might assume the attire of a woman, sit on a bed prepared for lust, and offer feasts to replenish the strength of your lovers who were broken by desire; my incense and the ointment which I had ordered to be made for me, and the soul that desired to do this for private use, you offered to idols; to gather a crowd of people and sing all kinds of music: so that you might please your lovers not only by sight, but also by hearing and smell, and all the senses, who came to you drunk: not preferring any urban elegance, but the attire of the desert and solitude, resembling that of peasants and robbers. And you, wicked sisters, have fallen into such great madness of pleasures, that you put your bracelets and necklaces on the hands and heads of your lovers, whether it be for yourselves, so that you may defile yourselves in full adornment. Therefore, I said to her, whether it be to Jerusalem or to Samaria, or to both: You have burned your forehead in such a way that you are not at all polluted in secret, but you avoid the gaze of your husbands and men; instead, you openly prostitute yourselves like public harlots, eagerly desiring to be defiled by those who enter to you, as if to harlots. So I will hand you over to be punished by those to whom you have willingly surrendered yourselves for defilement. For they are just men, who, at my command, torment adulteresses and murderers. For thus says the Lord God: By the request of your voice, O prophet, gather a multitude of peoples against them, and let all their possessions be plundered; then let them be stoned and pierced with swords, and let their sons and daughters be killed, and let their houses be burned. And all these things will be done so that wickedness may be removed from the earth; and all women and all the distant provinces may learn to avoid punishments similar to theirs: so that after you have received what you deserve, and have carried the crimes of your idols, then you may know that I am the Lord. But all these things were said tropologically and under the guise of adulterers against Samaria and Jerusalem, because they were delivered to the Assyrians and Chaldeans, and led into captivity, and their cities were consumed by fire: the people who worshiped the idols of demons instead of God were destroyed. These things can also be understood after the coming of Christ, in that the just men from the nations themselves judge the Samaritans and the Jews by comparison with themselves and deliver them to be devoured, to whom the Lord had said (Matt. XXIII, 38): Your house will be abandoned to you. And: When you see Jerusalem surrounded by an army, know that its desolation is near (Luke XXI, 22). For even to this day they are adulterated and oppressed by the stones of the whole world. Since they sent messengers to those who were far away, and could not say: I am a God who is drawing near, not a God from afar, says the Lord (Jeremiah 23:23). And they prepared themselves for their lovers, the demons, and turned all the worship and adornment that they had received from God as a natural good into the worship of demons. And they offered it to their adulterous lovers, whose punishment is a source of fear for the nations, yes, even for those who believed from the nations, lest they suffer similar things if they do what Samaria and Jerusalem did. From whom then their impieties will be taken away when they have received their crimes, and have taken away the veil that was placed before the face of Moses (Exod. XXXIV), from their eyes, so that they may know that He is the Lord Jesus Christ, whom they denied to be the Son of God (II Cor. III).

<h2 id='tocuniq243'>(Cap. XXIV. Vers. 1 seq.)</h2>

(Chapter 24, Verse 1ff). And the word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, saying: Son of man, write down the name of this day, on which the king of Babylon has besieged Jerusalem this day. And you shall speak a parable against the rebellious house, and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: Set a pot, set it on, and pour water into it. Gather its pieces into it, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder; fill it with choice bones. Take the choicest of the flock, pile up the bones under it; boil its contents well, and let its bones be cooked in its midst. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Woe to the city of blood, the pot whose rust is in it, and its rust has not gone out of it: part by part, throw it out and its pieces; the lot has not fallen upon it. For its blood is in the midst of it; upon a very clear rock it poured it out; it did not pour it out upon the earth, that it might be covered with dust. In order to bring My indignation to bear and take vengeance: I have given its blood upon a very clear rock, so that it would not be covered. Because of this, says the Lord God: Woe to the city of blood, on which I will make a great fire. Heap up the bones to be burned with fire; the flesh will be consumed, and the whole composition will be cooked, and the bones will decay. Also, place it on empty coals, so that its bronze may become hot and melt, and the filth of it may be consumed in its midst, and its rust may be destroyed. Much effort has been exerted; and its excessive rust has not gone out from it, nor has it been cleansed by fire. Your abominable impurity, because I wanted to cleanse you, and you were not cleansed from your filth; but you will not be cleansed until I make my indignation cease in you. I am the Lord, I have spoken: it will come to pass, and I will not pass by, nor pity, nor be appeased. According to your ways and your deeds I have judged you, says the Lord. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, saying: Son of man, write for yourself the day on which the king of Babylon has hardened himself against Jerusalem from this day onward, and speak to the rebellious house a parable, and say to them: Thus says the Lord God: 274 Put the pot on and pour water into it, and put in it the pieces, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder, separated from the bones of the chosen sheep, and burn the bones underneath it: it boiled, and its bones are cooked in the midst of it. Therefore thus says the Lord God: O city of blood, a pot in which rust is, and the rust has not come out of it, it has brought it out in its parts; the lot has not fallen upon it, because its blood is in the midst of it. I have set it upon the smooth rock: I have not poured it upon the ground, that it might be covered with dust. That fury may ascend for vengeance: I have given its blood upon the clear rock, that it might not be covered. Therefore thus says the Lord God: Woe to the city of blood, in which I will increase the terror, and multiply the wood, and kindle the fire, so that flesh may rot, and the juice may be reduced, and bones may be congealed, and stand upon its coals. It is kindled so that it may be burned and cooled, and its brass may be congealed in its midst, and its impurity may solidify, and its rust may fail. Rust will be humbled, and much of its rust will not come out of it: its rust will be confounded. Your impurity, Zemma, be brought low, because you have been defiled, and you have not been cleansed from your impurity. And what will happen if you are not cleansed anymore, until I have fulfilled my fury on you? I, the Lord, have spoken, and it will come to pass; I will not delay, nor will I have pity, nor will I relent. According to your ways and your deeds I will judge you, says the Lord God. Therefore I will judge you according to your blood and according to your wicked thoughts; you are impure and infamous, and you have multiplied your abominations to provoke me. (Many of these phrases have been added from Theodotion, and the Hebrew word Zemma (), which we have interpreted as abominable impurity.) And it has been added by them, which is not found in Hebrew, and it must be marked with an obelus: Therefore I will judge you according to your blood, and I will judge you according to your thoughts, unclean and infamous, and excessive for provocation. So let us speak about each one. In the ninth year of the captivity of King Joachim (for he began to prophesy in the fifth year), and in the tenth month of the same ninth year, on the tenth day of the tenth month, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Ezekiel, in the region of Babylon, and He said to him: Son of man, write down this very day for yourself, and know that today the king of Babylon has begun to besiege Jerusalem in the region of Judah, and to surround it with an army; and describe this siege as a parable and proverb, which in this present place signifies metaphor and translation. He said, 'Place a bronze pot, that is, a lebes, and pour water into it, and cut the bodies of the fattest animals into pieces, both the thigh and leg and arm, and carefully separate the flesh from the bones, and after the flesh has been put into the lebes, place or arrange the bones under the lebes, and make a heap, and piles of bones, so that the cooking of the lebes may boil not once, but frequently, and the meat may be cooked thoroughly internally, and the bones may be burned beneath.' But you want to know, prophet, who this potter's vessel is, or what kind of flesh or bones? Speak these things, says the Lord God: Woe to the city of blood, that is Jerusalem, to the potter's vessel, whose rust, that is extreme wickedness, and even though fire has been set to it, its rust has not gone out of it. For they have persisted even though captured and tortured in their former wickedness. Consume it in parts and one by one, let no one remain for salvation. The fate did not fall upon her so that some would perish and others would be saved, but a common destruction came to all. For her blood, that is, murders and the deaths of her sons, are in her midst. She spilled this blood over the clearest rock, so that it would be open to all and not be covered by earth or dust: so that my anger would not pass, but my revenge would hasten over the most obvious blood. For it is the nature that if blood is poured on the ground, the earth absorbs the moisture of the blood, or gradually the earth is covered and covered with dust. But when blood is shed upon a most clear and unyielding rock devoid of any pit, it flows and occupies a wide seat. But this indicates that he has not committed hidden but public homicides, according to that which is said to Cain: The blood of your brother cries out to me (Gen. IV, 10): therefore say to the city, not of one blood, but of many bloods: Behold, I will make a great pyre or tower in you, which the common people call a bonfire, and I will kindle not only soft and tender flesh in you, but also the hardest bones, so that nothing remains in you that is not consumed by the fire. And when both the flesh and bones have been consumed and burned, place the empty cauldron on the embers, so that its bronze may also become hot and be consumed, and when the bronze is consumed, let its rust also perish, that is, let it be consumed by the fire that burned the city, and let malice perish with the city. But what profit is there in having done what was ordered? Not even by fire could the rust and malice of the cauldron, and of the city, be removed; but it remains in that unholy and accursed defilement: for this is what the leprosy signifies. And he makes an apostrophe to the very city itself, that is, to the city itself. I wanted to cleanse you, but you have not been cleansed of your filth, nor will you be able to be cleansed until I fulfill my indignation against you. I, the Lord, have spoken, and my sentence cannot be disregarded. The siege of the city has now come, and I will do as I have threatened: I will not pass over your crimes, as I have often done in the past. And I will no longer spare you, nor will I be appeased by your prayers, even if you multiply them. Instead, I will repay you for your ways and your inventions. Indeed, I will judge you according to your works and your thoughts, so that even in this I may demonstrate my mercy, like a doctor who does not spare rotten flesh in order to save healthy limbs: he does not spare in order to spare; he is cruel in order to show pity; he does not consider the pain of the patient, but rather the health of the wound, according to the saying in the Gospel: he would rather let one member perish than the whole body be destroyed (Matthew 5). Also note how from the beginning of the prophecy until the present day, when Jerusalem began to be besieged, the order of the captivity comes. First the sword is provoked; then two ways are set, let Ammonite Jerusalem, on the right side of which the lot falls to Nebuchadnezzar; silver is melted in the city, brass, tin, lead and iron; the land is also not watered, but occupied by thorns: afterwards, under the name of the two sisters Oolla and Oolibah, the sins of Samaria and Jerusalem are narrated, how the former was captured, and the latter will be captured. At the end of the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, when Ezekiel and those with him were in captivity and had surrendered to King Jehoiachin, it is shown on what day the city began to be besieged, and a representation of a cooking pot is set up; just as meat and bones piled up in the pot are burned by fire, so the whole city with its inhabitants will perish, and none of those who are besieged will remain, but they will be consumed by famine, sword, and plague, and the remaining part will be taken captive to Babylon. Can this same prophecy pertain also to the time of the Lord's passion, for which Jerusalem was surrounded by an army and its children were killed, and with Titus, the son of Vespasian, besieging it, no one escaped for salvation, and the temple was destroyed; and after fifty years, under Hadrian, the city was consumed by eternal fire. But when Ezekiel saw this present captivity in Babylon, and Jeremiah puts it at the beginning of his book: What do you see, Jeremiah? And he answering, said, A boiling pot and the face thereof from the face of the north. (Jeremiah 1:13) Some, according to tropology, transfer the whole passage to the end of the world (the age), and they interpret the number nine, which in the holy Scriptures represents punishments and sorrows, and always follows justice, as the mercy of the tenth month and the tenth day. Therefore, punishments are inflicted on the sick, so that health may follow pain. Therefore, the world that is situated in evil (1 John 5:19) is set ablaze by the divine fire of judgment; and the city of blood is placed upon the coals of fire, so that what is written in Isaiah may be fulfilled: You have coals of fire, sit upon them: they shall be a help to you (Isaiah 47:14). And this is the difficult thing, that even though coals and bones are consumed, with which the Pharisees are also full, to whom the Lord speaks in the Gospel: Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, who are like whitewashed sepulchers: which are within full of filth, and of dead men's bones (Matthew 23:27), it is now said that the rust and filth of the world are not consumed, but that malice remains even after the severity of judgment. What is easily solved, if we understand the saying of the Apostle: God has concluded all under sin, that he may have mercy on all (Galatians 3:22). For the creature is subject to vanity (Romans 8:28). And the blood that was shed is set before the face of the whole creation, that the sins of all may be made manifest. But we can receive the most pure rock, and the Lord Savior, who followed the people of Israel in the wilderness, of whom it is written: They drank of that spiritual rock that followed them: and that rock was Christ (1 Corinthians 10:4): so that all things may be revealed in Him; and that which is written may be fulfilled: There is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed. And he said that the Lord does not show mercy, nor overlook the sins of the world; nor spare the wicked, nor be appeased, so that the ways of the wicked may perish, according to what is placed at the end of the first psalm: And the way of the wicked will perish.

(Verse 15 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, behold, I am taking away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke, and you shall not mourn or weep, nor shall your tears flow. Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the dead. Let your turban be on your head, and your sandals on your feet; do not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of mourners. So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. And I did in the morning as I was commanded. And the people said to me: Why do you not tell us what these things mean, that you are doing? And I said to them: The word of the Lord came to me saying: Speak to the house of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, and the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul fears, and your sons and daughters whom you have left behind shall fall by the sword. And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of mourners. You will wear crowns on your heads and sandals on your feet. You will not mourn or weep, but will waste away because of your sins; you will groan among yourselves. Ezekiel will be a sign to you; you will do just as he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Lord God. And you, son of man, on the day I take away their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes, their sons and daughters, On that day, when the fugitive comes to you to bring you news, on that day, I say, your mouth will be opened with the one who is fleeing, and you shall speak and be silent no more. You will be a sign to them, and they shall know that I am the Lord. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, behold, I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke (or in preparation); you shall not mourn or weep, and tears shall not come to you. Groaning in your heart, but not lamentation for the loss of your loved ones. Your hair will be bound upon you, and your shoes on your feet; you will not mourn or weep, but you will pine away in your iniquities and groan to one another. Thus I have spoken to the people in the morning, as I was commanded; and in the evening my wife died. So I did in the morning as I was commanded. Then the people said to me, 'Will you not tell us what these things signify for us, that you are acting this way?' Then I said to them, 'Thus says the Lord God: "I will profane My sanctuaries, man's arrogant pride, the desire of your eyes, and the longing of your souls."' Your sons and daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword, and you will do as I have done. Their mouths will not be comforted, and you will not eat the bread of men. Your hair will be on your heads, and your shoes on your feet. You will not weep or mourn, and you will be consumed by your iniquities, and each one will comfort his brother, and Jezechiel will be a sign to you. You will do according to all that he has done. And when these things come, you will know that I am Adonai the Lord. And you, son of man, on the day when I take away their strength, the pride of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and the arrogance of their soul, their sons and daughters, on that day the one who has been saved will come to you to announce it in your ears. On that day your mouth will be opened to speak to the one who has escaped, and you shall no longer be silent, and you shall be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the Lord. Above the cooking pot and the burning oils, she had shown the siege of the city, now she shows it captured and destroyed, and the entire population either killed by the sword or taken into captivity, the prophetic discourse attests. And first, according to our custom, let us lay the foundations of the history. Son, he said, behold, I will take away from your sight whatever is desirable to you, and I will take it to a place, or as the LXX has translated, in preparation: so that you may prepare yourself not to do those things which are accustomed to be done in mourning. Do not lament, nor will you weep, nor will flowing tears reveal the pain of the heart: but if perhaps you are overwhelmed by excessive sadness, keep silent groans, and do not burst forth in words. You will not mourn the dead, or, in the words of the Septuagint, the groaning of blood, but it is the lamentation of the kidneys. Through this, it shows that his wife is about to die. For immediately it follows: And my wife died in the evening (Prov. XIX); which specifically pertains to the connection of the kidneys. For there is nothing more pleasing to a man than a good and beloved wife, who is provided by God for man, and is united to him by the law of the Lord, and together with her, becomes one body. And what follows: 'Let your crown be bound around you, and let your shoes be on your feet,' signifies this: You will have hair that is cut in mourning, and shoes on your feet, which mourners usually cast off. Hence, David, fleeing from Absalom, his son, and repenting for the death of Uriah, walked with bare feet (1 Samuel 12:15, 18)." } The Hebrews say that the Babylonian masters, who observe the precepts of the Law, write the Ten Commandments on small scrolls and wrap them around their heads, and these are to be displayed before their eyes and on their foreheads, so that they always see the precepts. And because Ezekiel was a priest, he should not remove the crown of glory from his head, but have it bound. This is what they have said. However, according to the LXX, we understand the crown of hair to be the hair: although their interpretation does not accurately express the meaning of the Hebrew language. He said, 'You will neither cover your face with a veil nor eat the foods of mourners, which are done in mourning, to cover the face, and the Greeks call them 'περίδειπνα', let them be received by the consolers. I spoke, he said, to the people in the morning, what the Lord had commanded me, and in the evening my beloved wife died, the desire of my eyes, and the sorrow of my loins and blood. And immediately on the next day in the morning I did everything that was commanded to me: and the people asked me why I acted against the custom of everyone.' And to those who were seeking the causes of such great patience, I replied: The word of the Lord that was spoken to me, so that I may speak to the people of Israel, commanded me thus: Behold, I, that is, will now defile my sanctuary, so that the temple may be set on fire and open to all foreigners and profane, and in it you had pride, that is, confidence and hope and desire for your salvation, and for the sake of which your souls were trembling in fear; and I will also consume with the sword the sons and daughters whom famine and pestilence have made for you. Whatever I have done, you will also do. When custom is observed in mourning, the pain is moderate; but when such a great necessity of evils weighs down, so that the mourning of each person is greater than any other, and each person is anxious about their own necessity, they do not moan over the miseries of even those who are closest to them. 'You will not do anything that is usual to do in mourning,' he says, 'but with the city and temple set on fire, you will be astonished at the magnitude of the evils. You will not be thunderstruck, nor will you walk with bare feet, nor will you weep, nor will you veil your faces with a garment, nor will you take food from those who would console you. But you will waste away and be consumed by your iniquities, and you will hardly have the freedom to groan, lest you offend the pride of the conquerors if you are seen publicly weeping; so that the prophet Ezekiel may be a portent to you, and that you do not do all the things that he did not do upon the death of his wife, in the destruction of the city and temple.' And even more clearly: \"Oh,\" he said, \"son of man, in the time when I take from them their strength, the temple, as we have said, their confidence and the joy of their dignity, and in which they had only hope, and the desire in which their souls found rest, and also their sons and daughters, as is understood from earlier, when I take them away. In that time, when someone comes to you fleeing from Jerusalem, or one who has escaped, saying the city has been destroyed, then you, who were previously silent and had no freedom to groan, and showed such great patience that you did not shed a tear even in the death of your wife and the pain in your loins, you will open your mouth and speak, not to him who comes, but with him: so that whatever you had previously foretold, he will now report as fulfilled, and you will no longer be silent; but you will accuse them and say that everything has happened to them justly, so that you may be a sign to them, according to what is written in Zechariah: 'Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me' (Zech. III, 8). And the Lord speaks elsewhere: 'I have become like a mirror-image in the hands of the prophets.' (Hosea 12:10) Let these things be said according to the historical account. Let us come to the anagogy (if it has not seemed too violent to the cautious reader's prudence). That the Son of Man is called the Lord Savior, there is no doubt, who in the last hour, that is, at the evening of this world, lost his former wife, did not weep for her, did not cover his face with mourning clothes, did not receive any human consolation, and predicted these things that were to come in the morning, which were fulfilled in the evening, and again in the morning, he proved in his second coming the things he had predicted would come, that the sanctuary of the Jews, and what they had desired in their eyes, and over which their souls trembled, have become defiled: and that their sons and daughters were killed by the Roman sword. But when it is said, 'You will have a crown on your heads, and sandals on your feet,' we refer that to the fact that they should by no means grieve, nor assume signs of mourning, once they have received the truth in shadow, and have become Nazarenes, and each one will console his brother, so that Ezekiel, whom God the Father strengthened, may be a sign to them, foretelling the future, and after Jerusalem has been overthrown and the temple burned, and the whole world has heard of this, and the dispersion of Israel, which inhabits the borders of the earth, then the words of the Lord will be fulfilled by their actions, they will have freedom, and with His sanctuary defiled, the Law completed or destroyed according to the letter, the glory of the Gospel will be revealed, and Israel will recognize that He Himself is the Lord and God, who predicted these things that will come in the morning, and in the evening, and in the consummation of the world, and confirmed them by His coming.

Book Eight

What benefit does our dictation have on the prophets, it is the judgment of God, and the conscience of those who, by setting aside declamations and applause and the composition of words, desire to know what their speech either tells of the past, or accuses of the present, or predicts of the future. In the meantime, it benefits us: for while we do this, and think of nothing else, we approach the explanations in a way that resembles theft, and we compensate for the miseries of days with the study of nights: the mind is nourished and forgets the calamities of the world, which in the extreme end already laid down groans and gives birth (II Thess. II), until he who restrains is taken out of the midst, and the feet of the once iron statue are crushed by the frailty of clay fingers. The world falls, and the upright neck does not bend. Wealth perishes, and greed does not cease in any way. They hurry to gather what can be occupied again by others. Tears have dried up, all piety has been taken away. Many beg, few give. We are not ashamed, preferring poverty to a cheap cloak, to lie in the lap of wealth like Croesus; and to guard famine and the destruction of many in our own treasuries, following after that rich man clothed in purple, whom Scripture testifies has done nothing else, for neither his robberies nor his injustices. His cruelty and pride knew no bounds: he did not even order to be given to Lazarus, who was lying at his door in front of him, not even the things that are thrown to the dogs. How many now lie like Lazarus, and how many are clothed in garments of various colors of purple, not even converting them to their own uses, but preserving what will perish! This, Eustochium, a virgin of Christ, spoke from the abundance of her heart, and we shall say a little more freely than is fitting for our humility. Moreover, the eighth book in the book of Ezekiel, which contains the reproach of the sons of Ammon and other nations, and the prophecy of future events, will have this beginning.


<h2 id='tocuniq246'>(Cap. XXV.)</h2>

(Chapter 25) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face against the sons of Ammon, and prophesy against them. Say to the sons of Ammon: Hear the word of the Lord God. Thus says the Lord God: Because you said, 'Aha!' over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was desolate, and over the house of Judah when they went into exile, therefore behold, I am giving you to the people of the east for a possession, and they shall set their encampments in you and make their dwellings in you. They shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk. I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the city of Ammon a place for flocks. Then you will know that I am the Lord. Because this is what the Lord God says: Because you clapped your hands and stomped your feet and rejoiced with all your heart and mocked the land of Israel, therefore I will stretch out my hand against you and deliver you to the plunder of the nations, and I will cut you off from the peoples and remove you from the lands. And you will know that I am the Lord. When Jerusalem was captured or besieged and those who could escape came to Babylon and reported that the city was about to be taken or that the temple had been destroyed, as was customary for all the prophets against the other surrounding nations who had mocked the ruins of Jerusalem and the burning of the temple, the prophetic message turns first against the sons of Ammon, who had a metropolis called Rabbath, which today is called Philadelphia by the king of Egypt, Ptolemy by the name of Philadelphus, who ruled Arabia with Judaea. Son, says he, of man, set your face against the sons of Ammon, who are descended from Lot, and say to them: Thus says the Lord God (these are not the words of prophets, but of the Lord. Concerning the hardening of the face, we have discussed this more fully in the same prophet): Because you have said: Aha, Aha, or you have insulted and rejoiced, because my temple and sanctuary have been defiled by the invasion of enemies, and over the land of Israel, because it is desolate, and especially over the house of Judah, that is, the two tribes that are now led into captivity: therefore I will also deliver you to the sons of Edom, whom we have interpreted as the Easterners. There is no doubt, O Midianites, that they border the entire wilderness of the land of Arabia, who have herds of camels, and multitudes of sheep and goats, and live by these resources. This is also narrated in the book of Judges (Judg. 6) as happening to the land of Israel, when the Midianites came and devoured all their regions as far as Gaza. Therefore, metaphorically speaking, by the Midianites, we understand the Ishmaelites and the Hagarenes, who are now called Saracens, taking for themselves the false name of Sarah, so that they may appear to have been born of a free and noble mistress. And it is said in reference to King Nebuchadnezzar and all his army, that he will come and take the city of Rabbath, which is either properly called by this name or because of its greatness. For Rabbath is said to be very great. And lest we doubt that Nebuchadnezzar overthrew Arabia after Jerusalem was captured, the Scripture testifies above: 'And you, son of man, set yourself two ways, Ammon and Jerusalem, and the sword of the king of Babylon will come.' And again: 'At the head of the road to the city he will cast it, and he will set the road so that the sword will come to Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah in most fortified Jerusalem.' (Ezekiel, XXI, 19, 20). And again: Thus saith the Lord God to the children of Ammon, and to their reproach (vers. 28). So the sons of Cedem shall come and set up their tents, like shepherds, and they shall pitch their tents. They shall destroy your crops, and drink the milk and abundance of the land, bringing flocks of camels and people from all nations, so that the children of Ammon shall become a dwelling place for livestock, and by the necessity of evil they shall understand that the Lord himself is the one who predicted the future and ordered it to happen. But this was not enough for the sons of Ammon, that they insulted and said: 'Hooray, hooray over the temple and sanctuary of the Lord, which was polluted by the entrance of various nations'; but such was the lasciviousness of their insults, that the whole people clapped their hands and feet together, and with all the affection of their hearts cried out: because the land of Israel was desolate. Therefore, not by angels, nor by other ministries, but by the Lord himself, extending his hand to strike, he will deliver it to be plundered, not by camels and flocks of sheep, but more openly to the nations, so that it may be completely uprooted from the number of peoples, and perish, and be reduced to nothingness; and after it has been crushed, then it will understand that he himself is the Lord who judges all things, and has power over all the lands. We can understand, according to typology, the sons of Ammon, who were born from Lot in the cave, descendants of incest and drunkenness, as all heretics of whom Scripture and Apostle John say: 'They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would have continued with us' (1 John 2:19). These individuals were born from a deviant inclination, which is translated into our language as: 'Because they have all turned aside, together they have become useless; there is none who does good, not even one' (Psalm 14:3). Against these, the prophetic face is placed or strengthened, so that it may crush them with its severity, and it says to them: 'Because you insulted my Church during the time of persecution, because my sanctuary was polluted by the fault of various people, whether it be the fault of those who served me, or the cruelty of the enemies who persecuted me: even the land of Israel, which saw and understood God, is now desolate, devoid of the choir of virtues; and how the sons of the house of Judah, that is, those who confess God and have true faith and right confession, were led into captivity and ceased to serve the Lord': therefore, O everyone who insults, you will be handed over to the Eastern sons who have come from the true light and you will be handed over as an inheritance, so that you too may learn to confess the Lord. And by translation it is said that the sons of the East will place their tents over them, and pitch their tents, and drink milk, and eat fruits, and the city of former pride will become a dwelling place for camels, who, having laid aside the burden of sins, can enter through the eye of a needle (Matthew 19), and into the bed of the animals, which are led by a good shepherd (John 10), so that when they have done this, mixed and handed over to the shepherds of the East, they may understand that He himself is the Lord. And again he reproaches them, for why they insulted with excessive affection of heart the ruins of the people of God, and they considered the land of Israel completely deserted: for which they deserve the avenging hand of God, as those who had exceeded the measure of rejoicing and joy over the destruction of the house of Judah, should by no means be handed over to the sons of the East, but should be for the plundering of all nations, and should be killed from the peoples, and should perish, and should be crushed, and should by no means be considered from the offspring of Abraham, but should be believed to be so for all nations, and then they will know the magnitude of their evils, and their own destruction, and the killing of the people, that he himself is the Lord. What we understand in general about the Church can be understood about each individual saint, whom the people of the world and the enemy powers rejoice in their ruin, if they have lost their modesty over a long period of time: while the evil think of it as a consolation for their crimes if they have more partners in their crimes and punishment: and no one does this except the son of Ammon, that is, the son of the people, who is born in their decline.


<h2 id='tocuniq247'>(Vers. 8 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 8 and following) Thus says the Lord God: Because Moab and Seir said, 'Behold, like all the nations is the house of Judah,' therefore, behold, I will lay open the shoulder of Moab from the cities, namely, its 288 cities, and the glory of the land, Beth Jesimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim. And I will give it along with the sons of the East, as a possession, so that the sons of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations anymore. And I will execute judgments upon Moab, and they shall know that I am the Lord. LXX: This is what the Lord God says: Because Moab and Seir said, + 'Look, like all the nations, the house of Judah.' Therefore, behold, I will break the shoulder of Moab from its cities, the chosen land, the house of Beth Jasimoth, over the fountain of the sea city. I have given the sons of the East as an inheritance to the sons of Ammon, so that the name of the sons of Ammon will not be remembered among the nations. And I will execute judgments on Moab, and they shall know that I am the Lord. What we have interpreted and added from the edition of Theodotion is not found in the LXX. But in this place the Hebrews tell a fable. After the city was opened and the temple was unlocked, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Seir entered the temple and saw the Cherubim protecting the mercy seat. And they said: Just as all nations worship idols, so Judah also has its own religious idols; and therefore, they say, the Lord is angry and has delivered them into captivity. But we say this, that they insulted the house of Judah when it was captured by the Chaldeans, thinking that, like in other nations, there was no help of God there. And therefore, the kingdom of Judah, and Jerusalem, deprived of the protection of God, fell under the power of Babylon. Therefore, not long afterwards, but at present, the Lord threatens that he will destroy, or rather open, the shoulder, namely the strength and power of Moab from its cities, so that even the victorious Babylonians may enter and the cities in Moab may cease to exist, and the famous cities within its borders and boundaries may be destroyed: among which are mentioned the names Beth Jesimoth, Beelmeon, and Kiriathaim: for which the Seventy have translated something unknown, the house of Beth Iasimuth, which this word signifies a deserted town: and Beelmeon, until today, is a very large village, which they translated as 'over 289 fountain', and Kiriathaim, a maritime city: and it is reported that it along with the sons of Ammon from the East, namely the Babylonians, according to the interpretation we have given against the sons of Ammon. And I will give, says the Lord, Moab as an inheritance, so that just as there is no longer any memory of the children of Ammon among the nations, so also I will do vengeance and judgments on Moab, so that they may know that I am the Lord, who delivered Judah because of sin, and I will be the avenger on the children of Ammon and on Moab. However, to this day Moab, which is interpreted as 'from the father,' and Seir, which is translated as 'hairy' and 'rough,' despises and looks down upon the house of Judah, in which the true confession is, and thinks that it can be easily destroyed as the defenses of other cities are destroyed. And the Lord threatens to open himself up, or to break down all the strength of the Moabites, so that the cities may cease to exist, and they may not at all trust in the art of dialectic. But all those boundaries, which they call promontories for the purpose of illusion of the waves, shall be destroyed; and the famous and chosen land of Beth Jesimoth, which translates to 'house of solitude and desert,' and Beelmeon, which also means having a spring, or above a spring, and Cariathaim, which the LXX translated as a maritime city, shall perish. Although they may have the strength of warriors, and they continue to excel in the art of fighting, and they walk surrounded and fortified on all sides, yet their famous land is not a home of habitation, but a home of solitude. And what they think they possess as a source of knowledge, and a maritime city, which can withstand all the storms of the world, promising themselves patience and fortitude: yet they will be turned there, to be handed over to the children of the East, the true light in Christ; just as the sons of Ammon were handed over, who trusted in themselves in the multitude of heresy. And let us consider the progress, and in the very threat the mercy of God, so that the sons of Ammon, the sons of the East, are delivered as an inheritance; and let no heresy be named among the Gentiles; but by their acts, let them know that the Lord, who manages all things, will bring them to an end with his judgments and punishments for their arrogance. But to prove that in this place Moab is understood as the pride of philosophers, concerning whom it is said: I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart (1 Corinthians 1:19), a few examples from the prophets must be repeated. Amos speaks: Thus says the Lord: Concerning the three transgressions of Moab, and concerning the four I will not revoke the punishment, because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime  (Amos 2:1). Truly, whatever is of perverse doctrine in the world, whatever pertains to earthly knowledge, and is considered to be strong, is subverted by the art of dialectic, and is dissolved like fire into ashes and embers; so that what was thought to be the strongest may be proven to be nothing. But Isaiah reproves the pride of Moab, saying: We have heard the pride of Moab, he is exceedingly proud: his pride is taken away. (Isaiah 16). Jeremiah also, prophesying against all the nations, speaks specifically to Moab: Because you trusted in your fortresses. (Jeremiah 48:7). And a little later: You will have confidence in your glory. And again: How do you say, We are mighty? And then: The day of Moab is approaching, and its malice is very swift. (Ibid. 14:10). And more clearly: Say how the glorious staff is broken, the rod of magnificence (Ibid., 20)? And again: The horn of Moab is broken. But these things are said, so that under the name of Moab, the foolishness of the world, exalting itself to heaven, may be crushed by pride.

<h2 id='tocuniq248'>(Vers. 12, 13, seqq.)</h2>

(Verses 12, 13, and following) Thus says the Lord God: Because Edom has acted vengefully and has taken revenge on the people of Judah, thus they have incurred guilt by their acts of disobedience, and have sought vengeance against them. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: I will stretch out my hand against Edom and cut off from it both man and beast. I will make it a desolation from the south, and those who are in Dedan shall fall by the sword. I will execute my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel. I will deal with Edom according to my anger and my wrath, and they shall know my indignation, declares the Lord God. LXX: Thus says the Lord God: Because Edom acted revengefully against the house of Judah and incurred grievous guilt by taking vengeance upon them, therefore thus says the Lord God, I will stretch out my hand against Edom, and cut off from it humans and animals, and make it desolate; from Teman to Dedan they shall fall by the sword. I will execute my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall act in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, says the Lord God. Above, they have proposed two things: because they said Moab and Seir, and later about Seir, remaining silent, he only spoke against Moab: now he returns to the problem that Seir, that is, Edom, has made. Whoever has knowledge of the Scriptures should have no doubt that Esau and Seir, and Edom, and Idumea, and Duma, are all one people. And not to mention the other prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, who prophesied against Idumea, Duma, and Edom: Obadiah directs his whole prophecy against this nation, which we have discussed before as much as we could. Seir, who was hairy, received the name 'hairy' and Edom the bloody, who lost his birthright because of the cooking of a red lentil, received his name from his hunger. Esau's actions are also interpreted. And it should be known that in Hebrew it is never written Idumaea, but always Edom, which the Greek translation expressed as Idumaea. Therefore, it is by no means Idumaea (Edom), as Moab spoke, but he took vengeance on the children of Judah: and he sinned, or held the memory of ancient pain, in order to take vengeance on them, from whom he was supplanted in the womb. Therefore, not through angels, nor through any other: but the Lord himself, stretching out his hand over Edom, took away from it man and beast, and reduced its cities into a desert, that is, Themam, which we turn into the south: from which and from another city Dedan, they will be slain with the sword. And when they have taken vengeance on Judah, I will give vengeance upon the Edomites by the hand of my people Israel: that they may do justice upon them, in whom they have exercised vengeance. Those who act in Edom, or Idumea, according to my anger and fury, to fulfill my indignation, and through the hands of my people Israel, let my wrath rage against the enemy nation, and they will understand that my just vengeance was against the unjust revenge of Idumea, says the Lord Adonai. According to allegory, this is the meaning that seems to me. Idumea is called earthly and carnal, which rises against the spirit, so that we do not do things that are of the spirit, and it hastens to draw the soul placed in its midst to itself; and it seeks to render vengeance, to which it had previously been subjected by the sons of Judah, and it remembers the ancient pain, that it did not have its own power, and therefore it sought vengeance against those who, departing from the flesh, followed the spirit. Therefore the Lord himself, being the avenger of the children of Judah, stretched forth his hand upon Edom, and took away the man and the beast out of it, so that it became a desolation. And from Theman, which signifies failing, and from Dedan, which also signifies kindred, he destroyed them all by the sword, whom he had appointed in the hand of his people Israel, that they might subvert Edom, and that Edom might know his wrath and anger, and understand his revenge, so that it may serve the house of Judah. This is that which the Apostle disputes about, writing: Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated (Rom. IX, 13). But Jacob is loved, because he supplants and overcomes the carnal and earthly, and deserves to receive his blessings. First we live according to the flesh, and afterwards according to the spirit. Before vices, and then virtues, by which vices are destroyed, because the heart of man is inclined towards wickedness from childhood, and the mature age condemns the errors of youth (Genes. VIII). And David also said: Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my ignorance (Psalm 24:7). And yet it should be known that Jacob received the first blessing, Esau the second. And what is said about him at the end: You will be your brother's servant (Genesis 27:40), this signifies that after the flesh is subjected to the spirit and joined to it, it ceases to be flesh and transitions from Edom to Judah.

(v. 15, 16) Thus says the Lord God: Because the Philistines acted in vengeance and took revenge with wholehearted malice, destroying in their anger and perpetuating ancient hostilities. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines and cut off the killers, and I will destroy the remaining inhabitants of the coast. I will execute great acts of vengeance upon them with furious rebukes, and they shall know that I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon them. LXX: Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because the foreigners have executed vengeance and provoked insult from the heart in order to destroy forever, therefore thus says the Lord God: Indeed, I will stretch out my hand against the foreigners and I will destroy them, I will even slay the Philistines and I will exterminate the remnant of the coastal region, and I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious wrath, and they will know that I am the Lord God when I execute my vengeance upon them. After the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Seir, who themselves are Edomites, associate with the people of Israel through Lot and Esau, and with the house of Judah through kinship, they came to the Philistines, whom the Seventy translated as 'foreigners,' that is, aliens, not under the general name of all the nations that are not of the Jewish race, but under the specific name of their own nation, which is now called Palestine, with the letter 'P' changed to 'Pi' (π), according to the Greek custom, just as among us the Hebrew word 'Phase' is celebrated in Greek and Latin as 'Pascha.' The Philistines are interpreted as those who fall by a cup, who themselves were also intoxicated by the golden cup of Babylon, and rage, and insult with all their hearts, remembering the ancient hostilities against Israel, by which they were separated from the people of God. And when the Lord says: Vengeance is mine, and I will repay (Deut. XXXII, 35), they take revenge by killing and fulfilling ancient hatred. Therefore, they will experience the outstretched hand of the Lord upon them, which will kill the killers. For concerning the Seventy, I do not know what they wanted, the Cretans had interpreted, when both Aquila and Symmachus, and Theodotion himself had translated the Hebrew word Chorethim as either murderers or murder, not only in the present place, but also in Zephaniah, where these things are said against the Palestinians: Gaza shall be plundered, and Ascalon unto desolation, and Ashdod and Ekron shall be rooted out. Woe to the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the people of the Cretans! The word of the Lord is upon you, O Canaan, the land of the foreigners, and I will destroy you from your dwellings, and Crete shall be for the pasture of shepherds, and the fold of sheep (Zephaniah 2:4-9). And here, indeed, when the Seventy translated it into Greek, the other translators rendered 'ὄλεθρον' ((Al. κάῤῥον)) as 'interfection' or 'perdition'. Concerning this, in the aforementioned prophet, by God's favor, we have said what seemed right to us. Therefore, even the two legions of David, one of which was called Phelethi and the other Cerethi (2 Samuel 15), earned the name of Cherethim ((Al. Cherethim)), meaning 'slayers', from their last act of killing and slaying 294 people. And the Lord will destroy all the remnants of the maritime region, which is pounded by salty [or false] waves, and He will exact not small, but great vengeance in His fury, so that His fury may have an end of mercy, and after He has taken revenge, reproving with fury, then the Philistines will know that He Himself is the Lord.

<h2 id='tocuniq250'>(Cap. XXVI.)</h2>

(Chapter 26) And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, because Tyre (or Sor) has said of Jerusalem: Aha, the gates of the peoples (or nations) are broken, she has turned to me, I will be replenished, she is made desolate (or she who was full is now desolate); therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, Tyre (or Sor), and I will bring many nations against you, as the sea raises its waves. And they shall break down the walls of Tyre, and destroy its towers, and I will scrape away its dust from it, and I will make it a shining rock. The drying up of the nets will be in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken, says the Lord God, and it will be for the plundering of the nations. Also, her daughters who are in the field will be killed by the sword, and they will know that I am the Lord. Then the order of the prophecies will be fulfilled. He spoke against the sons of Ammon and Moab and Seir, who themselves are Edomites, and against the Philistines who are on the coast and hold the same boundary by the sea. After the Philistines, the region of Phoenicia follows, whose metropolis is the city of Tyre, which is called Tyre in Hebrew and Syriac. And because Jerusalem was captured, it also rejoiced and taunted, saying: 'The gates of the peoples are broken, I have the safest harbor, and when it is overthrown, all the multitude turned to me, which was governed at its pleasure, and because it is deserted, therefore I will be filled, and whatever was full before will be reduced to solitude.' Therefore, since you have said these things and have insulted the ruins of Jerusalem, which was destroyed by the judgment of God because of its sins, I will not send messengers or anyone else, but I myself will be against you, Tyre, and I will make the Babylonians rise up like the waves of the sea against you, along with many nations. They will destroy your walls and towers in such a way that they will fall to the ground and their dust will be scraped away or scattered in various directions. And so, it will be humbled, like the most shining stone, and there will be such a desolation in the once bustling city, that fishing nets will be spread out and dried in its midst. For I, the Lord, have spoken, and my words cannot be in vain, and I will deliver it into the hands of the nations for plunder. Also, her daughters, who are in the field or in the countryside, that is, on the coast of Phoenicia, cities and towns, villages and castles, will be slain by the sword. Metaphorically, because he called them daughters, he puts the killing by the sword, so that they may know at the end of things that I am the Lord, who commanded these things to happen. According to the allegory, because 'Sor' in Hebrew means 'anguish,' every soul that is occupied with disturbances can be called 'Sor,' which, when it sees Jerusalem overturned by God's judgment for its own faults and sins, in which there was the temple and the vision of peace, rejoices and thinks that the empire of the once famous city is to be transferred to itself. And this is accepted in opposing doctrines and in the people of the world, when they see a holy person fall through negligence and rejoice and exult, as if their fall were their own resurrection. Therefore the Lord threatens that He Himself will fight against such people and will cause many nations to rise up against them like the waves of the sea, which will destroy whatever seems most fortified and firm in them, and thus overthrow all their arguments, reducing them to dust. He should also make the nets and fishing gear with which they previously deceived the multitude cease, and spread them out and dry them in the deserted soil of the city, so that other fishermen may take their place, whom the Lord has sent to fish. And let his daughters, who were previously kept as if in a chamber and were not easily believed in mystical and more secret teachings, be brought forth and prolonged in public, and be cut down by the sword of the Church, so that they may understand that He himself is the Lord, who both temporarily left Jerusalem for sins, and destroyed the fortifications of Tyre for its insolence and joy.


<h2 id='tocuniq251'>296 (Vers. 6 seq.)</h2>

296 (Verse 6 onwards) For thus says the Lord: Behold, I will bring against Tyre (or against you, O Tyre) Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the north, the king of kings, with horses and chariots, and with horsemen and a great army. He will kill your daughters who are in the field with the sword, and he will build siege works against you, and raise up a siege mound against you, and raise up a shield against you. He will make weapons of war against your walls, and destroy your towers with his armor. The inundation of his horses will cover you with their dust, your walls will be shaken by the sound of the horses, chariots, and wheels, when he enters your gates as if entering a destroyed city (or as if entering a city from the countryside). With the hooves of his horses, he will trample all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your noble statues will fall to the ground (or your sources of strength will be brought down to the ground). They will plunder (or ravage) your wealth and destroy (or demolish) your merchandise, and tear down (or destroy) your walls, and overthrow (or turn over) your splendid (or desirable) houses, and they will place (or throw) your stones and wood and dust in the middle of the waters (or in the middle of the sea). And I will make the multitude of your singers (or destroy the multitude of your musicians), and the sound of your harps (or the voice of your organs) will not be heard anymore. And I will make you into the most transparent (or most shining) rock. You will be the drying up of the snares, and you will no longer be built upon, for I have spoken, says the Lord God. I have joined together both editions in the usual manner, and in those things in which they differ, I have brought them together on the side, providing for the brevity of volumes. Therefore, what he had said, I will make many nations ascend to you as the fluctuating sea ascends, and Tyre will be a spoil for the nations, then he explains more clearly that the Lord will bring King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon from the North, the king of kings, with horses and chariots, and with an infinite multitude of troops, who will first overthrow the cities and fortresses subject to Tyre on the shoreline, and afterwards make Tyre be besieged, and he will assault it with an army and siege ramps, and fortifications, and vines and rams and destroy the walls, and his cavalry will be so numerous that the foundations of the city will be moved by the dust of the cavalry, the noise of the howling army, and the sound of the wheels and the neighing of the horses, and thus he will enter the city with the walls scattered, as if entering from the field without fear, and there will be such security for the victorious army that the hooves of the horses will trample the streets of Tyre, and all the people in the middle of the city will fall, and the once noble statues, or all the wealth, will fall to the ground, and none of the former riches will be preserved in the conquered city, but even the noble houses will be destroyed along with the walls, and there will be such cruelty of the victors that the remaining wood and stones that were burned will be thrown into the middle of the sea, and either Nebuchadnezzar or the Lord himself will cause all the joy of the city, which was once resounding in songs and psalms, to cease, and it will be reduced to the drying up of the snares. And what follows: 'You shall not be built up any more,' seems to raise the question of how Tyre, which we see today as the most famous and beautiful city of the Phoenicians, was not built up. From this, some suppose that in the latter days Tyre will suffer these things, which will not be rebuilt afterwards. But how can they preserve the persona of Nebuchadnezzar, especially since we read in the following passages that Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre and did not receive the reward of his labor, and for this reason Egypt was handed over to him, because he served God's purpose in the siege of Tyre? The Greeks and Phoenicians, and especially Nicolaus Damascenus, and others of the Barbarians, who contradict this history, are said to have read the histories and to have found nothing about the siege of the city of Tyre by the Chaldeans, when we can prove that many things are said in the Scriptures which are not found in the Greek books; nor should we submit to their authority, whose treachery and lies we detest. Therefore, the statement, 'you shall be built no more,' can be understood to mean that she will no longer be the queen of peoples, nor will she have her own empire, as she had under Hiram and the other kings; but rather that she will be subject to the Chaldeans, or the Macedonians, or the Ptolemies, and finally to the Roman kings. But there is no doubt that by anagoge we understand King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who came from the North, as the devil, who, although he is a very harsh and evil wind, is called by the name "right" because he presumes for himself the dignity of a name, and is the king of kings and of all kingdoms, which he shows to the Lord, and he said to him: All these things have been given to me, which I will give you if you fall down and worship me (Matt. 4:9). This one has horses and chariots, of which it is written: A deceitful horse for salvation (Ps. 32:17). And: All who ascended horses slept (Ps. LXXV). And in another place: He threw horse and rider into the sea (Exod. XV, 1). This one kills the daughters of Tyre, souls confined in distress and in a certain prison of sin, in the field and widest plain, and surrounds Tyre with its fortifications, so as to keep it closed and no one can escape the authority of the Babylonian king. He will destroy walls and overthrow towers, and whatever he had by way of teachings, he will shake with the flood of his horses and the sound of the horses' hooves and the noise of the chariots, and he will enter its gates, with no one to prohibit, and the streets of the city: For the way is broad and spacious that leads to death (Matth. VII, 13), his horses' hooves will trample it, and all his possessions or noble statues, for which they had made false images for themselves, of which it is written: O Lord, in your city you will dissipate their images (Ps. LXXII, 20), he will cast down to the ground, and with the walls destroyed, the noble houses will also be overthrown, which he had prepared for himself, and in which he rejoiced, and it will come to such great desolation that its stones and the wood with which he built the walls, and the cement he used, will be thrown into the abyss, and his songs and music, in which he placed his trust in the wisdom of this world, and the sound of all the harps will no longer be heard, and his fishing will cease, and he will be brought low, like the drying up of reeds, and will be built no more, for according to the judgement of the Lord, it has been completely overthrown, as the Apostle also says: Whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme (I Tim. I, 20). The places are difficult, and a wise and diligent reader must forgive my effort. Or if he can find something better, I will defer to his judgment, as long as he knows the forgiveness he will grant me, he will receive it from others.

<h2 id='tocuniq252'>(Vers. 15 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 and following) Thus says the Lord God to Tyre: Will not the sound of your destruction, and the groaning of those slain in your midst, shake the islands? And all the princes of the sea will descend from their thrones, and they will take off their garments and cast away their beautiful clothes, and they will be clothed with astonishment. They will sit on the ground, and be astonished at your sudden downfall. They will take up a lamentation over you, and say to you: How you have perished, you prominent city, you strong city, which was feared by all its inhabitants! Now the ships will be astonished on the day of your terror, and the islands in the sea will be disturbed, because no one will come out from you. LXX: For thus says the Lord God Sor. Will they not groan at the sound of your ruin, when your wounded ones groan, when the sword is drawn out in your midst, the islands will be moved, and all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, and they will take off their crowns, and they will be stripped of their various garments? They will rage with fury: they will sit on the ground, and they will fear for their destruction, and they will groan over you, and they will take up a lamentation for you, and they will say to you: How you have perished and been destroyed in the sea, O praised city, that was strong in the sea itself, and its inhabitants, who gave their fear to all its inhabitants? And the islands will tremble on the day of your ruin, and the islands in the sea will be disturbed at your departure. First, let us explain the meaning of these words briefly by providing a brief translation. Thus says the Lord God to Tyre, which is called Sor in Hebrew (): Will the islands not be shaken on the day of your ruin, when Nebuchadnezzar attacks, and when you fall in the midst of the groans of the wounded or killed, will the islands not be disturbed? And all the kings will descend from their seats, or thrones, and the princes of the sea who rule over various islands, and they will take off the diadems from their heads, laying aside all the glory of reigning and the most precious garments, shining with incredible variety. They will cast them away and, overwhelmed by the magnitude of their astonishment, they will turn to madness, and, humbled, they will sit on the ground. And when they see you have fallen, they will fear something similar for themselves. And they will think that nothing in the goods of the earth is perpetual, but instead they will take up a lamentation and sing a mournful song, saying: How have you perished, you who dwelled (Alternative: you who dwelt) in the sea, renowned or praised city?" } For we read in Greek, Latin, and Barbarian histories that Tyre was indeed an island and had no entrance from the land. But later, it was either thrown up by king Nebuchadnezzar of the Chaldeans or, as some affirm, by Alexander the Great, king of the Macedonians, with mounds being thrown up and a place being prepared for the assault with engines of war and towers. Thus, the island became a peninsula. Therefore, oh Tyre, oh Sor, who once were the strongest of all islands, praised by the voice of all people, both in cities and with your inhabitants, whom all feared, how did you suddenly fall? Now the islands will be astonished or terrified over you, and as it is better understood in Hebrew, ships, on the day of your terror and ruin, and the islands in the sea will be troubled. Therefore, it is more fitting to read 'ships' instead of 'islands' so that they are not placed in a favorable position; because no one will go out from you, or as the Septuagint translated, on the day of your departure: when you are led captive. These, for now, have been laid as certain foundations of history: now we will strive to place the spiritual pinnacle. Imagine someone who, having preserved their chastity for a long time and excelled in many virtues, later collapsed into a serious and mortal sin. Will not all the islands be moved by the sound of his ruin and the death of his virtues? Especially those who are battered by the salty and bitter waves of this world. And the princes who seemed to be rulers in the filth of this age will descend from their thrones, humbled by their pride. They will remove the crowns from their heads, which seemed to possess good works, and cast off the various garments of virtue. They will be clothed in amazement, a kind of madness born from fear. They will sit on the ground, stunned by his sudden fall, and admire him in astonishment. So much so that everyone will assume mourning and lamentation for him who has fallen, saying: How did you perish, who were once saved? How you have fallen, who stood for so long, who among all the illustrious in the sea of this world were considered strong, who were thought to be strong by everyone! And your inhabitants, these are the most valiant thoughts, resisting all the fiery darts of the devil, which were previously feared by all adversaries, have been turned to astonishment. But even the ships, all of them holy, which cross the waves of this world, will be amazed when they see you have fallen. On the day of your panic and ruin, the islands will be thrown into confusion, lest they suffer the same. For the ruins of others are examples of the righteous, while we all dwell in a weak and feeble state, and never is our victory certain and secure: when those who stood before will depart from you; or in your departure; in the end and consummation of your time. For we are judged not by the past, but by the present. And caution must be observed, and always feared, lest it undermine old glory and solid steadfastness, the storms of a single hour.

<h2 id='tocuniq253'>(Vers. 19 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 19 onwards) For thus saith the Lord (the Vulgate adds God): When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited, and shall bring upon thee the deep, and many waters shall cover thee; and I shall bring thee down with those that descend into the pit (or to them that descend into the pit), to the people of old, and shall place thee in the lowest parts of the earth (or in the depths of the earth), like the ancient wilderness, with those that are brought down into the pit (or descend into the pit), that thou mayest not be inhabited, and (the Vulgate adds moreover) when I shall give glory in the land of the living (or that thou mayest not rise again in the land of the living), I shall bring thee to nothing (or give thee destruction), and thou shalt not be, and thou shalt not be sought for (the Vulgate adds anymore) forever, saith the Lord God. When I deliver you, O Tyre, a city devastated forever, just like there are other cities that are not inhabited at all, and when I bring upon you the abyss and many waters cover you, or countless hordes of enemies, or certainly the one who speaks of the island and compares the frequency of adversaries to the waves of the abyss surging against the city on the island in a metaphorical sense; and when I drag you down with those who descend into the pit or the abyss, to those who are in the underworld, of whom we read in the Psalms: They will go down to the depths of the earth; they will be given into the hands of the sword, their portion will be as prey for foxes (Ps. 62:10-11); to the eternal people, where there is weeping of the eyes and gnashing of teeth, and when I place you in the last land, where the ancient dragon is established, and it is like the ancient deserts and wastelands, where there is no memory of good things, but rather eternal punishments, and I will not allow you to rise again in the land of the living, as it is written: Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth (Matthew 5:4) . And in another place: I shall please the Lord in the land of the living (Ps. CXIV, 9): then you shall be reduced to nothing, or perish forever, and you will be no more, according to what is written in another psalm: Grant me respite before I depart, and I shall be no more (Ps. XXXVIII, 14). Not that one who is in eternal punishment ceases to exist, but that one who does not live for God, is said in the Holy Scriptures not to subsist. And Esther also speaking against idols: Do not give your scepter, she says, to those who are not (Esther XIV). Surely there were those to whom she pleaded not to give it; but they were not of God, who had ceased to have virtues and to be alive in God. And it should be noted that Tyre is sought by him who comes to seek and save what was lost, and ninety-nine sheep were left on the mountains, he seeks one lost sheep (Luke XIX). Also, a woman who had lost one drachma seeks, finds it, and calls her neighbors to share in the joy (Ibid., 15). But if Tyrus is not found, it is not the fault of the seeker, but of the one who has fled the hand of the good shepherd. And moreover, he says, you will not be forever; whether it is written in Hebrew as 'Lolam', or in Greek as 'αἰῶν', it signifies one age, according to the saying of Isaiah, who after seventy years says that Tyre will be restored to its former state (Isaiah 23). However, they say that one age, that is, the time span of a human life, is calculated by the number of seventy years, as the Psalmist says: The days of our years are seventy years." } But in the rulers, eighty years, whatever is above, is labor and pain (Ps. LXXXIX, 10). This we have briefly said in a metaphrastic way about Tyre. Which can also be referred to those who are placed in the narrowness of this world, are led to the underworld, and are covered by the abyss and the waves of punishments, and are drawn to the depths of the earth, and are united with those who are in the old solitude, and are led into the lake, or into the eternal pit, so that they are no longer inhabited by the Holy Spirit. Of which it is written: When the wicked falls into the depth of evils, he despises (Prov. XVIII, 3). They will no longer exist on the land of the living, but they will perish and be reduced to nothing, and they will cease to be with God. They misuse these testimonies, who say that the punishments of the wicked and not of the sinners are eternal: those who sought from God, were not found, and have ceased to exist forever: for they have lost him by their own vice, who says: I am the life (John XIV, 6).


<h2 id='tocuniq254'>(Cap. XXVII.)</h2>

(Chapter 27) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Therefore, son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyre, and say to Tyre, who dwells at the entrance of the sea, conducting trade with many peoples (or from many islands). Thus says the Lord God: If I were to summarize the entire prophecy against Tyre, or concerning the lamentation for Tyre, in one discourse, it would be lengthy and difficult for the reader to understand; for one cannot retain everything at once in the mind, especially regarding the discrepancies between the Hebrew and Septuagint versions in this passage, namely, what they have added or subtracted. So we will be content with our interpretation, and wherever there is disagreement, we will connect it from the side, leaving the perfect knowledge of God to all: and we will briefly remind what seems to us in each. He who is mourned, is still cared for by the one who mourns. Hence Samuel wept and mourned for Saul (2 Samuel 15). And the apostle Paul laments and grieves for those who have fornicated and have not repented (2 Corinthians 12). And Jeremiah wrote Lamentations on the destruction of Jerusalem in four alphabets. He dwells, therefore, in Tyre, or Sor, in the entranceways, following the order of the alphabet: either because it was formerly an island, or because it receives ships coming from the deep into a very safe harbor, and it is a place of trade for many peoples, or from many islands. Indeed, this continues even today, so that the commerce of almost all nations is carried out there. But following the interpretation that has been started, whatever is said about Tyre, let us refer it to 'narrowness,' that is, the narrowness of this world, which is situated in the wicked one, and is confined and beaten by various disturbances, like waves. Of such merchants is told in mystical language in the psalm: 'They that go down to the sea in ships, doing business in the great waters. These have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.' (Psalm 106:23-24).

<h2 id='tocuniq255'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) O Tyre, you have said, 'I am the perfection of beauty' (or you have said, 'I have surrounded myself with beauty') and situated in the heart of the sea. The first crime of Tyre is to think that if it possesses anything good, it is not from God but from itself, and to consider all the beauty that comes to it from various regions as a result of its own diligence and virtue. For it has said: 'I am the perfection of beauty' or 'I have surrounded myself with beauty', even though it is situated in the heart, that is, in the middle of the sea, and like an island it moves, and it is tossed by waves, and it is shattered by the crashing of the waves." } But as for the heart of the sea, it signifies the middle, and that prophetic speech demonstrates: Therefore we shall not fear when the earth is troubled, and the mountains are carried into the heart of the sea. Their waters have roared and been troubled (Psalm 45:2-3). But our Lord is said to have descended into the heart of the earth, that is, into the middle and the underworld. However, true and perfect beauty is found in no man, except in the body of Christ, which is interpreted as the Church, and is gathered by the virtues of many saints. And he himself speaks to the bride: You are all beautiful, my love, and there is no blemish in you (Song of Solomon 4:7).

<h2 id='tocuniq256'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

(Verse 4, 5) Your neighbors who built you have adorned you. They built you with cedars from Mount Hermon and with all the boards of the sea. They took cedar from Lebanon to make mischief for you. As for what they desired, I do not know, but the Septuagint translates it as: Your sons of Baalim surrounded you with adornment; cedar from Mount Hermon was built for you; they took fine cypress boards from Lebanon to make evil for you with fir. For the speech of Baal is not found in this place among the Hebrews, but it is written 'Gebulaic', which means 'your borders'. Moreover, your sons have been deceived by the ambiguity of the word and the similarity of the writing, as the same letters are read as both 'builders' and 'sons', 'Bonaich' and 'Benaich', due to their different pronunciation. Therefore, O Tyre, who have boasted in pride, I am the perfect beauty, or I have surrounded myself with beauty, listen to how much God's generosity has been bestowed upon you, even though you are situated in the middle of the sea. Your neighbors and bordering people, who are not from distant regions but from nearby, have filled your decoration, and you think what is yours is actually someone else's? And he speaks metaphorically, comparing the city to a ship, signifying its beauty and abundance of all things. After he describes the entire furniture of the ship - mast, sails, oars, rudder, keel, ropes, coverings, hides, and other things that the use of a well-equipped ship requires - he announces that a storm and a south wind, which will stir up very high waves, will come and cause it to suffer shipwreck. Through these things, the destruction of the Tyrian city is signified by King Nebuchadnezzar, or, as many think, by Alexander, the king of the Macedonians, who is said to have besieged and captured the city herself for six months after he defeated Darius in Lycia. According to mystical interpretation, the planks of the Tyrian ship are cut from the fir or cedar trees of Senir, with which it is woven and joined together, and the mast of it is made of cedar or cypress from Lebanon: the fir trees because of their lightness and the softness of the joints of the planks, which fit together gently and bite into each other; or cedar, because it is an incorruptible wood. But Sanir is said to mean 'the way of the lamp', or as we think more accurately, 'the tooth of the watchmen', because all the prosperity and enlightenment of a ship comes from true light. Sanir, however, is the mountain itself, which is also called Hermon, or what others call Sanior. Read the history. Lebanon means whiteness or bleaching, which itself contributes to beauty coming from elsewhere.

<h2 id='tocuniq257'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) The oaks of Bashan have flexed against your oars: they made your benches out of Indian ivory, and the cabins out of the islands of Italy. LXX: They made your oars and your temples out of Bashan, and they made wild homes for you out of ivory from the islands of the Hittites. What beauty the ship has, and its furnishings, to have oars made of cedar, not just any, but from Bashan, and ivory benches, and cabins, or cellars, in which the most precious merchandise is stored, from the islands of the Hittites, which we turn towards Italy: from that region which is closer to Greece, understanding all the western parts of the islands. Let us say, therefore, according to the anagoge, that the oars of the Tyrian ship are made from Bazan, of which it is also written in the Psalms: 'The Lord has said, I will turn Bazan from the depth of the sea' (Ps. LXVII, 23). Bazan, in our language, means ignominy. Therefore, God turns those who were in the depth of the sea, and the ignominy of sins, into oars, so that, sailing with the Apostles, they may be able to reach the land and the shores; and the oars are made of ivory, when they have mortified their bodies; or they may turn the use of their teeth to the praise of God, and the little cribs or cellars of the isles of “Chettiim,” which, according to the etymology of the Hebrew language, is translated as smitten, so that it may not only be killed by the blows of the devil, but also approved. We can speak of the houses made of ivory, and the wild homes of the Chettiim islands, which the heretics attempt to build not in the house of God, but on a Tyrian ship. And they, having their own language and tongues, building temples of God contrary to the temple, and wild homes, dwellings of beasts, when the Scripture says that groves, woods, and forests are not to be planted in the house of God (Deut. XII).

(Verse 7.) Various byssus woven in Egypt is made into a veil for you, to be placed in a vessel: hyacinth and purple from the islands of Elisa have become your covering. LXX: Byssus with variety from Egypt is made into a bed for you, to surround you with glory, and to cover you with hyacinth and purple, made from the islands of Elissa are your coverings. Because Tyre had said, I am perfect in beauty, or I have surrounded myself with beauty, it is pointed out what it has received from each region, according to the Scripture: What do you have that you did not receive? But if you have received, why do you boast as if you have not received (1 Cor. 4:7)? Therefore, it is described what each province should send, according to that of Virgil (Georg., 1st book):

India sends ivory, soft incense from the Sabaeans; the Chalybes send hard iron, and Pontus its men skilled in Castor's art, and so on. Fine linen grows in abundance in Egypt, from which the sail of Tyrian ships is woven, which is hung from the mast, and its covering, which provides shade to sailors and passengers in the heat and calm of the sun, is made from hyacinth and purple dye; these come from the Elisa islands, which are called the islands of the Ionian Sea. Moreover, next to the seventy byssus are woven into a layer, and into the rest of the Tyrian ship's coverings, so that it may be more glorious covered with them, and have a more beautiful appearance surrounded by a garment. However, byssus is said to come from the earth, because it originates from the earth, and hyacinth from the air, purple from the sea from which it is made, with the addition of double-dyed scarlet, with which the vestments of the Pontiff are woven, we have often reminded that they symbolize the four elements: earth, fire, air, and water, from which all things consist, which Tyre assumes for herself, not using them with grace for God's creatures, but saying: I am the perfect beauty: or, I have surrounded myself with beauty.

(Verse 8, 9.) The inhabitants of Sidon and Arad were your oarsmen. Your wise men, Tyre, became your helmsmen. The elders of Biblus and its wise men provided sailors for the various goods of your inventory. All the ships of the sea, and their sailors, were among the people of your commerce. LXX: Your princes dwelt in Sidon, and the oarsmen were from Arvad. Your wise men, O Tyre, were your helmsmen. The elders of the Bible, and its wise men, were in you; they fortified your counsel, and all the ships of the sea, and their rowers became yours to the farthest west. It had been said before: Your neighbors who built you up, completed your adornment: before those who lived far away come to you, it describes the help of neighboring provinces. Your inhabitants, it says, or the leaders of Sidon and Arad, which is a nearby island, your rowers. Your wise men, O Tyre, have become your navigators. For the governance properly belongs to the wise, as the Scripture says: 'Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety' (Prov. XI, sec. LXX). The elders or seniors of the Bible, and its wise men, provided sailors for your service, or strengthened the council of Tyre, and supplied various goods: and all the ships of the sea, and their sailors were in the people of Tyrian trade, or in the farthest west. In the literal sense, for the time being. However, according to the mystical interpretations, because they are understood as hunters of Sidonius and Aradius, we will say that Tyre, the glorious and most proud city, which, with the wind blowing, will be greatly hunted, has citizens or princes as hunters, about whom it is written: Our soul has been snatched away like a sparrow from the snare of the hunters. For where we read 'hunters,' it is written in Hebrew, 'of the Sidonians.' These come upon unwary souls, established in lofty places, in order to lead them down to earthly things, and they become rowers, to guide them to shipwrecks. But the wise men of Tyre, who are taken in an evil sense, by whom they are wiser than the children of light, they themselves govern Tyre prepared for shipwreck. The elders of the Bible and its prudent ones provided sailors to Tyre for service, or they strengthened its counsel. The sacred history narrates that there were many seniors rejected by the Lord, and the juniors chosen as a representation of the Synagogue and the Church. Senior Cain is added, and junior Abel is chosen (Gen. IV): Ishmael, the son of Abraham, is estranged from his father, and junior Isaac inherits (Gen. XXI). Of the sons of Isaac, senior Esau is a hunter and roams in the fields, while junior Jacob simply dwells at home (Gen. XXV). And it is written in Malachi: 'Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated' (Mal. 1:2). And rightly according to the Apostle (Rom. 9:13), they had done nothing good or evil in the womb of their mother, neither had they merit or offense, so that one might be chosen and the other rejected, except in the case of a symbol, as we have said, of the Synagogue and the Church, the elder is repelled and the younger is taken. 'All the ships of the sea and sailors of Tyre were in the people of Tyre's business, or in the West of the West.' How is the Song of Songs, and the age of ages, and the work of works said; in such a way that the greater song is preferred over other songs, and the longer age over other ages, and the more useful work over other works: thus the West of the West is called, to signify the magnitude of the Western parts. And the ships of the sea, and their sailors, and the rowers who are in the help of the Tyrian ship, do not go towards the East, or towards the rising of the light, where the sun of justice is born, but towards the West of the West, where the light sets, and where the beginning of darkness is.

(Verse 10) Persians and Lydians (or Lydia) and Libyans were in your army, your warrior men: they hung up their shield and helmet for your adornment (or shields, and helmets they hung up for your glory). The Persians were the strongest, whose king Cyrus, as prophesied by Isaiah (Isa. XLV), overthrew Astyages, the king of the Medes, and captured Babylon, as both sacred and secular history narrate. And at that time they were considered the strongest among the nations, of whom King Croesus was captured by the same Cyrus, as Xenophon writes in great detail. And we read in the book of Chronicles (2 Chronicles 12) that the Libyans came with the Troglodytes and Ethiopians against Jerusalem, who were very prosperous in those times, famous as warriors in battle, and are remembered as defenders of the city of Tyre, who hung shields and helmets on the ramparts to frighten the enemies. But spiritual intelligence means that the Persians, who are called 'tentatives' or 'tentative ones'; and the Lydians, whom we understand to be born; and the Libyans, who are referred to as 'Phuth' in Hebrew and are translated as 'from the mouth' (not from the bone); attempt in vain to defend Tyre, being overcome by temptation, and serve their generation and lust, and they only multiply empty words, not having the helmet of salvation nor the shield of faith (Ephesians 6); but they only pretend glory and noise of words to adorn that.

(Verse 11) The sons of Aradius, together with your army (or their own), were on your walls all around. And the Pygmies who were in your towers hung their quivers (or yours) on your walls in a circle, they enhanced your beauty. LXX: The sons of the Aradians, and your strength on your walls, were guardians all around in your towers. They hung their quivers on your battlements in a circle. They have accomplished your splendor. The Word of Gamadim (), the first edition of Aquila, the Pygmies: Symmachus, the Medes: The Septuagint, the guardians: Theodotius Gamadim, the Hebrew itself, have been interpreted. We still see the island of Aradus which is entirely a city, and the opposite town of Antaradus, and it is near Tyre, and it extends along the shore of Phoenicia for 310 miles of the mainland, and to this day: these are the guards of the city of Tyre and the custodians of its towers, and they hang their quivers around their waist and complete its beauty, so that they may be known as archers, whether they are pygmies, that is, warriors, and very ready for war, from the Pygmean, which is translated into Greek as a contest. But if they sound the trumpets of Aradius, let those who claim knowledge of a false name be called Aradius, who have in the quiver of their chest the fiery arrows of the devil, with which they wound and inflame the hearts of the deceived. For he desires to depose those who strive to ascend to lofty heights, and he completes the beauty of Tyre, of which it is written in Proverbs: Do not let the desire for beauty deceive you, lest you be captivated by your own eyes (Prov. 6:25). And again: Just as a gold earring in a pig's snout, so is beauty to a woman without discretion (Ibid. XI, 22).

(V. 12) Your Carthaginian merchants have filled your markets with a multitude of all kinds of riches, with silver, iron, tin, and lead. Not only in the present place, but also in Isaiah, where it is written: Howl, ships of Carthage (Isa. XXIII, 14), the other interpreters have translated the Hebrew word as Tharsis, which is undoubtedly a colony of Tyre. They themselves from the western regions have filled Tyre's markets with silver, iron, tin, and lead. Tarsis in our language signifies the exploration of joy. However, here we must understand explorers not in a positive sense, such as those whom Moses sent to explore the promised land (Num. XIII), but in a negative sense, as the Apostle says we should avoid: Because of false brethren secretly brought in, who came in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ (Galat. II, 4): and concerning whom Joseph spoke: You are spies: to see the nakedness of the land you are come (Gen. XLII, 9). And his brothers, understanding that the crime was not small, began to investigate the plot of others. They replied: Your servants are not spies. Therefore, these people multiply the Tyrian markets not with gold or precious stone, but with silver, iron, tin, and lead, possessing the charm of eloquence and weapons for conquering. And in their lead they mimic the appearance of silver, and in their tin the utmost wickedness, according to Zechariah (Zech. 5), where a woman sat on a lead weight, and the Egyptians sank deep like lead. The discussion of each metal is long, but we must strive for brevity.

(Verse 13, 14) Greece, Tubal, and Meshech themselves, your merchants, brought slaves and bronze vessels to your people. From the house of Togorma they brought horses, horsemen, and mules to your marketplace. Septuagint: Greece and its neighboring regions, your merchants in the souls of men and bronze vessels supplied your market. From the house of Togorma they supplied horses, horsemen, and mules for your trading. Jones says that in Hebrew they are called Javan, and Thubal, that is, Eastern Iberians, or the people of Hispania from the western parts, who are named after the Iber River by this term, and Meshech, whom we understand as Cappadocians, whose capital, which was later called Caesarea by Augustus Caesar, is still called Mazaca in their language: they made precious commerce with Tyre, so that they would bring slaves and bronze vessels from Corinth to Tyre, and from the house of Togorma, that is, from Phrygia, horses, horsemen, and mules, of which that province once had a great abundance. The Hebrews say that Greece, that is, Javan, means both 'is' and 'is not,' which properly refers to worldly wisdom. In this wisdom, if they find something to be correct, they call it 'is'; if they find it to be incorrect, they call it 'is not.' For they speak much about the good of nature and about duties, self-control, and despising wealth. These things the Stoics properly claim for themselves, and they seem to enrich the souls of the people they deceive. They also have bronze vessels that resemble gold, which they give to the people of Tyre to deceive them with false doctrine. Moreover, from the house called Thogorma, which means stranger and foreigner, horses are also brought to the market and fair, and both horsemen and mules, of which it is written: The deceitful horse brings salvation (Ps. 32:17). And in another place: All who mount horses have slumbered (Ps. 75:7). And in the Psalms: Do not be like a horse or mule, without understanding (Ps. 32:9). Therefore, Doeg, the accuser and killer of the priests, was the leader of many, as well (2 Sam. 22), and these belong to the house of foreigners and strangers, who do not eat the meat of the lamb, of which it is written: No foreigner or hired worker shall eat of it (Exod. 12:43); so that all the markets of Tyre may be filled with these goods.


Your sons, O Dadan, are merchants. Concerning them, the Seventy interpreted the sons of the Rhodians, unless perhaps by the false similarity of the first letters (et) they read 'Radan' instead of 'Dadan', which itself is the greatest of the Cyclades and once a very powerful city in the Ionian Sea, renowned for its naval competition and the safest harbor, the haven of all merchants. And because the Rhodians are translated into our language, it is now said tropologically about those who perceive the truth of judgment but do not practice it, as the Apostle says: therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever judges. For in whatever way you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you do the same things that you judge (Rom. II, 1). But it is better to give another's name to Dadan, as it is also in Hebrew, and is held by other interpreters.

<h2 id='tocuniq264'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Verse 15, 16.) Many islands have traded with your merchandise: they have exchanged ivory and ebony for your price. Your merchant, Syria, because of the multitude of your works, has presented droplets, purple, embroidered garments, fine linen, silk, and coral, in your market. Seventy: Your merchandise has multiplied from the islands: you have paid your wages with elephant tusks and those who were introduced. The men of your trading have bought your merchandise from a multitude: in Aphek, Stacte, and Polymita from Tharsis and Ramoth and Chodchod they have given to your markets. In the present place the Septuagint edition differs greatly from the Hebrew; therefore a few things must be said according to each: lest, occupied with Tyrian merchandise, we pass more slowly to the remaining prophecies. The sons of Dedan were the merchants of Tyre, and they multiplied their merchandise in many islands, so that they would give elephant tusks to those who came to trade with them, and they would have men in the markets because of the multitude of their merchandise. However, in Aphek there were 313, which is added in Theodotion's edition to the Septuagint: for which Symmachus translates as polymita. Stacte also, for which all others interpret as purple, which is called Argaman in Hebrew (): and varieties from Tharsis, for which in Hebrew it is called Bus (), which has been translated by all into byssus. However, Tharsis is not found at all in the present place. And they gave ramoth and chodchod in your markets; which is thus found in Hebrew, except that for ramoth, Aquila translates as silk or fine. Indeed, all the interpreters, as it is written in Hebrew (), have translated it. Therefore, according to the Septuagint, the sons of the merchants of Rhodes multiplied his trade from many islands: according to the Hebrew, after the sons of Dedan, his merchants also increased the variety of his merchandise, bringing ivory tusks from India, and ebony wood, which is of the most precious black color, and exchanged them with other Tyrian goods. Syrus was also a merchant from Tyre: for which reason in Hebrew it is called Aram (), in place of which the Seventy men interpreted Hebrew as Adam, and Res and Daleth of letters, as stated above, being deceived by similarity. However, even to this day the innate eagerness for trade persists among the Syrians, who, driven by the desire for profit, roam through the whole world, and have such a madness for trading that, now that they have occupied the Roman world, they seek wealth among swords and the deaths of the wretched, and they flee poverty through dangers. Of this kind are the merchants of Tyre, who trade in fine fabrics, purple dye, and embroidered goods. They also offer linen and silk, and display precious stones in their market. Concerning purple, which all have interpreted, the Septuagint translated it as stacte, that is, a drop. However, I have not been able to find the meaning of chodchod until now. The Hebrews say that all precious goods are signified by this name, or that it is a kind of precious merchandise that the Latin language does not resonate with, or the common term of peddlers. But from many islands, as we move on to anagogy, which are pounded by the salty and bitter waves of this age, merchants from Dedan bring ivory teeth, promising the whiteness of eloquence; about whom it is written: From ivory houses from which the daughters of kings pleased you in your honor (Ps. LIV, 9). But they are not pure, nor do they imitate the bride, of whom it is said: Who is this that comes up whitened, leaning upon her brother (Cant. VIII, 5)? But the blackness of the Ethiopian, which cannot change its blackness, as Jeremiah says: 'Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?' (Jer. XIII, 21). Also, Syrus, that is, Aram, which means exalted, and is swollen with pride, is a merchant of Tyre, and in the multitude of the works of the Tyrians he boasts a false knowledge of his name, promising many varieties and the most excellent fragrance of myrrh, and the purple of royal dignity, and the checkered pattern of the dialectic art, and fine linen, for which the Septuagint translates 'Tharsis,' dedicated to the works of the earth: and silk, for which it is written in Hebrew 'Ramoth,' which means the vision of death. For all earthly works rush toward destruction; and chodchod, whatever that is which is understood, sets forth in the bazaars of Tyre. Now, by the goods which are said to be brought from those regions and islands, either the region of India must be understood, or that of the Edomites and the vast wilderness, as some think, and it has a sound like a relationship, so that we may recognize a similarity of divine teachings in heretics.

(Verse 17) Judah and the land of Israel, they themselves, your stewards, offered in your markets: balsam and honey, and oil, and resin. LXX: Judah and the sons of Israel, these your merchants in the grain trade and in ointments: first honey and oil, and resin they gave in your markets. The Hebrew word Phanag () Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion translated as it is written among the Hebrews: for which LXX translates ointments, we translate balsam. It is said, however, that the land of Judaea, which is now called Palestine, is abundant in resources, such as wheat, balsam, honey, oil, and resin, which are brought from Judah and Israel to the markets of Tyre. And when the literal sense is clear, according to the spiritual sense we will say that the land of confession and of understanding God, which is referred to the Church, should not bring wheat to Tyre first, which when it falls to the ground, multiplies and is taken as the word of God: For man does not live by bread alone, but by every word of God (Deuteronomy VIII, 3). Then the balsam that grows in the vineyards of Engedi, or the ointment, of which it is written: Like the ointment on the head, that runs down the beard, the beard of Aaron (Ps. 132:2). And honey, of which Solomon speaks: You have found honey, eat what is enough. For if you eat too much, you will vomit it (Prov. 25:16), as excessive satiety turns honey into wormwood. And the oil, with which the lamp in the tabernacle of God is lit, lest we be subject to that prophecy: You sold oil in Egypt (Hosea 12:1). But if it were in Egypt and in Tyre, it will be turned upside down, and it will be said of it, The oil of the sinner shall not impregnate my head (Ps. 140:5). But resin is also gentle (or light), suitable for bodies, and is used as medicine. Hence it is written in Jeremiah: Is there no resin in Gilead, or a physician? Why then has the healing of the daughter of my people not gone up (Jer. 8:22)? Jacob also had this resin, which he sent to his son Joseph with honey, balsam, nuts, and stacte (Gen. 43). The Ishmaelites who bought Joseph from the land of Israel, were carrying these things into Egypt: spices, balm, resin of Gilead, and myrrh. And so that we may better understand what wheat, balsam, honey, and oil, and resin are brought to the market of Tyre, let us hear the words of the Lord saying: Do not give what is holy to dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine. Also, to the Canaanite woman who was praying for her daughter, saying: My daughter is severely possessed by a demon, the Lord replied: It is not right to take the food of children and give it to dogs. But because she had come out of the regions of Tyre and Sidon, and was approaching the land of Israel, therefore what she had asked for was granted.

(Verse 18.) Your merchant from Damascus in the multitude of your works: in the abundance of various goods: in fine wine, in the best colored wool. LXX: Your merchant from Damascus with the multitude of your works, from the multitude of all your strength: wine from Helbon, and wool from Mileto. For fine wine, which is interpreted by Symmachus, and by Aquila and Theodotion, and in the Hebrew itself, wine from Helbon. And again, when we arrived in the land of the best-colored wool, either shining or with splendid hues, Aquila and Theodotius transferred us to the land of Soor. It signifies that among other trades of Tyre, the finest wine and the finest wool were brought from Damascus to its market. And we still see this today. Now if Damascus is interpreted as 'drinking blood,' and the true tradition of the Hebrews is that the field in which Abel was killed by the parricide Cain (Gen. IV) was in Damascus, hence the place is called by this significant name, rightly so, and after the execution of Stephen, the first martyr in Christ, Paul went to Damascus, under the mercy of God who made the blind see and the sighted lose their sight, so that he could receive the insight of the mind. And the scales of the dragon fell from his eyes, with which he had lost the light of truth, so that he could go to the street called Straight and find Ananias, which means 'obedient' in our language (Act. IX). Therefore, from this cursed land, to which it is said: 'Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life' (Genesis 3:17), the Tyrian merchants gather, bringing fine wine and shining wool. The wine comes from Chelbon, which means 'milky'. Seventy are chosen for their excellent wool, which comes from Miletus or Tyre. Miletus is not mentioned in Hebrew, but because excellent wool is brought from there, they interpreted Miletus as Tyre. From this it is clear that Tyre feeds on milk in infancy and does not have its own clothing, but obtains it from elsewhere and from various provinces. That which Damascus interprets as the blood of Cilicia and the blood of kisses does not fit the present place. For Hebrew names are often interpreted in various ways due to differences in accents and changes in letters and vowels, especially those that have their own peculiarities among them.

(Verse 19) Both Greece and Mozel have put forth wrought iron on your markets: stacte  317 and cinnamon in your trade. LXX: + Both Greece and Mozel have put forth wrought iron on your markets, which were added in their edition of Theodotion. Iron made by work, and a wheel in your mixture is. From the name of the patriarch Dan and the tribe, and the place where the tribe dwelt, it received its name, where today Paneas is, which was formerly called Caesarea Philippi. And so the river Jordan obtained its name, Jor, meaning stream, Dan, which flows from Lebanon. Javan, on the other hand, denotes Greece, which as we have said, both is and is not. Symmachus also translated Mozel as deferring, so the sense is: Dan and Greece brought to your markets wrought iron, and so forth. Aquila, on the other hand, substituted Uzal for Mozel. From these regions, it is believed that iron, stacte, and reed were brought to the Tyrian markets. Let us say that Greece, that is, Javan, has iron made by craftsmen, and is very ready for war, and boasting that it presents everything with judgment and reason through the art of debate, and promises a vocal sound, which is interpreted on paper, and the scent of the best incense, whether it is iron made by craftsmen, and a wheel that turns with the arrangement of words, and has the flow of speech.

(Verse 20) Your traders, Dedan, sit on carpets. LXX: Your traders, Dedan, with selected animals for chariots. There is a significant difference between the Hebrew and the Septuagint in this passage, except for the name of the region, which is close to Dedan and Dadan. There is indeed a vast difference between sitting on carpets and using selected animals for chariots. There is no doubt that chariots and horses are considered negative if they are earthly. Moreover, both Elijah and Elisha are taken to the heavenly chariot, and Elijah is called the father, father, charioteer, and chariot of Israel (2 Kings 2:12). And Gehazi's eyes are opened to see the chariot on the mountain and the horses prepared for the Lord's ride without riders (ibid. 6). But in the tapestries, the beauty of the words is shown; in them, the merchants of Dedan are carried and rest, having come to the market of Tyre.

(Verse 21.) Arabia and all the princes of Kedar themselves, 318 merchants of your hand, came to you with lambs, and rams, and goats. Concerning the lambs, rams, and goats, 70 camels and rams, and lambs were interpreted. But Arabia and the princes of Kedar (which today is the region of the Saracens, as is most fully demonstrated in Jeremiah's discourse, which is written against Kedar) abound in these animals, namely lambs, rams, and goats, and they multiply the Tyrian markets by means of this transportation (Jeremiah 49). But also, the region of the camels is very fertile because of the expanses of pastures, the mildness of the air, which this animal delights in. Arabia, however, means 'evening', and Cedar means 'darkness'. Concerning this, it is also said in the Psalms: 'I dwell among the inhabitants of Cedar' (Ps. CXIX, 5). These regions provide Tyre with camels burdened by the heaviest weights of sins, whether lambs, and rams, and goats, which they sacrifice on their altars, which they have fabricated from their wicked and rebellious hearts. But we also read in this same prophet in a vision of shepherds, rams stirring up the purest waters and pushing the sheep with their sides and fighting with their horns (Ezekiel 34): also young goats, which are accustomed to stand on the left, and lambs that pretend to be a lamb (Matthew 25): of whom it is written, Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who taketh away the sins of the world (John 1:29). But Isaiah writes favorably about camels (Isaiah 60), concerning Midian, which is interpreted as the judgment of the Lord coming to Jerusalem, and Ephah, and rams from Nebaioth, and Sabah bearing gold and frankincense: the last two of which are also offered to the Lord by the Magi (Matthew 2). And there camels, with the burden of sins laid down, can enter the narrow and narrow path, which leads to life (Matthew VII and XIX).

<h2 id='tocuniq270'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22) The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, your own traders, brought you the finest spices, precious stones, and gold, which they offered in your market. In the Psalms, where it is written, 'The kings of Arabia and Sheba shall bring gifts to you' (Psalm 72:10), in Hebrew it says, 'The kings of Sheba and Sheba shall bring gifts to you.' One is written with the letter Sin, the other with Samech, which is similar to our letter S. Therefore, since 'Saba' is interpreted as conversion, it must be said that in this present passage it does not signify conversion but rather aversion, from which gifts are brought from Tyre with all kinds of spices and the best smells, and with a precious stone and gold, all of which are offered for sale in the markets of Tyre. And they themselves falsely claim the best smell and the precious stone with which they strive to build up their perversity in the churches, and the gold which they promise in a sensual way, and all these things are perverse. For they do not receive anything for free, nor do they give anything for free, but they purchase everything, just as the kings of the Arabs and Saba offer gifts to Christ for free. These are the ones who do everything for the sake of filthy profit: and they have received these gifts from Him who says in the Gospel: 'All these things I will give to you, if you fall down and worship me' (Matthew 4:9). Reama, or according to the Septuagint Rhegma, I could not find in any other place in the Scriptures, nor what region it is, nor what it signifies; except that it is clear, and from what is connected, that Saba is a neighboring region to this province.

(Verses 23, 24.) Aran, and Channe, and Eden, your merchants, Saba, Assur, Chelmad, your sellers: these are your merchants of various woven fabrics of hyacinth, and of precious multi-colored garments, which were wrapped and bound with ropes. LXX: Charran, and Chana, and Edne, these are your merchants: Sabba, Assur, and Chalman, your intruders, bringing merchandise + to Machalim, and to Galima ** hyacinth, and + multicolored ** treasures bound together with ropes. And these are the names of the different places. As for what is added to Theodotion in the Septuagint, it is interpreted by Symmachus as precious coverings. We have also added Polymita, which Theodotion interprets in various ways, from Aquila and Symmachus. The merchant's precious clothes were so highly valued that they were tied with hyacinth-colored ropes. Aran, or as the Septuagint says, Charran, means holes in our language. Channe means preparation. Eden means delights. As for Edne, which is not found in Hebrew, we do not know its meaning, and we should not seek the etymology of a fictitious name. Therefore, in the negotiation of Tyre, the preparation of the whole world is indicated by the fleshy senses which are displayed on the protrusions, for those who think that the sole delights are to increase the commerce of the Tyrian city. We have mentioned about Sabaeans above. Assur is interpreted as the leader: Chelmad, or as it is contained in some copies, Cherma, is transferred to the vineyards: without a doubt, those from Sodom who come to the market of Tyre, in order to direct wickedness, indeed, to accuse with punishments, and to correct what had been depraved, according to that which is said in the Psalms: "You will destroy the enemy and avenger" (Psalm 8:3). And they have in many different ways a variety of furniture, distinct by an incredible variety, which is bound by the coverings of the hyacinth; whether their treasures are bound with ropes, which they have amassed for themselves on earth, according to what is written: By the ropes of their sins each one is bound (Prov. 5:22). And they did not have free trade, but they bound everything with the chains of sins. Let us refer the hyacinthine coverings, because of their similarity in color, to the airy powers, which lavish their treasures in the markets of the world.


They also had cedar in your trade. Ships of the sea (or as it is written in Hebrew, Tarshish), your princes in your trade. Regarding cedars, Seventy cypresses were transported. And since we have already mentioned both, it is unnecessary to increase the reader's boredom.

(Verse 25.) And you were filled, and greatly glorified (or burdened) in the heart of the sea. Nothing, he says, was lacking for you in regard to the riches of the islands. Yet this glorification was a burden for the possessor, since you cannot bear riches in moderation, although often temptation also comes with poverty (Prov. 30). Therefore, Solomon asks only for what is necessary; he equally detests riches and poverty, so that pride does not creep in with one, and impatience and falsehood with the other.

(Verse 26.) Your oarsmen have brought you in many waters. Above the oarsmen we read of the Tyrians from the city of Sidon, and the people of Aradus, of whom the former are hunters and the latter are said to be interpreters. For they hunt the souls of those whom the waves of this world carry at their own will, not raising them up to lofty heights, but sinking them into the depths. They do not imitate those who, sailing until the morning watch, broke the raging waves of the sea and deserved to receive the Lord and Savior, and immediately arrived at the harbor of rest with such a pilot and companion. About which it is written more fully in the Gospel.

The south wind drives you in the heart of the sea (Matthew 14). All the wealth of Tyre perishes when the south wind blows, which more significantly is interpreted as scorching heat in Greek, καύσων (); which we can translate into a burning wind. Concerning this, the holy David said: The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night (Psalm 121:6). Jacob was scorched by this wind, yet not broken, as he speaks: By day I was consumed by burning heat, and by night by frost (Genesis 31:40). Those who were hired from the first hour endured the heat and the burning heat of the whole day, and yet they receive a denarius because they are burned but not broken. Therefore, the bride says in the Song of Songs: I am black but beautiful, because the sun has looked upon me (Song of Songs 1:4), or, more accurately in Hebrew, the sun has discolored me.

Your riches and treasures, and your abundant possessions. Many read it like this: In the heart of the sea are your riches and treasures, and your abundant possessions; so that all the riches and treasures of Tyre, and all its substance, are placed in the heart of the sea, and are overwhelmed by the waves of time, and its inhabitants have nothing stable or permanent, fulfilling that Gospel: Fool, tonight they will take your soul from you, and to whom will belong what you have prepared? (Luke XII, 20). And in that apostolic (scripture): Those who want to become rich fall into temptation and many traps, and are dragged into the depths (I Tim. VI, 9). The story is clear; therefore, we join together short sentences almost verse by verse. For now, the discourse hastens to the end of the book.

<h2 id='tocuniq274'>(Vers. 27)</h2>

(Verse 27) Your sailors (or rowers) and your pilots, who held your merchandise and ruled over your people: and your warriors who were in you, together with all your multitude which is in your midst, will fall in the heart of the sea on the day of your downfall. We read about the sailors or rowers of the city of Tyre, the Sidonians and the Aradians, about whom it has already been mentioned; and according to the Septuagint edition, the counselors of Byblos, which is called Gebal in Hebrew: as well as its warriors, Persians, Lydians, and Libyans, who will all fall and be shown to be nothing, when Tyre falls and all its glory comes to an end in ruins. But the multitude which the Seventy translated as 'commixtionem' signifies the common people; who, without the name of dignities, are crushed by similar judgment. And the prophecy is mixed between the city and the ship, so that from one you may understand the other: and yet both pertain to the end of the age, and to shipwreck.

<h2 id='tocuniq275'>(Vers. 28, 29.)</h2>

(Verse 28, 29.) From the sound of the outcry of your helmsmen, the ships will be thrown into confusion, and all who held the oars will disembark from their ships. The sailors, and all the helmsmen of the sea, the sailors and the rowers, will stand on land and wail loudly, and they will cry bitterly: and they will throw dust on their heads, and will be covered in ashes (or will spread ashes on themselves). And what follows: And they will shave their heads because of you, and they will put on sackcloth; and they will mourn for you with the bitterness of their souls, with the most bitter lamentation, and they will take up a funeral song for you, and they will lament for you. It is not found in the Septuagint, but it was added from Theodotion's edition. When Tyre falls, its governors will be troubled, and they will come down from their ships, as will the rowers, sailors, and pilots, and all the governors of the sea shaken by the waves, will eventually find a stable position; and they will wail with a loud voice over it, which they used to enrich with their merchandise, and they will indicate the bitterness of their minds with their outcry; they will also throw dust or dirt on their heads, doing penance for earthly works. And they shall be sprinkled with ashes, either of heifers as prescribed by the Law (Num. XX), for purification, or they shall sprinkle ashes upon themselves, as it is said to Jerusalem: Sprinkle the earth on your head, and spread ashes upon yourself, and make mourning (Jeremiah VI, 16). And it is written in the Gospel: If the miracles that were done in Tyre and Sidon had been done in Sodom, they would have repented in sackcloth and ashes (Luke X, 13). And the Psalmist says: I have eaten ashes like bread (Psalm CI, 10). And they will graze over Tyre's head, and they will make a baldness, which is accustomed to be done in mourning, at that time when the greatness of pain has expelled all joy. And indeed the apostles counted their hairs, because they had consecrated their hair to the Lord in the manner of the Nazarenes (Matthew 10; Luke 6). And as long as Samson had his hair, he possessed strength, but when his hair was taken away, he was captured by the Philistines (Judges 16). Moreover, when it is said, 'and they will gird themselves with sackcloth,' the old lust of the loins is condemned, so that those who had lived in luxury, afterwards, repenting, may live in austerity and harshness. The people of Nineveh had sacks (Jonah 3). And again in Jerusalem it is said: 'Lament to me like a bride dressed in sackcloth over her husband, a virgin' (Joel 1:8). And they will mourn you, he says, with bitterness of soul and with very bitter weeping. For it is better to enter into the house of mourning than into the house of feasting (Sirach 7): so that they may mourn for Tyre, and sing a mournful song, which the following Scripture adds. But so that we may know the progress of those who mourn for its downfall, and who before dwelled in its heart and in its midst, let the prophets teach us by their example: who themselves are commanded to mourn for Tyre, so that, after a time of repentance is fulfilled, it may be restored to its former state and, taking up the harp, may sing to the Lord. Read Isaiah. Some people, in a ridiculous (but nonetheless, worth mentioning) way, interpret governors as bishops of heretics, advisors as priests, helmsmen as archdeacons, oarsmen and sailors as deacons, and carriers as the entire population. And if they had added the shipmaster as the devil, they would have completed the tragedy. All of them will wail together and mourn bitterly, and they will repent after they have realized the shipwreck of their own ship and have stood on land, and they will have lost all the beauty of the false name of knowledge. And instead of joy and happiness, they will mark repentance with bitterness in their hearts.


<h2 id='tocuniq276'>(Vers. 33 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 33 and following) Who is like Tyre, who has become silent in the midst of the sea? (Which is not found in the Septuagint.) Who filled the sea with your merchandise and enriched many peoples with your abundant wealth? In the multitude of your riches and the multitude of your traders, you have made kings wealthy. Now you are shattered by the sea in the depths of the waters, along with all your merchandise and all the multitude in your midst have fallen. All the inhabitants of the islands were astonished (or were crushed) on account of you, and all their kings were struck (or were turned into madness) by the tempest, they changed their countenances (or they wept). The merchants of the nations (or of the peoples) hissed at you, you have been reduced to nothing (or have become a ruin: and you will no longer be 324 beyond (the Vulgate is silent beyond) forever (or for eternity). The governors, the sailors, the pilots, and the passengers will remember with lamentation those things in Tyre, which so silenced the speech of other cities, that it had no confidence in speaking; and it would hear that Gospel saying, Be silent, and be still (Mark 4:39). And concerning the Psalms: But to the sinner, God said, Why do you proclaim my justices, and take my covenant in your mouth? (Ps. 46:16) How much merchandise, O Tyre, have you become enriched with? And why have you sought with such great labor, to gather what will perish in shipwreck, both day and night? You have indeed filled many peoples, and enriched kings with your wealth, of whom it is written: The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together against the Lord, and against his Christ. (Ps. 2:2) But now you are crushed in the sea, and in the depths of the waters, just as it is written about Pharaoh: The chariots of Pharaoh and his army he has cast into the sea (Exod. XV, 4). He sank into the depths like a stone, and he could say: I have come into the depths of the sea, and the tempest has engulfed me (Ps. XIV, 4). All the islands, or the inhabitants of the islands, which are battered by the waves of this world, will be astonished at you, and their kings, struck by the storm, will feel their own destruction, imitating the voice of the snake, they will hiss and say: You have been brought down to nothingness, or you have been made into destruction; so that you may not have the nature of destruction, but the will. And you will not be. But if he had said this up to now, a great question would arise, how it is not, which we now see built. But from what follows: Forever, it shows the time of one age, which is reckoned in a circle according to the age of a man of seventy years. Whether you will not be with God, the Apostle says: Who called those things that were not (Rom. 4:17). And Isaiah the prophet: Behold, all your adversaries will be confounded and ashamed. For they shall be as if they were not (Isa. XLI, 11): And Esther according to the Septuagint Interpreters: Do not give your scepter to those who are not (Esther XIV, 11). And in the Psalm: Allow me to refresh myself before I depart, and I shall be no more (Ps. XXXV, 14). We have already explained in what sense these testimonies should be understood. However, all these things can be referred to the person of heretics, who, in the contrition of Tyre and shipwreck, feel their own error and, being placed in the middle of the sea, desire to free their souls and lament the ill-gotten riches with which they had enriched many kings, namely, their own patriarchs and the common people, whose wealth will be lost in the middle of the sea. Moreover, the inhabitants of all the islands (if, however, we choose to interpret in a favorable sense what has been said) will be amazed at the destruction of Tyre, and the kings of all the islands, struck as if by a storm, will change their countenance, or certainly reveal the grief of their hearts with weeping and tears, and they will testify to the greatness of their astonishment with astonishment and hissing, demonstrating how worthless it has become, and how it has perished which promised salvation to many nations. And beyond there will no longer be, at any fixed time, for us to interpret αἰῶνα as 'age'; but forever: because the same word signifies both.

<h2 id='tocuniq277'>Book Nine</h2>

Book Nine

325-326 It followed, my daughter Eustochium, that I should include the prophecy of Tyre and the prince of Tyre in one volume, and not separate them by the order of books, but by the connected places and prophecies. But because there are many things that are said, and exceed the measure of my prolixity, therefore the explanation has been extended to the ninth book, which we believe will reach the end with your prayers and those of all the saints: so that we may discuss also Pharaoh and all Egypt, which are written in Ezekiel. Which, even itself, needs to be divided into ten books for the sake of maintaining the measurement among the volumes, and so that the labor of the speaker, writer, and reader can be relieved by being divided into parts.

<h2 id='tocuniq278'>(Cap. XXVIII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 28, Verses 1 onwards) 'And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre: Thus says the Lord God: Because your heart is lifted up, and you have said: I am God, and I sit in the seat of God, in the heart of the sea, whereas you are a man, and not God: and you have set your heart as if it were the heart of God: behold you are wiser than Daniel? No secret is hidden from you! By your wisdom and understanding you have acquired riches for yourself and gathered gold and silver in your treasuries.' In the multitude of your wisdom and in your trading you have multiplied strength for yourself, and your heart is lifted up because of your strength. Therefore thus says the Lord (Vulg. adds God): Because your heart is lifted up like the heart of God, behold, I will bring foreigners against you, the most terrible of the nations, and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom and defile your splendor. They shall kill you and bring you down, and you shall die the death of the slain in the heart of the sea. Are you saying in your heart: 'I am God, when you are being killed by those who kill you, even though you are a man and not God, in the hand of those who kill you? You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of foreigners, for I have spoken,' says the Lord God. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: 'You, son of man, say to the prince of Tyre: Thus says the Lord God: Because your heart is lifted up, and you have said, 'I am God, I inhabit the heart of the seas,' yet you are a man, and not God, and you have set your heart as the heart of God, are you wiser than Daniel?' The wise have not taught you their discipline. Did you make strength for yourself in your learning or wisdom? Did you accumulate gold and silver in your treasuries or increase your strength through much learning and trade? Your heart is lifted up in your strength, therefore thus says the Lord God: Because you have made your heart like the heart of God, behold, I will bring foreigners against you, the deadly ones of the nations, and they shall draw their swords against your beauty of knowledge, and they shall humble your beauty in destruction. They shall bring you down and dispose of you, and you shall die the death of those who are slain in the heart of the sea. Will you say, 'I am God,' when you face your killers? But you are a man, not a god, surrounded by those who wound you. You will die at the hands of uncircumcised foreigners, for I have spoken, says the Lord God. Wherever the Lord is written in the Septuagint as the second name, the first name is the tetragrammaton (), which properly belongs to God and is ineffable. The second name is the common (), which is often found in humans. However, the city of Tyre is described under the figure of a ship, first in its wealth, then in its destruction and lamentation: thus, a prophetic speech is directed to the prince of Tyre, stating that he became arrogant and misused the riches he had; then, there is mourning and lamentation, about how great goods have turned into great evils. Therefore, the things to be mentioned first are these: It is written in Isaiah (Isa. IV) to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, that he equated himself with the power of God and became so lifted up in pride that he dared to say: 'I will ascend above the stars of heaven and will be like the Most High.' And he was cast down from his throne, deserving to hear: How has Lucifer fallen, who rose in the morning? And of Pharaoh in the same prophet: The rivers are mine, and I made them (Isaiah 29:9). And of the prince of Tyre, who, with an uplifted heart, arrogantly said: I am a god, and I sit in the seat of God, and dwell in the habitation of God, though he is a man, and not God. And although these things may seem to exceed the powers of human frailty, and to be the words not of men but of raving demons, nevertheless we must understand the hyperbole, that they have swelled to such an extent, and have not known their own measure, that, swelled up with the happiness and power of the world, while they think present good things to be eternal, they have not known themselves to be men, and have claimed eternal sovereignty for themselves. Although under the type of rulers, kings, and individual (or particular) cities or provinces, opposing powers are demonstrated, about which the apostle Paul also writes: Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms (Ephesians 6:12). And in another place: We speak wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this world or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing (1 Corinthians 2:6). And again, speaking about wisdom, he says, which none of the rulers of this world has known. For if they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory (I Cor. II, 8). In the prophecy of Daniel it is also clear that the Prince of the Israelite people is Michael, and the prince of Greece, and the prince of Persia (Dan. X). And Moses writes more clearly in the Song of Deuteronomy: When the Most High divided the nations, and scattered the sons of Adam, he established the boundaries of nations, according to the number of God's angels (Deut. XXXII, 8); or as it is better understood in Hebrew: according to the number of the sons of Israel. And a part of the Lord's people became His Jacob, His inheritance in Israel. And we should not be surprised that on the opposite side the worst kings would precede the princes in the likeness of the transgressors, since in the same way we ought to proclaim the best kings David, Solomon, and Josiah, together with the patriarchs and prophets, as foreshadowing the Lord and Savior. Therefore, according to both interpretations, let us discuss the writings about both proud kings and apostate princes. He says therefore (Al. Cum sit, ait): It is allowed for you, even though you are held in the narrowness of the middle of the sea and surrounded by islands, to say more, since you are a man and encompassed by the fragility of human flesh, swelled up with arrogance of heart, that you dwell on the throne of God, believe yourself to be in the heavens. And at the same time, because you boast of wisdom to such an extent that the men of your kingdom provoke Solomon with riddles: are you wiser than Daniel, who, by the grace of God, conquered all the magicians and soothsayers, and is now the wisest in Babylon? Or, to understand it in this way: Even if you are wiser than Daniel, who is acknowledged by all to be the wisest, and even if you desire to be equal in power to God in his greatness of wealth and power, you will still be taken captive by your adversaries, and the city will be destroyed, and you will be wounded by many blows. And then you will no longer say, 'I am a god,' but in your destruction, you will learn that you are a man, not a god. However, if we want to say that the same power is being referred to as the prince of Tyre, to whom the city itself, or the province, was given by God, let us take that testimony. I said, 'You are gods, and all of you are sons of the Most High. Nevertheless, you will die like men and fall like one of the princes' (Psalm 82:7). For they were given the provinces to govern as judges by the Emperor. But they, forgetting their honor and being influenced by a higher command, like Heraclianus in Africa, rose up with a tyrannical mindset against their king and Lord. They scattered throughout the whole world, assuming the names of idols for themselves under the guise of idolatry, and, swollen with pride, fell into the judgment of the devil and the snare. Concerning this, the Savior spoke in the Gospel: 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven' (Luke 10:18).

<h2 id='tocuniq279'>(Vers. 11 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 11 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, raise a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him: Thus says the Lord God: You were the signet of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering: carnelian, topaz, and jasper, chrysolite, onyx, and beryl, sapphire, emerald, and carbuncle; and crafted in gold were your settings and your engravings. On the day that you were created they were prepared. You, Cherub, stretched out and protecting, I have set you on God's holy mountain. You walked among the fiery stones: perfect in your ways, from the day of your creation, until iniquity was found in you. In the abundance of your trading, your heart was filled with iniquity, and you sinned, and I cast you out from the mountain of God, and I destroyed you, O Cherub, protecting from among the fiery stones. And your heart was lifted up because of your beauty. You have corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor, I have cast you to the ground. I have made you a spectacle before kings, that they may see you. In the multitude of your iniquities and the injustice of your dealings, you have defiled your sanctification. Therefore, I will bring fire from your midst that will consume you, and I will turn you into ashes upon the earth in the sight of all who see you. All who see you among the nations will be astonished at you. You have become nothing, and you will not be forever. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, take up a lamentation over the prince of Tyre and say to him: Thus says the Lord God: You seal of similarity, full of wisdom and adorned with a crown, you were in the delights of the paradise of God. You were surrounded by every good stone: sardius and topaz, and emerald, and carbuncle, and sapphire, and jasper, and silver, and gold, and chrysolite, and agate, and amethyst, and chrysoprase, and beryl, and onyx, and your treasury was filled with gold, and your storehouses in you, from the day you were created, they were prepared with the anointed Cherub from God, and dwelling in the tabernacle, I have set you on the holy mountain of God: you became in the midst of burning stones. You were blameless in your days, from the day you were created, until iniquities were found in you. By the abundance of your trading, you were filled with iniquity and sinned. Therefore, I cast you to the ground and exposed you before kings, to disgrace you. Because of the multitude of your sins, and the unjust practices of your business, I have defiled your sanctuaries. And I will bring fire in the midst of you, it shall devour you. And I will make you ashes upon the earth in the sight of all who see you, and all who know you among the nations shall be dismayed at you. You have become a ruin, and you shall be no more forever. For we have spoken of the prince of Tyre, and how he has fallen through his pride, let us acknowledge his lamentations over his former glory. First, let it be understood what it was, so that he may grieve for having lost what he had. 'You,' she says, 'are the seal of likeness'; according to that which John the Evangelist properly says about the Savior: 'For Him has God the Father set His seal' (John 6:27). And about humans: 'He has set His seal, because God is true' (John 3:33). And in the Psalms: 'The light of your face, O Lord, has been sealed upon us' (Psalm 4:7). And in another place: 'Beloved, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet appeared.' We know that when he appears, we shall be like him (1 John 3:2). Hence it is said to God: Who is like you? (Psalm 35:10). For likeness is one thing, equality another. Therefore, the most savage heresy is the one that confesses only the Father's likeness in Christ and denies his nature. But we not only say likeness in the Son, but also equality. For this reason the Jews persecuted him, because not only did he break the Sabbath, but he also made himself equal to God (John 5). But where there is equality, there is the same nature and one substance. This is what the Apostle speaks of in terms of similarity: My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you (Galatians 4:19), so that you may receive, namely, His likeness, which you lost through your own fault. And because in Latin codices the word for seal is ‘resignaculum,’ while expressing the Greek word κακοζήλως word for word, which is translated according to the Septuagint version as ‘ἀποσφράγισμα’ or seal. And some people understand it in this way, that the seal of God and the figure which was expressed as if in the softest wax, the king of Tyre has cancelled and lost, so that he has made a counter-seal in place of the seal, not having the image and likeness of God, by which the first man was created, as God says: Let us make man in our image and likeness (Gen. 1:26). And it should be noted that the image was made at that time only, but the likeness is fulfilled in the baptism of Christ. And consequently to whom it was said: You are a seal of likeness, joined, full of wisdom, perfect in beauty, or, a crown of adornment. For where the likeness of God is, there is also the fullness of wisdom, and perfect beauty, or like a crown adorned with different flowers, which the diligent increases with their own effort, while the industrious nourish the good of nature, and the negligent diminish it, according to what is said in Proverbs under the figure of a beautiful and ill-behaved woman: As a gold ring in a pig's snout, so is the beauty of an ill-behaved woman (Prov. XI, 22). It follows: In the delights of the paradise of God you were: for which in Hebrew it is called Eden, which also the story of Genesis narrates. Eden, however, is translated into delights. And beautifully, it is named paradise of God as a distinction, to show that there is a contrary paradise not of God, among those who exchange the truth for falsehood (Rom. I), and boast of having paradise. By this speech, he shows that it is by no means a man about whom it is written, but a contrary strength, which once dwelled in the paradise of God: although the Jews think that this is prophesied about King Hiram of Tyre in a manner called hyperbole. But to whom is it said: You were in the delights of the paradise of God, or you became, it shows what he had, or what he lost. Moreover, as for the dwelling of paradise, every precious stone is your covering, or your binding, and encircling, sardius, topaz, and jasper, chrysolite, and onyx, and beryl, sapphire, and carbuncle, and emerald, or, as in the Septuagint, in a different order and with other names, twelve stones are contained, it must be observed that not every precious stone surrounded or covered the king of Tyre, but every stone he had was precious. Moreover, there are many precious stones that are not mentioned in Scripture, such as chalcedony, sardonyx, chrysoprase, hyacinth, crystal, and the most precious pearl. Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotio also differ greatly from each other in both order and number in the present place, and the Septuagint translators not only differ in order but also in names. In the Book of Revelation, where the living stones of Jerusalem are mentioned as being built, there is a slight change in order in the outer parts, and the same stones are placed in its foundations, so that the gates are said to be constructed with the light of crystal (Rev. 21). But also in the breast of the high priest, according to the four orders in the Ephod (Exodus 28), the same stones are described, and on his shoulders two onyx stones, on which the names of the twelve patriarchs are written, which the true high priest, of whom it is written: You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek (Psalm 110:4), carries in his breast, carries on his shoulders, to represent the number of the twelve stones of the apostles; and in the two sacraments of both Testaments, one of which John the Evangelist reclined on his breast, to draw from the wellsprings of wisdom, and be able to say: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; this was in the beginning with God (John 1:1-2). These are the living stones, from which the Church is built, and 333 of which the Apostle Peter writes: If you have believed, because the Lord is sweet: approaching him as a living stone, indeed rejected by men, but chosen and honored by God, and you yourselves as living stones, are being built into a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices pleasing to God through Jesus Christ: for it is written (Isaiah 28:16): Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame (1 Peter 2:3 et seqq.). Moreover, by this vessel of election, He alluded to us, by saying: Them that were built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Himself being the chief cornerstone, in whom all the builded frame groweth up into a holy temple to the Lord (Ephes. II, 10). These are the stones, of which we also read in another place: And they shall be carried as in a sling, and they shall be set as a spire-stone, yet a little dust, and they shall roll on and on, hastening to heaven with restless motion (Zach. IX, 16). Of which the Scripture also makes mention: Behold I will lay thy stones in order, and will lay thy foundations with sapphires, and I will make thy bulwarks of jasper, and thy gates of graven stones, and all thy borders of desirable stones. And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord: and great shall be the peace of thy children. And thou shalt be founded in justice: depart far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear, and from terror, for it shall not come near thee. (Isaiah 54:11-13). Concerning which, what it may seem to us, we have declared in the explanations of the same prophet. The 20th Psalm sings of such stones: 'O Lord, in your strength the king will rejoice, and greatly exult in your salvation. You have granted him the desire of his soul and have not withheld the request of his lips. For you meet him with rich blessings; you set a crown of fine gold upon his head.' (Psalm XX, 1ff.) These are the pearls of the prophets and apostles, which, in comparison to Christ, are all sold in the Gospel, in order to buy the most precious pearl, and the stone of which Zacharias writes, that it has seven eyes, that is, the seven graces of the Holy Spirit. (Zechariah III and IV). Read Isaiah. And it is placed by the apostle Paul in the foundation of the Church, on which gold, silver, and precious stones are built (I Cor. III): the colors, natures, and efficacies of each of which, it is not the time of this world to discuss; but they require their own volume: so that in Ezekiel, and in Exodus, and in Revelation and in Isaiah, all the stones and orders of stones compared to themselves, make a great question for reading and discussing. The holy bishop Epiphanius also gave me his own volume. And Pliny the Elder's 37th book, Natural History, discusses gems and stones after a thorough knowledge of all things. The reader should be informed about these. Furthermore, Symmachus's interpretation describes this Tyrian prince as having a precious necklace adorned with stones. Lastly, he calls it a golden ornament, in which the stones are embedded. And according to the Hebrew it follows: The gold is the work of your adornment, and your openings were prepared on the day you were buried. This is why the Septuagint translates it: You filled your treasures and storehouses with gold, indicating the understanding and intention that his thinking had through divine sacraments, and he gathered for himself spiritual riches, about which the Lord commanded: Store up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where neither rust nor moth destroys, and where thieves do not dig and steal. Where your treasure is, there your heart is also (Matt. VI, 21). This is the hidden treasure, of which it also speaks in the Gospel: The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a person finds and hides again, and out of joy, goes and sells everything they have, and buys that field (Ibid., 13). However, the storehouses or granaries are, about which it is written in another place: Blessed shall be your storehouses and your remaining goods (Deut. XXVIII, 5). After this it is said, according to the Hebrew: You are the Cherub stretched out and protecting, the ark of God and the mercy seat are understood as subauditions, or according to the Septuagint, which itself is anointed and created with the Cherub. From this it is shown that this does not pertain to a human prince of the city of Tyre, but to the former and principal strength, which is positioned as the prince of the city of Tyre. And I have set you, he says, on the holy mountain of God; undoubtedly he signifies paradise, to which, after the third heaven, the Apostle Paul says he was caught up (I Cor. XII). But Cherub, of the masculine gender, is said in the singular and plural number, and it is interpreted as a multitude of knowledge. On them God rests and sits, and uses this chariot, as the prophet says to Him: You who are enthroned upon the Cherubim, reveal yourself. And in another place: He mounted the Cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind. This Cherub, or created with Cherub, extends and protects the sacraments, and is placed on the holy mountain of God, of which we have frequently spoken. And the apostle Paul speaks, if anyone however receives the Letter to the Hebrews: You have come to Mount Zion and the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to thousands of angels (Heb. XII, 22). Or certainly the holy mountain of God, paradise (as we have said) is to be understood. He also walked among fiery stones, of which it is written: He makes His angels spirits, and His ministers flaming fire (Ps. CIII, 4). And not only God, who is called consuming fire, should consume hay, wood, and straw (Deut. IV): but also the angels, who are called fiery stones and are fervent in spirit. Therefore, the Lord says: I came to cast fire upon the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled (Luke XII). And what follows: Perfect in your ways from the day of your creation (for which the Septuagint has: You were blameless in your days, from the day you were created), until evil was found in you, shows that every good creature created by God had perfection and virtue, and that the prince of Tyre was also blameless, so that the stain that follows is not one of nature, but of will. When iniquity was discovered in you, it was discovered by God, which was held captive in the treasures of your heart through pride and the abuse of the power that you had received. In the multitude of his transactions, the inner parts of it, or the storehouses, were filled with iniquity. For while he sought after many things and was not satisfied with the knowledge he had acquired, nor with the power he had been entrusted with, he filled the storehouses and the inner parts of his heart, so that, being satiated and made fat, he kicked against his Creator. For Jacob ate and was satisfied, and the beloved one kicked; he grew fat and plump and stuffed; and he deserted the God who made him (Deut. XXXII, 15). And out of the heart come evil thoughts (Matth. XV, 19). Because of these, God says: You have sinned and I have cast you out from the mountain of God, or you have been wounded by the mountain of God, which, when we read it, we are compelled to fear. For if the extended and protecting Cherub, placed on the holy mountain of God, and perfect and immaculate in the midst of the burning stones, filled his inner being with iniquity and sinned, and was cast out from the mountain of God, that is, from the dwelling place of paradise, or if he was wounded by the mountain of God, who is clearly understood to be Christ, or if he was indeed situated and dwelling on the mountain of God and wounded by himself, and feeling remorse in his conscience for his evil, as he understands himself unworthy of the dwelling place of the mountain: what should we think of ourselves? Because of this, it is said to him: And I have lost you, Cherub, protecting [you] from the midst of the fiery stones, so that you would not remain among the fiery stones, but would perish. O Cherub himself, or Cherubim, who was protecting you, I have brought you out from the midst of the fiery stones, according to that which is also written about Adam: He cast out Adam, and placed [him] (or, Cherubim) opposite the paradise of delights (Genesis 3:24). And it provides the reasons why he was brought out or cast out from the midst of the fiery stones. For your heart has been lifted up in your beauty; you think that what belongs to God is yours. Hence the apostle says that he received a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan, to beat him, lest he should be proud of the greatness of his revelations and fall into the judgment of the devil (2 Corinthians 12). And therefore your doctrine is corrupted, he says, with your beauty, or you have lost your wisdom in your beauty: so that while you desire to be more than you were created, and to know more than you received from God, you also lose what you had, and for the sake of beauty and doctrine, deformity and foolishness possess you: hence you are cast down to the earth, who once dwelt on the mountain of God. Of which Isaiah writes: How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! (Isa. XIV, 12)? And the Savior in the Gospel: I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven (Luke X). And Jeremiah speaks to Jerusalem: How the Lord has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger! He has hurled down from heaven to earth the splendor of Israel (Lam. II, 1)? But you have been cast out in the sight of all kings, that they might be terrified by your example, whether good kings, whose hearts are in the hand of God (Prov. XXI), or evil ones, whose kingdoms the devil showed to the Savior (Matt. IV): who met the king of Babylon, saying: You too have become weak like us, and you have been counted among us. Therefore, he defiled his sanctification, which he had when he lived on the mountain and walked among the burning stones. It follows: I will bring fire in your midst that will devour you. This fire was ignited in the heart of the king of Tyre by the one whose arrows are aflame, of whom it is written: All of them are like an oven; their hearts are like a burning hearth (Hosea). This fire is also mentioned by Isaiah: Walk in the light of your fire and in the flame you have kindled (Isaiah 50), so that when you go out, it may devour those who possess you, according to what is written in the same Isaiah: It devoured like hay the fuel (Isaiah 5). On that day the mountains, and hills, and forests will be extinguished, and it will consume from the soul even to the flesh. Nadab and Abihu offered this fire, which is called alien, at the altar of the Lord, and for this reason they were consumed by divine fire (Leviticus 10). Hence Moses says: This is the word that the Lord spoke: In those who come near to me I will be sanctified. But the sanctification of God is the punishment of sinners. After this it is said: And I will make you into ashes, so that everything you have built, your evil conscience will be consumed by fire. When you were supposed to rest on the Sabbath and not do any servile work, you gathered wood on the Sabbath so that there would be fuel for the fire that you would devour in your heart. It will also destroy all evil works, turning them into ashes, so that the harmful fire may be completely extinguished, so that all may see and be amazed that the king of Tyre has perished and has become nothing, not in many centuries, but in one, or certainly forever, so that what is written may be fulfilled: I will not spare you, and I will not have pity. The Hebrews are accustomed, among their other fables and genealogies and endless questions, to understand these words spoken against King Hiram of Tyre, when from Solomon to Ezekiel there are many years, which at that time it is clear that men did not live: and thus to pronounce, as if the prophet speaks to him ironically: Are you the seal of the likeness of God, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty? You adorned with all precious stones, you are a cherub, or were you created with a cherub? When, on the contrary, you sinned, and you shall be dissolved into ashes? And they add a marvel to their story, that, contrary to Scripture, or rather, without the authority of Scripture, they say that Hiram lived a thousand years. But the prudent reader understands how violent this interpretation is, without our judgment.

<h2 id='tocuniq280'>(Vers. 20 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 20 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set (or strengthen) your face against Sidon, and prophesy against it, and say: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, Sidon, and I will be glorified in you (or in your midst), and they shall know that I am the Lord when I execute judgments in it (or in you) and am sanctified in it (or in you). And I will send pestilence into it (or into you), and blood shall be in its (or your) streets, and the slain (or wounded) shall fall in its (or your) midst by the sword (or swords) all around, and they shall know that I am the Lord. And there will no longer be a stumbling block of bitterness and a thorn causing pain on every side for the house of Israel (or those who have insulted them); and they will know that I am the Lord God. Thus says the Lord God: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples (or from the nations) among whom they were scattered, I will be sanctified in them before the nations. And they will dwell in their own land, which I gave to my servant Jacob, and they will dwell in it securely (or in hope). And they will build houses and plant vineyards, and they will dwell confidently (or in hope) when I execute judgments on all those who oppose them (Vulgate adds 'and those who have insulted them') on every side; and they will know that I am their Lord God. And what follows, according to the Septuagint: 'And you, the God of their fathers,' is not found in the Hebrew. Furthermore, after Tyre, mention is made of Sidon; for both cities are in the same province. And in the Gospel, Tyre and Sidon are mentioned together: 'If the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon' (Matthew 11:21). Therefore, even the Canaanite woman, whose daughter was possessed by a demon, because she came from the region of Tyre and Sidon, obtained what she asked for (ibid., 15). But the divine word predicts that Babylon itself will be captured and will experience the weight of its sins, because the Lord Himself will judge it and sanctify it. It will be consumed by hunger, pestilence, and the sword, so that it will fall in its streets and no longer be a stumbling block to the people of God, nor will it frequently attack them. But when this is done, the people of Israel, whom the Lord had dispersed among different nations, will return to their own land and be sanctified in them. They will not be a bad influence like Sidon, but a good one, because the Lord will have shown them mercy. They will dwell in the land that their father Jacob was given, and they will dwell securely and confidently in the Lord. They will build houses and plant vineyards, fulfilling the promises made to them. And then they will know that the Lord Himself is the one whose promises are most steadfast. As for those who refer many things to the time of Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, when the people of Israel returned and dwelt in the land of Judah, others, however, hope for the fulfillment of these things in the last time and in a thousand years. Moreover, according to spiritual understanding, this seems to us to be the meaning here. They are interpreted as the hunters of Sidon, of whom it is also written in the Psalms: Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the snare of hunters (Psalm 123:7). And in Proverbs: The eye of a harlot is a snare for the sinner (Prov. XXIII, 27). But there are also hunters on the good side, about whom Jeremiah writes: Behold, I will send fishermen and hunters, who will hunt you from every hill and mountain (Jerem. XVI, 16): whom the Lord also sends to fish, and makes them fishers of men (Matthew IV). Hence the village of Peter and Andrew is called by this name: For Bethsaida in our language is interpreted as the house of hunters. Therefore, against these very wicked hunters, the word of God is directed and the prophet is commanded to set his face against Sidon, and not to be swayed by every wind of doctrine, but to stand firm in the truth and destroy his adversaries. What are the threats that the Lord is making against Sidon? Behold, I myself will come to you, and I will be glorified in you when I have killed you, and all who are alive will know that I am the Lord when I repay you according to what you deserve. And I will send pestilence and blood into your streets. And rightly are they called broad streets [platēae] of Sidon ... For wide and spacious is the road that leads to death (Matth. VII). And those who stood wrongly will fall, pierced by a sword that goes around: that sword which the Lord will send upon the earth to separate what is wrongly joined together, and let those who remain know that He is the Lord. And when those [340] have given way, there will no longer be a stumbling block of bitterness, nor a thorn of pain that pierces and wounds the people of God. But all these things are said against the opposing powers, so that in the end times they may be destroyed, and there may be eternal security when the Lord gathers the house of Israel, those who perceive God with understanding. And he will be sanctified in them, and what is written will be fulfilled: Be holy, for I am holy (Leviticus 19:2). And they will dwell in their land, of which we read elsewhere: I believe that I shall see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living (Psalm 16:13). Jacob, who supplanted his brother before, gave what was his own and deserved to receive the firstfruits. And they will dwell in it, secure in hope, and they will build houses, plant vineyards, and dwell securely in hope, according to what is read in Isaiah: 'O children who have been weaned from milk, who have been taken from the breast, wait for tribulation upon tribulation, and hope upon hope' (Isa. 60). They will build houses, which are also built in the Gospel by him who sets the foundations not on sand, but on rock (Matt. 7). Concerning which it is written: Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain (Psalm 127:1). And in Exodus, according to the Septuagint: Because the midwives feared God, they built houses for themselves (Exodus 1:21), and many similar things. But when the Lord executes judgment against those who oppose or afflict Israel with insults, then every creature will recognize that He is the Lord, whose judgments are true and justified in themselves.


<h2 id='tocuniq281'>(Cap. XXIX.—Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Chapter 29, Verses 1, 2.) In the tenth year (or according to the Septuagint, the twelfth) in the tenth month (or according to the Hebrew, the twelfth), on the first (or on one) day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against all Egypt. Speak and say: Thus says the Lord God. After Sidon, which is also situated on the coast of Phoenicia, the word of the Lord came to the prophet in the tenth year of King Joachim's captivity, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, to set his face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and speak of him and of all Egypt, or against all Egypt. For on the other side of Judah, situated on the same coast, there is the province of Egypt, and he shall prophesy about what will come upon them. But if we must say something about the numbers, it is the place of the tenth day among the ten: hence it is not said at the beginning of Genesis: And there was evening and there was morning, the first day, but the one day (Gen. 1), to always indicate the repetition of the same day. The same order among the ten decades, that is, the hundred number, is held by the tenth number, which is considered for the sacrifice of the lamb to be offered on the fourteenth day, and in this way, up to a thousand and ten thousand, and a hundred thousand, and beyond, the order of their numbers proceeds through the decades. After the tenth year, the twelfth month is placed, in order to represent the perfect number of the twelve apostles and prophets (who are contained in one volume). Moreover, according to the Septuagint, the tenth month, which is called Tebeth in Hebrew (), and in Egyptian τυβὶ, is called January by the Romans, because it is the gateway of the year for them: with all heat removed, it contains the dominion of winter cold. Let this be sufficient said about the numbers. Furthermore, that must be especially investigated, whether the person mentioned is Pharaoh himself who is referred to in Exodus, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and many other places, and in the Song of Songs: I have compared you, my love, to Pharaoh's chariots (Song 1): or is it someone else entirely? It seems to me that it is not just one person, but rather this term is used to denote royal dignity among the Egyptians, just as among the Romans, their emperors and kings are called by the name of the first Gaius Caesar and the second his adopted son Octavian, who was later named Augustus; and among the Syrians, Antioch, among the Persians, the Arsacids, among the Philistines, Abimelech, and after Alexander, the Ptolemies in Egypt until Cleopatra, who, having been defeated at Actium, made Egypt a Roman province. Therefore, in the present time, the word of the Lord is directed against every king of Egypt, which is interpreted as 'the scatterer', clearly meaning the killer and destroyer, who cuts down and separates everything with a sword. This can be understood in a mystical sense as referring to the power to which Egypt is subject. For no man would dare to say: 'The rivers are mine, and I made them', nor would he be called a great dragon, sitting in the midst of his rivers. But Egypt is called 'Mesraim' in Hebrew, which is translated in our language as 'the constrictor' and 'the oppressor', clearly referring to its subjugated people, who are not allowed to lift their eyes to heaven but, in accordance with the Gospel and the example of that woman whom the devil had bowed down for eighteen years, are always sinking into earthly things. Let us therefore see what the threat is against Pharaoh and all of Egypt.

<h2 id='tocuniq282'>(Vers. 3 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 3 onwards) Behold, I am coming to you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, great dragon, who lies (or sits) in the midst of your rivers, and you say: The river is mine, and I have made it for myself (or them). And I will put a bridle (or snare) in your jaws, and I will stick the fish of your rivers to your scales (or feathers), and I will draw you out from the midst of your rivers; and all your fish shall stick to your scales. And I will cast (or throw) you out quickly (or into the desert); and all the fish of your river shall die on the face of the earth (or your land). You shall neither be gathered nor assembled; I have given you to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the air for devouring. And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the Lord, because you have become (or were) a staff (or reed) of the house of Israel, when they took (or took hold of) you with their hand (Vulgate is silent on "their"), and you were broken, and tore every shoulder of theirs, and as they leaned on you, you were crushed, and you shattered (or broke) all their loins. We combine both editions of brevitas, where they do not differ much from each other. Otherwise, when there is a great difference, we present both. However, it speaks against Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, and under his likeness speaks to great power, which Egypt was given to govern, and yet it proudly claims dominion over its Creator, claiming for itself the rule of the land and handing itself over to be worshipped by the Egyptian peoples. And it speaks according to the location of the province, as if to a king, that it relies on the inundation of the Nile and does not greatly desire rains from the sky, and it believes itself to be the author of itself, or the channels and streams of the Nile, which it boasts are made by itself. No, he said, I will not send an Angel, but, o great dragon, who live and reside in the midst of your rivers, I myself will come to punish you. For you have dared to say: The Nile river is mine, and I am its creator: or, I have made the river by which all of Egypt is irrigated. And when I come, I will put a bit in your jaws: whether I tie your mouth with cords, with which you boasted magnificently, and make all your companions and leaders, whom you call fish, adhere to your feathers or scales, so that you are pulled out of the river and thrown away or cast down. For you have exalted yourself exceedingly in the desert. And you shall fall on the face of the field, or your land, because Egypt is a flat province. Your corpse will not be gathered, nor will you be gathered, that is, you will not be buried, but I will give you to be devoured by beasts and birds of the sky, so that when the inhabitants of Egypt see these judgments executed on you, they may recognize that I am the Lord. But these things will happen to you because you have deceived my people Israel with your assistance, so that they would not trust in their God, the creator, but in you. You were to them a staff made of reed, as Isaiah says (Isa. XXX), or a hollow rod, and a very fragile reed, on which leaners would find no support, so that when they leaned on it, it would break and pierce the shoulder and the hand that held it, and while they trusted in you, all the loins of those who fell to the ground would be crushed, and those seeking help would receive wounds. But these things are said metaphorically to the king of Egypt, because that province was never an enemy to Israel, but while it made great promises, it would separate them from God's help. But according to anagoge, we often read about the opposing power of the dragon. And so Pharaoh is said to be a scatterer, who separates and disconnects from God, and Egypt, that is, Egypt, is turned into tribulation and affliction, namely those whom it can subjugate. This dragon is a transgressor, about whom Job speaks most fully (Job XL, 41). And in the Psalms it is written: You have smashed the heads of the dragon, you have given him as food to the people of Ethiopia (Ps. LXXIII, 14). And the great dragon is said to be compared to the lesser dragons, about which it is sung in the psalm: You have crushed the heads of the dragons in the waters (Ibid.). And in another place: This great and spacious sea, there the creeping things, of which there is no number: small animals with big ones, there ships will pass through: This dragon, whom You have formed to mock him (Ibid., CIII, 25 seqq.). Of whom it is also said in another place: He is the king of all that are in the waters, and the beginning of the representation of the Lord, who became, that he might be mocked by his angels (Job. XLI, 24, sec. LXX). But he sits or lies down, in the midst of his rivers, not of one river, but of many, which we understand to represent various heresies, through which he flowed into Egypt of this present age, and watered the souls of the seduced, not with the rains coming down from heaven, but with the muddy waters from the earth, which Jeremiah does not prohibit to drink, saying: What to you and the ways of Egypt, that you may drink the water of Geon? (Jer. 11:18). Instead of which, in Hebrew it is written Sior (), which word is translated to mean 'muddy' and 'muddy'. But in order to understand what the rivers of the Egyptian dragon are, we can know from opposites. The Lord speaks about His rivers: Whoever believes in me, rivers of living water will flow from his belly (John 7:37). And to the Samaritan woman: Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never thirst again, but it will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life (John 4:13-14). These are the rivers coming from heaven, of which David sings: The streams of the river make the city of God glad (Psalm 46:4): undoubtedly it signifies the Church. Let us therefore consider what punishment the dragon receives, or what torture it is. Next follows: And I will put a bridle or a noose in your jaws. Similar to this is what Job says: But you shall draw in the serpent with a hook, and put a bridle about his nostrils. It trusts that the Jordan may enter into its mouth; it will receive him in its eye. But a bracelet will pierce its nostrils, and its lips (Job 40:19). The Lord puts a bridle in the jaws of this dragon, and pierces its lips and restrains it with a circle of a bracelet, when through the Ecclesiastical men, who are learned in the holy Scriptures, he imposes silence upon it, and all the teachings of wickedness are dissolved. And the fish of its rivers are congealed by its own wings or scales, with which the heretics, in their arrogance, hasten to the heights, so that they, too, bound with the dragon, may make one body with it and be joined to it either in the fellowship of error or in the likeness of punishment. Just as one who adheres to the Lord is one spirit (1 Corinthians 6:17). And indeed the Egyptian dragon has not one river, but many rivers, with which it waters lowly and desolate Egypt, having nothing within it of mountains, nor does it possess the waters of Siloam, which flow silently, but turbid and muddy waters (Isaiah 8). And the Lord will remove him from the midst of his rivers, so that he shall not have dominion over them, nor sit upon them: and all the fishes of the rivers shall stick to his scales. According to the greatness of his vices is he dragged, and as his sin is, so also shall his strength be. The scales of his flesh shall stick together as with a brazen strong shield. His heart shall be as hard as a stone, and as firm as a smith's anvil. When he shall raise him up, the angels shall fear, and being affrighted shall purify themselves. The sword of him that layeth at him shall not be able to hold, the spear, the dart, nor the breastplate. He shall esteem iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. The archer shall not put him to flight, the stones of the sling are to him like stubble. As stubble will he esteem the hammer, and he will laugh him to scorn who shaketh the spear. The beams of the sun shall be under him, and he shall strew gold under him like mire. He shall make the deep sea to boil as a pot, and shall make it as when ointments boil. A path shall shine after him, he shall esteem the deep as growing old. There is nothing upon earth like to him, who was made to fear no one. He beholdeth every high thing, he is king over all the children of pride. Indeed, I will cast you down from the pinnacle of your pride, and I will cast you down swiftly, according to the words of the Apostle: 'And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet speedily' (Rom. XVI, 20); so that the dragon may be crushed and cast down, and the fishes of that river may also be cast down, and the author of crimes may fall, who once thought himself to stand and to travel throughout the whole world. Let him fall upon the face of his own land, to which he was precipitated from heaven, so that he may by no means be gathered any longer in the Churches of heretics, neither be assembled nor buried among those who have believed in him, since they have been freed from him, but let him be given to be devoured by the beasts of the earth and the birds of the air. Regarding the beasts, it is written: 'Do not deliver the soul confessing to you to the beasts' (Psalm 73:19). And concerning the birds of the air, which eat the seed by the roadside and are interpreted to be the devils by the Savior (Matthew 13). For not only the prince of evil, but also his disciples are called devils, as it is said of Judas: 'Have I not chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?' (John 6:71). And the birds of the air are called the heavens, because they promise themselves lofty things, so that after the dragon is cast down with his fish and delivered to be devoured by the beasts of the earth, which have no gentleness in themselves, and by those who are carried about by every wind of doctrine (Ephesians 4), then all the inhabitants of this world shall understand that he is the Lord. But the reason for punishments is that the house of Israel sought aid in vain and there was for them a rod, or a reed staff, empty and devoid of anything fullness, because it could not say: But of His fullness we all have received (John 1:16); since the Scripture commands: You shall not appear before the sight of the Lord your God empty or devoid (Exodus 23:15). And the Scripture elsewhere testifies that we should not seek aid from Egypt: Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help (Isaiah 31:1). He taunts Hezekiah, the king of Judah, with a reed staff, mocking his trust in it, saying that it is broken and useless against Egypt. He warns that whoever relies on it will fall into his power. This is what Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, does to all who trust in him (Isa. 36:6). He falsely accuses the righteous king, who is symbolized by the staff, of being a drunkard. Hezekiah was deceived by the golden cup of Babylon and used his own possessions to appease the people who praised the Lord. But here the pharaoh is reproached because the house of Israel trusted in a rod or staff made of reed, which promised them empty and fragile assistance that would quickly be broken. However, in order to understand what the rod made of reed is, on which the house of Israel should not trust, we can understand the opposite by means of the rod and staff of the Lord, of which it is said to the Lord, 'Your rod and your staff, they have comforted me.' (Psalm 23:4). Aaron also had this staff, which devoured the Egyptian dragons, and when he struck the banks of the Nile, gnats were generated in all of Egypt. Moses also, according to the Septuagint, extended this staff and raised it to the sky, and the Lord brought a south wind upon the land all that day and all that night, and in the morning the wind lifted and brought locusts upon all the land of Egypt. I think that this staff is also mentioned in the Book of Numbers, that it blossomed and bore almonds or almond nuts. The Apostle also had this when he said, 'What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?' (1 Corinthians 4:21) And those who celebrated the Passover held staffs in their hands, without which they could not eat the flesh of the lamb, which sustains the weakness of the human body. This is the rod from the root of Jesse, upon which the seven spirits rested. But it is not like the rod of Pharaoh, nor the Egyptian staff, nor the reed staff that deceives those who hold it, and tears their shoulders, that is, their strength." } And whoever relies on it, their loins are weakened and they cannot stand, nor can they celebrate the Passover with their loins girded. This applies to those whose hearts and kidneys are searched by God.

<h2 id='tocuniq283'>(Vers. 8 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 8 onwards) 347 Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will bring a sword upon you and cut off from you man and beast. And the land of Egypt shall become a desolation (or a waste) and a wilderness. Then they will know that I am the Lord, because they said (or you said), 'The Nile is mine, and I made it' (or 'The rivers are mine, and I made them'). Therefore, behold, I am against you and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste, devastated by the sword, from Migdol to Syene (or from Migdol to Syene and even to the border of Ethiopia). The foot of man shall not pass through it, and the foot of beast shall not tread in it: and it shall be uninhabited forty years. And I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste in the midst of the countries that are waste, and her cities among the cities that are desolate shall be laid waste forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. For thus saith the Lord God: After the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians together from the people among whom they had been scattered. And I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and I will settle them in the land of Phatures, in the land of their birth (or in the land from which they were taken). And they will be there in a humble kingdom (or principality), among the other kingdoms it will be the humblest (or most humble). And they will no longer be exalted above the nations, and I will diminish them, so that they do not rule over the nations (or so that they are not many among the nations). Nor will they be a confidence (or in hope) to the house of Israel, teaching iniquity, to escap and pursue them (or to bring them to the remembrance of iniquity, to pursue them). And they will know that I am the Lord God. You were a reed staff to the house of Israel, and not only were you broken in his hand, but according to Isaiah (Isa. XXXVI), you pierced his hand and now lacerated his shoulder, and you yourself were shattered, and you dissolved the loins of those who relied on you: therefore I will bring a sword of enemies upon you, and I will devastate both men and animals, and the land of Egypt will be reduced to desolation, and the Egyptians will know for a second time that I am the Lord. I will not be satisfied with this end; but because he burst forth into such blasphemy, claiming that the rivers and all the abundance of Egypt were his own, therefore I will take away even him who claimed to be the Creator, and the rivers that he boasted were created by him, and I will reduce the land of Egypt to a vast wilderness, destroyed by the sword, from the tower of Syene to the borders of Ethiopia. For the tower which is called Magdal () in Hebrew, the LXX assigned the name, so that they would write Μαγδαλὸν. However, the tower of Syene remains to this day, a fortress under Roman rule, where the cataracts of the Nile are located, and it is the furthest point navigable from our sea. He says that the whole of Egypt should be depopulated as far as the borders of Ethiopia, where the furthest region of Egypt is joined, so that no foreigner may enter Egypt, and no animals are found there, and it is not inhabited for forty years. However, they spare the Egyptians, and because Israel once had been guests, the punishment is for a shorter period of time. Tyrus kept its Sabbaths for seventy years, and thus it was restored to its ancient state. The captivity of Judaea and the destruction of the temple lasted for seventy years until the reign of Cyrus, the king of Persia. For the mighty will endure mighty torments (Wisdom 6:7). And when it says, 'I will make the land of Egypt desolate among desolate lands,' it refers to the Palestinians, the Edomites, the Moabites, and all the other regions against which the prophecy of the prophets above stands. Then he will scatter or spread the Egyptians into nations, and he will scatter them into lands. For the Lord is merciful and compassionate, patient and full of mercy. After forty years, the restoration of Egypt will occur, and all the captivity will be brought back to its original land and placed in the metropolis city called Phatures, where it originated and where it came from. However, in order to benefit themselves, they will lose their ancient pride and become a humble kingdom, even the humblest of all nations. They will no longer rise above other nations or have dominion over them; instead, they will be reduced in number and not deceive the house of Israel with their confidence, nor teach them iniquity or remind them of their iniquities when they sought help from Egypt after abandoning the assistance of God. And all these things will happen so that the Egyptians may know on the third day that He is the Lord. We have briefly touched on these matters, laying the foundations of the story. Now it is necessary to expound on the allegory, and we will attempt to avoid lengthening the explanation with the same brevity. The speech is directed at the dragon, who had said, 'The rivers are mine, and I have made them' (Supra, eod.): which indicates that the Lord Himself will bring a sword upon him, concerning which it is written in Isaiah: 'My sword is drunk in heaven; now it will descend upon the earth to destroy both man and beast from it' (Isa. XXXIV, 5), whatever appears to have either reason or simplicity. And it will destroy, not absolutely, but the dragon, so that the dragons may perish and may live in God, and let the land of Egypt become a ruin, according to the higher sense, so that the dragon may perish, and after its destruction be reduced to desolation, ceasing to have the worst possible guest. And then men and animals will know, and the earth will be scattered, that He is the Lord: in the sense in which it is written in the seventy-seventh Psalm: When He slew them, then they sought Him (Ps. 77:34). For whoever seeks, finds. It is indeed a mercy of God that the abundance of this world perishes, and the streams of Egypt are dried up, nay, that their land becomes a wilderness, and the plan of the Lord is scattered from the tower of Syene, which means a circle, so that it may have nothing in it that is right, even to the land of the Ethiopians, who are called humble, so that all pride that has exalted itself against the knowledge of God may be destroyed, and humbled unto its salvation. Neither the foot of man, which is a rational being, may pass through Egypt, nor may the foot of an animal tread upon it, so that it may not even hold the innocent ones whom Pharaoh desired to retain in Egypt after the people were dismissed, with Moses opposing him and desiring that the animals too be liberated from Egyptian captivity. And, He said, 'They shall not dwell there for forty years,' which number always represents affliction and punishment. Therefore, both Moses and Elijah, and even the Savior Himself, fasted for forty days and nights, and the people spent forty years in the wilderness, so that they might later be circumcised in Gilgal and be delivered from the reproach and ignominy of Egypt. In the sacrament of this number, and the same prophet here, for the tribe of Judah, sleeps for forty days on the right side, and it is announced that the people will serve in Egypt for four hundred years (Gen. VII): those who make forty centuries, or four centurias. Rainstorms also flood the world for forty days. For it was just that the one who offends God by loving and nurturing the four elements of the world, by which all things are said to consist, should be punished in that very number: and Israel, who sinned on the Sabbath, endured a punishment of seven decades, that is, seventy years. And the land of Egypt will be given and its deserts, and its cities in the midst of the land and the cities that have been destroyed, which are not built of stones but of mud and straw, so that Egypt, which had been wrongly joined together, may be scattered and blown away into the lands, and the grain may be separated from the straw, and when the forty years are completed, there will be the restoration of Egypt, and its captivity will be brought back, and it will be placed in the land of Phatures, which means trampled bread; where that bread which said, 'I am the bread which came down from heaven' (John 6:5), was trampled by heretical wickedness: so that when they come to the Church, they may dwell in trampled bread, and may not be lifted up in pride, but may be in a humble kingdom. And so, even when they are restored to their original state, they humble themselves through humility, because they have lived in Egypt and built brick cities, and among many kingdoms they are humble to the Church, and they know against whom they have sinned, and Egypt shall no longer rise above the Churches divided throughout the world, but it shall be reduced to few, and only a few shall remain among the nations, according to what is written: Give them, O Lord. What will you give them? Give them a barren womb, and dry breasts (Hosea 9:4): so that they may not rejoice and exult in the multitude of the deceived, but be reduced to few: For many are called, but few are chosen (Matthew 20). And let them no longer deceive the house of Israel, that is, the Church; nor promise them vain hope and confidence, teaching iniquity, so that they may escape Ecclesiastical discipline and follow Egyptian pleasures. But these things will happen so that the Egyptians may know on the third day that He is the Lord. This seems to me to be said for this reason: the first knowledge of the Egyptians is in the flesh, the second in the soul, and the third in the spirit. First, on the earth, second, after the conversation of this world is finished, third, after the resurrection.

<h2 id='tocuniq284'>(Vers. 17 seq.)</h2>

(Vers. 17 seq.)  351 And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was rubbed bare, and there was no wages given to him, nor to his army, for the service that he served against it. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will give Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, the land of Egypt, and he shall carry off its multitude, and plunder its spoil, and take its prey; and it shall be the wages for his army. I have given him the land of Egypt as his payment for which he served me, declares the Lord God. In that day I will cause a horn to sprout for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth in the midst of them. And they shall know that I am the Lord. It is asked how, after ten years from the previous discourse, immediately the twenty-seventh year is mentioned, and in the following, the tenth and twelfth, and in the final description of the temple, the twenty-fifth. But the solution is simple. For since it covers both Egypt and the superior part, and what is now called prophecy, although it is made at different times, it is united because it prophesies about one province. And as we frequently read in Jeremiah, the order of events is described in a reverse order. For the deeds of Zedekiah are reported first, and then those of Jehoiachin who came before him. But in the Psalms, because it is a lyric poem, the order of the events is not sought. Let us therefore speak first according to the literal interpretation. When Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre, and because it was surrounded by the sea, he could not bring rams, machines, and siege towers close to the walls, he ordered an infinite multitude of the army to bring stones and earthworks, and with the middle of the sea filled, indeed with the narrowest strait, he made the adjacent shore into a continuous island (or, neighboring shore into a connected one). When the Tyrians saw that the city was now completely finished and that the foundations of the walls were being shaken by the battering ram, they loaded onto ships whatever precious things the nobility had in gold, silver, clothing, and various furnishings, and carried them to the islands, so that when the city was captured, Nebuchadnezzar found nothing worthy of his efforts. And because he had obeyed God's will in this matter, after several years of Tyrian captivity, Egypt was given to him, and Tyre was much more cruel to Egypt. For she was besieging Jerusalem; this one was making empty promises of help. For it is one thing to deceive weakness with hope, and another to fight against the people of God. This is therefore what Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, says: in the siege of Tyre he made his army serve me, so that I might fulfill my will: Every head is shaved, and every shoulder is depilated, carrying loads of earth, and stones with which shoulders are shaved, and the head is shaved; and yet neither he nor his army found anything worthy in Tyre. And when he has served me in this, and fulfilled my will against Tyre, therefore I will give him the land of Egypt. Some say that this was accomplished under Nebuchadnezzar: others under Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, who devastated Egypt up to Ethiopia, so that he killed Apis and destroyed all their idols. For this reason, they think that he was turned into madness by the accident of a horse, and stabbed himself with his own dagger. Herodotus narrates this story in great detail: where all of Egypt is described by towns, castles, and villages, and the origin of the Nile and the nation of its people, and the measurement of the land around to the desert of Ethiopia, and the shores of the Great Sea, and the borders of Libya and Arabia. But the cause of the Lord's anger against Egypt is that it deceived His people and prevented them from hoping in God, and it provoked Him to anger. On that day when Egypt is captured, the horn of the house of Israel will sprout: undoubtedly symbolizing the royal lineage. Some refer this to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, who was descended from the Davidic line through Jeconiah, while others refer it to the final times, when they think that Elijah will come. But we, understanding the horn of the Lord to be Christ, take hold of the present story. And when, he says, this has first been fulfilled, then your mouth will be opened, and your prophecy will hang not on doubtful promise, but will be seen accomplished by the work: so that all who hear may know that I am the Lord, whose words have been spoken and actions performed. These things have been said according to the letter, indeed, according to the truth of the prophecies. Furthermore, from the fact that Nebuchadnezzar received a reward for good work, we also understand that even the Gentiles, if they do something good, are not overlooked by God's judgment without a reward. Therefore, through Jeremiah, Nebuchadnezzar is called the dove of God because he served the will of the sinful people of God. And he says, 'I will bring my servant Nebuchadnezzar' (Jeremiah 25). From this it is clear that we are condemned in comparison to the Gentiles, if they do the natural law, which we also neglect the written law. About which Paul the apostle disputes extensively with the Romans. And lest we seem to pass over anything according to spiritual understanding, we ask where we may read this number, that is, the twenty-seventh. In the book of Genesis, Scripture testifies (Gen. VII) that in the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the waters of the flood were brought upon the face of the earth, and after the seventh month of the same year, which is close to the sabbath, and on the twenty-seventh day of the same seventh month, the waters of the flood ceased, and Noah's ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat, which are interpreted as Armenia. From this we understand that the number is intermediate and can be applied to both, since in this both the anger of God begins with the flood, and his mercy is demonstrated in the seventh month in the same number of days. And because among the Hebrews the month, which among us is counted by the Kalends, Nones, and Ides, is calculated according to the course of the moon: hence also in the Greek word μήνη, that is, moon, has received its name from the month, it is said on the twenty-seventh day of the moon that a little of its light remains, so that his anger may not be without mercy. But when the entire orbit of the moon is completed, then Easter and all the greatest solemnities are celebrated. We have laid it down precisely so that we may know that in this number, both good and evil are equally contained. Good for Nebuchadnezzar, whose labor is rewarded; evil for the Egyptians, whose destruction is announced.

<h2 id='tocuniq285'>(Cap. XXX.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter XXX—Verse 1 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, prophesy and say: Thus says the Lord God: Wail, woe to the day! For the day is near, even the day of the Lord is near, a day of clouds, it will be the time of the nations. And the sword will come upon Egypt, and there will be panic in Ethiopia when the slain fall in Egypt, and its multitude is taken away, and its foundations are destroyed. Ethiopia, Libya, Lydia, and all the mixed people, and Chub, and the sons of the land of the covenant with them will fall by the sword. Thus says the Lord God: The supports of Egypt will fall, and the pride of its power will be destroyed. From the tower of Syene they will fall by the sword, says the Lord of hosts. They will be scattered in the midst of desolate lands, and its cities will become deserted. And they will know that I am the Lord when I set fire to Egypt and all its helpers are crushed. On that day messengers will go out from me in ships to terrify the confidence of Cush, and there will be panic among them on the day of Egypt's fall, for it is certain to come. Thus says the Lord God: And I will cause the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon: he and his people with him, the strongest of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land. And they shall unsheath their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain. And I will make the rivers dry, and deliver the land into the hand of wicked men, and will scatter the land and its abundance into the hands of strangers: I the Lord have spoken. Thus says the Lord God: I will destroy the idols and put an end to the idols of Memphis, and there will no longer be a leader in the land of Egypt, and I will bring terror to the land of Egypt. I will destroy the land of Pathros and set fire to Taphnis, and I will bring judgments upon Alexandria, and I will pour out my fury upon Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt, and I will kill the multitude of Alexandria, and I will set fire to Egypt. Like a woman in labor, Pelusium will mourn, and Alexandria will be laid waste, and there will be daily distress in Memphis. The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastis will fall by the sword, and the captives themselves will be led away. And in Taphnis the day will darken when I shatter the scepters of Egypt, and the pride of its power will fail in it. The cloud will cover it, and its daughters will be led into captivity. And I will execute judgments in Egypt, and they will know that I am the Lord. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, prophesy and say: Thus says the Lord God: O day, behold, it is near, and the day of the Lord is close; a day of clouds, the end of the nations. And a sword will come upon the Egyptians, and there will be turmoil in Ethiopia. And the wounded will fall in Egypt, and they will take away its multitude, and its foundations will be cut down. Persians, and Cretans, and Lydians, and Libyans, and all who are mixed, and the sons of my covenant will fall by the sword. Thus says the Lord God. And the pillars of Egypt will fall, and the pride of its strength will come down from Migdol to Syene. They will fall by the sword in it, says the Lord God. And it shall be desolate in the midst of desolate regions, and its cities shall be in the midst of deserted cities, and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I set fire to Egypt, and all who help her are broken. In that day there shall go forth messengers from before my face in haste, to destroy the hope of Ethiopia, and there shall be consternation among them in the day of Egypt, for it is coming. Thus says the Lord God. And I will destroy the multitude of the Egyptians by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon himself, and his people with him, pestilences that come from the nations to destroy the land. And they shall unsheathe all their swords against Egypt, and the land shall be filled with the wounded. And I will make their rivers dry, and I will deliver the land into the hand of the wicked, and I will destroy the land, and its fullness will be in the hands of foreigners: I the Lord have spoken. For thus saith the Lord God: And I will destroy abominations, and I will cause the nobles of Memphis to fail, and the princes of the land of Egypt, and they shall be no more. And I will bring terror upon the land of Egypt, and I will destroy the land of Pathros, and I will bring fire upon Zoan, and I will execute judgments in Thebes, and I will pour out my wrath upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt, and I will destroy the multitude of No. And I will send fire upon Egypt, and Sais shall be in great anguish, and there shall be a split in Diospolis, and the waters shall be scattered. The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastis shall fall by the sword, and the women shall be taken captive, and in Taphnis the day shall become dark, when I break the scepters of Egypt there, and the pride of its strength shall come to an end, and a cloud shall cover it, and its daughters shall be led away captive, and I will execute judgments on Egypt, and they shall know that I am the Lord. After the twenty-seventh year of the captivity of King Joachim, we return to the present time when he began prophesying against Egypt, that is, in the tenth year and tenth month, on the eleventh day of the month. And the Lord commanded him to speak to all nations, especially to Egypt. What, therefore, does he say? Wail, alas, alas for the day, for the day of the Lord is near; it is approaching like a storm, not with bright shining sun, but with clouds covering it, and bringing a tempest upon Babylon. And when the sword begins to devastate Egypt, there will be panic in Ethiopia, which is near Egypt, lest the Babylonian blade reach even to them. For the wounded will fall in Egypt, and its multitude will be taken away, and everything will be destroyed to its foundations, so that if anyone is found in Egypt from Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and in general from various peoples and from Chub, which Symmachus translates as Arabia, and from the sons of the land of the covenant, that is, from the people of Judah, they will fall by that sword. For which nations, seventy were set, Persians, and Cretans, and Lydians, and Libyans, and all mixed people, and the sons of my Testament, they shall fall by the sword. And that we may know that all these nations were in aid to Egypt, the following discourse demonstrates: And those who supported Egypt shall fall, that is, her allies, and all the pride of her empire, or the insult of her strength shall be destroyed and cast down from the tower of Syene, which we said is situated in the farthest borders of Egypt, from Magdalo to Syene, as the seventy have translated: all the cities of Egypt shall be deserted, that they may acknowledge the Lord, when the fire of the Chaldeans has devastated all, and all its helpers are crushed, and messengers arrive according to the Aquila and Theodotion (whom Symmachus translated), hastening: we have turned to the triremes; for thus we have learned from the Hebrews: that all the confidence of Ethiopia may be shattered, and when the neighboring province has been laid waste, fear may seize the closest. But in order to know who this sword was, which devastated Egypt and terrified Ethiopia, it follows more clearly: And I will make the multitude of Egypt cease in the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will not only come, but will come with many accompanying nations, so that all Egypt will be filled with the blood of the slain, and the anger of the Lord will be so great that the channels of the rivers, that is, the canals of the Nile, will dry up to the ground, and in the hand of the pests, or the fullness of the worst men, Egypt will be deserted. For my words cannot be in vain, and therefore indignation will advance there, so that the images of Egypt are scattered, and the idols of Memphis cease, which until now is the metropolis of Egyptian superstition, whether the nobles and leaders of Memphis, and of the land of Egypt. But such terror will possess all of Egypt, that the whole land of Phatur will perish, and fire will ravage Taphnis, or as the Seventy have translated, Tanin. And he said, I will make judgments in Alexandria, which is called so today. However, it has the ancient name of No, which Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotio translated as it is written in Hebrew. For this reason, I do not know what the Seventy translators, also known as the Septuagint, intended and said the small city of Diospolis, which is in Egypt, instead of No. But we have chosen Alexandria for No, by anticipation, which is called 'πρόληψις' in Greek, according to that Virgilian verse (Aeneid. book IV):

And Lavinia came to the shores; not at the time when Aeneas came to Latium, they were called Lavinia; but those which were afterwards called Lavinia, in order to make the location more apparent to the understanding of the reader. And I will pour out, he says, my indignation upon Sain, which we turn into Pelusium, and it is called the strength of Egypt, because it has the safest port, and sea trade is especially carried on there. Hence the poet calls it Pelusiac lentil (Virgil. I Georg.), not because this type of legume is produced there, or especially so; but because it is brought there most abundantly from Thebaid and all of Egypt through the stream of the Nile. And he said, 'I will destroy the multitude of Alexandria, which is again placed in Hebrew No, not in Diospolis, as mentioned above, but in Memphis, they transferred to the LXX. And to show that the city was populous at that time, 'I will destroy the multitude of No (); and I will give fire, that is, the king of Babylon in Egypt, who will devastate everything like fire. Sain, that is, Pelusium, will suffer like a woman in labor: or will be disturbed by turmoil; and in Alexandria, that is, in No, there will be a fissure, and the waters will be dispersed, for which they transferred to Diospolis again, the LXX. However, it is the custom of the Egyptians, because of the flooding of the Nile, to build high embankments along the banks of the Nile. If these embankments are breached due to the negligence of the guards or the excessive size of the water, the surrounding fields are not irrigated by water, but rather they are overwhelmed and devastated. By this it is signified how Egypt is usually occupied by the Chaldean army, just as it is accustomed to be covered and corrupted when the waters of the Nile overflow and increase beyond measure. Concerning the flooding of the waters, and the breaking and breach of the embankments, it is written in Hebrew: 'There shall be daily distress in Memphis, where the Nile is divided, and where the temple of Apis is, and where the oracles give their answers, there shall daily distresses arise. The young men also of Heliopolis, which in Hebrew is called On, and of Bubastus another city, shall fall by the sword: so that the cities themselves, that is, their inhabitants or women, shall be led into captivity, who are of the female sex and subject to injury.' But in Taphnis, which is the royal city, the scepters of Egypt, that is, the entire royal race, will be crushed. And when its power, with the princes slain, shall have failed, then the day shall grow dark, and all things shall be filled with gloom and darkness, so that the city itself shall be covered with a cloud of mourning and lamentation, and its daughters, that is, the remaining towns, shall be led into captivity. So after I have executed judgments in Egypt and shown myself to be the judge to all, then the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord. We have described these elements as if for little children, so that they may progress to the reading of prose or poetry through letters, syllables, words, and the arrangement of words. Now let us venture into anthropology, and in a brief, almost pictorial manner, let us demonstrate the widest ocean of discussion. The speech of the Lord, who was always in the Father, became that of a prophet, and He called Himself not by His own name, but the Son of Man. This is always understood in a positive sense in the Holy Scriptures, only in the singular number, as in this same prophet, and in Daniel, and in the Gospel. Moreover, in the plural number it is read in the opposite way, as in this: Sons of men, their teeth are weapons and arrows, and their tongue is a sharp sword (Psalm 56:5). And again: Sons of men, how long will you have a heavy heart? (Psalm 4:3). For the lion will roar, and who will not fear? The Lord has spoken, and who will not prophesy? (Amos 3:8). Howl, they say, woe, woe to the day because it is near, and it comes, says the Lord, a day of clouds, a time or end of nations it will be. Duplex consummation is either general of all, when the end comes, or specific of each, when the time of death arrives. It is called duplex because, in comparison to eternity, all time is short. Hence Jacob said that his 130 years are few and evil days. And the Psalmist, speaking of the fragility of the whole human race, says: Our days have passed away like a shadow. Considering this, we will not be lifted up by power, nor will we dwell on riches, nor will we rejoice in happiness, knowing that everything must quickly be taken away. And the day of the Lord is said to be beautiful, when the whole conversation of the world will be destroyed, and with error removed, truth will appear as one, and the days of clouds and fog. For no one fearless and uncertain waits for the judgment from the judge without fear. And the time or end of the nations will not be of one Egyptian nation, but of all, so that it may be clearly foretold about all the nations. Following, there will come to Egypt a sword, a fiery versatile sword, the divine word that separates the good from the evil and consumes the wicked with its fire. But in Egypt of this age, it will be a terror, like in Ethiopia, where they wander through Egypt in the darkness of error and stay in the shadows, and their darkness does not easily or at all turn into light. And those who stood in wickedness will fall wounded in Egypt. And the multitude of Egypt shall be taken away. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction (Matthew 7:13). And its foundations shall be destroyed, so that nothing of the former stability remains in Egypt. But let the worst foundations be abandoned, and let the foundation of Christ be laid upon which the Church shall be built. For every plantation which the Heavenly Father has not planted shall be uprooted (Matthew 7). Therefore, Jeremiah is commanded to destroy what has been built, in order to build better things (Jeremiah 1). The Ethiopians, Libyans, and Lydians will also perish in Egypt, or according to the Septuagint, the Persians, Cretans, Lydians, Libyans, and Chub, that is, the Arabs, and all the remaining common people whom the Seventy translated as hybrids and mixtures. All of these, depending on the variety of vices and the interpretation of names that we have set forth in the vision of Tyre, we can understand as different nations. Hence, the Apostle says: You, he says, gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision (Ephesians 2:11). For he never would have spoken of nations in the flesh, unless there were others in the spirit, as in another place: Behold Israel according to the flesh. Therefore, great care must be taken that we do not turn back in our hearts to Egypt, from which we once came out, and that we do not find ourselves among other nations; and that we do not perish by the sword, about which it is said in the following: The youths of Heliopolis and Bubastis shall fall by the sword, especially when the sons of the land of the covenant, or of my Testament, shall be struck with the sword at the same time, of whom it is written: Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help and rely on horses and chariots  (Isaiah 31:1). But if the men of other nations are slaughtered in Egypt, how much more the sons of the land of the covenant and Testament of God, who, despising the bread of angels, have remembered the pumpkins, and onions, and garlic, and shallots, and cucumbers of Egypt (Num. 11). Then the supports and props of Egypt, which sustained it in wickedness, will collapse, the subtleties of the dialecticians and the sophistries of the philosophers. Also, the contemptuous and proud empire will be destroyed, those who speak about everything with arrogance and consider Ecclesiastical simplicity as nothing. For indeed, towers fall in those places which are at the extreme boundaries of Egypt, near Syene, Ethiopia, and the Blemmyae: where the Nile is unnavigable, and there is the roar of cataracts, and everything is impassable and full of serpents and venomous animals. But if, as we said above, Magnesia signifies magnificence, and Syene signifies a round course, it is clear that the resources of Egypt, and its insolent strength and magnificence, that is, its boasting and exaltations, will perish by violence as far as the round course of Egypt, where nothing is stable; but it is swept away by an uncertain fall, and comes to ruin. Then the cities of Egypt will be scattered and the land will be deserted, and no assembly will remain, having any stability, so that they may know at the end of things that He himself is the Lord, when He sends fire into Egypt, which the Lord desires to burn, like hay, wood, and straw, which are built upon the foundation of Christ, and all the helpers of perverse doctrines are crushed. From this it is to be understood that the knowledge of false name and those about whom it is written: Scatter the nations that want war (Ps. LXVII, 32), are called allies and helpers of Egypt. In that day, says he, those messengers shall go forth from the face of God, of whom it is written in the Gospel: Their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven (Matt. XVIII, 20). And in the parable of the seed, the reapers are the angels, that is, those who are messengers, are sent to gather together all scandals and cast them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth (Ibid. XIII). And they will hasten to fulfill the commandment, to deter or crush the confidence of Ethiopia, who have reached the summit of malice, so that in the overthrow of Egypt Ethiopia may be crushed and may fear, because the day of the Lord is a day of vengeance and retribution, when the darkness of sins will flee and the light of virtues will remain. And I will make the multitude of Egypt cease, says the Lord, in the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to punish them. For he is an enemy and avenger who has also received payment, because he served in the conquest of Tyre, the multitude of Egypt: so that many in Egypt may cease to exist, who have always been there. But if someone opposes, how can it be said in Deuteronomy: Your fathers went down to Egypt with seventy persons: and now the Lord your God has made you as the stars of heaven in multitude (Deut. X, 22): this is easily resolved. For he did not set forth an example of an earthly multitude, but of a heavenly one, which shines with virtues and is full of light, above which multitude the mightiest of nations are brought, so that they might disperse the land, for whom the Seventy render a pestilent interpretation. I do not know how this agrees with those who are brought by the Lord, unless perhaps according to that example, the sending forth through wicked Angels (Psalm 77:19): who shall unsheath their swords upon Egypt, and shall fill the land with the slain or wounded, so that they may perceive themselves to have killed and wounded, and to such an extent Egypt is destroyed and reduced to nothing, that all the rivers of eloquence with which the errors of the Egyptians were watered, the reed and the calamus, may dry up, and be handed over into the hand of the wicked, who may torture them, and the fullness of the land of Egypt, which had grown in evil, may be destroyed in the hand of foreign gods. For it is not the good, but the evil angels who are put in charge of torments. This is necessary for them to know, because the Lord has spoken. And this is often assumed, so that those who hear may know that these are not the words of prophets, but of the Lord, whose commandments cannot be in vain. It follows: And I will destroy the idols, which are abominations. The Septuagint translates: And I will cause the idols or the nobles of Memphis to cease, and the leader or prince in the land of Egypt will be no more. For it is the very nature of the most merciful Lord to overthrow false things, so that no likeness which falsely imitates the image of truth remains in Egypt: let the nobles of Memphis also perish, which is interpreted 'from the mouth'; of which they have made all the idols, so that without heads and masters of idols, there may be no ruler in Egypt, and all Egypt may be filled with terror and destruction. Concerning its cities it is said: 'And I will destroy the land of Pathros, and I will give fire in Taphnes, or in Tanis, and I will execute judgments in No, which the Seventy translated as Diospolis; and I will pour out my indignation upon Pelusium, the strength of Egypt.' Phatures is interpreted as the trampling of bread; Taphnis, the humble commandment; Diospolis, for which it is written in Hebrew, rest. Sain, temptation: by which names the various assemblies of heretics and all the gatherings of lies are shown. They trample on the ecclesiastical bread and despise it, and they follow the humble commandment, which does not lead to heavenly things, and they indulge in pleasures, and they are at rest; such as we read in the Gospel of the rich purple-clad man (Luke 10); and they serve the tempters, of whom one sought from the Lord the power to tempt Job. The Lord will destroy and burn all these things, and pour out His wrath upon them, and He will scatter the strength of Egypt, so that, reduced to nothingness, they may in no way trouble the people of God, and make them rely on their own help; so that, forsaking the truth, they may seek falsehood, and with their own weak support, be wounded like a reed staff. After this, it is said: And I will destroy or scatter the multitude of Mempheos, which in Hebrew is called No, as translated above by the same Seventy interpreters as Diospolis, which means rest. For there are many who seek rest, and they want to lie on ivory beds and eat suckling lambs. Or according to the Seventy, who are translated as Mempheos, there are many who speak with futile words: Remove that speck from your eye, when they themselves have a beam in theirs. And there is a fire given in Egypt, which consumes vain talk and pleasures with its burning. The whole temptation will grieve, and in Diospolis, which is not mentioned again in Hebrew, there will be a division; so that the waters may be poured out and every evil assembly may be scattered, and may perish here and there. In Memphis, there will be daily distresses according to the Hebrew, in order to render an account for every idle word, so that they understand that nothing of their Lord's judgment will pass by. The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastus will also fall by the sword. Heliopolis is called On in Hebrew, which means pain. But Bubastus, according to the Egyptian language, is a test of speech. All those who could not bear the pain of the world, but pursued the pleasures of Diospolis, and trusted in the volubility of words, disputing against other doctrines, had the experiences of victory. The sword of God's word will cut them down, and those who are called not young men, but weak-minded women, will be led captive. Or the cities themselves, boasting of their pain and mouths, will be led into captivity. And in Taphnis, he says, the day will turn black. Taphnis is interpreted as yielding to the mouth, and the devil is understood: those who yield to him will lose the light of truth, and they will change day into night, and they will perceive that the scepters of Egypt and all its power have been shattered in Taphnis, so that its contemptible strength or the pride of its power will fail, and the rays of the sun of justice will be obscured in the cloud, and it will not be women but daughters who will be led into captivity; and may the Lord not bring just one judgment, but many judgments upon Egypt. For just as there are many dwelling places for the blessed with the Father, so too there are diverse judgments of punishments for the Egyptians, so that when all these things have happened, the Egyptians may know that He Himself is the Lord, whose judgments are true and justified in themselves.

<h2 id='tocuniq286'>(Vers. 20 seq.)</h2>

(Verse 20 and following) And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month (the Vulgate adds 'month'), on the seventh day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and behold, it is not bound up, to be healed, and to be wrapped with bandages, or to be strengthened with liniments (or to be given a plaster); so that it could hold the sword. Therefore thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and I will break his strong arms, and that which is broken (or the strong arms that are in place), and I will cause the sword to fall from his hand, and I will scatter (or disperse) Egypt among the nations, and I will disperse them (or scatter them) through the lands (the Vulgate adds 'lands'). And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and I will put my sword in his hand, and I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and they will groan with the groaning of those who are slain before his face (or as it is in the Septuagint: And he will bring the sword upon Egypt, and he will plunder its spoil, and he will take its plunder. It follows): And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh will fall: and they will know that I am the Lord, when I give my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he stretches it out upon the land of Egypt, and I will scatter (Vulgate: destroy) Egypt among the nations, and disperse them into the lands, and they will know that I am the Lord. He returns to the order of the prophecies; for after the twenty-seventh year, he now sets down the eleventh. This question is also contained in the preceding [psalms]. For when the word of the Lord was spoken against Tyre in the eleventh year, which came before, in the following [psalms] he speaks to Pharaoh in the tenth year; and again he sets down the twenty-seventh year, as we have said, and now the eleventh. Let me pass over the other things that are contained in the order of the psalms. It is asked, how the third psalm is placed before these psalms, in which David changed his appearance before Abimelech and about Doeg the Edomite, and when he was found in the cave, and the fiftieth of repentance, in the title of which it is shown that he entered in to Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, while the previous [psalms] are earlier than the third, in which it is noted that he fled from the face of his son Absalom. But in the Psalms the answer is easy, for it is a lyric poem, and in such a work the order of history is not sought; but rather the songs of individual events. However, in history it must be said that those things which are said about one thing at different times should not be divided by speech, but concluded by a narrative of one place. For example, so that those things said about Egypt at one time and another may be understood in the order of reading. When we have said these things, nevertheless the question remains: Why in this same place was the speech of the Lord to Pharaoh first made in the eleventh year, and afterward in the twenty-seventh year, and then in the tenth year, when surely according to the order, the eleventh year should have been marked first, the twenty-seventh year second, and the tenth year third, in each prophecy. To this we can respond: Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! (Rom. 11:33). And in another place: Who can plumb the depths of wisdom? (Sirach 1:2, 3). But we can say this, that even in the Prophets, the order of history is not always observed, at least not in all cases. For they do not narrate the past, but rather they foretell the future according to the will of the Holy Spirit. But in history, as there are the five books of Moses, and Joshua, and the volumes of the Judges, as well as Ruth and Esther, Samuel and the Books of Kings, the Book of Chronicles and Ezra, along with Nehemiah, there is no disordered narration to be found. This is sufficient to say about the order of years. Now let us see what is the prophecy against Pharaoh or about Pharaoh. It is said that his arm is broken, and it is not wrapped or bound, nor is it healed with ointment, according to what is written: 'It is not fitting to apply ointment, nor oil, nor bandages' (Isa. 1, LXX). But if it had happened that, with strength regained, he could hold the sword and advance to war. Therefore, God, who is kind and merciful, once again shattered his arm or arms so that the sword would completely fall from his hand and be scattered among the peoples of Egypt and blown away by the wind. But in your arm, take strength and courage, as the Scripture says: Break the arm of the sinner and the evil one (Psalm 9:15). What is broken in our adversaries, when they pursue us, they are unable to overcome. And for the salvation of the servants of God against Pharaoh, the King of Babylon often rises up to oppress the powerful with a more powerful one, and the wicked are handed over to the more wicked, with God strengthening the arms of the worst, so that he who is freed may know that he himself is the Lord. And it is profitable for virtue to know that he himself is the Lord. On the other hand, we can say: The sons of Eli, the sons of pestilence, not knowing God (1 Samuel 2:22). And concerning the kings who have done right in the sight of God, it is written that they may know the Lord. However, that which is said in the Septuagint, 'And I will break his strong and ordered arms,' which in Greek is said 'τεταγμένα,' has been corrupted by the error of the scribes. For they interpreted it not as 'τεταγμένα,' but as 'τεταμένα,' which means not ordered, but extended. For this reason, according to their custom, other interpreters have rendered it as 'exalted.'

<h2 id='tocuniq287'>Book Ten</h2>

Book Ten

I wish, as I have already said, to explain the prophecies against a single province or a single king in the same books and not at all to divide the meaning of the reader. But what shall I do with the length, which, unless it is divided into parts, exceeds the measure of a volume; and an infinite mass, as troublesome to the speaker as to the listener? Therefore, after the discourse against Egypt and its lamentation, and against the king of Egypt, whose arm is neither wrapped nor restored to its former health, we have said in the last part of the ninth book, we move to the beginning of the tenth book against the same Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who is compared to the king of Assyria, and after a very long prophecy, a lamentation is made about the same, and then against all of Egypt. In discussing these matters, O virgin of Christ, Eustochium, raise your hands with Moses so that the fruit of our victory may be the result of your prayers. For it is not of the one who wills or of the one who runs, but of the merciful God who speaks to the prophet: 'Open your mouth and I will fill it' (Psalm 80:11); the prophet responds to the Lord: 'I opened my mouth and drew in the breath' (Psalm 118:131); he breathes where he wills. But where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom (John 3:8; 2 Corinthians 3:17), the freedom with which the Lord has gifted us. How vainly the Jews boasted, saying: We are the seed of Abraham, and have never been in bondage to any man (John 8:33), subject to many vices and sins, and ignorant of that saying: by whom a man is overcome, of the same he is also the bond-slave (2 Peter 2:19).

<h2 id='tocuniq288'>(Cap. XXXI.)</h2>

(Chapter XXXI.) And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his people: To whom have you compared yourself in your greatness? Behold, Assyria, like a cedar in Lebanon, beautiful in its branches, thick with foliage, and towering in height; its top was among the clouds. The waters nourished him: the deep exalted him: his rivers flowed round about his roots, and he sent forth his rivulets to all the trees of the country. Therefore was his height lifted up above all the trees of the country, and his branches were multiplied, and his boughs were elevated because of many waters. And when he had spread forth his shadow, all the fowls of the air made their nests in his branches, and all the beasts of the field brought forth their young under his shadow, and a great people abode under his branches. And it was most beautiful in its size and in the spreading (or multitude) of its shrubs (or branches): for its roots were near the waters. Cedars (or Cypresses) were not taller than it in the garden of God, and firs (or pines) did not reach its height, and plane trees (or firs) were not equal (or similar) to its leaves (or branches). Every tree of the garden of God (or in the garden of God) was not compared to it in beauty and splendor, because I made it beautiful (or him), with many dense branches, and all the trees of pleasure (or delights) that were in the garden (or adding God) were jealous of it. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because it has exalted itself to the height and has set its top among the thick clouds, and its heart is proud of its height, I will deliver it into the hand of a mighty one of the nations. He shall surely deal with it as its wickedness deserves. I have cast it out for its wickedness. And strangers, the most ruthless of nations, shall cut it down and leave it. They shall cast it down to the mountains, and its branches shall fall in all the valleys, and its boughs shall be broken in all the ravines of the land, and all the peoples of the earth shall be withdrawn from its shadow and leave it behind. In its ruins dwelt (or rested) all the birds of the sky, and on its branches were all the beasts of the region. Therefore, all the wood of the waters will not be raised in its height, nor will they set their loftiness among the wooded and leafy (or in the clouds): nor will they stand in their height (or in their exaltation) all those that are watered by the waters, for all have been delivered to death to the lowest earth, in the midst of the children of men, to those who descend into the pit. Thus says the Lord God: on the day when he descended to the underworld, I declared mourning (or the depths mourned) for him; I covered him with the depths and restrained its rivers, and I held back its many waters. Lebanon was shattered (or darkened) over him, and all the trees of the field fainted (or failed). From the sound of its downfall, nations were moved (or were shaken), when I brought him (or her) down to the underworld with those who descend (or descend) into the pit; and all the choice and splendid trees of Lebanon were comforted on the infirm ground, and they were watered by the waters. For even they themselves, along with her (or with him), will descend (or have descended) into the underworld to the dead (or to the wounded) by the sword, and the arm (or the seed) of each inhabitant under her shade, perished in the midst of the nations (or of their own lives). To whom have you likened yourself, O illustrious one, and sublime among the trees of pleasure! Behold, you have been brought down with the trees of pleasure to the uttermost earth, you will sleep among the uncircumcised, with those who have been killed by the sword. So Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord God. I have mixed both editions according to custom, where they nevertheless disagreed greatly, so that the double account would not increase the magnitude of the books. And first it should be known that whatever is said about the future king of the Assyrians is mentioned in the Septuagint as if it had already happened, and thus it speaks both to the tree and to the leader of the Assyrians, so that it is understood, in both masculine and feminine gender, about one person, while the tree is referred to the Assyrian, and the Assyrian is named in the tree. And there is no mention in the present discourse of the Babylonian king, lest it seem to provoke the anger of the Chaldeans, who have placed the captive people in Chaldea, against their lords and rulers. Instead, it is said of the king of the Assyrians, who at that time had already been captured by the Chaldeans, and all the might of the Assyrians was subject to the Babylonian empire. Hence, the ten tribes, that is, Israel, are taken captive by the Assyrians; but the Chaldeans overpower the two tribes, that is, Judah and Benjamin, and overthrow the city of Jerusalem. Therefore, speaking against Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and his people, God used the following divine speech against him: 'To whom have you been compared in your greatness? Look, Assyria is like a cedar of Lebanon, and so on.' And the meaning is: Do not be surprised if you are to be defeated and perish by the Babylonians, and if your empire is to be destroyed and all the wealth of Egypt is to be destroyed, since Assyria, much stronger than you, was destroyed by the same Chaldeans. And it describes the power of the king of Assyria under the figure of a cedar tree, according to the Hebrew text, according to the LXX, Cypress, situated on Mount Lebanon, which is beautiful with branches and thick with foliage, and reaching up to the clouds, which grew so much not by water, but by the depths, that is, by very abundant waters. For the depths are a multitude of the sound of waters, so that all the birds have made nests in its branches, and all the beasts of the field have bred under its foliage. And so that we would not doubt what were the flying creatures of the sky, or the beasts of the woods, he clearly stated: And under his shade dwelt a multitude of diverse nations. Cedars, he said, and cypresses, firs, either pines or plane trees, or cypresses, did not equal the branches of that tree. And so that he would not separately speak of all the trees, he said that all the trees of the paradise of God are not similar to it, nor to its beauty. Through which some understand that it is not said about the Assyrian king, but about the opposite strength, which is said to have been born in the speech of Tyre among the Cherubim, and distinguished by precious stones, and thereafter to have fallen to the earth due to its own fault, who is also called Lucifer in Isaiah (XIV), and is indicated in the Gospel by the Lord: I saw Satan falling like lightning from heaven (Luke X, 12). But let us understand all these things as an interim history of hyperbolic sayings, that the Assyrian was of such great power, and thus he oppressed all nations, comparing himself to the strength of the Angels. However, everything metaphorically is said to be under the highest cedar, or cypress, referring to the Assyrian, and his killing is called the cutting down. And what follows: I have delivered her into the hand of the strongest nations, it calls the king of Babylon, so that what conquered the Assyrian, it understands not as its own strength, but as divine power. According to him, I expelled her because of her impiety, in order to secretly warn Babylon that it should not be cruel or oppress the people of God who had been handed over to it, lest it suffer the same fate as Assyria, which was cruel and impious. And strangers will cut her down, the most cruel among the nations, or, according to the Septuagint, the most pestilent: something that he would never say ((Alt. wanted to say) being in Chaldea so as not to stir up his own people against him. She is also cast onto the mountains, and her branches fall down the steep valleys without delay, and they are broken against the rocks, and she is abandoned by all the peoples, that is, by the birds of the air and the beasts of the field, and she will come to such destruction that all the trees that were thought to be tall compared to the tree of Assyria, by their example, will be raised up and reach even higher, and no longer remain in their height, but once cut down, all will be cut down in fear together. And what was said through the translation becomes clearer. All, he says, were handed over (understood: kings to death) to the farthest land (that is, to the underworld), in the midst of human children (not among trees) to those who descend into the pit. There is no doubt that this signifies the infernal regions. After the cutting down of the Assyrian tree, or on the day when the Assyrian descends to the underworld, and the Lord inflicted mourning (or, commanded mourning), again through the translation he speaks of him being covered by the abyss, according to what is written: “I came to the depth of the sea, and the storm has submerged me” (Ps. 68:3); and all the rivers, that is, all the nations, have ceased to water him beyond, and he, that is, the Assyrian, be made sad or darkened upon it, that is, the tree, or him, that is, the Assyrian, like Lebanon. Lest we think that there is discourse about a tree, it follows: I moved nations with the sound of its collapse. For what great collapse of one tree can there be, such that all nations are moved by its sound? When I led it down to the underworld, according to the word, a tree cannot be led down to the underworld with the others who descended into the lake, that is, into the underworld. And the lowest parts of the earth were consoled, namely in the heart of the earth, with all the trees of pleasure, or delights, which is called Eden in Hebrew, so that it signifies delightful and excellent groves and forests, which were in Lebanon and were watered by waters. For even the trees themselves, along with it, that is, the Assyrian, descend into the underworld, to the killed or wounded with a sword. The trees are not wounded by swords, but cut down, nor do they descend into the underworld. And the arm, he says, or the offspring (since in Hebrew the word "Zara" (seed) means both), will rest in its shadow in the midst of nations, not of forests, but of peoples. Finally, there is an apostrophe to the Assyrian himself, or to Pharaoh. To whom are you likened, o illustrious one, and sublime among the trees of pleasure? None were equal to you, they say, but you surpassed all kings in power, and yet, among the other kings who were in your retinue to the farthest lands, that is, to the underworld, you were led, as the Scripture says: They will enter the furthest reaches of the earth; they will be delivered into the hands of the sword; they will be the prey of foxes (Ps. 62:10-11). In the midst, it is said, you will sleep with the uncircumcised, with those who were slain by the sword. It showed what were the trees, whether cedar or cypress, wounded by swords, and lying with the uncircumcised. And he would join the extreme parts to the front, because he had said above: To whom have you been made like in your greatness: Behold the Assyrian, as a cedar of Lebanon, fair in branches and in leaves, and the rest, now brings down: So is Pharaoh, and all his multitude, says the Lord. How, he says, the Assyrian, cedar and cypress, having fallen by the Babylonian, is brought down: so Pharaoh and his people, that is, the very tree and the branches thereof shall be cut down by the Babylonian. These things, therefore, are said according to history, which most people understand to happen in the consummation of the world and to compare the king of Egypt, that is, the power to which Egypt is subject, with the most powerful king of the Assyrians, that is, the Antichrist: if he falls, surely other rulers of these darknesses and princes of the world will fall more easily. So let us speak briefly about each one, touching on everything, so that we do not so much discuss and explain the obscure as we seem to have given material to those desiring to explain. And first, let us discuss why in the eleventh year, on the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel, saying: Son of man, speak to Pharaoh of Egypt and his multitude. When speaking to Pharaoh, it was in the eleventh year that the word of the Lord was spoken, for it had not yet come to the twelfth year, which is the number of complete and perfected power. Therefore, there are also twelve sons of Jacob (Genesis 35), from whom later the twelve names of the prophets are contained in one volume. And there are twelve apostles (Luke 6), of whom one, Judas the betrayer, is replaced by Matthias. And the synagogue ruler's twelve-year-old daughter is raised to life by the Lord (Mark 5). The woman with the hemorrhage also receives healing in the twelfth year. But because Pharaoh is punished and bewailed afterwards, therefore the third month and the eleventh day of the eleventh year are linked in number. Hence, in the following twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord comes to Ezekiel, saying: Son of man, lament over Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him. For the one who mourns, mourns in order to understand how great the goods they have lost; and yet because Pharaoh was there, and his arm had not yet been bound, nor had he regained his former strength: therefore, in the twelfth year and month, twenty-nine days still remain, in order to complete the number of twelve years. Therefore, on one day of the month, the word of the Lord came to the Prophet, and he was commanded to speak to the king of Egypt and his multitude. It is remarkable that the four interpreters did not say 'people', but 'multitude'. For many are called, but few are chosen (Matthew XXII, 14). And in the law it is written: 'You shall not be with the multitude in doing evil.' And it is said to the king of Egypt: 'To whom have you likened yourself in greatness or in height?' For he himself has exalted himself and is subject to that sentence: 'Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled' (Luke XIV, 11); but let him not be like his height, who was like a cedar or a cypress in Lebanon, beautiful with branches and leafy with foliage; and he has raised his head in height even to the clouds, to which, according to David (Psalm XXXV), the truth of God reaches, and upon which he commands that they do not rain rain upon Israel. Beauty is also praised, which, when corrupt will, has been turned into ugliness (Ps. 77); so that it is said of it: The Lord will break the cedars of Lebanon (Ps. 28, 5): and he himself, being exalted on the highest mountain of Lebanon, the higher he was, the stronger he would fall. The Holy Scripture, wishing to show its height, calls it a great cedar, which the waters nourished, not the waters of Siloe that go silently (Is. 8), but the waters of Rasin and the waters of Egypt, of which it is written: What is there to you to drink the waters of Geon (Jeremiah 2, 18), or Sion? He who makes the turbulent waters sound. The abyss also lifted him up above which in the beginning of the world darkness was carried (Gen. I), and to which in the Gospel the demons beg not to be sent (Luke VIII). The rivers of the same abyss were around its roots, about which it is said: What is it to you and the ways of the Assyrians, that you drink the waters of the rivers (Jer. II, 18)? And in another place: Behold, the Lord will bring upon you a strong and plentiful river water, the king of the Assyrians and all his glory (Isa. VIII, 7). The abyss also sent forth its rivers to all the trees of the region, so that it might water not only the prince of this world, but also his companions. Therefore, it was exalted and grew above all the tallest trees, and its shrubs multiplied, and it possessed the empire of the whole world, saying: All these things have been handed over to me (Matthew 4:9). And its branches were lifted up, for all those who were watered by the abyss. It extended, or spread, its shade in order to subject everyone to its rule. On his branches all the birds of the air have made their nests. For everyone who commits sin is born of the devil, and is counted among his branches. And those birds have made their nests in his branches, which, according to the Gospel, devour the seed by the wayside. It may be because all have sinned and are in need of God's mercy, as it is written: They have all fallen away, and have become useless together. Therefore, they have made their nests on his branches. It follows: And under its branches all the beasts of the forest that have lost the meekness of Christ were born, and under its shade dwelt a multitude of nations, so that there was none who was not sheltered by its shade, except him who said: Behold, the prince of this world is coming: and he will find nothing in me (John XIV, 30). For by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death (Rom. V, 12); and thus death has passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned, and in Adam all die, and we all have sinned, and we need the glory of God (I Cor. XV). And yet, within the same dwelling, there are different conditions. Some dwell in its branches like birds, boasting knowledge in philosophy and the dogmas of heretics. Others are like wild and cruel beasts, while others are like a multitude of diverse nations, signifying a mixture of various vices and sins. However, Assyria was most beautiful in its size and the spread of its foliage, as its roots were watered by many waters, to such an extent that in the paradise of God, there was no cedar or cypress taller, nor did the firs or pines match its height; nor were plane trees equal in their foliage to it. Therefore, no tree of plants in Paradise was suitable for him, because every tree of God's Paradise is not comparable to him and his beauty. For they were not elevated by pride, but they knew their own humility, nor did they attempt to claim the likeness of God with a sacrilegious spirit. And what follows: And all the trees of delight in Paradise were jealous of her, let us explain: The trees of Paradise were jealous of the abundance of its branches: For many are called, but few are chosen (Matthew 20:16). And; The broad and spacious road that leads to death (Ibid. VII, 13). For he desires to have as many for salvation as Assyria had for destruction. Therefore, because Assyria was exalted in height, and extended its lofty and thick foliage, even to the top of the clouds, and his heart was lifted up, saying: I will be like the Most High (Isa. XIV, 14), therefore he was delivered into the hand of the strongest of nations: which we understand to be another detestable power, to whom he is delivered for punishment: for he himself is an enemy and avenger; so that Assyria may be understood as the Antichrist, and the strongest of nations to whom he is delivered, Satan, according to the saying of the Apostle: Whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme (I Tim. II, 20): Who will do to him whatever has been commanded by the Lord. But this cypress was expelled from the paradise of God because of its impiety; and strangers and cruel ones, or pests among the nations, will cut it down, so that what is written may be fulfilled: The fool, when punished, will become wiser (Prov. XIX, 25). And again: The axe is already laid to the root of the trees (Matth. III, 10); those who will cut it down on the mountains, so that it may fall in its pride. Indeed, all its branches will fall in every valley, so that all those who were in its company may be led to Tartarus and depart from its shade, and leave it behind: so that the birds of the air and the beasts of the land, which were previously under it and were covered by its shade, may afterwards share in its punishments. And when they see that the other trees of the forest, or of paradise, have fallen by the judgment of God, the cypress of Assyria will not be lifted up in pride, nor will they consider themselves to be anything, nor will they think their own irrigation of water to be riches: because all the branches and the birds of the sky, and the beasts of the earth, that were under the dominion of Assyria, will be brought down to the final earth in death. Of them it is written: In his sight, all who descend to the earth will fall. And in another place: They will come to the ends of the earth (Ps. 62:10): and they will not be with the angels, but with the sons of men, who descend into the lake or into the eternal pit. But when he descends to the ends of the earth, and a part of foxes will be among those from whom he is to be torn apart: then there will be mourning either of all his companions, or of the holy strengths, which will grieve that he has descended into the underworld. Hence the Lord says: I have covered him with the abyss, whose waters he had been nurtured by before; and I have forbidden his rivers, that is the abyss, and I have restrained many waters, so that they may not water him, but instead overwhelm him. Lebanon was made sad because of him, where the proud ones lived. All the trees of the forest were shaken, and they were afraid of being cut down. The crashing of its downfall made the nations tremble, so that no one could ignore its destruction and its descent into the underworld with its companions. All the trees of Eden were comforted, the choicest and the best in Lebanon. They too were consoled when they saw that the wicked were being punished and the righteous were being restored. But these trees of Lebanon were watered by the streams of the Lord, and they were the same trees that had fallen. Whether all the trees, which once were good and were watered by the waters, and dwelt in the height of Lebanon, will receive consolation, when they see their prince suffering similar torments. For they themselves will descend into hell, to the slain by the sword of the Lord, and all the might of the trees will dwell under his shadow, that is, in punishment, in the midst of all the nations which shall be shut up in the prison of hell. After this, the discourse turns to Pharaoh himself, to whom it had been said in the beginning, with whom have you become like in your greatness? And it is said to him: To whom have you been likened, o illustrious one, and sublime among the trees of pleasure? Surely to the Assyrian who fell. And you were illustrious and sublime among the trees of Eden, that is, of delights and paradise, and behold, you have been cast down like the Assyrian, with all the trees that were once in delights, to the ultimate land and to the underworld, and you shall not sleep in rest, but in punishments amidst the uncircumcised, that is, the unclean, and with those who have fallen by the sword of the Lord. And so that we may know who he is whom he said: O illustrious and sublime among the trees of pleasure, he puts it more clearly: He is Pharaoh, and all his multitude. Or according to the Septuagint, it is thus Pharaoh, and all his multitude, just as just as the Assyrian above was chopped down and fell, so may the Egyptian also be overthrown.

(Chapter XXXII, Verses 1 onwards) And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month (or tenth), on the first day of the month (the Vulgate is silent on the day of the month), the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him: You are like a lion among the nations, and like a dragon in the seas, and you stirred up your rivers and troubled the waters with your feet, and trampled their (or your) streams. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: I will spread my net over you with a multitude of many peoples, and I will draw you up in my snare (or I will draw you up with a hook). And I will cast you on the ground: on the surface of the field I will throw you (or your fields will be filled). And I will make all the birds of the sky dwell (or sit) upon you, and I will satisfy all the beasts of the whole earth with you, and I will give your flesh on the mountains, and I will fill the hills (Vulgate adds yours) (or valleys) with your filth (or your blood) and I will water the land (or the land will be watered) with the stench (or odor) of your blood (or your dung) on the mountains, and the valleys (378) will be filled from you. And when you are extinguished, I will cover the sky and make its stars darken: I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light. I will make all the lights of the heavens mourn (or grow dim) over you: and I will bring darkness over your land, says the Lord God. And I will provoke the heart of many peoples when I bring your destruction (or captivity) among the nations in lands (or in the land) that you do not know. And the people (or many nations) will be astounded over you, and their kings will be greatly terrified when my sword begins to fly against their faces and they suddenly become dumbfounded, each one for their own life, on the day of your ruin (or waiting for their own ruin from the day of your ruin). Because thus says the Lord God: The sword of the king of Babylon will come against you. With the swords of the mighty ones (or giants), I will cast down your multitude (or strength): all these nations are invincible (or pestilential from all nations): and they will devastate (or destroy) the pride (or injustice) of Egypt, and its multitude (or all its strength) will be dispersed (or crushed). And I will destroy all its animals that were on many waters (or on many waters): and the foot of man will no longer disturb them, nor will the hoof of animals trample them. Then I will make their waters pure (or so that their waters may rest), and I will bring their rivers like oil (or so that oil may flow), says the Lord God, when I have made the land of Egypt desolate (or destroyed). But the land will be deserted from its abundance (or with abundance) when I strike (or scatter) all its inhabitants; and they will know that I am the Lord. The daughters of the nations will lament him, and the multitude of Egypt (or all its might) will lament him, says the Lord God. We mix both editions, only in those places where they differ. Otherwise, when there is one meaning, we follow the Hebrew. However, in many copies, according to the Septuagint, the twelfth year and tenth month is placed; according to other interpreters, the tenth year and twelfth month, so that either Jerusalem has already been captured, and Pharaoh's joy is taken away from him in the face of impending evils, or it is certainly to be captured, and it should grieve more for its own miseries than rejoice in the captivity of others. And meanwhile, laying the foundations of a certain history briefly, let us explore what the Hebrews understand in this place. Pharaoh is compared to a lion, not of one nation, but of many nations; or to a dragon in the sea, who possessed the land and waters by the irrigation of rivers, and was raised up in pride, which is called a horn, and with the multitude of his army, he could disturb all the waters: therefore, he says that his net is spread out over his multitude, and he would draw him out with his dragnet or hook, and cast him, or stretch him out upon the land, he who had been wrapped up like a serpent with many coils, so that he may be devoured by all the birds of the sky. And when not only the birds, but all the beasts of the earth have torn him apart, the remaining flesh of him will fill the mountains, valleys, and fields, so that everything will teem with worms. However, this is spoken metaphorically, so that after the birds of the sky and the beasts have been satiated with his flesh, that is, his army, and the rest of the multitude will be transformed into worms and putrefaction. Then it says, the heavens will be enveloped in darkness: the sun, and the moon, and other lights will not give their light, but everything will blacken upon you: and nothing joyful will be left for you, and for your destruction all the peoples and all their kings will be greatly frightened, seeing my sword flying to and fro and sparing no one, and they will fear a similar destruction in your ruin. But so that you may know what this sword is, listen more clearly: The sword of the king of Babylon will come to you. In the swords of the brave, or giants, I will throw down all your multitude. These giants are invincible nations, which were held by the army of the Babylonian king. They will devastate or scatter the pride of Egypt, and all its multitude. And nothing will remain in Egypt, but both men and beasts of burden and wild animals will be taken away together. And there will be such solitude in Egypt that neither the foot of a man nor the hoof of a beast will disturb its waters, but everything will be calm. And its river waters will flow like pure and shining oil, with no one passing through them or disturbing their flow. This will happen because of the solitude of Egypt, which will be transformed into a desert by the Lord, striking its inhabitants so that those who remain may understand that He is the Lord. Therefore, the mourning of Pharaoh is justified, and the daughters of nations mourn around him. But not only for him, but also for his multitude, which was destroyed by the devastating Lord. Let it suffice to say briefly about this simple letter, let us move on to the spiritual understanding. Nor do I think it is of great importance to know who the Pharaoh of Egypt is, since we have already explained more fully, namely that power to which Egypt is entrusted; either one province, or Egypt of the whole world, which is not founded by a lion, but assimilated to the lion of nations by its own vice. For when man was in honor, he did not understand; he was compared to dumb beasts, and became like them (Psalm 48, 13). On this the lion and Peter speak: Our adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, goes about seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5, 8). And in the ninth psalm (Verse 9) it is written: He lies in wait secretly as a lion in his den; he lies in wait to catch the poor. And in Jeremiah the Holy Spirit says: A lion out of the forest has struck them (Jeremiah 5, 6). But the dragon is said to be the devil (for which reason the eagle is interpreted as Leviathan, explaining the name of the dragon), as I have taught with many testimonies according to the earlier explanation, which says: 'The rivers are mine, and I made them.' Therefore, this dragon, like with its horns, struck many nations, which we can understand to be Marcion, Valentinus, Arius, Eunomius, and the other princes of heresies, who imitate the ecclesiastical men, saying to the Lord and Savior: 'We will strike our enemies with the horn in you' (Psalm 44:6); and they do not strike for salvation, to lift them from earth to heaven, but to cast them into the depths. Finally, it follows: And you troubled the waters with your feet; according to the words of the Apostle: But whoever troubles you will bear judgment (Gal. 5:10). For He does not want to drink the waters of Siloam, which flow silently (Isa. 8), but the turbid and muddy waters of Egypt, which before they were trampled underfoot by the dragon, were pure and flowed in their own order; but after they were troubled by his feet, they lost their course. For heretics do not make use of the testimonies of the Scriptures that are consistent with themselves, but they confuse everything. And because he is an enemy and avenger, the Egyptian dragon not only disturbs foreign waters with his feet, but he tramples upon his own rivers, so that he does not spare those whom he has once reduced under his power. 381 The righteous, desiring to avoid this, prays: Let not the foot of pride come against me (Ps. XXXV, 12). And in another place, the trampled one asks not to be trampled again: Have mercy on me, O Lord, for man has trampled upon me (Ps. LV, 1). But the enemy is the devil, of whom the other psalm speaks: Let not man be exalted upon the earth. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: I will spread my net upon you, in the multitude of many peoples (Ps. IX, 18). The net of the Lord, woven with the reason of the Old and New Testament, is cast upon the dragon, who dwells among the multitude of peoples, and always delights in crowds and the multitude of peoples: that he may draw him into his snare, or into his hook. This is the net that is cast into the sea of this world, and it gathers many fish to be chosen and others to be cast away (Matthew 13). Or this is the hook, of which it is written in Job: You shall bring forth the dragon by the hook, etc., you shall surround its nose with a bridle (Job 40:19); which was interpreted by Aquila: You shall draw out Leviathan by the hook, and bind its tongue with cords. Now the dragon, or Leviathan, is drawn out of the sea by the hook or net of the Lord, in order to be cast out or stretched upon the earth, and all its coils, with which it concealed its snares, may be opened and brought forth into the open, and be cast upon the earth, and may lay down the one that had set its mouth in heaven and boasted of being like the Most High. And it follows: And I will make all the birds of the sky to dwell or sit upon you, and I will satisfy all the beasts of the earth with you, according to what is written: You have given him as food for the people of Ethiopia (Ps. 73:14). Those are either called birds or beasts of the earth (Matt. 13; Luke 8). Birds, which snatch the seed, as we have said, along the way. Beasts of the earth, in reference to heretics and pagans who are given over to vices. But what follows - And I will give your flesh on the mountains, and fill your hills with your rottenness; or, I will fill the valleys with your blood - has this meaning: that by the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, we understand the deceived peoples and the cruelty of the Gentiles, and by the mountains we refer to the leaders of heresies such as Valentinus and Marcion, and by the hills we refer to their successors who are filled with the rottenness of the dragon, or the valleys, which are filled with the blood of the dragon, we refer to the lower class of believers. Certainly, there are opposing powers in the mountains that roam through the air, and valleys that descend into the depths of hell, bound by eternal torments. Moreover, when it is said, 'And I will water the earth with the stench of your blood upon the mountains,' or, 'The earth will be watered with your excrement upon the mountains, and the valleys will be filled with you,' it signifies that all the pride and arrogant swelling of heretical faction is not filled with vital and pure blood, but with putrid and stinking blood, as it is written, 'Make them like refuse on the ground.' (Ps. LXXXII, 11). Concerning whom the Holy One is delivered by the Lord, who raises up the poor from the earth, and lifts up the needy from the heap of refuse. To seat him with princes, with the princes of his people. The valleys in the depths, as we said above, signify either the infernal regions or the humble sense of the heretics on account of their desire for pleasure and worldly wealth, do all these things. But as for what is joined: And I will cover the heavens when you are extinguished, and I will make his stars dark, I will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon will not give its light, I will cause all the luminaries of the sky to mourn or dark to fall upon you, and I will bring darkness upon your land, says the Lord God, if we follow the literal meaning, it cannot be fully understood. For when Pharaoh, or the scorching sun, and the moon, and the stars did not give their light, and the sky was covered in darkness, according to that poetic line (Virgil, Georgics I):

And the impious feared the eternal night. Therefore it must be said that with the extinguishing of Pharaoh, who transformed himself into an angel of light, of whom it is written elsewhere: The light of the wicked will be extinguished (Job XVIII), the heavens or the sky will be covered in darkness. Concerning this, Paul also speaks: And the spiritual wickedness in heavenly places (Ephesians VI, 12). And the Lord will cause his stars, or the dragon, or the sky, to become black. About this, Judas the Apostle also writes: Wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved forever (Jude XIII). The sun is also covered by a cloud, the sun of iniquity, which opposes the sun of justice, but the cloud, or even the Lord Savior himself, who descended upon Egypt on a light cloud (Isa. XIX), not burdened by the weight of sin, or the prophets and apostles, of whom we read: 'I will command the clouds not to rain upon it' (Isa. V, 6). And in the Psalms: 'Your truth reaches to the clouds' (Ps. XXXV, 6). But when the sun of iniquity is obscured, the moon, which we perceive as the Church of heretics, and which was thought to receive the light of iniquity from the sun, will not give its light, nor will the knowledge of a false name deceive believers. And all the lights and whatever is seen to be in the doctrines of heretics will be extinguished with the dragon destroyed, and they will dry up, mourning the lost leader, so that the Lord himself may cover the land of heretics with darkness, the ignorance of truth, so that the blind may lead the blind into the pit, and the inhabitants of the earth may be thrown into outer darkness, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. After this it is said: 'And I will provoke the heart of many peoples, when I bring your affliction or captivity among the nations over the land that you do not know, so that those who had previously served Pharaoh may be angry against him, seeing that his captivity has been brought to another land, which the dragon did not know.' And we must not doubt that the lands are good, which Pharaoh does not know, namely when the captivity of Pharaoh is changed into another captivity, of which it is said to the Savior: Ascending on high, he led captivity captive: he received (or, according to the Apostle, gave) gifts to men. And I will cause many peoples to be amazed at you, so that those who previously admired Pharaoh's power will then admire that he has fallen from his own summit. The kings of the peoples will also be frightfully feared over him, whose kingdoms the devil shows to the Lord, and of whom it is said in the psalm: The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers gathered together in one (Ps. II, 2). But this will happen when the sword of the Lord begins to fly over their faces, the faces of kings or peoples are understood. And the sword of the Lord is to be understood as the living word of God, and effective, and sharp on both sides, which flies and runs and stings the eyes of those who see and deters their faces, so that, astonished by the ruin of Pharaoh, they see themselves thrown down in him. And indeed, the sword of the Lord, of which it is written: Behold, he is set for the fall and for the resurrection of many (Luke 2:34), lifts up those who are lying down, and changes those who are badly erected with humility. But the sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon the Egyptian dragon, so that the Lord may cast down the multitude of him, who followed the king of Egypt, with the swords of the mighty men or giants. Indomitable, therefore, or pestilent from the nations, all these, that they may be handed over to worse evils for punishment, of which it is written: He sent forth upon them the wrath of his indignation, indignation, and trouble by evil angels (Psalm 78:49). And the Apostle says: 'Whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme; or to the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved.' (I Tim. I, 20). But when the pride of Egypt, represented by these ministers, has been cast down, and its multitude scattered, all its beasts, which were upon many waters, shall perish, and the foot of man shall no more disturb them. For if it is blessed to sow upon the waters where the ox and the ass tread (Isa. XXXII), then, on the other hand, unhappy is he who, by his own persistent error, keeps the simple in his error, so that even the foot of man treads not upon them, lest the waters of Egypt seem to have any sign of wisdom and reason in themselves. The hoof of the beasts also shall not trouble them, so as to make them troubled and muddy, out of the most clear and shining make them troubled and muddy. Then the most pure waters, which were troubled by the dominion of the dragon, shall be restored, not by another, but by the Lord Himself: so that their rivers shall run forth as oil, and the light shall be their eternal nourishment. But these things shall come to pass, when the Lord shall have made the land of Egypt desolate, and shall have destroyed the multitude thereof, and shall have smitten all the inhabitants thereof, so that by this proceeding they may know that He Himself is the Lord. But what is joined together: it is a lamentation, and the daughters of the nations shall lament over Egypt and over its multitude, says the Lord God. It is clear that the souls of all the nations, who were previously oppressed, whether of those nations that did not dwell in Egypt at all, but lived in the region of the living, shall lament the slain dragon and all its multitude: not in hope of salvation, but because it has been cast down into eternal punishment due to its great power and pride.


<h2 id='tocuniq290'>(Vers. 17, seq.)</h2>

(V. 17, seq.) 'And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, prophesy against the multitude of Egypt and drag her down, along with the daughters of mighty nations, to the farthest land, with those who descend to the pit. How beautiful you are, descend and lie with the uncircumcised. In the midst of those slain by the sword they shall fall: the sword is given, they have drawn her and all her people.' The most powerful of the strong will speak to him from the midst of the underworld, who descended with his helpers (or his own) and slept with the uncircumcised, and those slain by the sword. There Asshur and all his multitude, all around his grave, all who were slain, and those who fell by the sword, whose graves were given in the depths of the pit: and his multitude was made all around his tomb, all the slain and fallen by the sword who once caused terror in the land of the living. There Aela and all its multitude around its tomb: all of these were killed and fell by the sword, those uncircumcised who descended to the nether world, who spread terror in the land of the living and bore their disgrace with those who descend to the pit. In the midst of the slain they made her a bed among all her people, around her tomb. All of these were uncircumcised, killed by the sword. For they have caused terror in the land of the living, and have carried their disgrace with those who descend into the grave. They were placed in the midst of the slain. There Mosoch and Thubal, and all their multitude, surrounded their graves. All these were uncircumcised and were killed by the sword, those who caused terror in the land of the living. They will not sleep with the mighty, the fallen, and the uncircumcised, who have descended to the underworld with their weapons and have placed their swords under their heads. Their wickedness is in their bones, for they have become a terror to the land of the living. And so you will be crushed in the midst of the uncircumcised, and you will sleep with those slain by the sword. There Edom and its kings, and all its princes, who gave their might with their armies, along with those slain by the sword, and who slept with the uncircumcised, and with those who descended into the pit. There are all the princes of the north, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain, in shame, despite their might, because they slept uncircumcised with those slain by the sword, and they bear their shame with those who descend into the pit. Pharaoh saw them, and he took comfort over his whole multitude, which was killed by the sword, Pharaoh and all his army, says the Lord God. For I have given ((or gave)) my terror in the land of the living, and he slept in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord God.» The Septuagint edition differs greatly in this place both in order and translation, and certain things have been added to it from Theodotion. Where we found it necessary to include the text itself, not at all sparing in length, and serving the diligence of the attentive reader.

LXX. And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth month, that the word of the Lord came unto me, saying: Son of man, weep for the multitude of Egypt, and they shall bring down her daughters as the nations of the dead into the depth of the earth, with those who descend into the pit (Moreover, under the asterisks it is added: + Descend from the beautiful water; + and sleep with the uncircumcised ** Again it follows in order): In the midst of the slain by the sword, they shall fall with him, and all his strength shall sleep, and the giants in the depth of the pit shall say to thee, descend, for thou art better, descend, and sleep with the uncircumcised in the midst of the slain by the sword. There Assur, and all his congregation. (And what follows: ÷ All the wounded were given there, ÷ and his tomb in the depths of the pit, ÷ and his congregation was made ** which is not found in the Hebrew, but was added by the Septuagint. Again it is said): Around his tomb all the wounded who had fallen by the sword. (And again it was added from Theodotion's Edition under asterisks: + They gave his tombs on the sides of the lake; + and his congregation was made around his tomb. + All these wounded, and falling by the sword. After these, the seventy placed): They gave their fear upon the land of the living. There Aelam, and all its strength around its tomb, all wounded, and falling by the sword: and those who descend uncircumcised into the depths of the earth, who have brought their terror upon the land of the living, and have received their torment with those who descend into the pit among the wounded. There were given Mosoch, and Thubal, and all their strength around their tomb, all their 387 wounded, all uncircumcised, and wounded by the sword, who have brought their terror upon the land of the living, and have not slept with the giants who have fallen from ancient times: who have descended into hell with the weapons they used for war, and have placed their swords under their heads, and their iniquities have become their bones, because they have terrified the giants in their life. And you will be crushed in the midst of the uncircumcised, and you will sleep with those who are wounded by the sword. There are Edom and its kings, and all the princes of Assyria, who gave their strength to it in its sword wound. These slept with the wounded, with those who went down to the pit. There are all the princes of the north, all the officials of Assyria, who were wounded and terrified, and who slept in their confusion, uncircumcised with the wounded by the sword, and they took their shame with those who went down to the pit. Pharaoh will see them, and he will receive consolation for all their strength: Pharaoh, wounded by the sword, and all his strength, says the Lord God. For I have placed fear of him over the land of the living, and he will sleep in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those wounded by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord God. I am not unaware that such a great discrepancy between two editions will be displeasing to the delicate reader. But what shall I do with my detractors, who, if I remove anything from the translation of the Seventy interpreters, accuse me of sacrilege and shout without fear of the Lord, especially since they disagree in the truth of faith and follow the errors of the Manichaeans, stirring the souls of the unlearned when they are able to show any change in the old customs, desiring to wander more willingly than to learn anything true from their rival. And meanwhile, according to the history, the meaning is clear. In the same twelfth year, and in the same, as we suppose, month, but not on the same, as above, day, but on the fifteenth day, not against Pharaoh, but against the strength or multitude of Egypt, a lamentation is taken up, which is removed from its pride together with all its daughters, or the strong nations, to the farthest land, that is, to the depths of hell, and it is said to the king of Egypt: How much better are you, that you deserve to escape death? For when Assur, and Elam, that is, the Persians, and Mosoch, which are interpreted Cappadocians, and Thubal, which others will have to be Iberians, others Italians: 388 Also Idumeans, and the princes of the north, with the Sidonians, with all their armies, who by their assistance terrified all nations, are dead, and slain by the sword, and have laid down their swords under their heads, which is to be understood more emphatically, will you alone be able not to bear the same things? Moreover, when you see such a great multitude of sleeping souls with you in the underworld, and your tomb surrounded by the memories of once mighty princes, you will find comfort, considering the lesser torments in the company of many. For now, let it suffice to have spoken these things succinctly according to the simple meaning. Now, let us briefly expound on the same matter as much as the difficulty of explanation allows, embracing spiritual understanding and the highest knowledge. On the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to the Prophet, this being the fifteenth. But in the first place, that is, on the Kalends, the beginning of the month is. On the fifteenth, when the whole orb of the moon is filled, and if it is the first month, it is the first day of unleavened bread; but if it is the seventh, it is the day of tent pitching (which are the most solemnities among the Hebrews). But lamentation is made over the strength of Egypt, so that it ceases to be strong in evil: and it receives weakness, and when it is weaker, then it is stronger. For the fortitude of Egypt, in Hebrew it has a multitude. For the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many enter through it (Matthew 7:13). In contrast, it is said to Israel: But you are few among all the nations (Deuteronomy 28). For virtue is always rare, and the way that leads to life is narrow and difficult, and few are those who enter through it. And as for the mourning of Egypt and her dead daughters, according to the Septuagint, whether it is the daughters of strong nations that are led to the ultimate land, in the lake or in the deepest pit, it signifies the souls dwelling in Egypt of this world, who have lost the one who says: I am the life (John 14:6), and being dead in their sins, they are dragged down to the depths by the weight of their offenses, as the sinner says: For my iniquities have risen above my head, like a heavy burden they press me down (Psalm 38:5). These are the ones about whom it is written elsewhere: They will go down into the depths of the earth, they will be delivered into the hands of the sword, they will become the prey of foxes (Ps. 62:10). For whoever digs a pit, will fall into it (Sirach 27:29; Ps. 7:16). Hence we also read: He opened a pit and dug it, and he fell into the hole he had made. And what follows: How beautiful you are, come down and sleep with the uncircumcised, is specifically directed to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, or as the addition in the Septuagint of Theodotion states, to Egypt itself: Come down from the most beautiful water and sleep with the uncircumcised. Regarding specifically to the one who is reborn in the baptism of Christ and hears with the Church: 'Who is this that ascends, adorned in white, leaning upon her beloved?' (Song of Songs 8:5) Afterward, whether through fornication or other vices, he is cast out of the Church and it is said to him: 'Come down from the most beautiful water and sleep with the uncircumcised,' that is, with the impure, according to the sense which the Apostle gives: 'We are the circumcision' (Philippians 3:3), who serve in the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus, not relying on the flesh. Hi all in the midst of the wounded or slain will fall with Pharaoh, by that sword which the Lord is coming to send upon the earth. For just as the sword of Christ separates the good from the evil, saying: I have not come to send peace upon the earth, but a sword (Matthew X, 34): so the sword of heretics cuts off all people and leads the wounded into hell. These are the most powerful and rebellious giants, and they lift up their mouths in arrogance, and the higher they raise themselves in pride, the lower they are dragged down into the depths of the pit and the ultimate hell, all of whom are killed by the sword. And so that Pharaoh or all the power of Egypt would know, which has been drawn down to the underworld, who it had as partners in punishment, the following discourse demonstrates: There is Assur, and all his multitude, or his assembly. For indeed, the leader of the heretics is the devil, whose true assembly is the synagogue, of which it is said in the Apocalypse: They are the synagogues of Satan (Apoc. II, 9). But I think the following verses, which are marked with an obelus, should be skipped, and it should be said that what is contained in Hebrew is: Around that place, their tombs, namely the tombs of those deceived by him. Those who were wounded or killed by the sword and therefore fell, their tombs were given in the very depths of the lake. But that the lake is called infernus is clearly shown in that psalm, in which the repentant one speaks: 'I am reckoned among those who go down to the pit' (Psalm 27:1). By no means should we understand it according to the proper meaning of the Latin word which is called λίμνη in Greek, as in the lake of Tiberias, and Lake Como, and Lake Van, and many others, but which we do not usually call cisterns. The Scriptures testify that sinners and all heretics dig up the lakes, which cool the waters and take away all heat from them, and as far as my memory serves me, no holy lake, that is, cistern, has been dug. But all sinners, among whom was King Uzziah, afflicted with leprosy and who fell because of his pride, of whom it is written that he was a man lying in the works of the earth, and built many towers of pride in the corners, and dug up lakes (2 Chronicles 26). On the contrary to the just person it says: 'Drink water from your vessels, and from the fountains of your wells.' (Prov. V, 15) And again: 'Let your fountain be your own.' Therefore the Lord speaks: 'They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and have dug for themselves broken cisterns, that hold no water.' (Jer. III, 13) It follows: 'And its multitude became round about its grave.' All these surround Assyria, and their multitude is very great, all of them wounded and slain, and falling by the sword. For none of them can stand with Moses, nor hear: Ye that stand in the house of the Lord. (Psalm CXXXIV, 2); but all are wounded and slain, and they fall who once inspired fear in the land of the living, but now inspire fear in those who are governors of the Churches, lest they make the people of the living to be like the dead, and deceive even the simple. Hence Paul also said: But I fear, lest as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. (II Corinthians XI, 3). But here this fear is mitigated by the hope of the Lord, as Ecclesiasticus says: The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life, from whom shall I tremble? (Ps. XXVI, 1, 2) After this it is said: There is Aelam (or Assyria), and all its multitude around its tomb, undoubtedly Assyrians. Aelam is translated into our language as their ascent. For all those who, despising the humility of Christ, rise up in the pride of the devil and consider themselves something in the knowledge of false names, are to be called Aelamites, who surround the tomb of the Assyrian king, and they were killed and wounded with the sword. And although they have set their mouths on high, they have descended unclean and uncircumcised to the lowest earth, so that the higher they were elevated, the more forcefully they would fall. These ones have not only imposed their terror once, but a second time on the land of the living. For who among the Ecclesiastics is secure from the terror of such Aelamites, and has not lost someone of his flock? And fittingly the Church of Christ is called the land of the living, so on the contrary, the gatherings of heretics are believed to be the land of the dead. And they carried, he says, their shame, and their torment with those whom they dragged with them into the lake, and into the deep of hell: of which the bed is among the midst of the killers: namely, those whom they cut their throats with their sword, and they surround such peoples. These peoples are the peoples of the Assyrian king, and although they boast to be circumcised: nevertheless, they were killed uncircumcised by the sword, and for the third time they caused terror and fear in the land of the living. Where they carried their torment and punishment in the midst of those whom they deceived with their trickery. There, too, is, that is to say, near Assyria, Mosoch, and Thubal, and all his multitude around his tomb: all uncircumcised and killed, and falling by the sword, who had brought their fear upon the land of the living. For Mosoch and Thubal, Symmachus and Theodotius are interpreted as their dwelling places, so as to show the dwellings of heretics, or rather eternal pits, are the punishments of the Assyrian king. Mosoch is interpreted as madness: Thubal, conversion, not from evil to good, but from good to evil; or all things, so that it offends all heretics to be insane, and with equal zeal to be turned to worse things (Rom. XII). It is not surprising if the insane, and gathered together in evil, have a multitude, since they are partners of the Egyptian king, who delights in multitude. All of these were killed by the sword, who had given their fear, not once, nor twice, but for the third time, in the land of the living, of whom we have spoken more fully above. It follows: And they do not sleep with the mighty, or with the fallen giants, and not with the circumcised, who descended to the underworld with their weapons: and they placed their swords under their heads; and their wickedness was in their bones; because the terror of the mighty has become in the land of the living. These, he says, who had been leaders of heretics, have reached such a height and torment of evil, that they do not deserve to suffer similar punishments even with the mighty and giants who fell from the beginning. Those who, never repenting for their own errors, descended to the underworld with their weapons, rebelled against God and His Church; carrying weapons with them, of which it is written: 'The teeth of men are their weapons and arrows' (Psalm 56:5); and they placed, it is said, their swords under their heads, resting in their minds to be destroyed; and embracing the spears of their opinions as their greatest victory, to the extent that their iniquities were in their bones, that is, possessing the strongest fabrications and doctrines of their own error. Because the strong have become terrified in their lives, whether on the earth of the living. The fourth says this, so that they may terrify the strongest men, and those who have knowledge of the Scriptures, and those who would be from the region of the living, with their wickedness, as they descend into hell with their weapons, and place their swords under their heads, and their iniquities reach even to their bones. After this it is written: And so you shall be crushed in the midst of the uncircumcised (Rom. 16:20), which is said either against Pharaoh or against the strength or multitude of Egypt, and that she herself may be crushed, according to what is written: But may God quickly crush Satan under your feet. And you shall sleep, says he, with the sword having been killed, in eternal sleep. There, with the Assyrian, and with the Egyptian multitude, there shall be Edom, and its kings, all who served earthly works or delighted in blood. Indeed, Edom signifies earthly and bloody things. All the kings and all the rulers, whom the Apostle often speaks of (Phil. III), while indulging in earthly works and daily shedding the blood of those they deceived through their deceit, slept with the uncircumcised and impure, and with those who descended into the lake, of whom we have spoken above. In that very province, there will be the princes of the North, from whom evils blaze upon the earth. And it is from whom, either in Jeremiah (Jer. 1), or in the same prophet (Above XXII), that that pot full of flesh and bones is set on fire. And not only the princes of the North, but all the 393 magistrates of Assyria, for which it is more accurately expressed in Hebrew, all the Sidonians, whom we translate as hunters, according to that which is written: Our soul has been rescued like a bird from the snare of the hunters (Ps. 124:7), for which it is expressed in Hebrew as Sidonians. Those of Sidon, or hunters, will be led trembling to the underworld, having once relied on their own strength, and they will sleep in uncleanness, and they will carry their confusion or torment, having the eternal penance of a guilty conscience, so that their fire is not extinguished (Isaiah 66), and their worm does not die (Mark 9). When Pharaoh sees all of them, he will be comforted, either still having his former wickedness or realizing that he has many companions in his punishment, or certainly he was comforted, seeing them also confounded in their punishments and terrors above his entire multitude that was killed by the sword, namely, Pharaoh's, or all his companions, especially the king of Assyria, and Meshech and Tubal and the Edomites, and the princes of the North, and the Sidonians. For they had instilled their terror in the land of the living. As the fifth says, we should beware and flee all such nations that have deceived our every sense and that we know to be frightful and not easily avoided unless we guard our hearts with utmost caution. He slept, so they say, and Pharaoh himself was slain with his allies by the sword, his allies being a multitude, as they journeyed along a wide and spacious path towards eternal punishments.


<h2 id='tocuniq291'>(Cap. XXXIII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 33, verses 1 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and say to them: When I bring a sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them and make him their watchman; and he sees the sword coming upon the land, and blows the trumpet, and warns the people. If anyone hears the sound of the trumpet but does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. He heard the sound (or voice) of the trumpet, and did not take notice, his blood shall be upon himself: but if he take notice and watch to save his soul, his blood shall be upon him. But if the watchman see the sword coming, and sound not the trumpet: and the people look not to themselves, and the sword come and cut off a soul from among them: he indeed is taken away in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at the hand of the watchman. And thou, O son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore, hear the word from my mouth and announce it to them from me. If I say to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from their ways, the wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood. But if you do warn the wicked to turn from their ways and they do not do so, they will die for their sin, but you will have saved yourself. Again, the word of the Lord came to the prophet, who had been silent for a while because a prophet cannot always bear the weight of continuous prophecy due to human weakness. He speaks the same things that were said before. Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. You will hear a word from me and deliver a warning from me. If you do not warn the wicked person about their iniquity, they will die because of their iniquity, but I will hold you responsible for their blood. However, if you warn the wicked person and they do not turn from their wicked ways, they will die because of their iniquity, but you have saved yourself. And if you announce to the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness and his way, that wicked person shall die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul. If you carefully examine them, you understand that they are indeed similar, but not the same, as they differ in many respects. And we must observe this in all the holy Scriptures, where there seems to be some similarity in the message, not everything is said in the same way, but many things are either subtracted or added, and the arrangement of the different words have their own logic. And meanwhile, before we go on to higher things, a brief statement must be explained. If a lookout has been stationed among the people to announce the sword of the Lord and the coming wrath, and when he announces it the people refuse to listen, the lookout will be free, but the one who is caught by the sword will bear the guilt of his own blood. But if the lookout does not blow the trumpet and the people do not take notice of the approaching sword and are therefore not warned, the people will indeed die in their iniquity, but I will hold the lookout accountable for their blood. And so that the prophet Ezekiel would know that the general dispute pertained to him above all. And you, he said, son of man, you were not appointed from the land and the people of the land, as I said before, but from me, you were appointed as a watcher over the house of Israel. So if I say to the wicked: Wicked one, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn him to keep himself from his wicked ways, and he dies in his iniquity, his blood will I require at your hand. But if you announce and command the impious one to turn away from his worst ways, and he refuses to do so, he will indeed die in his iniquity; but you will be saved from the destruction of negligence in your own soul. From these words we learn that a man, even if wicked and impious, can be saved from his impiety if he hears the words of the teacher and repents. But the teacher is also at risk if he refuses to teach, either out of fear of consequences or despair of the sinner. The teacher is responsible for the blood of the one who could have been saved and rescued from death if the teacher had not remained silent. Both the teacher's choice to remain silent or speak and the listener's choice to hear, act, and be saved or despise and perish are free. And immediately it does not follow that what the prophet predicts will come to pass. For he does not predict in order that it may come, but in order that it may not come; and because God speaks, it is not necessary that what he threatens will happen, but he threatens in order that the one to whom he threatens may be converted to repentance, and that what is foretold may not happen if the words of the Lord are despised. Now we can explain this passage in three ways: either according to the literal sense, that the land which appoints a lookout for itself is the land of Judah; or according to the spiritual interpretation, the Church, which often chooses a lookout for itself regarding the last things of its people, namely, whom the Apostle, writing to the Corinthians, takes as a judge (1 Corinthians 15); or certainly, the soul of the believer, which places its mind and reason above the thoughts of the people and crowd of its own thoughts, so that it may not accept all the incitements of its thoughts but may judge and discern which ones ought to be followed and which ones ought to be avoided. The speculator of the land of Judea can be understood either as a king or a prophet. But the speculator of the Church, that is, the bishop or the presbyter, is chosen by the people and is knowledgeable in the reading of the Scriptures, foreseeing what is to come. He announces to the people and corrects the wrongdoer. Therefore, it is greatly to be feared that we approach this office unworthy and chosen by the people, giving ourselves to negligence and laziness. And what is worse, serving in pleasures, belly, and leisure, we think that we have received honor, not ministry. For the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve (Matt. 20:28); and he washed the feet of the disciples (John 13), to show that all filth and vices should be washed away and cleansed by the teachers in the disciples. And let us not immediately respond, what is the profit of teaching if the listener does not want to do what you have taught? For each person is judged according to their own mind and duty. You, if you have not spoken, and he, if he has contemptuously refused to listen. Concerning negligent magistrates, Solomon speaks: Hidden wisdom and secret treasure, what use is there in both? (Ecclus. XX, 32). This means something similar in the Gospel (Mark IX), that whoever causes scandal to one of the least of the Church, it would be better for him to be tied to his neck an ass’s millstone and be thrown into the deep, rather than, placed on a pedestal, cause damage to many.

<h2 id='tocuniq292'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 and following) Therefore, son of man, say to the house of Israel, Thus you have said: 'Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we waste away because of them; how then can we live?' Say to them, As I live, declares the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn back, turn back from your evil ways, for why will you die, O house of Israel? And you, son of man, say to the people of your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him when he transgresses, and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall by it when he turns from his wickedness, and the righteous shall not be able to live by his righteousness when he sins on any day." } Even if he says that life must be lived justly, and trusting in his own justice commits iniquity, all his righteousness will be forgotten, and he will die in the iniquity that he has worked. But if he says to the wicked, 'You will surely die,' and he repents of his sin, and practices judgment and righteousness, restores what he has taken by robbery, walks in the commandments of life, and does not commit any injustice, he will live and not die. All sins (Vulg. adds \"of his\") that he has committed will not be attributed to him: he has done judgment and justice, he will live: And the children of your people say: The way of the Lord is not equal, and their own way is unjust. For when the just shall depart from his justice, and commit iniquities, he shall die in them. And when the wicked shall depart from his wickedness, and shall do judgment and justice, he shall live in them. And you say: The way of the Lord is not right. I will judge each of you according to your ways, O house of Israel. If we read negligently, the same prophecy seems to us to say what is said above, namely: \"Do I have any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord God, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?\" (Ezekiel 18:23) And at the end of the same prophecy: \"Turn away from all your transgressions, and they shall not be a stumbling block to you of iniquity\" (ibid., 8). For there the conversation takes place with those who want to do penance and erase their sins with justice, so that they may convert with confidence and repent with a full heart. However, here he speaks to those who, due to the magnitude of their sins, or rather their impieties, despair of salvation and say: Our iniquities and sins are upon us, and we waste away in them. How then can we live? And the meaning is: Since death has once been proposed to us, and there is no medicine that can restore health to our wounds, why must we labor and be consumed in vain and not spend this present life in despair, so that we may at least enjoy this, since we have lost the future? To those whom God responds, he does not desire the death of the wicked, but rather that they should turn back and live. And he makes an appeal to the desperate wicked: Turn away from your worst ways. And in order for us to know who the wicked are to whom he speaks, the following discourse demonstrates: Why should you die, house of Israel? However, life and death in this context do not signify the common law of nature by which we all either live or are dissolved by death, like animals; but rather that which is written, I will please the Lord in the land of the living (Psalm 114:9); and, The soul that sins, it shall die. And from a special reminder that he was speaking to the house of Israel, he transitions to a general discussion: that past righteousness does not save from present injustice, if one is occupied with new crimes, and they do not erase the sins of an old sinner or impious person if they have corrected their past mistakes with righteous actions. And God does not judge in both cases based on the past, but on the present. If I say, he says, to the righteous, you shall live, and if I have promised the rewards of righteousness to him, and if he, relying on that, sins, all of his past righteousness will be forgotten, and he will die in his present wickedness. And my opinion has not changed, since I cannot fulfill what I promised to the same sinful person as to the righteous person. But if I threaten sinners and the wicked, saying, 'In three days Nineveh will be overthrown,' and that person repents and corrects their past mistakes through good deeds, acting justly and restoring what was taken, walking in the commandments of life and doing nothing unjust, should not the life that is in Christ live and never die, since the punishment of the sinner should not fall upon the righteous? This is what the divine speech says to Jeremiah when he goes down to the house of the potter and hears either the promises or the threats of God. It is done in order to either provoke people to salvation or to deter them from sin (Jeremiah XVIII). Therefore, those who say 'The way of the Lord is not fair' are argued against, as their own judgment is unjust, their eyes are very bad, and they do not judge with anything new, but with the old judgments. All of these things demonstrate that a sinner should not despair of salvation if he repents, nor should the righteous person rely on his own righteousness if he carelessly loses what he had acquired with great effort. We race through the manifest, so that we may dwell in the more obscure matters, in which the present prophecy differs from the past, and in which it speaks of similar things, the comparison of both can indicate. Moreover, what it means to judge and to do justice, to restore a pledge, to give back what was stolen, to walk in the commands of life, and other things, we have already mentioned in this same prophet.

<h2 id='tocuniq293'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verses 21, 22.) And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the tenth month (the Vulgate is silent about the month), on the fifth day of the month of our transmigration (or captivity): the one who had fled (or been saved) from Jerusalem came to me, saying, 'The city has been devastated (or captured).' But the hand of the Lord had come upon me in the evening before the one who had fled came: and he opened my mouth until morning and with my mouth open, I did not remain silent any longer. In the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah, in the fifth month, the city of Jerusalem was captured. This prophecy, however, in the twelfth year, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month of captivity or migration, when Jechoniah was captured, shows that one year, four months, and twenty-five days after the capture of Jerusalem, a citizen of Jerusalem came to Babylon to announce the captured and devastated city. But one day before the one who was to narrate this arrived, in the evening the hand of the Lord came upon the prophet Ezekiel, who opened his mouth which had been closed for a long time, and whatever he was going to say, the one who made this happen replied beforehand: nor did he remain silent any longer, seeing his prophecy fulfilled in action, and having no doubt at all about the people who were in Babylon, or those who were taken captive from the prophetic prediction. For then the mouth of the prophet is opened, when what he had previously announced is shown in action: and he proclaims with complete freedom, who demonstrates not things that will happen in the future, but either things that are present or things that have already happened. This according to the letter. Moreover, according to the anagoge, if Ezekiel is interpreted as the strength of God: but Christ is the power and wisdom of God (I Cor. I, 24), this is to be understood, that when Jerusalem was captured and destroyed, whoever could escape the perfidy of the Jews, like the apostles and the relics that were saved, he himself announces to Christ that all the ceremonies of the Jews have been destroyed, which some still think should be observed today, not hearing the Apostle's words: You have fallen from grace, you who are justified by the Law (Galat. V, 4). And why not, when the stubbornness of men wishes to defend in word what they dare not fulfill in deed, except perhaps under the disguise of sheepskin, that is, of Christians, the wolves of the Jews hide? What does the defender (or rather, the accuser) of the synagogue proclaim in the Churches of Christ? Therefore, with Jerusalem captured and destroyed, the mouth of the Lord is opened through the apostles and the apostolic men, who can say: My mouth is open to you, O Corinthians; and: A great and powerful door has opened to me (II Cor. VI, 11). And this: I opened my mouth and drew in breath (Psalm 118, 131), which will never be silent, nor be heard with Israel: Hear, O Israel, and be silent: but it will resound throughout the whole world, and will open (or be opened) the Gospel of Christ to the Gentiles. Therefore, according to this understanding, the twelfth year refers to the twelve tribes, and the tenth month to the time of Jewish propitiation, which is called ἱλασμός in Greek; and the fifth day of the month refers to carnal senses, which we have shown were all destroyed and passed away, with Jerusalem being captured and the Gospel succeeding; and in the evening, that is, at the consummation of the world, the hand of the true Ezekiel, who had foretold the future destruction of the city through the prophets, and showed that the prophecies had been fulfilled in the morning.


<h2 id='tocuniq294'>(Vers. 23 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 23 and following) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, those who dwell in these ruined places in the land of Israel are saying: Abraham was alone, and he possessed the land; but we are many, the land has been given to us for possession. Therefore, you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God: You who eat meat with blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood, shall you possess the land as an inheritance? You have stood with your swords, you have committed abominations, and each one of you has defiled his neighbor's wife, and shall you possess the land as an inheritance? You shall say this to them: Thus says the Lord God: As I live, surely those who dwell in the ruins shall fall by the sword, and he who is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those who are in strongholds and in caves shall die of the plague. And I will make the land a desolation and a waste, and the pride of its power shall cease, and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, so that no one will pass through them. And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I make their land desolate and deserted because of all their abominations that they have committed. And you, son of man, the children of your people speak about you by the walls and in the doors of houses, and they say to one another, each to his neighbor, speaking: Come, let us hear what word is coming forth from the Lord. And they come to you as the people usually gather, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but they do not do them, for they turn them into a song of their mouth, and their heart follows their greed (or as it is contained in the Septuagint: For they themselves make falsehood in their mouth, and after their abominations their heart walks. Followed): And you will be to them like a musical chant that is sung with a sweet and pleasant sound, and they will hear your words, but they will not do them, and when the predicted thing comes, behold, it is coming: then they will know that there is a prophet among them. Firstly, it must be understood that about eight more or less lines have been added to the place that we have set. Those who dine on blood, and you lift your eyes to your impurities, up to the place where it is written: These things you shall say to them, thus says the Lord God, it is not found in the Septuagint, which, along with many others, have overlooked these things or, translated by them, have gradually been removed due to error. And our Latin authors, or rather envious Christians, or, to speak more plainly, the heirs of the Grunnian faction, bark against us because we discuss according to the Hebrew text: as if food is being forced upon unwilling recipients, and that these feasts are not prepared for those who receive them with thanksgiving. Certainly, if they do not believe us, let them read other editions, of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion; let them question Hebrews from different regions, not just the ones I have redeemed, but from various provinces; and when they see that everyone agrees with my error or ignorance, then they will understand that they are too wise and prefer to sleep rather than learn; and let them live in the seventy cells of the Alexandrian Pharos, so they do not lose their sails from their ships and sigh over the damage of their ropes. This, on the other hand, is spoken against the envious: now let us discuss what we have proposed. After Jerusalem was captured and the temple was destroyed, the poor of the land, about whom Jeremiah writes,  were the only ones left in Jerusalem who cultivated vineyards and fields and lived in the ruins of the burned city. And although they should have repented for the things that led to their captivity, deceiving themselves with false hope, they said: Our father Abraham was one, and yet he possessed this land as an inheritance, not because he himself possessed it, but because his seed received the land of promise. If, therefore, he alone was multiplied into so many peoples, we who are left in the land of Judah, and dwell in deserted and ruined cities, will certainly be multiplied much more, so that we may possess more than he possessed alone. To whom the Lord responded: Abraham possessed the land of promise by faith alone. For Abraham believed in God, and it was counted to him as righteousness (Genesis XV, 8). However, these people, occupied with disbelief and wickedness, even if they are many, will not be able to possess. At the same time, he enumerates what the sinners do to offend God, namely six kinds of sins. Those who eat flesh with blood, and lift up your eyes to impurities, that is, to your idols, and spill blood, that is, perpetrate murder: can those who do these things retain the land as their inheritance? Not content with this, you also stand with your swords every day, ready to kill, and imitating Esau, who stood and lived by his sword, you commit incredible abominations, namely shameful lusts, and each one defiles his neighbor's wife; so that in this you are more wicked, because he defiles the wife of his friend and neighbor. And when you do these things, do you think that you will retain the land as an inheritance? Therefore, respond to them, O prophet, and bring forth this judgment upon them from my word. I swear by myself that those who dwell in ruins and walls shall fall by the sword, and those who are in the fields or in the open country shall be devoured by beasts. And those who are in fortified cities or in strongholds and caves shall not be able to escape the wrath of God, but instead shall die by famine and pestilence. And I will make the land of Judah a desolation, so that the proud strength of Judah shall be brought low. But God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble (James 4:6). Even the mountains and all things will be deserted, and there will be such a great desolation that no one will pass through them. And then those who have relied on their multitude will have no confidence, only a few who remain. But they will come to know the magnitude of the desolation and that I am the Lord, who have made the land a desert because of all the abominations they have committed. Let these words be spoken against those who, after Jerusalem was captured and the entire region of Judea was laid waste, lived in ruins and in deserted cities and villages. Now let us turn to tropology, and according to our custom, let us engage in a wide-ranging discussion rather than a dissertation. Every heretic dwells in walls and deserts, and thinks that he possesses the land of Israel, and he says: If Abraham, through his faith alone, came to such great blessedness that his offspring would be multiplied like the sand of the sea and like the stars of the heavens, how much more will we, who are more numerous, possess the land of Israel, that is, the land of those who see God, and the land of the confession of the Lord? To which the Lord responded: He possessed the land of faith deservedly; but your unfaithfulness, rather blasphemy, will not be able to possess the land of Israel, that is, the Church. For first you eat in blood, pouring out their blood, whom you scandalize. Then you lift your eyes to your uncleannesses or abominations, which you have fixed in your mind: when you ought to imitate the ecclesiastical man, and say: To you I have lifted up my eyes, who dwell in heaven (Psalm 122:1). Thirdly, you shed blood, not giving life to those whom you have deceived, but killing. Nor is it enough for you to have done these three things, but you stand with your swords, that is, you persist in the wickedness of your judgment, and you are prepared for murders, and you commit abominations, doing those things in your bedrooms which it is shameful to speak of, and you defile the wife of your neighbor, specifically the ecclesiastical way of life, hastening daily to deceive and snatch away those embraced by Christ. And when you have done these things, do you think you will inherit the land of Israel? To whom God speaks, that whoever dwells in the ruinous gatherings of heretics, shall fall by the sword, as it is written: They have swords doubled-edged in their hands (Ps. CXLIX, 6). And in the Gospel: I come not to send peace, but a sword (Matth. X). And the servant who indulges in luxury and idleness, shall be divided, that is, shall be struck with a sword, and his portion shall be with the unbelievers (Luc. XII). And he who is in the field or in an open area, will be given to the beasts to be devoured, which the prophet, desiring to avoid, prays: Do not deliver the soul of the one confessing to you to the beasts (Ps. LXXIII, 19). But he who is in strongholds and fortified cities, of which it is written: The righteous ascends to secure cities, and he destroyed their fortifications in which the wicked trusted (Prov. XXI, 22); and he dwells in caves, of which it is said: It is written, My Father's house will be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves (Matt. XXI, 33): this person will die from the famine of the word of the Lord and the plague, and the entire earth of heretics will be turned into a desert, so that their pride will be broken, and the mountains that they promised to raise in their knowledge will be reduced to a desert. Those mountains are called Israel, because under the name of Christ they deceive and supplant those who are deceived: and no one will pass through them, nor will anyone be able to say what Moses said: 'Going through, I will see this great vision' (Exod. III, 1); for the inhabitants are of the corrupt mountains, not strangers and sojourners: so that when these things have been suffered, they may then know that He Himself is the Lord, who has made their land a desert because of the abominations they have committed. It follows: On the same day and at the same time, that is, in the twelfth year, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, when he who had fled from Jerusalem came and when the prophet spoke to those who were in the land of Judah and promised them the hope of eternal possession, and he orders the prophet to speak to the people who are in Babylon and live with him, and he rebukes them for their deceptive schemes, who desire to hear the prophet's words, not for the salvation of their souls, but for the pleasure of their ears. They were sitting beside the walls and at the doorways of houses, not desiring to enter into the understanding of the prophet; but they encourage one another and say: Come and let us hear what word comes forth from the Lord; and thus they come as a people who enter into the Church of God, and they sit before you, my people, who claim to be mine, and they do not want to do what they have heard. They seem to me to be like those who are amused by theatrical songs: and they either listen to tragedy or to comedies, and there they are delighting themselves with pleasure: so that when they have left you, they repeat those things and sing them, and with sweet sound they deceive themselves. And they will listen, he says, to your words but not do them. Such are many in the Churches even to this day, who say: Come, let us hear him, and him, rolling the words of his preaching with wondrous eloquence: they stir up applause, and shout, and wave their hands, and those things which they had neglected in their actions, once they learn that he has arrived (for it is necessary that what the prophet of God proclaims with his word should come to pass), then they will begin to approve and know that all the things they had heard were not the words of a man, but of the Lord, who spoke through the prophet and the man of the Church.


<h2 id='tocuniq295'>Book Eleven</h2>

Book Eleven

405-406 The eleventh book of explanations in Ezekiel will contain a prophecy against Gog and Magog in the final part, and it will come up to the beginning of the city situated on the mountain, and of the temple situated in it. If, with the help of the Lord and by explaining its mysteries, I can bring it all the way to the end, it will be a long and difficult task for me, and I will have to consider whether I should lay hands on the spiritual temple or openly admit my ignorance. Especially since both among the Jews and among us there is a great silence regarding its interpretation: some believe that it should be constructed in the future, while others, with good intentions but lacking knowledge, understand that what is said are spiritual things, yet they themselves do not know how they should be explained. And meanwhile, so that the care of the present work may hold us, know, O Virgin of Christ Eustochium, that you should pray for us. In a very difficult prophecy, I briefly remind you that a man of our time, not of noble birth, writing to the Emperor, said about this nation: That one is Gog, the Goth; how all the things written about it can be connected is not for me to discuss, but for those who believe this.

<h2 id='tocuniq296'>(Cap. XXXIV.)</h2>

And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds (or to the shepherds) of Israel, prophesy, and say to the shepherds: Thus says the Lord God: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves. (Or: O shepherds of Israel, do the shepherds not feed themselves?) Are not the flocks fed by the shepherds? (Or do the sheep not feed the shepherds?) You ate the curds, you clothed yourselves with the wool, and you slaughtered the fat animals, but you did not feed my flock. You did not strengthen what was weak (or comforted); and you did not heal what was sick; you did not bind up what was broken, and you did not bring back what was cast away (or wandered); you did not seek what was lost; but you commanded them with harshness, and with power (or by force) you afflicted them with labor. And my sheep were scattered because there was no shepherd (or shepherds), and they became food for all the beasts of the field, and they were scattered. My flocks (or sheep) had wandered on all the mountains and on every high hill, and my flocks (or sheep) were scattered over the face of the earth, and there was no one who sought them, I mean, there was no one who sought them (or who would bring them back). Therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: As I live, says the Lord God, because my flocks (or sheep) have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd (or shepherds), since the shepherds (Vulgate adds 'of mine') did not seek my flock, but they fed themselves and did not feed my flocks. Therefore, shepherds, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I myself will search for my flock and will rescue them from the hand of their shepherds, and I will make them cease from feeding the flock so that they will no longer be fed. I will not allow the shepherds to feed themselves (or the sheep) any longer, and I will deliver my flock (or sheep) from their mouths, and they will no longer be food for them. For thus says the Lord God: Behold, I myself will search for my sheep and will visit them as a shepherd visits his flock on the day when he is in the midst of his scattered sheep (or when it is dark and clouds are separating his sheep): thus I will visit my sheep and will deliver them from all the places where they were dispersed on the day of cloud and darkness. And I will bring them (whether female or male) from the peoples (or from the nations), and gather them (whether female or male) from the lands (or regions), and bring them (whether female or male) into their own land, and feed them (whether female or male) on the mountains of Israel, in the rivers and in all the habitations of the land. In the most fertile pastures I will feed them (whether female or male), and on the high mountains of Israel their pastures (or flocks) will be: there they will rest in green grass, and in rich pastures they will graze on the mountains of Israel. I will feed my sheep, and I will make them lie down (or rest), says the Lord God. What was lost, I will seek, and what was rejected (or gone astray), I will bring back; and what was broken, I will bind up, and what was weak, I will strengthen (or comfort); and what was fat and strong, I will watch over, and I will feed them with justice (or with judgment). But you, my flock (or my sheep), thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and goats. Was it not enough for you to feed on good pastures? Moreover, you trampled the leftovers of your pastures under your feet, and while you drank pure water, you disturbed the rest with your feet. And my sheep, which were trampled by your feet, were being fed, and those that disturbed your feet were drinking. Therefore, thus says the Lord God to you: Behold, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean (or between the strong and the weak): because you were pushing with your sides and shoulders, and with your horns you were butting all the weak animals until they were scattered abroad. I will save my flock, and it will no longer be a prey, and I will judge between sheep and sheep (or between ram and ram). And I will raise up over them (or over it) one shepherd who will feed them (or it), My servant David: he will feed them (or it), and he will be their shepherd. But I, the Lord, will be their God, and My servant David will be their prince in their midst. I, the Lord, have spoken. And I will make a covenant (or testament) of peace with them, and I will cause the most harmful beasts to cease from the land, and those who dwell in the wilderness will sleep securely in the meadows. And I will place them around my hill as a blessing, and I will give rain in its season, it will be a blessing of rain. And the trees of the field will yield their fruit, and the earth will bring forth its produce (or strength); and they will dwell in their land without fear (or in the hope of peace); and they will know that I am the Lord, when I break the chains (or yoke) of their burden, and I deliver them from the hand of those who make them serve (or oppress them). And they shall no longer be a prey to the nations, neither shall the beasts of the earth devour them: but they shall dwell securely (or in hope) without any fear. And I will raise up for them a name (or a planting of peace): and they shall no longer be consumed (or destroyed) by hunger in the land, neither shall they bear any more the reproach of the nations. And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, who is with them, and they themselves are my people, the house of Israel, says the Lord God. But you, my flock, the flock of my pasture (or sheep), you are human beings, and I am the Lord your God, says the Lord God. Often I have urged each edition to mix both, so that the magnitude of the books' vine, only in those things that do not differ much from themselves in translation. After the capture of Jerusalem, after he announced in Babylon who had fled, he spoke of those who lived in ruined Jerusalem, and then to those who were placed in captivity but nevertheless persisted in wickedness, not wanting to hear the words of the prophets: now he directs his speech to the shepherds, that is, to the leaders, whose fault the sheep, that is, the people, have been scattered. And it is to be noted that from the twelfth year, tenth month, fifth month of migration or captivity of Jechoniah, and those who were taken captive with him, until the twenty-fifth year when the temple of the city was built on the mountain and the incredible sacraments of the Church were revealed, there is no middle year, no specific time period; rather it is simply said: The word of the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man, speak to them and to those, that we may understand everything that is read for thirteen years, in different times spoken; and yet they do not have certain intervals of time between them. But the word is directed to the shepherds of Israel, whom we must understand as either kings or princes, scribes and Pharisees, and teachers of the Jewish people. Or certainly in the Evangelical people, bishops, priests, and deacons: or according to a mystical understanding, the Angels of the individual Churches, to whom John wrote in his Apocalypse (Apoc. I), and whose Angels daily behold the face of God (Matth. XVIII). And it is said first: Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who must pasture the flock of the Lord, and provide for its salvation, but hasten instead towards their own luxury. Wherefore great caution is to be exercised, and those precepts observed: Seek not to be made a judge, lest perhaps thou mayest not be able to take away iniquities (Eccli. VII, 6). And again: The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all things, and thou shalt find grace before God (Ibid. III, 29). And again: They have made thee a ruler, despise not; but be among them as one of them (Eccli. XXXII, 1). Wherefore even the Apostle says of himself that he is as a little child and as one that is still nourished by milk among the disciples (I Cor. III). And what follows: You were eating milk, and you were clothing yourselves in wool, by metaphor of shepherds speaking to princes, of whom it is also written elsewhere: Who devour my people as bread (Ps. LII, 5). Understand all food in milk: in wool, the diverse variety of clothing. But what is said: And you were slaughtering what was fat, speaks of the rich people of the populace, whom evil princes are said to slaughter in the churches, while they preach to them and dare not rebuke their vices. Concerning whom the prophet also says: My people, those who call you blessed, deceive you and overthrow the path of your feet (Isa. III, 12). Concerning whom also James speaks (James II, 3), that when they enter unto them, being adorned with costly garments and a golden ring, they are honored, and it is said to the holy poor: But you, sit on a stool, or on the ground, or stand. They do not strengthen or consolidate that which is weak. And Paul also speaks: Receive the weak (Rom. XIV, 1). And: receive the weak in faith. And: Many among you are weak and sick. To whom the divine word is sent, of which it is written in the Psalms: He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions (Ps. CV, 10). And he says that what is broken, they do not bind: not at all considering mortal wounds in the people, such as adultery, murder, sacrilege. And what is despicable, or what they have seen to be in error, they do not bring back, allowing them to be deceived by heretics. And what is lost, they do not seek, not desiring to save those who are lost, but rather to devour those who are in the Churches: but ruling over them with severity and power, which properly belongs to the arrogance of bishops, namely those who bring dishonor to the dignity of their name with their actions, and assume pride for humility, thinking that they have obtained honor, not burden: and whoever they see in the Church with authority and having the word of God, they strive to oppress. Whereas it is written in the Septuagint: And you have been tormenting what was perhaps weak. And the people of God have been scattered, either by vices or by the error of heretics: because there was not a good shepherd who would lay down his life for the sheep: but all are hirelings, who consider only their own gain from the flocks, and when they see the wolf, they flee. Because of their negligence, the flock of the Lord is devoured by the beasts of the field, of which it is written: You have set darkness, and it has become night: therein shall all the beasts of the field pass over, the lion's whelps roaring, that they may snatch, and seek from God food for themselves (Ps. 103: 20, 21). And they are scattered and wander on all the mountains, which rise up against the knowledge of God and the high hill, which through heretical pride despise the simplicity of the Church. And they are scattered over the whole face of the earth, seeking earthly things and not heavenly things. And there was no one to seek or to bring back, because they are occupied with pleasures and do not care about the losses of the flock of the Lord. Therefore, the word of the Lord is spoken against the wicked shepherds, because you have done these things that I have explained above and that are enumerated a second time: Behold, I myself will come to the shepherds and will seek my flock from their hand. It is expedient that a millstone be hung around their necks, so as not to scandalize the least of my people. And this will be their punishment, or rather their greatest punishment, that they will no longer feed my flock; that they will not feed themselves under the pretext of caring for the sheep, and gather wealth. And I will free my people from their mouths. As he says, I will seek from their hand, and I will free from their mouth what is devoured by greedy jaws. But when he seeks the sheep, he visits them as if they were sickly and emaciated, and scattered by the negligence of the shepherds; and he will free them from all places in the day of cloud and darkness, of which Joel speaks: The day of the Lord is coming, and it is near, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of cloud and mist (Joel. II, 1, 2). Then they shall be brought forth from the lands, to be led into their own land, which is the land of the living: and He Himself shall feed them on the mountains of Israel, of which David speaks: I lift up my eyes to the mountains, from where shall come my help (Ps. 121:1). And not only on the mountains, but also in the rivers, and in all the seats of the earth, in abundant pastures, and on the high mountain, of which Isaiah, and Micah prophesy more fully (Isa. 2; Mic. 4, 7): whether on the high mountains of Israel. There they will rest on green herbs, and they will say: The Lord feeds me, and nothing will be lacking to me; in the place of pasture he has placed me: He has led me up above the waters of refreshment (Ps. 22:1-2). And they will be pastured in the richest pastures on the mountains of Israel. It is an infinite promise and a hope of blessedness, when the Lord himself promises, saying: I will feed my sheep, and I will not at all commit them to evil shepherds, and I will make them to lie down, says the Lord God, so that they may rest in the bosom of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Then what was lost among the people of the nations will be sought after, and what was led astray by the persuasion of heretics will be brought back, and what was broken will be restored, and what was crushed and weak will be strengthened, so that what is written may be fulfilled: He heals their diseases and binds up their wounds (Psalm 147:3). For God does not despise a contrite and humble heart (Psalm 51:19). Therefore, the saint also says: Heal me, O Lord, for my bones are troubled (Psalm 6:2). And in the thirty-seventh Psalm (verse 4), the penitent says: There is no peace in my bones from the face of my sins; and what is fat, he says, and strong, I will keep, lest it be devoured by beasts. And he will feed his sheep in judgment, knowing to which sheep the pastures should be given. For there are different mansions with the Father (John 14). And: The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son (ibid., 5). But these things he spoke against the shepherds; now he speaks to the sheep, that is, to the people; and to the flock of both kinds of livestock, that is, of sheep and goats; and not only to the sheep and goats, but also to the rams and he-goats, who are the leaders in the flocks, to whom he says: Was it not enough for you that you were fed with the good pastures of the Scriptures? But furthermore, you trampled on the remnants of your pastures with your feet. And while you drank the pure waters of God's words, you disturbed the remaining waters with your feet, so that my people would eat and drink trampled pastures and turbid waters, and would accept your vice, which in itself was good, as corrupted and violated. Indeed, all heretics do this, in order to misconstrue the words of the Scriptures and, as much as they can, defile them. But even ecclesiastical men who do not guard the truth of the doctrines, but fabricate from their own heart, and hold their own presumption, are misled by a similar error. When they have persuaded the people that what they have made up is true, and have incited applause and cheers in a theatrical manner, they become forgetful of their own ignorance, and assuming a haughty expression, with studied words, and carefully chosen arguments, they assume the authority of masters for themselves. Let us therefore see what judgment there is between one beast and another beast: and by what judgment the good and true shepherd, who has received all judgment from the Father, judges them. Behold, he says, I myself judge between the fat beast and the lean, or between the strong and the weak. For the strong push and collide against the weak animals with their sides and shoulders, and they toss them with their horns, not knowing that according to the law the bull must be punished with the horned heifer (Exodus 21). But they were pushing on the sides, and they were fanning with horns, until they dispersed, and they drove the sheep out. For the pride of the elders, and the injustice of the leaders, they are often driven out of the Church: so that they may be scattered by the Lord, whom he himself saved. But the Lord will no longer let them go unpunished, and he will judge between sheep and sheep: not between the names of dignitaries, by whom the leaders are swollen; but between man and man, according to what each servant is of the Lord. Then he will raise up one shepherd, who says in the Gospel: I am the good shepherd (John 10:11); his servant David according to what form a servant is worthy to assume (Philippians 2); who is interpreted as David, the man of strong hand. He will feed them, and the Lord will be their God, either the Son and the Father, or certainly the shepherd according to the assumed flesh: 413 However, the Lord and God, according to the Word that was in the beginning with God. David, as the rational animal surpasses the irrational animals, will never be called a shepherd, but a prince among them, as it is written: 'One stands among you whom you do not know' (John 1:26). Then he will establish a covenant of peace with them, not of wars and discord, for his dwelling place has been made in peace (Psalm 76). But it is the peace of Christ, which surpasses all understanding (Philippians 4), who says: 'My peace I give to you; my peace I leave with you' (John 14:27). And he will cause the most malicious beasts of the earth, vices, or disturbances, by which human souls are tormented: or opposing powers, by which they are attacked, to cease. And those who dwell in the desert will sleep securely in the forests. For the Lord will reveal the hidden places of the woods, and in his temple all will declare glory (Psalm 29:9). But once the beasts are driven away, and the land is reduced to solitude, those secure in such creatures will sleep and say: The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? (Psalm 26:1) And He will place them, who sleep securely around their mountain or hill, and they shall be blessed. Then he will give rain in its season, and there shall be blessings of rains, which are promised in the blessings of Deuteronomy (Deut. XXVIII). And He will give, as it is said, the tree of life, of which it is written in Genesis (Genes. II): and the tree of wisdom, of which it is said, It is a tree of life to all who take hold of it (Prov. III, 18). And He will give its fruit, when the earth also gives its fruit: whether it be the trees of the regions, a great multitude of the saints. And the earth will give its fruit: For truth has risen from the earth (Psalm 84:12). And they shall be in their land without fear, with hope for peace, in the land of the living, in the land of the gentle, of which it is written: Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth (Matthew 5:4): so that they may know by the happiness of all things that He is the Lord: when He breaks the chains, or the iron circle of their continual oppression, by which they were almost crushed under a very grievous rule, and He will deliver them from the hand of their oppressors, or from the affliction of their servitude. For each person is a servant to the one by whom they are overcome. And the demoniac peoples will no longer be a prey; nor will the beasts of the earth devour those of whom we have spoken. But they will dwell confidently without any fear, according to the previous exposition. And, as it is said, I will raise up for them a named shoot, or a planting of peace, which is spoken of in the Gospel: I am the true vine (John 15:1). And they will no longer be diminished by hunger in the land. Therefore, hunger in earthly matters is hunger to hear the word of God, which, under a good shepherd, is celebrated with a named germ and the speech of all, and the planting of peace. It will by no means be on the earth anymore, nor will they be subjected to the reproaches of the nations, saying, 'Where is their God, the Lord?' (Psalm 113:10). And after all these things, it is known that not only is He the Lord, which He has also said above; but with the addition that He is the Lord of all, their God, with those who say in the Gospel to the Apostles, 'Behold, I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world' (Matthew 28:20). But when He Himself shall be their Lord God, then also they shall be His people, not all, but those who have deserved to be called the house of Israel. And lest we should think that all the things which were said belong to the shepherds, and the sheep, and the goats, and the rams, He solves the enigma, or rather the metaphor, and expresses it more clearly: But ye are My sheep, and the sheep of My pasture; ye are men. Therefore every divine discourse is for men, to whom He says: I am your Lord God, saith the Lord God.


<h2 id='tocuniq297'>(Cap. XXXV.)</h2>

(Chapter XXXV.) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it, and say to it, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you desolate and a wasteland. I will demolish your cities and make you deserted, and you will know that I am the Lord; because you have been an everlasting enemy and have confined the sons of Israel in the hand of the sword, and have acted deceitfully against the house of Israel in the time of their affliction, in the time of extreme wickedness. Therefore, I live, says the Lord God, because I will deliver you to bloodshed (or because you have sinned in blood) and blood will pursue you. And when you hate blood, blood will pursue you. And I will make Mount Seir desolate and deserted, and I will remove from it those going and returning (or men and beasts). And I will fill its mountains with the slain (or wounded): on your hills, and in your valleys, and in the ravines, those killed by the sword will fall. I will deliver you into eternal desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited: and you will know (or you will know) that I am the Lord (Vulgate adds God); because you have said: Two nations and two lands (or regions) will be mine, and I will possess them by inheritance, when the Lord was there. Therefore, as I live, says the Lord God, I will deal with you according to your anger (or enmity): and according to your zeal, which you have made, I will become known to you (Vulgate adds through them) when I judge you, and you will know that I am the Lord. I have heard all your reproaches (or the voice of your blasphemies) that you have spoken (or because you have spoken) against the mountains of Israel, saying, 'The deserts have been given to us to devour,' and you have risen up (or have vigorously spoken against me) with your mouth; and you have derogated against me (or have shouted against me) with your words: I have heard. Thus says the Lord God: Rejoicing in all the earth, I will reduce you to a wilderness: just as you have rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it has been scattered; so I will do to you: You will be scattered, O Mount Seir, and all Edom, and they will know that I am the Lord. But that which is added in the LXX, 'and they shall be consumed', is not in the Hebrew. If the word of God were always in the prophets and had a constant lodging in their hearts, Ezekiel would never so often have said, 'And the word of the Lord came to me saying'. But because of human frailty and the necessities of this life, it sometimes departed from them. Therefore, John the Baptist speaks: 'He who sent me to baptize, said to me: On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon him, it is he (John 1:33)'." } For it would never be proper in Christ what is added, and remaining in him, unless sometimes it would depart from others. Otherwise, God speaks to Moses: I will take away from the spirit that is in you (Num. XI, 17): which certainly he would not have, unless it descended to him from the Lord. But the prophecy of this whole chapter is against mount Seir, namely the sons of Esau and Edom, who are called Idumeans in Greek and in our language, because in a time of necessity and distress, when Judah was being captured by the Babylonians, they insulted them and they thought that the land was handed over to them to possess, and not only did they not receive their brothers, namely the sons of Jacob, but they persecuted them and they delivered them into the hands of the sword. Where Symmachus has interpreted more clearly: You have hated your own blood, and blood will persecute you. However, it is prophesied that he himself will be captured and brought into eternal solitude, and at the end of things, he will recognize that God is the judge, because he has said: There are two nations and two regions that belong to me; either the Edomites and the Jews, or certainly the Jews and the Israelites, specifically the twelve tribes. And you have spoken concerning the mountains of Israel, saying: Desolate places have been given to us to devour, not realizing that this blasphemy was against God. And it follows: Let all the earth rejoice, I will bring you into solitude. And the meaning is: when all the earth of Judaea will have received its former state, you will remain in eternal solitude. And what is implied: Just as you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it had been scattered, so I will do to you. In the LXX it is not included, but it is added with asterisks from Theodotion's edition. But all the wrath of God advances there against the mountain of Seir, so that when it is scattered, both it and all of Edom may know that he is the Lord. I have said these things quickly according to the history and the meaning rather than the words. I will move on to anagoge and, in the interest of brevity, I will briefly touch on a few points. Put, he says, or turn your face towards Mount Seir. And significantly he says, turn, from one prophecy to another prophecy. But it is not the face of the body, but of the soul, about which the Apostle says: But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord (II Cor. III, 18). But Mount Seir, which means rough and hairy, should be understood in a negative sense, as it presided over the people of the sons of Esau, and stood against the people of Judah, that is, the confession and true faith. But if a wise reader opposes this, how Seir, that is, rough and hairy, can be understood in a negative sense, since Elijah was also called a hairy man (2 Kings 1): I will briefly answer, it is written of Esau that he was red, and like a hairy skin (Genesis 25): but of Elijah, that he was only a hairy man. In Esau, who was bloodthirsty and violent, he is compared to the roughness of a hairy skin, which is a sign of human works and of his own death; in Elijah, it is an indication of manliness. Therefore, his dwelling in solitude and his austere way of life demonstrated not only a man, but a very strong man. Furthermore, Jacob, who had supplanted Esau and received his birthright (Genesis, X), is called light and polished because he simply lived at home and was not a hunter like the giant Nimrod. Therefore let us see what God commands to be said to the mountain, or against the mountain of Seir. Behold, I will not send Angels to you, O mountain of Seir, nor will I make use of ministers, but I myself will come to you, and I will stretch out my hand upon you, and I will assume the appearance of one striking, and I will make you desolate and deserted, who were dwelt in wickedly, and had many partners in your impiety, to the extent that you even built cities and claimed them as your own empire. Now, when you are desolate with your cities, which Jeremiah is ordered to destroy and uncover (Jerem. I, LI), in that you will succeed in building good cities in their place, you will know that I am the Lord, whom you could not know before your solitude. But the whole cause of sin is that you have been an eternal enemy. Hence the psalm says, 'Be angry and do not sin' (Psalm 4:5), so that we may quickly reconcile with our enemies and turn hatred into love. However, Seir is not such a mountain that encloses eternal enmities or besieges the children of Israel with deceit and the sword in hand. From this we understand that whoever takes up the sword against the children of God, acts deceitfully, besieges them, shall be handed over to the sword, just as Seir did in times of extreme wickedness, when the days are evil and the world is placed in the hands of the wicked (1 John 5), and with the increase of wickedness, the love of many grows cold. But there is another sin of Mount Seir: that because he hated the blood of the just, which he desired to shed in every persecution, he himself suffers persecution from that blood. And so the souls under the altar of the saints cry out and implore vengeance from the Lord for their blood (Apoc. VI). And they are taken away from Mount Seir, going and returning, that is, every inhabitant, whether men or animals that are saved in the Church, of whom it is written: You will save men and animals, O Lord (Psal. XXXV, 5). What is destroyed on Mount Seir is both those who seem to have some reason; and those who are content with simple faith, at God's command, may perish. And his mountains are filled with the wounded and the slain. And not only the mountains, which have reached the peak of impiety: but also the hills, which are the lower disciples of Mount Seir, and the valleys that are depressed in the depths, or the torrents, which have turbid waters, collected here and there, coming from pride, or, according to the LXX, the fields (or plains), which are in the middle between hills and valleys. All those who are killed will fall by the sword of the Lord, and his outstretched hand, striking them, so that they may be reduced to eternal desolation; and if they were cities, that is, the meeting places of evil dwellings, let them perish and cease to have a consensus in the wrong direction, and let their languages be divided (Gen. XI), so that they may not be able to build a tower of blasphemy against God; and reduced to desolation and wilderness, let them know that he himself is the Lord. It is not enough to have said so much about Mount Seir, as the previous discourse narrated; but he also spoke this through pride: 'I have two nations, and two lands or regions, namely Idumea and Judaea, and I will possess heretics and the Ecclesiastics equally.' And this, he said, when the Lord was there, who presided over his people. Therefore the Lord swears and says: 'As I live, says the Lord God, I will make myself known to you, and you will know that I have known your reproaches and blasphemies, not from any other person, but from myself, I have heard what you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying: 'They have been given to us as a desert to devour.' We must receive the mountains of Israel, Moses, prophets, and apostles, whom heretics and the prince of heretics think they have handed over to devour: when either rarely or not at all is found in the church, who can fight for the mountains of the Lord and defend their tearing with their own voice. And you have risen up, he says, against me with your mouth, whether you have spoken magnificently, not as you think against the mountains, but through them against me, and you have asked (or rather demanded) against me or cried out against me. For all your prayers, O mountain of Seir, and the companions of the mountain of Seir, of which it was said above (above, in the same place): I will fill its mountains, and hills, and valleys, and plains, or torrents, were against me: certainly not prayers and supplications, as you think towards God, but shouts, vociferations, and blasphemies. Therefore, the Lord threatens and says: Just as you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, when it was scattered and torn apart by your persecutions and dispersed throughout the whole world: so I will do to you. For the whole earth of the living rejoices, and the land of the saints, and all those converted to the service of God, you will be scattered, O rough mountain, O hairy mountain, and all of Edom, dedicated as they are to earthly works, and given to bloodshed and slaughter, so that you may then know that I am the Lord, who spoke elsewhere: I am the Lord your God.

<h2 id='tocuniq298'>(Cap. XXXVI.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 36, Verses 1 and following) 'And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say: Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord God: Because the enemy has said of you, 'Aha!' and, 'The ancient heights have become our possession,' therefore prophesy, and say: Thus says the Lord God: Because you have been desolate and crushed on all sides, and become a possession of the rest of the nations, and you have become the talk and evil gossip of the people (or nations).' Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus says the Lord God to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, the valleys, and the desolate and forsaken walls and the cities that have been depopulated and mocked (or trampled) by the remaining nations all around. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Because I have spoken in the fire of my zeal concerning the remaining nations and all of Edom, who have taken possession of my land for themselves with joy (or with a sword), and with all their heart and soul, and have cast it out to devastate (or despise with hatred the souls, to overthrow them in destruction). Therefore he says (( Vulg. he is silent)), prophesy over the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, to the ridges and valleys, thus says the Lord God: Behold, in my zeal and in my fury I have spoken, because you have endured the disgrace (or reproach) of the nations. Therefore thus says the Lord God (or Adonai the Lord): I have lifted (or will lift) my hand, that the nations around you themselves may bear their disgrace (or shame). But you, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people Israel, for they are about to come. For behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown. And I will multiply people on you, the whole house of Israel, all of it. The cities shall be inhabited and the waste places rebuilt. And I will multiply on you man and beast, and they shall multiply and be fruitful. And I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times, and will do more good to you than ever before. Then you will know that I am the Lord. And I will bring (or generate) upon you, my people Israel, and they shall possess you (or you), and you shall (or you will) become an inheritance, and you shall no longer be without them (or they shall no longer make you childless). Thus says the Lord God: Because they have said of you (or to you), devourer of men and suffocater of your nation: therefore you shall no longer eat men, and you shall no longer kill your nation, says the Lord God: and I will no longer make you (or make you) a hearer of the confusion (or disgrace) of nations, and you shall not bear (or you shall not bear) the reproaches of peoples, and you shall no longer lose your nation (or your nation shall no longer be without children), says the Lord God. Above is set forth the face of the prophet, or rather, he turns towards Mount Seir: here the Son of Man speaks to the mountains, or rather, above the mountains of Israel, which are commanded to hear the word of God. And so that I may delay the allegory for a little while, the brief meaning of all the prophecies concerning the mountains of Israel is this: Because the enemy, that is, Mount Seir, has insulted you and thought that he would possess you forever, and the once lofty heights of the Lord now deserted have become his inheritance, and not only has he said this, but he has also possessed you for some time, to the extent that he spoke arrogantly against you, so that you would be a disgrace to all nations. Therefore, thus says the Lord God, not only to Mount Seir, but also to its mountains and hills, its torrents and valleys, its desolate and devastated places, and its abandoned cities: because of the fire of his jealousy, and indeed against all nations, but particularly against Edom, which, he says, along with the other nations, has possessed my land and possessed it with the sword, and possessed it with all his heart, in order to drive out the inhabitants and lay waste to the land. Therefore, speak, says the prophet, concerning the land of Israel, and you will say to the mountains, and the hills, and the ridges (which in the Septuagint are interpreted as 'wooded places,' which we understand as forested areas) and the valleys. This is what the Lord God says: in my zeal and in my fury, I will be the avenger of your disgrace, and I will raise my hand, so that the nations around you may bear their shame and confusion: but you, O mountains of Israel, will bring forth branches and send out shoots, or as in the Septuagint, produce grapes, with which my people Israel will be satisfied. What you may not think will happen after a long time, is near, imminent, and will come. And so that this does not seem difficult to you, I myself will come to you, and those who have gone away from you will return to you, so that you may reclaim your former culture, and all things may be filled with seed, so that many may be among you, and cities that were previously destroyed may be inhabited. And I will not only multiply men, but also animals will multiply and increase, and I will make you dwell as in the beginning, when Moses led two and a half tribes across the Jordan to take possession, across the Jordan (Num. XXXII), and under Joshua the son of Nun, the other nine and a half tribes possessed the land of Judah (Jos. I, and XIII): and I will give you much greater blessings than you had in the beginning before you experienced various captivities. And when I have done this to you, then you will know that I am the Lord. And you, O land of Israel, will be filled, says the Lord God of My people, who will inherit you. And you will be their possession, and you will no longer be without children. But when your inhabitants multiply, O mountains of Israel, then your enemies will no longer say that you devour men and are without children, but instead you will multiply men, and your posterity will produce a very large offspring. You will no longer hear, he said, nor will you endure the confusion of the nations, but you will not lose your people, so that you may one day endure captivity, because the Lord has spoken. This we will say in a paraphrased manner according to the Jewish custom, which they expect in the kingdom of a thousand years, when they assert that the city of Jerusalem will be rebuilt, and the temple, which is described at the end of this volume, and the happiness of all things, which some believe were fulfilled under Zerubbabel. But how can this be fulfilled, when it is said: 'And I will cause you to dwell as in the beginning, and I will give you greater blessings than you had from the beginning?' For under Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, only a few of the people were restored, and they themselves obeyed the Medes and Persians, and later the Macedonians, Egyptians, and Romans, and served various foreign kings, up to Titus and Vespasian, and continue to serve even now. So it is impossible for the last prophecy to be fulfilled: 'You will no longer bear the reproach of the nations, and you will not lose your people anymore.' And because it is now lengthy to speak against the Jewish teaching and their indulgence in food and drink, who desire everything earthly and say, 'Let us eat and drink,' of whom the Apostle also speaks: 'Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food,' but God will destroy both it and them (I Cor. VI, 13), let us briefly explain: now let us move on to spiritual understanding, according to which we have also interpreted the later parts of Isaiah. For we do not, like the Jews, await a Jerusalem adorned and golden from heaven, which they call the 'second Law', nor will we once again endure the injury of circumcision, nor offer the sacrifices of bulls and rams, nor will we sleep in the leisure of the Sabbath. This is also the belief of many of our people, especially Tertullian's book, titled 'On the Hope of the Faithful', and Lactantius' seventh volume of 'Institutions', as well as the frequent explanations of Victorinus of Pettau, and our recent Severus in a dialogue titled 'To Gallicus'. And in order to mention both Greeks, and the first and the last, [let us speak of] Irenaeus and Apollinarius. 423 So we, the mountains of Israel, will say that the prophets and apostles are those who hear the word of God, and to whom the enemy devil insulted, saying: ‘Well done, once high mountains, about which it is written: “Mountains are around it and the Lord is around his people”’ (Ps. CXXIV, 2). They were given to me as a possession when they were devastated by the narrowness of persecution, trampled around, made an inheritance to the remaining nations, and blasphemed by all. Therefore, the Lord speaks of the mountains and desolate places, not only the mountains, but also the lower places and through each level in the land of Judah, that is, on the mountain of the Church, of which it is written: A city placed on a mountain cannot be hidden (Matth. V, 14); and on hills and valleys, in which faith is increased by the winter of persecutions and the storm of afflictions. Also, in these valleys, which are depressed by humility, and in the deserted Churches and walls, and in the whole world, where the gatherings of Churches are abandoned: such as the persecution was under Diocletian and Maximian in the whole world, by which the Churches were proscribed and devastated: when all the nations of the Gentiles and the heretics mocked the Church around, because it spoke in the fire of its zeal, and specifically against Edom, which wanted to carry the image of the earthly, having set aside the image of the heavenly (I Cor. XV). For they have given the land of God as their inheritance, and with all their heart and soul they have persecuted the Church of the Lord, and have driven it out of its seats, and have laid it waste. But what profit have the nations gained, what benefit have the heathen peoples obtained by insulting the land of the Lord, when the Lord speaks to it, and to its mountains, hills, and ridges, or to the wooded places that were flourishing with the beauty of paradise; and to the hills that we have mentioned above, He has spoken in His zeal and rage, and has lifted His hand against the adversaries who have persecuted the Church, to bring them confusion and disgrace? Then, with the persecutors killed and peace restored to the Church, the mountains of Israel, namely the Apostles and Apostolic men, will produce their trees and extend their branches, bringing forth grapes to be crushed in the winepress of the Lord, from which the must is poured, which will intoxicate the peoples of the believers, and the wine that rejoices the heart of man (Psalm 103): so that all the fruit of the mountains, from which the bread that comes down from heaven is made, may be eaten by the people of God, Israel. And let us not perhaps despair in persecutions, it is added: The time is near for it to come. For he who is coming will come, and will not delay (Habakkuk II, 3). Therefore, he promises his coming to the mountains, and to those who have endured in tribulations, and he promises that after the heat of persecution, the earth, previously harvested by the plow of Christ, will exercise all the virtues and receive the seed from which men and the whole house of Israel will be born and multiplied. And when the cities, that is, the Churches of the believers, were inhabited again by returning crowds, then not only men who were knowledgeable in Scriptures, but also animals and the simple believers will multiply and grow, and the Churches will be inhabited as in the beginning, that is, before the persecution existed, and they will flourish with greater goods than they had from the beginning, adorned with the victories of martyrs. And then they will know that He is the Lord, who restores His people to their former state, that they may possess the Churches, and that the Churches themselves may be the inheritance of the Church, and no longer without children, whom they had lost in persecution. Therefore, the prophet is commanded to speak to the land of the meek, the land of the living, or to the mountains of Israel, and to say: You shall no longer suffer the reproach of the persecutors, nor shall they insult your slain people, as though they were sheep for slaughter. For with peace restored, all disgrace shall cease, nor shall you endure confusion and shame among the various circuitings, but you shall have your nation and your people, for the truth of the promise, as spoken by the Lord, is confirmed.

<h2 id='tocuniq299'>(Vers. 16 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 16 onwards) And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, the house of Israel have dwelt (or dwells) in their own land and have defiled it with their ways and their idols. Their ways have become unclean before me, like the uncleanness of a woman during her menstrual period. And I poured out my fury (or anger) upon them, because of the blood they had shed on the land. They defiled it with their idols, and I scattered them among the nations and dispersed them in various countries (or regions) according to their ways. I judged them for their sins, 425 and they entered the nations where they had gone and defiled my holy name, so that it was said of them, 'This is the people of the Lord, and they have come out of his land.' And I spared my holy name (or I spared them for the sake of my holy name) which the house of Israel had defiled among the nations they entered. Therefore, say to the house of Israel, thus says the Lord God: It is not for your sake, house of Israel, that I will act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have defiled among the nations where you have entered. And I will sanctify my great name, which has been defiled among the nations, which you have defiled in their midst, so that they may know (Vulg. adds nations) that I am the Lord, says the Lord of hosts, when I have been sanctified in you before their eyes. For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land. And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be cleansed from all your filthiness, and I will cleanse you from all your idols. And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit in the midst of you (or give it to you), and I will cause you to walk in my statutes (or my justifications), and you shall keep my judgments, and do them (or make them) (Vulg. is silent about them). And you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God. And I will save you (or I will make you safe) from all your uncleanness (or impurities), and I will call for the grain, and multiply it, and I will not give you hunger, and I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, so that you will no longer bear the reproach of famine among the nations. And you shall remember your evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations. Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord God, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel. Thus saith the Lord God; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded. And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by. And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited. And the nations shall know that have been left around you, that I the Lord have built the things that were destroyed, and have planted the things that were desolate: I the Lord have spoken, and I will do it. Thus saith the Lord God: Moreover in this shall the house of Israel find me, that I will do it for them: I will multiply them as a flock of men (or as holy sheep), as a flock of holy sheep, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts: so shall the desolate cities be filled with flocks of men (or sheep), and they shall know that I am the Lord. The things that are spoken are clear, and all the senses of the mountains of Israel, which were previously deserted and later restored, are now placed more clearly. And God gives reasons why he delivered the people of Israel into captivity, and promises, because of his mercy, to bring them back to the land of Judah and to give them much greater things than he had taken away. Some Jews attribute this to the times of Zerubbabel, when, with Cyrus, the king of the Persians loosening their captivity, many from the tribe of Judah and Benjamin were brought back to Judah. But others refer to a kingdom of a thousand years, when under Christ, whom they believe is to come, the city of Jerusalem will be built, and the temple erected, of which we will speak in the final part of this prophecy. And meanwhile, leaving aside the Jewish fables and endless genealogies, according to our custom, let us briefly go through the summary of this chapter, and discuss what it seems to us, according to ecclesiastical understanding. The house of Israel, that is, the people of the Jews, once dwelt in their land, that is, in the land of Judea, when they were brought out of Egypt; but they defiled it with their ways and their pursuits, or their idols, and they became so polluted that they were compared to the uncleanness of a menstruating woman. Because of this, God poured out his wrath upon them, for the blood of the prophets and the righteous, which they had shed upon the earth, as the Savior said in the Gospel: 'Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you' (Matthew 23:37). And again (V. 35): Amen, amen I say to you: the blood of Abel the just shall be required of this generation, from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, who was slain between the altar and the temple. Yea I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered together thy children, as the hen doth gather her chickens under her wings, and thou wouldest not? Behold, your house shall be left to you, desolate (Matt. 23). When I saw this, he said, I spared them not for their sake, but for the sake of my holy name (for I am the Creator of all) and I sanctified them and restored them to their former glory, so that I could pour out the clean water of saving Baptism upon believers and those converted from error, and cleanse them from their abominations and from all the errors with which they were occupied, and give them a new heart, that they may believe in the Son of God, and a new spirit, of which David speaks: Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me (Psalm 51:10). And it should be considered that a new heart and a new spirit is given through the pouring and sprinkling of water. But when the new heart and new spirit are given, then all hardness, which is compared to stone, will be removed from the Jewish heart, so that the heart may be like flesh, soft and tender, able to receive the spirit of God within itself, and to be inscribed with healing words. Then they will walk in the commandments of the Lord, and keep His judgments, and dwell in the land of confession, which He had given to their fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to all the holy ones and prophets, and they will be a people of God, and the Lord will be their God, which is proven in the present time. And when they are saved, the Lord will call forth the grain and multiply it. For unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone (John 12:24). And they will not tolerate hunger, not hunger for bread and thirst for water, but hunger to hear the word of God, which he endured, who came forth from the Father, and wasted all the substance he had received: when a pressing need for hunger, he fed on the husks of swine (Luke 15). Then the fruit of the tree, that is, wisdom, will be multiplied, of which it is written: The tree of life is for all who seek it (Prov. III, 18); and the produce of the field will be like Jacob, whose scent was like the scent of a full field, whom the Lord blessed (Genes. XXVII, 27). They will no longer bear the reproach of famine among the nations, which the incredulity of the Jews suffers today. But once they have attained blessedness, they will imitate the Apostle who says: I am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God (I Cor. XV, 9). And they will remember their worst ways and their ungood studies, by which they offended God. And their iniquities and their crimes, by which they previously erred, will displease them. But the Lord will attribute all these things, not for those who perished by their own error, but for the sake of his holy name. Therefore, he provokes the house of Israel to be confused and ashamed about their previous faults, and to understand their Creator. But after he has cleansed the people who believe from their sins and has caused the cities of the Church to be inhabited and has restored the ruins which had fallen in the synagogues, and the land of confession has been cultivated with the ceremonies of God, which once appeared desolate to all the holy ones who pass by the works of earthly conversation: then all will say, How is it that the land of Judah, which was once uncultivated, now has the likeness of the paradise of God; and the cities of Judah, which were deserted and deprived, and buried in their disbelief, are now upright and fortified in confession, and in the name of the Lord, the Savior? So that every creature may know, and the multitudes of angels that surround the land of Israel, that the Lord has rebuilt the cities that were laid waste, and has planted the uncultivated regions, and has fulfilled what he had promised through the prophets. And this will not be the extent of his generosity towards the people he has saved, but he will bestow far greater things. For there will be found among the house of Israel one who had been sought for a long time, and had not been found. And after he finds them, he will multiply them like sheep: not of brute animals, but of the sheep of men, which are full of reason and confession, like holy sheep and flocks of Jerusalem, in which proper worship of God and the vision of peace are, in its solemnities, when we eat the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth (1 Cor. 5), and we feed on the flesh of the Lamb and drink his blood, and in the seven weeks, and in the tabernacles of this world, we celebrate the Lord's Day, so that once deserted cities may be filled with flocks of men, and by this means they may know that he himself is the Lord, who has provided all things. According to the truth of history, or rather according to the faith of prophecy: how the people of Israel will be restored to their original state, and the remnant of the people of Judah will be saved in the Apostle Paul, and in all those who believed in the beginning from the Jews, and even today return to the Church, it is enough to say briefly. Now the same sense must be opened in the same brevity of tropology. Whoever is from the house of Israel, and sees the peace of Christ, which surpasses all understanding, dwells in his own land, that is, the Church, or in the lodging of the flesh, which was given to him by God. But if he pollutes both lands with his wicked ways, and is compared to the impurity of a menstruating woman: God will pour out his anger upon him, for the blood, either his own or that of those he has scandalized, and will pour it out upon the land, and with the perverse thoughts with which he has polluted it. Then he will be scattered among the nations, to be leveled with unbelievers, and will be winnowed in the land like chaff, to be separated from the wheat of the Church, and will be judged according to his ways. But if they do not recognize their sin in this way, but defile his holy name, then all those among whom he has lived will say: Behold the people of God, behold one who has come out of his land, indeed one who has been cast out. But if they repent and I am sanctified in their midst, then every multitude of the Gentiles will know that I will take them from the lands in which they were dispersed and bring them back to the land of the Church, and I will pour out upon them not the waters of saving Baptism, but the waters of doctrine and the word of God; and I will cleanse them from all their iniquities and from all the idols and errors they had simulated in their deceitful heart. And I will give them a new heart, which they had lost through sin, and I will renew the right spirit within their hearts. And I will remove their heart of stone, the unbelieving heart; and I will give them a heart of flesh, soft and tender; so that they may receive God's commandments; so that they may walk in my commandments and observe my judgments; which they had previously neglected, and they shall dwell in the land which I had given to their fathers, namely, the land of their masters and teachers; and once again they shall be the people of God, and the Lord shall turn to them as their God, whom they had previously offended. Then they will be saved from all their defilements, and their grain will multiply, from which heavenly bread is made; and they will no longer endure hunger for the word of God; and the tree of wisdom will multiply among them, and their chests will be filled with offspring. They will no longer be a reproach among the nations; but after God has shown them mercy, they will remember their worst ways, and they will know where they have been, and they will be displeased with their iniquities. What the Lord says, he does not do for them, but for his own mercy. Therefore, he encourages the wanderers to be confused and ashamed in their ways, and to return to the cities of the Church, which will once again be inhabited by them, and to rebuild everything that has been destroyed in them. They should return to their previous ceremonies, and the land, which was once deserted and seen as desolate by both residents and foreigners passing through, should return to its former state. And everyone will marvel and say: 'Once a barren land, a deserted land, in which all virtues perished, now it has become like a garden of pleasure and the paradise of God.' And the once deserted cities, which did not have God as their guest and were deprived of the Holy Spirit, and were buried in unbelief, will be fortified by the faith of Christ, so that all around may know that the Lord has built up scattered souls, planted in them, and nurtured the trees of all virtues. And he himself will fulfill the things he promised with his words. And again, the prophetic discourse exhorts the penitents, that even when they have returned to the Church, they always seek the Lord, and find Him: so that the flocks of those returning may multiply, not of beasts and brute animals, but flocks of men, who are full of faith and reason, holy flocks, flocks of the city of Jerusalem, in all the solemnities which the mercy of God has received; so that after the multitude of such flocks has filled the cities of the Lord, then all may know that He is the Lord.


<h2 id='tocuniq300'>(Cap. XXXVII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 37, Verses 1 and following) In 431, the hand of the Lord came upon me, and He led me in the Spirit of the Lord and placed me in the middle of a field that was full of bones. He guided me around and around among them. There were many bones lying on the surface of the land, and they were very dry. Then He asked me, 'Son of man, can these bones live?' And I replied, 'O Lord God, You alone know the answer to that.' Then He said to me, 'Prophesy to these bones and say to them, 'Dry bones, listen to the word of the Lord! This is what the Lord God says to these bones: I will make breath enter you, and you will come to life. I will attach tendons to you and make flesh grow on you and cover you with skin. I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord.' And I prophesied as He commanded me: and there was a noise and behold a commotion and the bones came together, each one to its joint. And I saw, and behold, upon them there were sinews, and flesh came up, and skin was stretched out over them above, but there was no breath in them. And He said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit: Thus says the Lord God: Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. And I prophesied as he commanded me, and the spirit came into them, and they lived: and there stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army. Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts. Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD. LXX: And the hand of the Lord came upon me, and he led me out in the spirit of the Lord, and he set me down in the middle of a field, and it was full of human bones. And he led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the field, and they were very dry. And he said to me, 'Son of man, can these bones live?' And I answered, 'O Lord God, you know.' Then he said to me, 'Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord God to these bones: 432 Behold, I will bring upon you the breath of life, and I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord.' And I prophesied as he commanded me: and there was a voice when I prophesied, and behold a commotion: and the bones came together, bone to his bone. And I saw, and behold the sinews and the flesh came up upon them: and the skin stretched out over them, but there was no spirit in them. And he said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, O son of man, and say to the spirit: Thus saith the Lord God: Come, spirit, from the four winds, and blow upon these slain, and let them live. And I prophesied as He commanded me, and the spirit entered into them, and they lived and stood up upon their feet: an exceeding great army. Then He said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts. Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it, and performed it, saith the Lord God. The vision is famous and celebrated by the reading of all the Churches of Christ; for this very reason I have placed both editions in their entirety, so that no false accusation may be made against us by the Hebrews, if, at least, there may be any discrepancy in the words. For they are accustomed to laugh at us, and to raise their eyebrows and to belch out a knowledge of the Scriptures with inflated cheeks, if I may not say a disagreement of meanings (which, if there is, is rightly condemned), if they are able to demonstrate any dissonance of words in our books. Those who believe in the resurrection, which is believed by both Jews and Christians to be a word of God, often say the following: 'The hand of the Lord has come upon the prophet,' that is, the Lord and Savior through whom the Father has done all things. For all things were made through him, and without him, nothing that was made exists. And he said, 'The spirit of the Lord lifted me up,' and it is understood that it was the hand of the Lord. But he was lifted up in the spirit, not in the body, but outside of the body, and he was placed, or rather, sent in the middle of a field that was full of human bones. Rest was not allowed for him, but he made all the bones go around, which were not covered by the ground but were lying on the field. And there were not just a few, but very many, and due to their age, they were extremely dry and had no moisture in them. And when the divine word had asked him whether he believed that these bones could live, he answered: Lord God, you know, who possess full knowledge of things to come. And the Lord said to him: Prophesy concerning these bones, and say to them: Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. It is truly amazing how he spoke to dry bones, which before had no nerves, flesh, skin, or life-giving spirit from God, and they were able to hear the word. And first the bones are bound together with the ligaments of the nerves; then they are filled with flesh, and above that the skin is stretched out for beauty, which covers the ugliness of the exposed flesh; and then they receive a spirit, which makes them alive, and after they have lived, then they know that He is the Lord. Thus, as the prophet had commanded, there was immediately a shaking, and the bones were joined together, bound with nerves, filled with flesh, covered with skin; and human bodies lay there without breath. Therefore, the prophet prophesies concerning the spirit, and says: Thus says the Lord God: Come, spirit, from the four winds, that is, from the four corners of the world, so that just as in the first creation of man, God breathed into his face and he became a living soul (Gen. 2:7), so also in the second creation, that is, the resurrection of the dead, by the breath of the spirit, may they be made alive; those who entered human bodies immediately lived and stood on their feet. And the resurrection of the dead is called a gathering, or the Church of many (Psalm 103:30), and as it is stated in Hebrew, a great army; and it is fulfilled in time: Send forth Your spirit, and they shall be created, and You shall renew the face of the earth. But what follows: And He said to me: Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel, seems to raise a question, because it is not about the general resurrection, but specifically about the resurrection of the house of Israel, which says: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost, and we are completely cut off. With those saying these things, Ezekiel is compelled to prophesy a third time, and to say to the dry bones: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will open your graves. In which it is asked: If he opens the tombs, how did he say before: There were indeed many things over the face of the field, and very dry. And I will bring you out of your tombs, my people, according to that which is written in the Gospel: The hour is coming; when those who are in the tombs will hear the voice of the Son of God, and they will come forth who have done good to the resurrection of life (John 5:28-29). And again: Those who have heard will live (Ibid.). And if, as some believe, the divine discourse speaks of the general resurrection, why was it necessary to say specifically: And I will bring you into the land of Israel, when the dead should rise from all parts of the world in which they were buried? And when, he says, I bring you out of your tombs, and I give my spirit in you, and you live, then I will make you rest upon your own soil; so that after you have rested in the land of Israel, then you may know that I am the Lord, who has fulfilled my promises by my actions. Therefore, when they understand these things about the general resurrection, that which seems to pose a question is this: 'These bones are the whole house of Israel; they refer to the resurrection of the saints, of which the Apostle John also speaks in the Apocalypse: Blessed and holy is he who has a part in the first resurrection; over him, the second death has no power.' (Rev. 20:6) This clearly indicates that there is a different resurrection for the saints and a different one for the sinners. And in the first psalm it is said: The wicked do not rise in judgment, nor sinners in the council of the just. But the land of Israel, which the Lord promises to those who rise, they confirm to be that about which it is written: Blessed are the meek, for they shall possess the land. (Matt. 5:4). And: I will please the Lord in the land of the living (Ps. 114:9). These things are spoken by those who assume that Ezekiel wrote about the general resurrection, as we have said. But those who interpret in this way should not cause us envy, because by interpreting this passage differently, we seemed to deny the resurrection. For we know that there are much stronger testimonies, in which there is no doubt, found in the Holy Scriptures, such as this from Job: 'You will raise up (or 'raise me up') my flesh, which supports all this' (Job 19). And in Daniel: 'Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will rise, some to everlasting life, and some to shame, and everlasting contempt' (Daniel 12:2). And in the Gospel: Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell (Matt. X, 28). And the apostle Paul: He who will give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit dwelling in you (Rom. VIII, 11), and many others. From which it is clear that we do not deny the resurrection, but we do not contend with these unwritten things about the resurrection, and through the parable of the resurrection, it is prophesied about the restoration of Israel, which was captive in Babylon at that time. And we will not immediately give occasion to heretics, if we deny that these things are understood of the common resurrection. For the likeness of the resurrection is never set forth to signify the restoration of the Israelitish people, unless the resurrection itself be valid and future belief secured; because no one confirms uncertainties concerning things that do not exist. And our whole assertion tends to this, that just as it seems incredible that a resurrection should be promised to bones that are dry and consumed with age, yet what is promised will certainly come to pass; so the restoration also of the people of Israel, who were led into captivity and are scattered throughout the whole world, seems indeed incredible to those who do not know the power of God, yet it will come to pass; because, says He, 'I am the Lord; I have spoken, and I will do as I have promised.' Finally, in the earlier prophecy, in which the ancient status of Israel is promised on the mountains, the Lord says to them: And I will turn to you and you shall be tilled and sown, and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel (Ezekiel 36:9-10): and again, that the house of Israel will dwell in its own land, which was once uncultivated, but will become like a garden of delight, and the deserted and destitute cities will be fortified; and the house of Israel will multiply in them, like a flock of sheep, and other things that pertain to the same meaning, which is now said figuratively and metaphorically of dry bones, and those who have no moisture of life, fulfilling what is written in the Gospel: What is impossible with men is possible with God (Matthew 19:26). But all these things confirm the Jews, either under Zerubbabel, as I said before, when a great commotion occurred; and the kingdom of the Chaldeans was transferred to the Medes and Persians: or in the presence of their Christ, whom they believe is to come. But we, spiritually, after the completion of the Lord Savior's cross, commemorate; and daily this happens, especially to those who, like Lazarus, are bound by the bands of their sins, are raised up at the voice of the Lord (John 11); and they truly are the house of Israel, once desolate, and having no hope of salvation: but when the spirit of grace enters into themselves, and the Lord stretches out his hand, they are liberated from the depths of hell: and those who previously said, 'Lord God, you know these things,' afterwards hear, being delivered: 'O you of little faith, why did you doubt?' (Matthew 14:31).


<h2 id='tocuniq301'>(Vers. 15, seq.)</h2>

(Verse 15, onward) 'And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, take for yourself one piece of wood and write on it 'Judah' and the children of Israel, his companions, and take another piece of wood and write on it 'Joseph,' the wood of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel, his companions. And join them together as one piece of wood in your hand. But when the children of your people speak to you, saying: Will you not tell us what you mean by these?' You shall speak to them: thus says the Lord God: Behold, I will take the wood of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, which are joined to him: and I will give them together with the wood of Juda, and I will make them one wood: and they shall be one in my hand. And the woods upon which thou hast written shall be in thy hand before their eyes: and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from the midst of the nations, whither they are gone: and I will gather them on every side, and will bring them to their own land. And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king over them all. And there shall no longer be two nations, nor shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more; neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, and with their abominations, and with all their iniquities. And I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. And my servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them. And they shall dwell upon the land which I have given to my servant Jacob, where your fathers have dwelt, and they shall dwell upon it, they and their children, and their children's children, forever. And my servant David shall be their prince forever. And I will establish a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them, and I will bless them and multiply them, and I will put my sanctuary in their midst forever. And my tabernacle shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And the nations shall know that I am the Lord who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctification is in their midst forever. LXX: And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: And you, son of man, take for yourself one staff, and write on it: Judah, and the children of Israel who are associated with him. And take for yourself another staff, and write on it: Joseph, the staff of Ephraim and all the children of Israel who are associated with him, and join them together in one staff for yourself, so that you may connect them, and they shall be in your hand. And it shall come to pass, when the children of Israel shall say unto thee, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these? And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand. And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes. And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land: And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all. And they shall no longer be divided into two nations, nor shall they be divided into two kingdoms, so that they may no longer defile themselves with their idols and their stumbling blocks, and with all their abominations. And I will deliver them from all their iniquities, in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them and they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them a God. And my servant David shall be their prince in the midst of them, and there shall be one shepherd for all them, because they shall walk in my commandments and keep my judgments, and do them. And they shall dwell in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, where their fathers dwelt, and they shall dwell in it, they and their children, and their children’s children, for ever: and my servant David shall be their prince for ever. And I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will establish them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. And my tabernacle shall be with them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And the nations shall know that I am the Lord who sanctifies you, when my sanctuaries are in their midst forever." (Ezekiel 37) The history of the Kings (3 Kings 12) tells that under Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, the twelve tribes were divided, and two, namely Judah and Benjamin, followed Rehoboam, who reigned in Jerusalem, and his kingdom was called Judah. But the other ten tribes, who said, "We have no portion in David, nor inheritance in the son of Jesse," submitted their necks and served Jeroboam, the son of Nebat from the tribe of Ephraim, who was the son of Joseph. They were mostly called the people of old by the name of Israel. And for a long time, the kingdom of Judah and Israel had strife against each other and obeyed their own kings (4 Kings 25). And the first ten tribes were captured by the Assyrians, and after some time, those who were called Judah were taken captive by the Chaldeans and brought into Babylon, and the tribe of Judah was restored to the ancient land after seventy years. But the ten tribes that were called Israel still serve as captives in the mountains and cities of Media to this day (4 Kings 25). Therefore, the present prophecy promises from the mouth of the Lord that both kingdoms, that is, the kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel, will be joined together; and the scepter of Ephraim, who is descended from the line of Joseph, will be taken away, along with the other tribes that are united with him, and be joined to the scepter of Judah, so that they are not called Judah and Israel, but are called Judah by one name; and under the figure of the prophet who precedes in the type of the Lord Savior, they are held not with two hands, but with the one hand of Christ. For he says that he will gather the children of Israel from among the nations to which they were carried captive, and will bring them back to the land and mountains of Israel, of which we have read above; and that he will call them one nation, to be ruled by one king; so that they may no longer defile themselves with idols and their abominations, but when they have been freed from the seats of captivity in which they have sinned, they may be cleansed from all their vices and become the people of God, so that the Lord may be their God. And the servant, he said, David, my king, will reign over them (Luke I). Concerning whom the Angel speaks in the Gospel, that he will reign over the house of Jacob, and his kingdom will have no end: and his mercy will be so great that he will be called not only king, but also shepherd, because he softens the proud name of emperor with the name of shepherd. After they have become one nation, and have dwelt in the land of Israel and the mountains, they will walk in all the judgments of the Lord and keep his commandments; but they will not dwell in any other land, but in the one that he gave to his servant Jacob, in which their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the rest of the saints lived, and not only will they themselves dwell there, but also their sons and grandsons, according to that passage from Virgil (Aeneid, Book IV):

And of the sons who will be born from them; and let them dwell not for a short time, but forever. But you want to know, he says, who this king and shepherd is? He is the one of whom I have spoken before, my servant David. Though he was in the form of God, he did not consider equality with God something to be grasped; but he emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, and became obedient to the Father unto death, even death on a cross (Philippians 2:6-8). And when they are under such a king, I will make a covenant of peace with them, not like in the Old Testament of strife and wars, but a covenant of peace that surpasses all understanding, of which the Savior speaks to the Apostles: My peace I give to you, my peace I leave with you (John 14:27). And the prophet says: His dwelling place is in peace (Psalm 76:2). When he has established and strengthened them in the Church, so that they can say: He set my feet upon a rock (Psalm 40:3), then they will increase either in number of believers or in the multiplication of virtues. And I will give, he says, my sanctification, or sanctuary among them forever, which the Jews interpret as the temple that was built by Zerubbabel. But how can this be fulfilled, when that temple that was built by Zerubbabel and later restored by many was burned by the Roman fire? All of these things must be referred to the Church and to the times of the Savior, when his tabernacle was placed in the Church: where he became our God, and we became his people. And the progress of all is that they may know that He Himself is the Lord and He Himself sanctifies Israel, not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. When His sanctification was made in the midst of the believers forever. But when the Lord rejected the tribe of Ephraim and chose the tribe of Judah, and in the Psalms we read, in which it is written: And He rejected the tent of Joseph and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim; but He chose the tribe of Judah (Ps. LXXVII, 67, 68), of which it is written: The prince shall not fail from Judah, nor a ruler from his thighs, until He comes to whom it is reserved, and He shall be the expectation of the nations (Gen. XLIX, 10). For truly in the coming of the Savior Lord, two rods, and as it is written in Hebrew, two pieces of wood are joined together in one scepter, and in the baptism of Christ they are formerly separated and united: so that they may become one new man, and one nation, neither polluted any longer with idols and abominations; but may be the people of God, and Christ shall rule over them, and they shall dwell upon the gentle earth, the land of the living, which he had given to his servant Jacob, who supplanted the people of Israel in the womb of their mother. But if we wish to understand according to the prophecy of Hosea, which is directed almost entirely to the ten tribes, that is, to Joseph and Ephraim, and Samaria, and Israel, the false knowledge of the name, and the various heretical sects, we shall say this: in the last time, when the fullness of the Gentiles has entered, and all Israel has been saved (Rom. 11), then also the adversaries of the people, who have fought against the house of Judah and the confession of the Church, shall submit to the Church's faith, and abandoning all errors and the princes of this world who are destroyed, and their patriarchs, who have led them into the abyss of blasphemies, shall arise and forsake their idols and abominations, which they have devised in their hearts, and from all the places where they have sinned, they shall pass over to the Church's faith, and be cleansed, and be the people of Christ, and He shall be their God: these things I know that the prophet Hosea has spoken more fully. But if the Jews and the Christians who Judaize wish to refer this to a thousand years, they are compelled by necessity to undertake all these things: to receive all those who will be saved and to dwell in the land of Israel, to build Jerusalem, to construct the temple, to perform all the ceremonies of the Law, to observe the Sabbath, to accept the injury of circumcision, to eat and drink, and to consider abundance of wealth as the highest blessedness and as the measure of all resources. Yet the Apostle says: Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food; and God will destroy both one and the other (1 Corinthians 6:13). But just as in the type of the resurrection the superior prophetic sermon demonstrated the resurrection of the Jewish people, not carnal but spiritual: so this prophecy pertains not at all to the flesh but to the happiness of the soul, and to the faith of Christ, by which we are cleansed in baptism, whose kingdom is everlasting, so that we do not expect things that have already happened, and we know that they are transacted daily.

<h2 id='tocuniq302'>(Cap. XXXVIII.)</h2>

(Chapter XXXVIII.) \"And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, set your face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him. And you shall say to him: Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and I will turn you around and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great multitude with bucklers and shields, wielding swords: Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya, all of them with shield and helmet; Gomer and all its troops; the house of Togarmah from the far north and all its troops, and many peoples with you.\ Prepare and equip yourself, and all your multitude that has gathered to you, and be a commandment to them (or and you will be for me a custody). After many days you will be visited: in the last ((or last)) years you will come to the land that has turned (or perverted) by the sword: and it has gathered from many peoples to the mountain ((or mountains)) (or land) of Israel, who have been desert always: this has been brought out from the peoples and all will confidently dwell [or have dwelt] in it. But when you come like a storm, and like a cloud, to cover the earth you and all your armies, and many peoples (or nations) with you. Thus says the Lord God: On that day, thoughts will rise up in your heart, etcogitabis cogitationem pessimam, et dices: Ascendam ad terram (sive super terram) absque muro (sive abjectam): veniam ad quiescentes habitantesque secure (sive in pace): omnes ((Vulg. addit hi)) habitant sine muro, vectes et portae non sunt eis: ut diripias spolia, et invadas praedam: ut inferas manum tuam super eos qui deserti fuerant, et postea restituti, et super populum qui est congregatus ex gentibus, qui possidere coepit, et esse habitator umbilici terrae. Sabaet Dedan, et negotiatores Tharsis (sive Carthaginenses et omnes leones villae) ejus dicent tibi: Numquid ad sumenda spolia tu venis? Ecce ad diripiendam praedam congregasti multitudinem tuam, ut tollas argentum et aurum, et auferas supellectilem atque substantiam, et diripias manubias infinitas. Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog: Thus says the Lord God: Will you not know on that day when my people Israel dwells confidently (or in peace)? And you will come from your place from the sides (or from the farthest parts) of the north, you and many peoples with you, all riding on horses, a great assembly, and a mighty army. And you will come up against my people Israel like a cloud, to cover the land. In the latter days you will be (or it will be), and I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me, when I show myself holy through you in their eyes, O Gog. Thus says the Lord God: So you are the one about whom I spoke in the ancient days through my servants, the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days and times (or years), that I would bring you against them? And it shall come to pass on that day, on the day of the coming of Gog over the land of Israel, says the Lord God: My wrath shall rise in my fury. And in my zeal, in the fire of my anger, I have spoken, for on that day there shall be a great commotion on the land of Israel, and the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, and the beasts of the field (or the plains), and every creeping thing that moves on the ground shall be stirred up before me: and all the people who are on the face of the earth shall be shaken, and the mountains shall be torn apart (or the valleys shall fall), and every wall shall fall to the ground. And I will summon against him on all my mountains the sword (or every terror of the sword), says the Lord God. Each person's sword (or man's) shall be directed against his brother. And I will judge him with pestilence (or death), and with vehement rain and immense stones (or hail). I will rain fire and brimstone upon him, and upon his army (or upon all that are with him), and upon many people that are with him. And I will be magnified, and sanctified, and I will be known in the sight of (or before) many nations, and they shall know that I am the Lord.» The first foundations of the history must be laid, and it must be known that this final discourse of the Lord is to the prophet Ezekiel. For after this we can find nothing similar, except for that which is written in the twenty-fifth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin: The hand of the Lord came upon me, and he brought me there, that is, to the land of Israel, when the building of the temple is described, and the order of its ceremonies is narrated. Then it must be observed that the face of the prophet is set or confirmed against Gog of the land, or the land of Magog. For by confirmation and careful consideration, it is necessary to understand what is said according to the words of the Apostle: But we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord, the Spirit. Therefore, the Jews and our Judaizers believe that the nations of Gog are the Scythians, cruel and innumerable, who extend beyond the Caucasus Mountain, the marsh of Maeotis, and near the Caspian Sea, all the way to India. And after a thousand years of reign, they are to be stirred up by the devil and come into the land of Israel to fight against the saints, gathered with many nations. First, Mosoch, whom Josephus interprets as Cappadocians, then Thubal, whom the same people suspect to be Iberians or Spaniards, the Hebrews suspect to be Italians, having Persians, Ethiopians, and Libyans with them in their army: also Gomer and Thogorma, whom they interpret as Gauls and Phrygians: also the Sabaeans and Dedan and the Carthaginians, or Tarsus, which John also mentions in his Apocalypse: 'And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle, their number is like the sand of the sea. And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city.' And fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them: and the devil, who seduced them, was cast into the pool of fire and brimstone, where both the beast And the false prophet shall be tormented day and night forever and ever (Apoc. X, 7 seqq.).» Not understanding the whole volume of John, which is designated by the title of Revelation, to be mystical, and that we need revelation in order to be able to say with the prophet: Reveal my eyes, and I shall contemplate the wonders of your law (Ps. CXVIII, 18). But others, abandoning earthly sense, and indulging in Jewish and old wives' fables which are harmful (1 Tim. 4), and relying on themselves, they dive into the depths, ascend too high, and invent much worse things, so that in heavenly Jerusalem they describe the wars of the devil and all his army, and interpret under the headings of the particular nations the spiritual wickednesses in heavenly places. All these things, leaving them to the judgment of the reader, we will endeavor not so much to condemn as to affirm the ecclesiastical explanation. From the Greek word δόμα, Gog is said to mean "gift," and Magog means "uncovered. Therefore, all pride and knowledge of false names, which elevates itself against the knowledge of truth, is demonstrated by these names. These are the roofs that Isaiah speaks about in his vision against the Valley of Zion: What has happened to you now, since you have all gone up into empty roofs? (Isaiah 22:1). And we interpret the roofs as the leaders of heretics, and those who have received their teachings from them. And beautifully, after many mystical prophecies in this volume, the final prophecy is against Gog and Magog. For if it is the time of judgment, according to Peter, it must begin with the house of God, as also according to the same Ezekiel who says: And begin with My holy ones (above, 9:6), and the last enemy to be destroyed is death (1 Peter 4). Also, in Isaiah, the first speech is against Judah, in which the confession of the Lord is, and the last against the wild animals that are in the desert (Isaiah 2). And rightly here, too, the final speech is against Gog and Magog, who attack the city of God, which the rush of the river makes joyful (Psalm 46). And what is said in Isaiah: I am the first city, which is attacked (Isaiah 27:10). And concerning which it is written in the Gospel: A city situated on a mountain cannot be hidden (Matt. 5:14). And more fully in the psalm: Jerusalem, which is built as a city, whose participation is in unity (Psalm 122:3). Its mountains are round about it, and the Lord is round about His people (Psalm 124:1). Moreover, that in the army of Gog, or Magog, who according to the Septuagint, Symmachus, and Theodotion, is the prince of Ros, Mosoch, and Thubal: the first nation, Ros, is interpreted as head by Aquila, which we have also followed, so that the sense is: The prince of the head, Mosoch, and Thubal. And truly, neither in Genesis, nor in any other place in Scripture, nor even in Josephus, who sets forth the names of all the Hebrew nations in the first book of Antiquities, could we find this nation. From which it is clear that Ros does not signify a nation, but a head. It must also briefly be noted that in Ezekiel, Gog is said to be the prince of the land of Magog. Moreover, the Apocalypse mentions both Gog and Magog as nations, which come forth from the four corners of the earth (Apoc. 10). And just as from Jacob, who was afterwards called Israel, the entire people of the Hebrews received the name Israel (Gen. 32), and from Aram, Syria, and from Mesraim, Egypt, whose names are written in Genesis (ibid., 10): so also from the prince Gog, all who are subject to him are called Magog. However, Mosoch is interpreted as insanity, and Thubal as everything or all. Therefore, the leader and head of arrogant insanity, and of all evils, are called Gog and Magog, according to what is written: The world is set in wickedness (1 John 5:19). These nations, hostile and adversarial to the saints, come out from the corners of the earth, leaving the straight path and the arrangement of God's camps, as narrated in the Book of Numbers, and not knowing that testimony: Many will come from the east and the west, from the north and the south, and will recline with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of God (Matthew 8:11). And in another place: I will say to the north, 'Give up,' and to the south, 'Do not withhold; bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth, everyone who is called by my name.' (Isaiah 43:6). But these are not the corners of the earth from which Gog and Magog come forth: next to these corners stands the harlot in Proverbs (Prov. 23), who, passing through the streets, namely the wide and spacious road that leads to death, hastens to deceive foolish young men. The scribes and Pharisees also pray in the corners of the streets, to be seen by men, who have received their reward (Matthew 6). So what is the threatening prophecy against Gog? I will cause you to wander and turn you around, and I will put a bit in your jaws. First, I will make you waver in your decision and turn back. And I will put a bit in your jaws, as it is written: 'Put a bridle on their jaws, those who do not come near to you' (Psalms 32:9); so that the untamed and unruly horse, running off cliffs, may be subdued by the Lord's bridle. To whom the prophet says: 'Ride on your horses, and let your chariot be your protection' (Habakkuk 3:8). And to Job it is said through the cloud and the storm: 'Have you given strength to the horse?' (Job 39:19). Such were the horses and horsemen; the multitude of them that John saw in heaven (Revelation 6). Therefore, it says to Gog: I will bring you out, or gather you and all your army, or your strength. One who is brought out and gathered together from dispersion is drawn back to salvation, according to what is promised in the law: 'If your dispersion is from one end of the heavens to the other, from there I will gather you' (Deuteronomy 30:3). They also boast of having horses and cavalry dressed in armor that imitates the apostle's, and they claim to have breastplates of righteousness (Ephesians 6). The multitude is excessive, and they all seize the shield and sword against the Church, and there are fierce and hostile nations, Persians, Ethiopians, and Libyans, whose wars against the people of God are recounted in the Holy Scriptures. Gomer and the house of Togarmah also, who come from the sides of the North, which is the coldest wind, and is called the Wind of the North, and the whole strength of Magog, and all the peoples who are subject to them, will come with him to battle. It is said to him ironically: prepare yourself, equip yourself, and gather to yourself all your multitude that obeys your commands; and know that after many days you will be visited, according to what is written: I will visit their iniquities with a rod and their sins with blows (Psalm 88:33). In the last, it says, you will come in the year. Hence, even John speaks: Little children, it is the last hour (1 John 2:18). And at the eleventh hour, the people of the nations are hired to work in the vineyard (Matt. XX), and they come to the land, that is, the land of meekness, and the land of the saints, which brings forth one hundred and sixty and thirty and thirty fruits, to be conquered by Gog, which has turned back or turned away from the sword. For it is written: Scatter, O Lord, the nations that desire war (Ps. LXVII, 32). And it is in peace and is gathered from many peoples and nations, so that, with the error of the nations disregarded, it may come to the mountains of Israel, namely the patriarchs and prophets, who were once deserted constantly without the law and commandments of God; to whom it is later said: More are the children of the deserted one than of her who has a husband (Isa. LIV, 1). These are the deserts and waterless places in which the devil could not find a place, because they were called to salvation, and after he took on seven other more wicked demons, he returned to his own house (Matt. XI), namely to the nation of Israel. This, he says, is brought out from the peoples, and the land is understood; or here, he is brought out from the nations, so that the people of believers who dwelled in peace and trusted in the Lord may be understood. But when Gog ascends with his entire army, he will come like a storm and like a cloud, to cover the land of the believers. For who is not like a storm coming against the Church, and like a cloud with his words, rushing to oppress and cover even the simplest of believers? Thus it is said to him: As much as you can, you will cover everything and all your armies, and many peoples with you. And Gog, ascending beautifully, does not have voluntary rain, nor temporary and late rain that would rejoice the dry fields, but storm and darkness, to confuse everything with darkness and error. Therefore, the Lord God speaks to him: In that time, that is, in the last days, words will arise in your heart, and you will contemplate evil thoughts, as Scripture says: If the spirit of the one who has power wants to ascend upon you, do not leave your place (Eccle. X, 4). On the contrary, God ascends in the heart of the holy one, of whom it is written: He has set ascents in his heart (Ps. LXXXIII, 6). And Gog says: I will ascend to the land without a wall, or a fortification, that is, the one deprived of the help of God, and not fortified by dialectic arguments; I will come to those who are at rest, and those who dwell securely, that is, in peace. For our king is a peaceful one, and his dwelling place is in peace (Psalm 75). 'All,' he says, 'dwell without walls, they have no bars or gates.' This is what the devil, the prince of heretics, speaks, that the Church has no defenses; nor worldly wisdom, which is foolishness before God, in order to plunder spoils and invade the Church's prey, and lay his hand upon those who had been abandoned when they did not have knowledge of God: and afterwards restored through Christ, they come to the Father, to whom he speaks in the Gospel: 'Father, I have revealed your name to men' (John 17:6). And so that we may know that the people who had been abandoned and later restored signify the Christian people, it follows: 'And upon the people who are gathered from the nations' (Psalm 73:12). This people began to possess the inheritance of Christ, and to be inhabitants of the navel of the earth, about which it is written: 'He has worked salvation in the midst of the earth. For truth has arisen from the earth' (Psalm 84:1); which says in the Gospel: 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life' (John 14:6). While he was thinking about these things, and saying, and hastening to seize possession of the Church, the nations that had been converted from their ancient error to salvation, Saba and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, of Carthage, or of the sea who seek merchandise in the waves of this world with good works, and all their cities, whether lions or lion cubs, as it is written in Hebrew, will speak to him what follows. However, regarding the lion cubs, which are called Caphir in Hebrew, it is clear error that the Seventy and Theodotion translate as cities. For if you write it with the letter chi, it is called lion cub; but if you write it with the letter ce, which is called Coph in Hebrew, it means field and city. Therefore, Capernaum is said to be a beautiful field. So Saba and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, and all the saints who are called lion cubs, or certainly the dwellings and habitations of believers, will say: O Gog, do you come for the purpose of plundering the Church, and have you gathered this multitude so that it becomes your inheritance of Christ? Or do you think that you will possess the silver and gold, which are understood in speech and meaning, of the Church, so that you may take away all the furniture and infinite treasures that have been gathered by Christ's victories? Therefore, O Prophet Ezekiel, who is called son of man in the typology of Christ, speak to Gog and say to him: Thus says the Lord God, when the error of the whole world is removed, my people Israel, who perceives God with the mind, will confidently dwell in the Church, or in peace. Then you shall know, or rather arise, and come from your place. But the following words show where the place of heretical depravity is: From the sides of the North, which tries to cool all the heat of believers. And many people will come with him, all riders of horses, of whom it is written: He has thrown the horse and its rider into the sea (Exodus 15:1): a great gathering and a fierce army, with whom he goes up, saying, over my people Israel like a cloud and darkness, to cover my land, of which it was said above: In the latter days you shall be, when the Gospel preaching: and I will bring you upon my land. For it is necessary that there be heresies, so that those who are approved may become manifest (1 Corinthians 11:19), and by the will of God the devil and all perversities of doctrine have been abandoned: so that all nations may know and understand me, when I have been sanctified in you in their sight, O Gog, that is, when they shall have understood me as their judge in your punishments. And he says an apostrophe to Gog himself; Are you not the one about whom I spoke in ancient days, through the hands of my servants the prophets of Israel? Namely, Moses, who said in the Book of Numbers, specifically according to the LXX: A man will come forth from his lineage, and he will rule over many nations, and his kingdom will be exalted, and his kingdom will grow (Num. XXIV, 7). However, according to the Hebrew text, I found it written as follows: Therefore, his king Agag will be removed (Vulgate: Gog), and his kingdom will be taken away, because the kingdom of Israel was destroyed by Saul because of King Agag of Amalek. And in another place: He will cleanse the land of His people (Joel 3). Joel also describes the gathering of the peoples in the valley of Jehoshaphat, which is the judgment of God. And Isaiah and all the prophets, in whose hands the word of the Lord is spoken through good works. So when you come upon the land of Israel, my indignation will rise up in my anger against you, and in my zeal for my people. In the fire of my wrath I have spoken, which will consume all the wood of your vices. At that time there will be a great upheaval upon the land of Israel. For as the devil is unleashed, there will be frequent persecution against the Church: which when it is subdued, and overcome by the protection of God, then the fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the animals of the field, and every creeping thing that moves on the earth, and all the people who are upon the face of the earth will be disturbed before him. This is clearly demonstrated by the inhabitants of the Church: some are like fish of the sea; some are like birds of the sky; some are like beasts of the field and all the crawling creatures that move upon the earth; some, however, inhabit the face of the earth, retaining the dignity of man. Furthermore, the diversity of customs is designated by various names, as the Apostle writes to the Corinthians, distinguishing between heavenly bodies and earthly bodies after the resurrection (1 Cor. 15); and the body of a fish is different from that of a bird, and the body of a beast is different from that of a reptile, and the body of a man is different from that of the others who have preserved their original form. In the Acts of the Apostles, that linen cloth which is shown to the Apostle Peter by the four principles (Acts 10) also signifies the variety of believers, which is also contained in the Ark of the Flood. Then the face of the Lord and the majesty of his presence will overthrow the mountains that rise up against the knowledge of God. And the hedges or valleys that have been submerged in the depths of ignorance will fall, as well as the fortifications that promise something in order to imitate the Church of God, of which it is said: 'Whoever destroys a hedge, a snake will bite him' (Sirach 10:8). And all the walls will fall to the ground. For when the strength of the words of Ecclesiasticus appears, all the fortifications of heretics will collapse. And I will call, he says, against him, that is, the prince of the heretics Gog, a sword on all his mountains, so that the leaders of his army will be defeated by the sword of the Lord. Then heresy will fight against heresy, and their struggle with each other is our victory. And I will judge him, says the Lord, with death, or with pestilence, and with blood, and with a violent rain, and with immense stones, or hailstones. But Gog will be judged with his own death, and with the blood that he has shed, and with a violent rain, by the words of learned and perfect men, and with immense stones, which will bury him under the testimonies of the Scriptures, or hailstones, which will cool his heat. For all those who commit adultery, their hearts are like an oven (Hosea 7:4). Fire, he said, and sulfur will rain down upon him: by which the punishment of eternal judgment is demonstrated. And not only upon him, who was the author of wickedness, but also upon the entire army and multitude with him, and upon many peoples, who are with him. For indeed heretics have many companions, and even the devil, their prince, is surrounded by an infinite multitude. With every error removed, and with the leaders of the heretics punished and destroyed, the Lord is magnified and sanctified among the believers, and is made known in the eyes of many nations, who have believed in his faith: and both from the blessedness of himself and from the punishments of his adversaries, they will know and understand that he himself is the Lord. We have interpreted these things as best we could, obeying that command: You shall not turn aside to the right or to the left, but you shall walk in the straight path (Deuteronomy 28:14). But if anyone criticizes our words, let them either propose better things for us to follow, or if they have nothing to say, let them leave the complete knowledge of God to Him. However, let them know that there is no strength in us, but it is the mind that is to be judged.

(Chapter 39, Verses 1 onwards) \"But you, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say: 'Thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal; and I will turn you around and lead you out, and bring you up from the far north, and bring you against the mountains of Israel. And I will strike down your bow in your left hand, and cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand. You shall fall on the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops and the nations that are with you.\ I will give you as food to the wild animals, birds, and all flying creatures, and to the animals on the ground. You will fall on the open field or in the countryside, because I, the Lord God, have spoken. I will send fire on Magog and on those who live securely in the islands. Then they will know that I am the Lord. I will make my holy name known among my people Israel, and I will not let it be dishonored anymore. The nations will know that I am the Lord, the holy God of Israel. Behold, he is coming, and it has happened (or you will know that it will happen), says the Lord (the Vulgate adds God): this is the day of which I have spoken. And the inhabitants of the cities of Israel will come out and burn weapons, shield and spears (or shields and spears), bow and arrows, staffs of the hand (the Vulgate manus): and spears (or lances): and they will burn them with fire for seven years. And they will not take wood from the regions (or from the fields), nor cut from the forests: for the weapons will be burned with fire, and they will plunder those who plundered them; and they will spoil their devastators, says the Lord God. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give Gog a place for burial in Israel, the valley of the travelers east of the sea, which will astonish those who pass by; and they shall build a wall around the mouth of the valley, and bury there Gog and all his multitude; and it shall be called the valley of the multitude of Gog. And the house of Israel shall bury them, in order to cleanse the land for seven months. But all the people of the earth will bury them, and there will be a day named for them, in which I have been glorified, says the Lord God. And they will continually appoint men, going around the land, to bury and search for those who remain on the face of the earth, to cleanse it. But after seven months they will begin to search. And they will go around exploring the land. And when they see the bones of a man, they will set up a marker next to it, until the cleansers in the valley of the multitude of Gog bury it. The name of the city is Amona (or Polyandrion), and they will cleanse the land (or the land will be cleansed). And the heirs of this Jewish tradition, and the disciples of endless fables, contend that after a thousand years of reign, Gog, the prince of Ros, Mosoch, and Thubal will be killed in the borders of Israel; and they will be devoured by all the birds and beasts. And the inhabitants of the cities of Israel will not use wood for seven years, but rather the weapons of Gog, namely shields and spears, arrows and staffs or javelins. And Gog himself will be buried in a valley, which is called Ge in Hebrew, and the name of his tomb will be called Polyandrion, where a great multitude of people will be buried. But he is to be buried by the house of Israel for seven months, so that the land may be cleansed. And on a glorious day to come, when Gog is killed, those who are appointed to diligently search for and bury the bones will be established, so that nothing remains unburied on the land. After the months, or in the seven months, the land will be greatly enlarged; and wherever they see a human bone, they are to mark it with a sign, so that it may be buried later by those in charge of this task. The city is to be called Amona, which is Greek for 'multitude of buried people,' and thus the land will be cleansed. They said this to him. But we, understanding the meaning of the beginning of the explanation, discussed each thing that we proposed. Gog himself also has his own trinity: Ros, Mosoch, and Thubal; head, that is, and insanity, and everything; so that there is no vice that does not consist in the possession of Gog. This one will be raised up, whether he will be moved around, and he will feel, or he will be suckled: in hope of victory, he will be led to battle to be killed. And he will ascend from the sides, or from the uttermost parts of the North, from whence evils break forth upon the whole earth. And he himself will be led over the mountains of Israel: which we must understand as the apostles and apostolic men, and ecclesiastics, so that after he has been led to the mountains of Israel, then the bow, which is in his left hand, and the arrows, which are held in his right hand, will be struck. And he himself, in mimicking those whom he has deceived, will have weapons in his left and right hands, through good and bad reputation. These arrows are the same as the darts, of which the Psalmist speaks: Behold, sinners have bent the bow; they have prepared their arrows in a quiver, to shoot in the dark at the upright of heart (Ps. 10:2). The fiery darts of the devil must be extinguished by the shield of faith (Ephes. VI). However, Gog, who had ascended the mountains of Israel, will be cast down or will fall, in the very mountains with all his army and all his troops; and he will be food for the wild beasts, birds, and all the flying creatures of the earth: namely, the adversaries, the powers, who by the wayside devour the seed, and the bloodthirsty beasts. For just as it is written about the dragon: You have given him as food to the peoples of Ethiopia (Ps. LXXIII, 14); so those who have been deceived by heretics are the food of demons. But Gog is a cadet, either in the width of the field or in the cultivated field that is tended by the farmers of God. For it is impossible for the words of the Lord to be in vain. Then fire will be sent to Magog, namely to those who have received Gog's teaching, and to those who are beaten by the waves of the world like the likeness of islands, and who think that they should be secure. That fire of which the Lord speaks: I came to cast fire upon the earth; and how I wish it to be kindled (Luke XII, 49); so that all may know and understand that I am the Lord, and that the name of holiness may be made known in the midst of my people, who have not been deceived by Gog's authority: and so that my name may no longer be polluted by the opportunity of a false name of knowledge among heretics; and so that the nations, which are around, may know that I am the Lord. But what follows, 'Behold, he comes, and it is done,' is said of the judgment of Christ: 'He that cometh will come, and will not delay' (Habakkuk 2:3). And this is the day of punishment and vengeance, of which the Lord spoke through all the prophets. And the inhabitants of the cities of Israel, the people of believers, will go out; but by the cities of Israel we understand the Churches of the right faith. And they will kindle and burn the weapons, of which it is written in another place: 'He will break the bow and smash the weapons, and burn the shields and spears with fire' (Psalm 44:10), the shields and spears, the bow and arrows, the staffs of the hands, on which they celebrated the perverse Passover, the lances or poles with which they inflicted wide and incurable wounds of false doctrines, and the shields, bows, and arrows, of which it was said above. And what follows: And these things shall happen for seven years, it must be explained from Exodus and Leviticus (Exod. XXI; Levit. XXV), in which the Law prescribes that in the seventh year of remission, when freedom is restored to Hebrew slaves and all debts are paid, the ancient possession returns to the owners, and the land rests, and all produce is pardoned for the poor, so that in the holy and perfect number of seven years the armor of the heretics may perish, and the ecclesiastical men may by no means cut down trees from the fields and regions, woods and forests of the nations, whom they desire to save rather than destroy; but from the heretics whom they have conquered, using shields, spears, arrows, staffs, poles, and lances. For they themselves have various weapons to attack the Church of Christ, which must be ignited by the learned men with the fire of the Holy Spirit; namely, the ecclesiastical discourses, which those who possess can say: Was not our heart burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was opening the Scriptures to us? (Luke 24:32) We cannot have full peace and confidence of dwelling unless we plunder all the furniture of the adversaries, so that everything may perish and turn into ashes; and we plunder those who had plundered us before, and we lay waste to those who had previously devastated the Church. In Dieilla, in the clear light of preaching: 'I will give', he says, 'to Gog a named place, a tomb in Israel, near the Hebrew, the valley of travelers towards the East of the sea, which causes those passing by to be amazed.' The meaning of this speech is that the tomb of Gog will not be in the mountains, but in the low valleys and in rugged places, which in Hebrew are called Ge (Jah). The heretics, even though they are in the West, pretend that these places are in the East, in order to deceive travelers, who are passing through this world and are not inhabitants but strangers, saying that prophetic verse: 'I am a stranger and a sojourner, like all my fathers.' For who, passing by, of whom it is written: 'And they that passed by, have not said: The blessing of the Lord be upon you' (Ps. 128:8), does not marvel and stand amazed when he sees the valley of travelers, which appears as a valley to travelers, but as a mountain to its inhabitants? This according to the Hebrew. However, the Seventy translated it as the gathering of those who come to the sea; and they shall build around the entrance of the valley. For it is the labor of those who go out from the cities of Israel, to enclose and build around every entrance and exit of heretical wickedness that comes to the sea, and they delighted in its bitterness, and with the heaps of water and the cruelty of shipwreck, they may shut it up and build around it, and bury it in the depths of the earth, so that they may no longer be able to come out and deceive others with their deception. Therefore, there Gog and all his multitude will be buried, with which the heretics are always delighted. And the name of that valley in which Gog is buried will be called Ge, or πολυάνδριον, which means the tomb of a great multitude. And as we said above, the weapons of the adversaries will burn for seven years: and so the land will be cleansed from the filth of the heretics for seven months. For from the first month, when we celebrate the Passover of the Lord and avoid the destroyer of Egypt, the lambs with the blood on our doorposts, until the end of the year, that is, until the seventh month, when we set up the tabernacles and protect ourselves with the branches of palm trees among the other branches: so that a complete victory against the enemies may be demonstrated, we observe all the festivities among the people. It will not only be done by the teachers, but also by the whole people, to bury Gog and cover the land and not allow the free air to be taken. But after the death and killing, or burial of Gog, men of the Church shall be chosen, who have the task of ensuring that nothing of the ancient filth remains on the land of Israel, and that no dead bodies are left. They shall search the land, looking for the dead, and bury them, so that the land of the Church may be purified. But if, after seven months, when everything should be cleansed, those who travel and go around the land find anywhere the bones of a man, that is, the hardness of heretical wickedness, or anything of the dead doctrine still remaining, they shall place it beside that place, or build a memorial, so that once those who are of such kind are marked, they may be cleansed or buried with Gog, and they shall be cast into the tomb (or crowd) of his burial. But the name of the city, where the victory of the Lord's servants is, and the adversaries lie down, and the whole multitude of its enemies is prostrate, will be called Amona, or Polyandrion: so that the end of all things may be the restoration of purity. Finally it follows: And they will cleanse the earth; no doubt those about whom it is written above: They will begin to seek, and the wanderers will go around the earth.

<h2 id='tocuniq304'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Vv. 17 et seq.) \"Therefore, son of man, thus says the Lord God: Speak to every bird and to all the birds of the air, and to all the beasts of the field: Gather and come together; gather from all around to my sacrifice that I have prepared for you, a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, so that you may eat flesh and drink blood. You shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth: of rams, lambs, and goats, of fat bulls and all the fattened animals.\ And you will eat the fat in abundance, and you will drink the blood in drunkenness, from the sacrifice which I have offered to you. And you will be satisfied at my table with horse and with strong horsemen (or giants): and with all the mighty warriors, says the Lord God. And I will put (or give) my glory in the nations (or in you): and all the nations will see my judgment which I have done, and my hand which I have placed (or brought) upon them. And the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God from that day forward. And all the nations shall know that the house of Israel was taken captive because of their iniquities, because they have forsaken me, and I have hidden my face from them and have given them into the hand of their enemies, and they have all fallen by the sword. According to their uncleanness and their transgressions I have dealt with them, and I have hidden my face from them. Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Now I will restore the captivity of Jacob, and I will have mercy on the whole house of Israel, and I will be zealous for my holy name. And they will bear their confusion (or disgrace), and all the transgressions by which they have transgressed against me, when they dwelled confidently (or in peace) in their own land, fearing no one. And I will bring them back from the peoples (or nations), and I will gather them from the lands of their enemies (or from the regions of the nations), and I will be sanctified in them in the eyes (or in the sight) of many nations. And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, when I have scattered them among the nations and have gathered them together upon their own land, and have not left any of them there. Nor will I hide my face from them any more, for I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, says the Lord God. This translation, according to the Hebrew, is that I will gather them upon their own land, and will not leave any of them there. This is not found in the Septuagint. And again, what is placed next to the Hebrews for a blessing, because I have poured out my spirit, the LXX translated as fury, which pertains to anger, especially since in Hebrew it is written Ruhi, which properly means my spirit, and by no means my fury. But everything up to that point, where the building of the temple follows, those whom we mentioned above, the Jews and our Judaizers, refer to the final time: that Gog with all his army should be saturated like the fattest sacrifices of birds and beasts, and that Israel should be restored to its former state, and no longer be conquered by the nations, but that God should pour out his spirit upon them, so that they may dwell in their land: not all nations, but specifically the house of Israel. But following the begun tropology, we will say that the Lord summons all birds and all beasts to deliver to them the leaders of heretics, like very fat victims to be devoured. Birds and beasts, however, are called such either because of their swiftness in running everywhere or because of their fierceness and cruelty, to whom adversaries are handed over for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved, and they may learn not to blaspheme (I Tim. I). But they will eat a large and very fat victim; not elsewhere, but above the mountains of Israel, which we must understand as the prophets, apostles, and holy men. For in them the teachers of contrary doctrines fall, and are destroyed by the wounded themselves, upon whom the Church is built: or rather, upon the mountain of mountains, of which Isaiah and Micah speak: Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will show us his ways (Isa. II, 3; Mic. IV, 2). But these birds and these animals, swift and cruel, feed on flesh and drink blood, which cannot possess the kingdom of God: the flesh of the mighty or giants who rebelled against the knowledge of God, and the blood of princes, not of heaven, but of the earth, who have savored all earthly things: the blood of rams, and lambs, and goats, or according to the Septuagint, rams, calves, and goats, to signify three types of animals that are sacrificed in the name of God. For heretics also imitate the gentleness of the Church, but their offering does not profit for the worship of God, but for the food of demons, which is their fattest offering. They are satiated with fatness and drink the blood of deceivers to the point of drunkenness. But God offers this victim through ecclesiastical men, so that the multitude of deceivers may be satiated as the worst guests, and they may drink to the point of vomiting and drunkenness. When you see holy men, educated in the divine Scriptures, cutting down the horses of heretics and their riders, of whom it is written: He has cast the horse and his rider into the sea (Exodus 15:1), and slaying all rebels and giants with his sword, and shedding the blood of all 460 warriors of false knowledge: then know that the Lord's table is prepared, that he may place his glory in all nations, who believe in his name, and understand the judgement of his holy Church, which they have passed upon their adversaries, and the strong hand with which they have struck them. And let the house of Israel know and understand, that he himself is their Lord God, who has said: I am the Lord your God, from the day of the Lord's victory until eternity. And let them remember that the house of Israel was once captured by the heretics, and dispersed throughout the whole world of perverse doctrines, because they abandoned him, who for a little while hid or turned his face away from them, and delivered them into the hands of heretics, and they fell pierced by their sword because of their impurities and injustices, which was the reason he hid and turned his face away from them. But after presenting the arguments, according to what is written: It is necessary that there be heresies, so that those who are approved may become manifest (1 Corinthians 11:19), the captivity of Israel, namely the Church, in which they dwell, beholding God: now promises that it will bring back into the Church the captivity of Jacob, who had supplanted the Jewish people, and was later supplanted by the frauds of the heretics: and will have mercy on the whole house of Israel, not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. And I will take up my zeal for my holy name, which was blasphemed among the nations because of the heretics: so that after I have delivered them, they may be ashamed and confounded, for they have transgressed against me by abandoning the faith of the Church. But let them be confounded and greatly ashamed when they dwell in their own land, a land of meekness and a land of saints, and they dwell confidently, in peace, not fearing the snares of the heretics (Psalm VI). Then they shall be brought back from the peoples, and gathered from the lands of their enemies into their own land, and the Lord shall be sanctified in them in the sight of many nations, who themselves shall also believe in the Lord. And the end of blessedness shall be to know and recognize that He is their Lord God, because He has appeared to them among the nations, whether He has transferred them from the nations and gathered them onto their own land, the land of Judah, the land of confession, the land of gentleness, and the land of the living, and has not left even one to heretical depravity. And He will no longer hide His face from them, nor turn away from them, because He has poured out the spirit of His grace, of which the prophet Joel also speaks: 'And in the last days I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh' (Joel 2:28); but He poured it out upon the whole house of Israel. But if, according to the Septuagint, we interpret 'fury' as referring to the Spirit, which is not found in Hebrew, it must be understood that God will no longer hide his face from those on whom he had previously poured out his fury. Up to this point, we have spoken concerning the prophet Ezekiel, with the help and inspiration of God, may he assist us, without opposing the opinions of others who have written before us or in the future, if they should write, but affirming whatever is our own. But in the construction of the temple, and the order of the priests, and the division of the holy land, and the flow of the river from the temple, and the evergreen trees on both banks, and the fruit brought forth each month, and the rest contained in the prophetic volume until the end, we openly confess our ignorance, considering it better to say nothing than to say too little.

Book Twelve

Your prayers, daughter Eustochium, and the promises of the Lord have overcome my fear in explaining the temple of Ezekiel, or rather my persistence in remaining silent, saying: Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you (Matt. VII, 7). And as we excuse ourselves, as we stated at the end of the previous volume, it is better to say nothing than to say too little; you have turned it around, so that you should at least be considered as saying too little rather than nothing: for in the former case, there is a willing spirit, whereas in the latter there is despair of the entire work. And you mention that it is the nature of such people not to have as much gratitude for what you have given as sorrow for what you have denied. For we praise virtues with less enthusiasm than we condemn vices: and although bodies may be beautiful, they become more noticeable due to the wickedness and deformity of one part. Therefore, I will obey your will, and with the Holy Spirit blowing, I will set sail, ignorant of the shores I will reach, and shouting with the same prophet, I come from the four winds, O spirit; and to the fastidious reader, or rather to the mind that is eager to learn from our words, I declare with complete freedom in explaining the temple, that if he desires truth, he should seek it from others. However, we simply confess and declare those things which we can suspect in the most difficult work, giving thanks to the Lord, if He has not opened the doors of knowledge to us in all things, which is impossible, but in most things. For, as the exalted speaker says, it is honorable even to persevere in pursuing and standing by second or lesser matters.

In a vision (or in a vision from God), he brought me to the land of Israel and set me down (or placed me) on a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city, towards the south (or in the southern region).' And he brought me there, and behold, a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze (or shining bronze); and a measuring line (or mason's line) was in his hand, and a measuring rod (or reed) in his hand. He was standing in the gateway, and he spoke to me, the same man: Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I show you (or set in your heart all that I will show you), for you were brought here in order to be shown it (or to enter here): declare (or show) to the house of Israel everything you see. If, in the fifth year of the captivity or exile of King Joachin, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, the heavens were opened to the prophet Ezekiel by the river Chebar and he saw visions of God; and now it is said that in the twenty-fifth year of the same captivity of Jehoiachin, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth month, the hand of the Lord came upon him and he was brought to the land of Israel and placed on a very high mountain, so that he could see the building of the city leaning towards the south, there is no doubt that his entire prophecy is composed of nineteen years, nine months, and five days of the twentieth year. Now, if according to Theodotion, who interpreted it in the beginning of the year, in the new year, on the tenth day of the month (which is called the seventh month among the Hebrews, and has the Hebrew word 'Thesri' as its name), on the Kalends of the seventh month, there is the sound of trumpets, and on the tenth day of the same month, there is a day of fasting and atonement; and on the fifteenth day, when the entire lunar cycle is completed, there are the boisterous feasts. It is understood that on the tenth day of the Day of Atonement, Ezekiel saw the building of the city. And just as he demonstrated the restoration of the people, indeed the resurrection of life in the bones of the field under the image of resurrection, so now the Lord promises the restoration of the city that was destroyed by the Babylonians fourteen years ago, under its description, so that just as the type of captivity and destruction, shown by the boiling pot from the face of the North, and the truth of prophecy was proven by deeds, so the truth of future rebuilding would be proven by the faith of past events. 464 And this is not said about that time, as some ignorant Jews would have it, when the temple was rebuilt under Zorobabel and under Jesus, son of Josedech, the high priest, with the prophets Haggai and Zechariah prophesying. For this temple that is now described, and the order of the priesthood, and the division of the land and its fertility, are much more magnificent than what Solomon built. But that which was built under Zorobabel was so small and insignificant compared to the former, that those who had seen the former temple and then beheld this one wailed and testified to their grief with tears, and the wailing of the mourners would be much louder than the blast of trumpets. Read the book of Ezra. Furthermore, what is added, in the fourteenth year after the city was struck (or captured) (3 Esdras 5), according to mystical understanding, fourteen signifies generations: when they are completed from David until the birth of Christ, the restoration of the city is promised by him, of whom it is written: He will build my city and bring back the captivity of my people (Isaiah 45:13). And again: He came to preach remission to the captives and sight to the blind, saying to those who were in chains, come out, and to those who were in darkness, be revealed (Ibid., 61:1). But the hand of the Lord was upon him, so that he would come to the land of Israel in the spirit while he was physically located in Babylon. And not just in a single vision, but in multiple visions from God, he would be placed upon a very high mountain, of which Isaiah and Micah prophesy: 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob' (Isa. II, 3; Mic. IV, 2). For this mountain is exceedingly high, in comparison to the other mountains, as the prophet testifies, saying: 'I lift up my eyes to the mountains, from where will my help come?' (Ps. CXX, 1). And in another place: Mountains are round about it, and the Lord is round about his people (Ps. 124:2). Of this it is also said in Isaiah: Go up into a high mountain, thou that bringest good tidings to Zion (Isa. 40:9). Upon this mountain the building of the city is shown, according to the Septuagint and Aquila, on the east side, and opposite to the north, from where the prophet came to the land of Israel; but according to Theodotion and Symmachus, it is inclined towards the south, where there is full light, and the sun of justice is placed on the highest point of the sky. And in the Song of Songs it is said: Arise, north wind, and come, south wind; blow on my garden, that its fragrance may spread (Song 4.16). For the north wind, a very harsh wind, is driven away from the garden of the Lord, lest the heat of love be cooled and the flowers wither. And when it is said: Like a building of a city, not truly a city, but the likeness of a city is shown, of which it is written: Glorious things are said of you, city of God (Ps. 86.2): which is Jerusalem, built as a city, whose participation is in itself, and in which the great Lord is exceedingly praiseworthy, in the city of our God, on His holy mountain (Ps. 48). And in the towers of this city, God is known, when He will receive her. Of her and elsewhere: The rush of a river makes the city of God rejoice (Ps. XLV, 4). And: A city set on a hill cannot be hidden (Matt. V, 14), which speaks in Isaiah: I am a fortified city, a city under siege (Isa. XXIII). It did not say conquered, but besieged: which is built upon a rock, and is not shaken by any storm. It follows: And He led me there, the hand of God is understood. There, however, to the building of the city, in order that He might show me all the things that were inside. And behold, he said, a man, whose appearance or vision was like the shining of bright bronze, that is, the one of whom it is written: Behold the man, his name is the East (Zach. VI, 12). But he did not have the appearance of amber, as is said at the beginning of this volume, nor was he girded with a golden belt, as is contained in the Apocalypse of John (Apoc. I); but he had an appearance like that of bronze according to the Hebrew. For this material is more resonant than all metals, and it resounds far with a ringing sound. Hence in Daniel, in the image that was made of gold, silver, bronze, and iron, the kingdom of Alexander and the Greeks is represented in the likeness of bronze (Daniel II); so that the eloquence of the Greek language might be signified: by which it is evident that they still need instruction, who have not yet fully understood the mysteries of spiritually building the temple. There was also a line (funiculus) made of linen in his hand, as described in the book of Zachariah (Zech. II), which symbolizes the geometric measuring line he used to measure the width and length of the city. The line represents either the masons who serve God's commandments, or the angels who serve God's commandments, or Moses, and all the prophets and apostles who build the city of God and are helpers or ministers of the Lord's will. As the apostle Paul said: We are God's field, God's building (1 Cor. III, 9). And the pen in his hand signifies prophetic grace, of which it is written in the forty-fourth psalm: My tongue is the pen of a skillful scribe (Psalm 44:2). And about John the prophet and the Baptist: What did you go out to the desert to see? A reed shaken by the wind (Matthew 11:7). Those who desire to imitate this reed are the ones who write iniquity while they write, and to whom the prophet curses: Rebuke the beasts of the reeds (Psalm 68:31). But he was standing at the gate; for through him we enter to the Father, and without him we cannot enter the city of God, so that he may receive the worthy and reject the unworthy. There is also judgment at the gate. Thus, the prophet says: They hate those who accuse at the gate (Isa. 29:21). And in another place: He will not be put to shame when he speaks to his enemies at the gate (Ps. 127:5). Here, a man spoke to the prophet, in whose hand was a measuring line, and whose appearance was like bronze, and who held a reed in his hand. He spoke to Ezekiel of the true architect, whom Paul the apostle imitated, saying: 'Like a wise architect, I have laid the foundation' (I Cor. III, 10). But he calls the wise architect, in distinction to the one who is foolish, and he is called the senseless shepherd in Zechariah; but he spoke the following: 'Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears' (Zech. XI): not with the eyes of the flesh, but with the spirit; not with the ears of the body, but with the soul. Lift up, he says, your eyes and see that the harvest is already white for harvesting (John 4:35). And: He who has ears to hear, let him hear (Luke 8:8). And the building of the city appears, and the order of the ceremonies and priests is heard, and the description of the land. It is not enough to command to see with the eyes and hear with the ears; but he added: And set your heart on everything; or, and set in your heart everything that I will show you. For seeing and hearing is of no use, unless you store in the treasure of memory what you have seen and heard. But when He says, 'All that I shall show thee,' He makes the hearer attentive, He also prepares the eyes of the heart, that they may retain in memory what they are about to see; because thou art led hither, that all things may be shown thee. Wherefore, having said this, He shows particularly that nothing is sweeter than theory and knowledge, which the prophet desires, saying: 'One thing have I desired of the Lord, this will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.' To see the beauty of the Lord, and to visit his temple (Psalm 26:4,5). Therefore, he joins and says: O Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house, and the place of the habitation of your glory. Announce, he says, all that you see to the house of Israel, so that those who cannot see for themselves may learn from you what is demonstrated to you by the Lord. And to the house of Israel belong those who see God with their minds, among whom was Nathanael, who earnestly sought Christ and deserved to hear: Behold, a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit (John 1:47)."  }


<h2 id='tocuniq307'>(Vers. 5 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 5 and following) And behold, there was a wall on the outside surrounding the house all around, and in the man's hand was a measuring reed of six cubits and a handbreadth, and he measured the width of the building with the reed, one reed wide, and also the height with the reed. And he came to the gate that faced the eastern way, and he went up its steps, and he measured the threshold of the gate with the reed, one reed wide, that is, one threshold the width of one reed, and a chamber one reed long and one reed wide, and between the chambers was a span of five cubits, and the threshold of the gate next to the vestibule of the gate on the inside was measured with one reed. And the vestibule of the gate was eight cubits, and its front was two cubits: the vestibule of the gate was on the inside. And the chambers of the gate toward the east were three on this side and three on that side; they had the same measurement on each side as well as the same measurement of the front. And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits, and the length of the gate was thirteen cubits. And there was a margin in front of the chambers of one cubit, and one cubit was the end on each side: and the chambers were six cubits on one side, and six cubits on the other side. And he measured the gate from the roof of the chamber to its roof, a width of twenty-five cubits, door opposite door. 70: And behold, there was a wall outside the house all around, and in the man's hand was a measuring rod of six cubits, and he measured the wall, a width equal to the rod, and its height according to the rod. Then he went into the gate that faced east, and went up its seven steps, and measured the threshold ÷ six cubits wide, and six cubits wide at the other side of the gate. The gate had the same measurement as the rod in length, and the same measurement as the rod in width, and a threshold of six cubits on each side. And he measured the gate, which faced east, seventy-five cubits in length, and twenty-five cubits in width, with a threshold of six cubits on each side. And the third part equal to three in width, and equal to three in length, and the gate's lintel which is next to the gate's lintel to be eight cubits, and the lintel of two cubits, and the gate's interior lintel, and the gate's threshold in the 468th region, three on this side, and three on that side, and the measure of the entrance: one measure of the lintel on both sides. The width of the gate's entrance was ten cubits, and the width of the gate was thirteen cubits, and one cubit was equal to the view of the third cubit, and one cubit's end on both sides, and three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. And it was measured from the gate of the wall to the wall, a width of twenty-five cubits. This gate is opposite the gate.» While I was a boy in Rome, and being educated in liberal studies, I used to go around the tombs of the apostles and martyrs with others of the same age and purpose on Sundays; and frequently, I would enter the crypts, which are dug deep into the earth, and on both sides of those who enter, they have the bodies of the buried, and everything is so dark that the prophetic saying is almost fulfilled: 'Let the living descend to the underworld' (Psalm 55, 16); and rarely does light enter from above, tempering the horror of the darkness, so that it is not so much a window as a hole through which light is let in: and once again, we approach slowly, and in the pitch-black night, that Virgilian verse is presented: 'Fear surrounds us, and the gloom of the night' (Aeneid, Book II).

Horror everywhere terrifies the soul, even the silence itself. Let this statement be for me, so that the wise reader understands my opinion on the explanation of the temple of God in Ezekiel, concerning which it is written: 'Clouds and darkness are under his feet' (Psalm 97:2). And again: 'Darkness is his hiding place' (Psalm 18:12). Therefore, Moses also entered the cloud and the darkness, in order to contemplate the divine mysteries, which the distant and lowly people could not see (Exodus 24 and 34). Finally, after forty days, the common people were unable to see the face of Moses, as his eyes were veiled, because it was glorified, or as it is written in Hebrew, Moses had a horned face. Similarly, as I was reading the description of the mystical temple (which the Jews believe should be built literally during the coming of their Christ, whom we consider to be the Antichrist, but we refer to the Church of Christ and see it being built in his saints every day), wherever the eye of the heart opens, I happened to think I saw and possessed the bridegroom, and joyfully said, 'I have found the one whom my soul seeks, I will hold him, and I will not let him go' (Song of Solomon 3:4); but again the divine word abandons me, and the bridegroom flees from my hands, and my eyes are closed by blindness, so that I am forced to say, 'Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!'" } How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! (Rom. XI, 33) And what is written elsewhere: The judgments of the Lord are a great deep. (Ps. XXXV, 7) And: Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord, O Lord, hear my voice. (Ps. CXXIX, 1) And that of Elisha, who followed with his eyes the rapture of his master, saying: My father, my father: the chariot of Israel and the driver thereof. (IV Kings II, 12) Therefore it is necessary for me to confess that I do not wish rashly to discuss the temple of the blessed Ezekiel, which all ages have kept silence about, but to show the readers the conjecture of my soul with faith and fear of God; as if I were to offer to the tabernacle of God skins of goats and hair, by which the thorns and thistles of sins may be defended against and the rains and storms prevented: let another who is rich, according to the measure of his merits, offer iron or copper or silver, gold and precious stones, and not despise ours, because they are inferior; but rejoice in his own wealth. For unless the foundation is built, the upper parts cannot exist; and in order for the larger parts to be praised, they are enhanced by comparison with the smaller. Let us therefore see what Ezekiel saw first upon entering the city building that faces south, then what he heard: 'And behold,' he says, 'a wall surrounding the house on all sides.' Instead of 'wall,' which Aquila and Theodotion interpreted as, Symmachus and the Seventy used the word 'περίβολον' meaning 'surrounding.' Therefore, the wall or 'περίβολον' enclosed the entire house, that is, the temple of the Lord, and it had a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, and he not only carried a measuring line used by geometers and masons, but also held a reed in his hand, the length of which was unspoken, and is now reckoned as six cubits and a palm, which is more accurately called a 'παλαιστή' in Greek, and is the sixth part of a cubit. Furthermore, the palmus is equivalent to the σπιθαμὴν, which some call the palm to distinguish it. Similarly, they used to call the wrestler a palmus. Therefore, the width and height of the wall were measured with a reed, and both, that is, the width and height, were six cubits and one palm. And since there were many gates, he did not enter through the other gates, but through the one that faced the East. And because the place was not level, and the wall was circular, and the house of God was built in higher places, he entered, or rather ascended, by steps. These steps are called seventy-seven, only because we read in Hebrew and in other translations the word 'steps' without a number. And upon entering the gate, he immediately measured the threshold of the gate, which the seventy gods call: for which it is written in Hebrew as Seph. And I think it is necessary to remind the diligent and studious reader: if, however, he is led by the knowledge of the Scriptures and not by the empty declamations of orators, that he may know that almost all the Hebrew words and names, which are placed in the Greek and Latin translation, have been corruptly altered by excessive antiquity, and have been distorted by the fault of the writers, and while they are written without correction, they become even more uncorrected, and the Hebrew words have become Sarmatian, indeed, of no nation, since they have ceased to be Hebrew and have not begun to be foreign. Therefore, the threshold of the gate, whether it be called θεὲ, or rather seph, which Symmachus interpreted as οὐδὸν, had one reed, that is, six cubits and a palm in width. For this reason, the LXX, I know not for what reason, added six cubits on each side. After the threshold of the gate, according to the Hebrew, it was measured as a chamber or room, as Symmachus translated, with παραστάδας, that is, posts on each side of one reed, both in length and width. And they also translated 'aelam' (αἰλὰμ) as 'ailam', which Symmachus interpreted as 'antechamber' in the following. Between the two chambers, or bedrooms, and the corresponding arches, there were five cubits, and another doorway next to the entrance inside with a single reed. The third vestibule of the doorway also had eight cubits, and on its front, or on its margins, two cubits. And lest anyone think that this vestibule is the same as the one above, he added: Moreover, it was the interior vestibule of the doorway: for which the first, second, and third vestibules were translated as seventy." } However, the thalami, that is, the bedrooms, which were built after the Eastern gate in the vestibules, faced the Eastern road. And in order to know how many thalami there were, it is connected: three on this side and three on the other, namely facing North and South, and the Eastern road; and one measurement of the front was on both sides. He also measured the width of the threshold of the gate and found it to be ten cubits, and the length thirteen cubits, and the ends of the thalami were narrowed to one cubit, or as Symmachus translated, 'παραστάδων', and each front had one cubit. However, the thalami, or παραστάδες, and as the LXX have put it, θεηλὰθ, had six cubits on each side. And the gate was measured from the ceiling of the thalami, or παραστάδος, to the ceiling or wall of it, and it was found to be twenty-five cubits in width between the ceilings. For there was only this much space between the door and the door, or between the gate and the gate. These things we have briefly spoken with a mind more inclined to divine than to explain, desiring to portray the obscure and almost imperceptible picture according to the literal sense. But few things, which we can suspect, we will set forth strictly and doubtingly. The Apostle Paul, wanting the Ephesians (Chapter III) to know more sacred things, prays for them to be filled with the wisdom and love of the Lord, so that rooted and grounded, they may be able to know and comprehend the length, and width, and height, and depth of his riches, and he speaks to them: Therefore, you are by no means strangers, but fellow citizens of the saints and members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone, in whom all the building is fitly framed together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord: in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God through the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 3:2). Peter the apostle also speaks in almost the same words, because of the same spirit, in his letter: 'if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good, approaching him, as to a living stone, rejected by men indeed, but chosen, and honored by God, and you yourselves as living stones are being built into a spiritual house, for a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.' (1 Peter 2:3-5). From this it is clear that the Lord and Savior, who is the true architect, would evaluate stones that could be placed in the foundations of the temple, both in the middle and in the upper and lower parts, for a measure of 472, or of less solid strength in the wall, and placed outside the temple in the surrounding area. For it is not of small strength or minimal firmness to support stones placed upon it. Hence the Apostle writes to the believers: Bear one another's burdens (Galatians VI, 2). And in another place it is written: we should not take on a burden that we cannot bear. However, the measuring reed, which had six cubits and one palm, signifies that our conversation is known to God, which is contained within the six days in which the world was made, and signifies the order of our works, so that one thing pertains to the works and another to the mind. Hence, the width is equal to the height: the width refers to the works, as we have said; the height refers to the mind, which hastens to lofty things. But let it suffice to have once warned: to know that "cubitus" both denotes a measurement and is of neutral gender, but for the sake of simplicity and ease of understanding, and for the common usage, we prefer to use the masculine gender. For we do not care to avoid errors in speech, but rather to discuss the obscurity of Holy Scripture with whatever words are available. Therefore, a man whose name is "Oriens" enters through the Eastern gate to enlighten those whom he finds in the first section of the vestibule, whether at the entrance of the gate itself or within. He ascends not by one step, but by several steps, the number of which is silent, so that the difficulty of ascent may become apparent, and whatever number of steps you propose, know that it is less than what is left uncertain. I consider this gate, of which it is sung in the Psalms: This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall enter through it. And the threshold of the gate is measured, so that we may know that all the knowledge of God is open. This threshold is said to be one reed in width, and it is not mentioned in terms of height or length. For it is both the way and the entrance, and through it one must advance to the interior (although in this place the Seventy needlessly say 'length' or, as is contained in most manuscripts, 'height'); but the chambers, that is, the rooms and recesses, should have individual reeds both in length and in width, but between chamber and chamber there should be only five cubits, so that the inner chambers may have a full measure of a reed, that is, six cubits and one palm, as the work and the plan equally agree. But those things that are external, that is, between chamber and chamber, are five cubits; for the secrets of Christ have not yet penetrated, nor can they say: The king brought me into his chamber (Song of Songs 1:3). And elsewhere: All the glory of the daughter of the king is inward (Psalm 45:14). But while the disciples are staying at home with Christ, they cannot hear his mysteries, and they desire to go outside themselves to hear the word of God, and for this reason the measure of five cubits is placed in them, so that they may be taught to refer all things to the five senses. The threshold of the other gate, as it is contained in the Septuagint, is also of the same measurement as the second and third vestibules of the same pen. After which, in the entrance of its vestibule, that is, the threshold of the gate, eight cubits are placed, so that the inner parts of the vestibule may hold not a sevenfold, but an eightfold number, namely, six cubits and one palm, which pertain to the sacrament of the resurrection and the Lord's Day. And on the front, it says, of the same vestibule there were two cubits, which pertain to both Instruments, or to the letter and the spirit, or to the mystery of the tongs, which in Isaiah is understood concerning the altar of coal, and is carried to cleanse the lips of the prophet. And so that we may know what this vestibule is, which is terminated by eight and two cubits, he explains more clearly: The vestibule of the gate was inside, through which we reached the temple of God. There were also chambers and rooms along the way of the eastern gate, which Seventy Elau writes about. There were three on one side and three on the other, measuring one rod, that is, one reed, which had six cubits and one palm, as mentioned above: And one rod on its length, and one rod on its width, and five cubits between the chambers. Therefore, let us not think that there are only two bedrooms, but he placed three on each side to demonstrate the number six, which is also indicated in the water jars of the Gospel (John 8), in which water was turned into wine, and daily the Jewish waters are turned into wine, which gladdens the heart of man, and becomes sweeter with the blood of Christ. He also measured the width of the threshold of the gate, which is ten cubits, a perfect number that is either contained in the Ten Commandments or in the sacrament of the four Gospels. Starting from one, it reaches four in such a way as to complete the number ten. Its length was thirteen cubits: for which reason its width is also placed at seventy, which seems to me to be distorted by the negligence of the scribes. For Scripture would not have stated the width in one place, and then the width again as ten or thirteen cubits. However, the gate of the threshold, in which the number of the old and new Testaments is consecrated, or the Lord himself, who says, 'I am the door' (John 10:9), can be understood; or certainly all the saints, through whom we enter into the knowledge of God, of whom the Apostle Paul spoke: 'My mouth is open to you, Corinthians'; and 'Widen yourselves also' (2 Corinthians 6:11). But thirteen cubits after the number of eight, the books of Moses contain a sacrament, which is also shown in the five loaves (Matthew 14), and in the Samaritan woman of the Gospel (John 4), who is accused of having had five husbands, and the sixth whom she thought she had, she did not have. And yet the number eight and the number five are completed with one cubit, that is, the thirteenth (or third) one: because in Christ all things are recapitulated. It is said: 'And one cubit on each side; thus both the old and the new Testament are comprised in the one measure of Christ, and one cubit includes the height of the ark of Noah, which is thirty cubits.' But as for the chambers, as the Seventy (the Septuagint) have rendered the Hebrew word, either 'thalami' or 'thee,' they were six cubits on each side, changing and varying in each place as they pleased, and they had no span or height added above, which would symbolize the present conversation leading to future blessedness, but only six cubits. And he measured the gate from the ceiling of the chamber to the ceiling of the wall, and found it to be twenty-five cubits in width. This number, though multiplied by four, still corresponds to reality. For if you arrange five cubits against themselves five times, you will produce the number twenty-five, which is between the ceiling of the chambers and the ceiling; and yet both, positioned opposite one another, have a doorway facing a doorway from the highest parts. These may not seem trivial to the reader, even though they displease me myself, feeling like I am knocking on a closed door; but they are to be read with permission: otherwise, I could simply confess my ignorance and cut off all desire of students. For as we are far from perfect knowledge, we consider a lighter fault at least somewhat, rather than saying nothing at all.

<h2 id='tocuniq308'>(Vers. 14 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 14 seqq.) And he made frontals of sixty cubits, and all around the front of the courtyard of the gate. And before the face of the gate, which reached up to the face of the inner vestibule gate, there were fifty cubits, and oblique windows in the chambers, and on their front sides which were within the gate, all around. Likewise, there were also windows within the vestibules in a circular shape on the inside, and in front of the frontals there were depictions of palm trees. LXX: And under the sky, the height of the gate was sixty cubits, and the threshold of the court gate all around. And under the sky, the court gate on the outside was fifty cubits, and hidden windows above the threshold, and on the inside of the gate of the court all around. And similarly the side chambers and the windows all around on the inside, and above the palm trees on each side.\" Symmachus interpreted this passage as follows: And he made enclosures, which we can call surroundings: for which in Hebrew, it has Elim (), which Aquila interpreted as κρίωμα, and we translated as front. Again, when the Seventy placed the veil in front of the atrium, in Hebrew it has the singular number El, which Symmachus translated as near the atrium, Aquila κρίωμα, that is, the front of the atrium. Under the sky also, the threshold of the gate, Aquila, in front of the gate posts: Symmachus, opposite the face of the gate vestibule, interpreted. The hidden windows which are called Atemoth in Hebrew, Symmachus translated as τοξικὰς. And where the Seventy said, above the veil, and above the threshold, the same Symmachus placed posts, and surroundings; Aquila, chambers, and their fronts: for which it is written in Hebrew Theim and Ele. Furthermore, Elamoth, which were also translated by the Septuagint and Theodotion in a similar manner; Symmachus rendered 'circumstances,' Aquila rendered 'forefronts.' However, Aelam, which is written as 'El' in Hebrew (Mss. Ul), means 'gate' or 'entrance.' As for palm trees, it is written as 'Thamarim' in Hebrew, in the plural form, because in the singular form it is called 'Thamar.' I know that this might be annoying to a fastidious reader, but I wanted to briefly show how much the ancient translation deviates from Hebrew truth due to the length of time and, dare I say, the fault of the scribes, especially in Hebrew names, which we have expressed in the Latin language not so much as an explanation of the words, but rather as an indication of our simple suspicion. But I think that outside the wall of the temple, around it, and in the courtyard, that is, in the middle, there were certain things placed for decoration, which Symmachus interprets as surroundings, that is, certain standing objects, and erected from the ground up, and these occupy a space of sixty cubits. And again, for those exiting from the inner gate towards the front of the vestibule, which faced the outer gate, there was a space of fifty cubits, in which there were oblique windows, which Symmachus calls arch-shaped. And in these windows were in the chambers, that is, in each bedroom, and in the porches that extended before the bedrooms, occupying fifty cubits. These windows, which were slanted or arched, hence obtained the name from arrows, because they let in a narrow light into the house, resembling the shape of arrows, and they enlarged from the inside: and all things around were full of such windows. And in front, he said, of the porches, there were paintings or carvings of palm trees: through which it is shown at the entrance of the gate, and immediately upon entering, there is a wall that meets sixty cubits with various ornaments, which refer to the condition of the world, so that the Creator may be understood from the creatures: and they show the variety of the world in order and in a rational manner, which among the Greeks is called "kosmos" and received its name from adornment: and it was made in six days, so that through each day, ten decades are counted, which perfect number we mentioned above. After this, as we enter the inner atrium, we encounter before us the vestibule of the inner gate of the bedroom with oblique windows, covering a space of fifty cubits, which itself is a sacred number. And after seven full weeks of festivities and joy, the first day of the Octave begins, which is the day of resurrection, and it brings us to the vicinity of the temple. When we have done everything, repenting for the error of the previous week, then we become close and near to God, as in the outer atrium, the order of creatures teaches us about the knowledge of the Creator and constancy, and in the inner atrium the true jubilee, in which all that is owed to us is forgiven, instructs us in theology and leads us to the Holy of Holies. It should also be noted that the inner atrium has several windows, not direct and equal, but oblique and narrow on the outside, and widening on the inside, so that through small openings we can penetrate into the interior, and reach the fullness of the brightest light that moves in the temple. Finally, after sixty and fifty cubits, and bedrooms, and porticos, and facades of the porticos, and many windows around, the carving or painting of palm trees is shown to us, so that as victors of the world, we may be worthy to see the palms of virtues.


<h2 id='tocuniq309'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 17 onwards) 'And he brought me to the outer court, and there were treasuries, and a paved floor made of stone in the court all around; there were thirty treasuries around the floor. And the floor in front of the gates, facing the interior court outside, was lower. And he measured the distance from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court outside, one hundred cubits to the east and to the north. Seventy: And he brought me to the inner court, and there were chambers, and the columns of the court all around, thirty chambers on the columns, and after the gates there were porticoes in the length of the gates facing the columns below.' And the width of the atrium was measured from the place that was under the outer gate to the inner gate, under the outer gate that faced the outside, one hundred cubits long, and it inclined towards the east. For the thirty chambers, which the Seventy translated as gazophylacia and cellars, as Aquila interpreted, Symmachus placed ἐξέδρας. And for the one hundred cubits of exterior space that extended to the eastern gate, the same number of cubits is stated in Hebrew, and it is said to extend to the north: but in the Seventy, the name of the north has been removed. So that man who had the measuring line of masons in his hand, and the measuring reed, and stood in the gate, showed in his vision, among other things, after the courtyard of sixty cubits, and another vestibule of the inner gate which was fifty cubits long, he brought out the prophet to the outer courtyard, or as it is written in the Septuagint, he brought him into the inner courtyard. And I am quite amazed, according to the literal interpretation and the Septuagint, how after the outer courtyards, which measured sixty and fifty cubits, there is an inner courtyard that extends in width one hundred cubits: unless perhaps, in a mystical and progressive sense, the inner teachings are broader for those who enter. But upon entering the inner courtyard, or being led to the outer courtyard, as is described in Hebrew, he immediately saw thirty chambers or storerooms, or as Symmachus interprets, exedrae, which had been prepared for the dwelling of the Levites and priests, and the floor adorned with living stones or intercolumns, in order to show that the inner or outer courtyard had an arrangement of columns in front of the doors, and a floor in front of the gates, or a portico behind the gates. In these porticoes I believe that the columns were arranged in order, so that there were porticoes in front of the treasury, and columns supporting the porticoes in the fronts of the porticoes. The pavement, which was laid with stones, extended in front of the atrium porticoes, lower in the ascent of the porticoes, and had the same length as the building of the chambers. And the same man measured, in whose hand was a measuring line and a reed, from the face of the lower gate, or as the Seventy interpret, the outer gate, to the front of the atrium or the inner gate, one hundred cubits to the east, and as it is said in Hebrew, and to the north. From which we understand the Gospel that is narrated by the Savior (Matthew XV), about sowing seeds in good soil, which multiplies fruits according to the variety of virtues in thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and hundredfold. This prophecy of this place is fulfilled by these thirty, sixty, and hundred numbers, so that we may be able to reach perfect knowledge through these stages. Only in such a way that the fiftieth number leads us to the inner parts of the Church, which, after the completion of the Sabbath of the seven weeks, burst forth into the day of resurrection. But they are called gazophylacia, which are full of spiritual riches, as it is written: The redemption of a man's soul is his own wealth (Prov. 13:8). On this Paul the Apostle also congratulates his disciples, that they are full of all speech and all knowledge (Phil. 1:). But in the Persian language, treasuries are called 'gaza'. Or certainly the chambers, which are called παστοφόρια in Greek, show the rooms prepared for the arrival of the bridegroom, which were in the number of thirty, in order to demonstrate the complete age of the inhabitants. And the pavement was laid with stone: so that the feet of those who dwell in sin might not be polluted by mud, and earth, and the dust of sinners; but that they might walk upon living stones, with which the temple of God is built: Whether there were intercolumniations before the doors of the chambers, which supported the building placed on top. These are the pillars, of which also the Apostle Paul writes: They gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, James and John that seemed to be pillars (Gal. II, 9). And in another place: Column and buttress of truth (I Tim. III, 15). And in the Apocalypse of John we read: He who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall never go out of it (Apoc. III, 12). Therefore, the pavement that was in front of the gates, of which we have already spoken, or the portico behind the gates, which protected the inhabitants of the rooms from the rain, was lower. For those things that are lower are always placed in higher places, so that we may be able to reach by ascent and steps the mystical and secret things, and those full of spiritual riches." } And the number in the ten is full and perfect in its set of ten, which also multiplies the seed of Isaac by a hundredfold (Genesis 26). But because he was in a foreign land, he could still say: I am a stranger, and a wanderer like all my fathers (Psalm 38:13). It is said that he sowed barley and harvested a hundredfold (Matthew 13, John 12), before the grain of wheat had died in the ground, which would produce many crops. And the hunger of the Jewish people to hear the word of God was satisfied with the bread that came down from heaven (Amos 8, John 6). However, how one hundred cubits were not only to the Eastern gate, but also to the Northern gate, the following testimony will demonstrate.

<h2 id='tocuniq310'>(Vers. 20, 21.)</h2>

(Verse 20, 21) The gate that faced the way of the north of the outer court was measured in length and width, and it had three chambers on either side, and the front and vestibule were of the same size as the front gate, measuring 50 cubits in length and 25 cubits in width. Its windows, vestibule, and carvings were of the same size as the gate that faced east. There were seven steps in its ascent, and a vestibule before it. And the gate of the inner court was opposite the gate of the north and the east. And he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits. Seventy: And he brought me to the north, and behold, there was a gate that faced the outer court. And he measured it in length, and in width, and its threshold was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side, and its height was five cubits, and its doorposts were a palm in width (which is not found in Hebrew). And the measurement of the gate that faced the east was fifty cubits in length and twenty-five cubits in width. And its windows, and its porches, and its palm trees were like the gate that faced the east; and there were seven steps leading up to it, and its porches were on the inside, and it had a gate that faced the inner court facing north (and which in Hebrew is not found, as the gate that faces east). And the outer court was measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits: What the Hebrew words thee, and elau, and elamoth signify, we have already explained more fully: but our translation will now teach their comparison. Now the man whose measuring line was in his hand, the door of the outer court that faces north, he brought the prophet in through the door that faces north to the outer court. It should be noted that he is first brought in through the door that faces north, secondly, through the door that faces south, and thirdly, through the eastern door. For from the north evil breaks forth on the inhabitants of the land (Jeremiah 1:14). And it is clear that one who is a resident of the land, and not a stranger or a foreigner, is exposed to the javelins of one who comes from the north, whose javelins are set ablaze, which, as the Apostle says, are extinguished by the shield of faith (Ephesians 6). And to the north is called the outer courtyard, but to the south, that is, to the south, not the outer courtyard, but the inner courtyard. For the Scripture says: And it led me to the inner courtyard to the South gate, which is also found written similarly in the Eastern courtyard. For the first one entered with strength, treading on the North with his feet, and after fifty-one, 481 and twenty-five, reaching the top of the hundred: then being led to the South side and expelling the cold of the North: and then coming to perfect strength, that is, to the Eastern gate, in which the sun of justice rises, and through which only the high priest enters. And this must be observed, that although there are four cardinal directions, no mention is made of the Western gate, which is written at the beginning of the sixty-seventh psalm: Make a way for him who ascends from the West, his name is the Lord (Psalm 7:5); so that after we have prepared a way for the Lord and fulfilled what John the Baptist proclaims in the wilderness: Prepare the way for the Lord, make his paths straight (Matthew 3:3), we may be able to hear what is said at the end of the same psalm: Sing to God, sing praises to the Lord, who ascends above the highest heavens to the East (Psalm 68:33). But what is said of the three chambers here and three chambers there teaches that both the letter and the spirit, and both understanding and tropology, pertain to the sacraments of the Trinity. And that which is said, 'And its front and vestibule according to the measure of the previous gate,' signifies the Eastern gate, which is called first not by order but by merit. And it had, he says, fifty cubits in length and twenty-five in width, so that in fifty weeks after seven hebdomads eternal rest is demonstrated: stretching throughout the day of resurrection to the kingdoms of heaven, in which true rest is. But in twenty-five, as we have already mentioned, let the measurement of the five senses be preserved by the five orders of the square, of which one is adapted to length and the other to width; so that in length there may be rest and delight in a more sacred science, and in width there may be a demonstration of the present things that pertain to the senses. And it is implied: And its windows, and vestibules, and sculptures, or as the Seventy added, palms, were according to the measurement of the gate that looked toward the East, this is subtly indicated, that whoever is positioned at the entrance of virtues may have entered three and three chambers, and may recognize the front and vestibule of the measurement of the former gate, and proceed to those things, and behold what has been most fully contained in the Eastern gate. Furthermore, what follows: And there were seven steps to its ascent, and a vestibule in front of it, or inside, it has this meaning, that through the seven steps of the week, and the lamps that are lit from the face of the North, and the ceremonies of the Jews, for which God gave commandments that are not good, and the justifications in which they do not live, we climb to higher things and to its vestibule, that is, its gates, for which the Seventy Elders translated. The vestibule before the gate is both inward and outward. There is not only one gate of the North, which is called the outer gate, but also another gate within, which resembles the gate of the East, as the Seventy have made more manifest. And the inner gate of the court faces the gate of the North, just as the gate that faced the East did. And the measurement was from the outer gate of the North to its inner gate, one hundred cubits: so that departing from the outer gate, we may come to the inner gate by these as it were steps and measurements, the secret of whose number has been mentioned above.


<h2 id='tocuniq311'>(Vers 24 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 24 onwards) 'And he brought me to the south gate, and behold, there was a gate that faced south. And its front and vestibule were measured according to the higher measurements, and it had windows and vestibules all around, like the other windows. Its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits, and there were seven steps leading up to it, and there was a vestibule before its doors, and carved palm trees on its front, one on each side.' And the gate of the inner court facing south measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits. Then he brought me into the inner court by the south gate, and he measured the south gate according to the same measurements. Its rooms, its posts, and its vestibule were of the same measurements. And there were windows in it and in its vestibule all around, fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. And a vestibule of twenty-five cubits in length, and five cubits in width. And its vestibule faced the outer court, and its columns were in front, and it had eight steps by which one could ascend to it.» 483 Seventy agree in the same words, except thee, elau, and elamoth, and elam, for which ulam is used in Hebrew. Thee, however, is interpreted as threshold or front; elau, around it or supports; elamoth, gateways or vestibules; ulam means entrance, that is, before the doors. But what we have placed next to the Hebrew: And the vestibule, or πρόπυλον, in a circle of twenty-five cubits in length, and five cubits in width, is not found in the Septuagint. But it is also to be noted that in the south gate according to the Septuagint it is not called a road, but simply: and he led me to the south, and behold, a gate facing south. Therefore, through each entrance Ezekiel, whom God strengthened, for this is the meaning of his name, is led, and from the north gate he passes to the southern gate, whose fronts, and thresholds τροπύλαια, or vestibules, and windows around had similar measurements, fifty cubits in length and twenty-five cubits in width, and it was ascended to by seven steps, that is, to the southern gate, and its vestibule, that is, elamoth, before its doors, and there were also two carved palms, of which we have spoken in the gate of the northern region. And let this be sufficient to remind, that whatever is placed there, according to a lower intelligence, that is, according to the literal sense, we understand at the southern gate according to the spiritual sense. For in the same lines, both history and tropology run: but the former is humble, the latter sublime: the former clings to the earth, the latter soars to the heavens. And all things were filled with light around through the windows. For each πρόβλημα has its own limits, and through it the light proper to the believing soul enters: especially if the length of his life, that is, fifty years, has been prolonged by the mystery of a jubilee, and has been able to reach the breadth of a more divine sense. In this latitude and on these streets wisdom confidently prevails, and with a lofty voice, it cries out: it enters by seven steps, that it may reach the vestibule, and by the palms of its purpose and efforts, it may hold eternal victory. And lest we think that there is only one atrium to the south, about the second atrium it is said: And the door of the inner atrium is on the 484th street to the south, and it is measured from the door to the gate on the southern street a hundred cubits; so that after the weeks and sacraments of the old instrument, it may reach good soil and the grace of the Gospel. Not only is there a second atrium in the southern gate, but also a third, about which it is now said: 'And he brought me into the inner atrium at the southern gate, and measured the gate according to the upper measures, etc. For each atrium has its own measures and arrangements, and in these measures there is a different grace, as we know the same things differently at the beginning, in progress, and at the end. However, what is not found in the Septuagint, and the vestibule, or πρόπυλον, in a circular shape, with a length of twenty-five cubits and a width of five cubits, seems to raise a question, because it is not mentioned in the old interpretation, how twenty-five cubits and five are placed after the progress of the third step.' But it removes the ambiguity what follows: And its entrance to the outer courtyard: and its palms on the front; so that this courtyard, which had a length of twenty-five cubits, and a width of five, is not of the inner courtyard, but of the outer courtyard, so that it possesses the width of the previous courtyard, that is, twenty-five cubits, and holds a length of the outer courtyard, and a width of five cubits. These measurements, that is, twenty-five and five, we refer to the same senses, namely, sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. And if we ascend to higher things, we double them five times and make them spiritual from bodily senses, as it is said: Lift up your eyes and see that the fields are already white for harvest (John 4:35), And: He who has ears to hear, let him hear (Luke 8:8). And: Taste and see that the Lord is good (Psalm 34:8). And: We are the sweet odor of Christ to God in those who believe (2 Corinthians 2:15). And in the Epistle of John it is said: That which we have heard and seen, and our hands have touched, about the Word of life (1 John 1:1). And finally, just as in the northern region seven degrees are not sufficient, but after seven comes the number eight, so we transition from the Synagogue to the Church, from the old testament to the new, from earthly things to heavenly things.


<h2 id='tocuniq312'>(Vers. 28 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 28 seqq.) And he led me into the inner courtyard through the Eastern gate, and he measured the gate according to the upper measurements; its chambers, its façade, and its vestibule as above, and its windows and vestibules all around, with a length of fifty cubits and a width of twenty-five cubits. And its vestibule, that is, the outer courtyard" (for which the LXX and Symmachus have put "inner"), "and carved palm trees on its façade on both sides, and an ascent of eight steps. » From the Northern side, where only seven steps were ascended into the atrium, one passes to the Southern gate and the atrium of the same side, which is ascended not only by seven, as before, but by eight steps: namely, that we may pass from the old to the new; and to speak more clearly, that we may come through the patriarchs and prophets to the apostles: so that in one week there may be the hebdomad, and in the other, the octave. But now it comes to the last, or rather to the highest, and introduces the prophet by the way of the inner gate, or through the atrium, to which one goes by the way of the East. In this place, the way is only known by the road that says: I am the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6) in the Eastern part, so that we may understand that in the Northern and Southern regions it is completely silent. Through Him we come to the Father, and it is written about Him: Blessed are the undefiled in the way (Psalm 119:1), who do not perceive anything of Christ as sinister, but their faith is pure and not polluted by the filth of heretics. And the number of chambers, fronts, vestibules, windows, and their respective measurements of length and width are the same: namely, fifty and twenty-five cubits, preserving the sacredness, and the vestibule of its gate or inner court, which is placed on the outside according to the Hebrew, so that all things may be kept enclosed in the Eastern light, according to what is written: Nor is there anyone who can hide from its heat (Psalm XIX, 7). But if we understand the atrium both externally and internally, we must understand that God is both surrounding and indwelling, as the prophet says: 'He holds the heavens in the palm of His hand, and the earth in His fist' (Isaiah 40:12), so that all things are seen to be encompassed by Him. And again: 'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool' (Isaiah 66:1), so that He is believed to be present within all things, according to that Virgilian verse (Aeneid, Book VI).

At the beginning, the sky and the earth, and the flowing fields, and the shining globe of the moon, and the stars of Titan, the spirit drives from within: it infuses all through the limbs, the mind moves the mass, and mingles itself with the great body.

And when, through the weapons of justice, on the right and on the left, through glory and shame, through good and bad reputation, through praise and blame, we have achieved victory over this world (2 Corinthians 6): then palms are given to us on both sides, which neither joys nor sorrows nor successes nor adversities have changed; and not through seven (or rather eight) steps, as in the northern region, nor through seven and eight, as in the southern region, but only through eight (or rather seven) steps do we ascend to the highest point; whereby the number eight is sufficient for us, that is, the sacrament of the Gospel; so that we can say, according to the Apostle: Even though we knew Christ according to the flesh, yet now we no longer know Him (2 Corinthians 5:16), and it is understood 'according to the flesh'.


<h2 id='tocuniq313'>(Vers. 35 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 35 onwards) 'And he brought me to the gate that faces north, and measured its upper chambers, its front, its vestibule, and its windows all around: its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits. Its vestibule faced the outer court, and palm tree decorations were on its front, on both sides, and its ascent had eight steps.' And for each treasury there is a door in the gates (in the Vulgate, fronts): there they shall wash the burnt offering. And in the vestibule of the gate, on this side and on that side, there are two tables, on which the burnt offering, and the sin offering, and the guilt offering shall be sacrificed. And on the outer side, which goes up to the gate that faces north, there are two tables, and on the other side before the vestibule of the gate, there are two tables. Four tables on this side, and four tables on that side: on the sides of the gate, there were eight tables, on which they would sacrifice (in the Vulgate, would sacrifice): but four tables were built for the burnt offering of square stones, with a length of one and a half cubits, and a width of one and a half cubits, and a height of one cubit, on which they would place (in the Vulgate, they would place) the vessels in which the burnt offering and the victims are sacrificed. And their lips were one palm in circumference, turned inward all around; and on the tables were the offerings of meat.» In this testimony, the Hebrew Truth is greatly different from the edition of the Seventy Interpreters. For what we have said: There they shall wash the burnt offering, and in the vestibule there are two tables here, and again: So that the burnt offering and the sin offering may be offered on them, it is not found in the Seventy [version]: but it is added in many manuscripts from Theodotion. Again, when we said: And their lips were turned inward in a circle of one palm, they transferred it to seventy, and having the shape of a false god inward in a circle. Whether this word is Hebrew or Greek, we do not know, except only that for 'false god,' Symmachus and Theodotion translated it as 'lips'; the first edition of Aquila, with the plural form, 'epistases'; the second edition translated it as 'lips': for which in Hebrew it is written Asephathaim(). And where we have spoken, on the tables however the meats of the offering, the Seventy put from their own (translation), and on the tables (they) covered from above, that they may be protected from rain and drought. However, what they have produced in Hebrew names, Thee, and Elau, and Elalamoth, and Aelam, what they signify, and we have warned above, and our translation can show in turn: And it is not necessary to frequently warn the reader about this, and to distrust his wisdom and diligence. Therefore, it is introduced again to the gate that looked towards the North: but not as before to the outer courtyard, but to the inner one. For in what is said afterwards: Its vestibule looked towards the outer courtyard, it is shown that this courtyard was inside. Through which the progress of the one entering is shown; as in each place there are appropriate names and measurements, and the windows all around are full of light, showing the whole extent of knowledge, and through fifty and twenty-five cubits the sacraments of divine senses and remission are placed, as we see in the vestibule of the inner courtyard: contemplating the knowledge of the past and present, through which we come to the twofold palms and victories, and understand the mysteries of the eight degrees, having entered the treasuries, in which the riches of the temple are contained, and our prayers are cleansed from every stain of sin; and on either side of the tables two are placed, so that the first offering may be sacrificed.

The vigilant herdsman follows his father's custom, and the barking Gesacus, and the barking Sidonian, and so on. That the sacred fire may assume the whole, first for sin, and finally for ignorance: either because we have committed it knowingly, or unknowingly. On the outer side also, next to the Seventy, there was a stream made by the workman, which carried away the ashes of the burnt offerings, and the foulness of the flesh on the outside: whether there were two altars, and on the other side of the vestibule of the same gate were two altars, that is, four on each side, four on this side and four on that side, and behind, or on the side of them were eight other altars: so that they make sixteen altars together: by this number the mysteries of the prophets are shown, so that whatever we offer through the Gospel's proclamation, we confirm by their prophecies. And there are four tables made of square stones, and these themselves are for sacrifice and burnt offering. These are living stones that roll upon the earth and they have with them a corner stone, by which the walls of the old and new Instruments are contained. And the number four represents the sacraments of the Gospel, having a length and width of one and a half cubit, meaning, in square form, which, when joined together, make three cubits, which have one cubit in height; so that the mysteries of the Trinity may preserve the measurement of divine majesty, as the Lord says to the disciples: Go, baptize all nations in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19). But the name of God, as it were, is of one cubit in height, which encompasses 489 three properties, and always receives the holocaust offering of our oblations. Moreover, on top of these four tables made of living stones, the length, width, and height of which are described, vessels are placed in which the holocaust of the martyrs is sacrificed, of whom it is said: Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints (Ps. 116:15); and their victims, who sacrifice their souls to the Lord with continence and the holiness of the body. I believe that the name of these tables is mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew, Luke, Mark, and John, where a crown is bent inwardly over their circumference, enclosing the margins, so as to hold the sacrifices inside and not allow them to flow around freely. It also held the meat offerings, or as translated by the Septuagint: 'And the tables themselves were covered from above, because of the violence of the rain and the excessive dryness of the summer sun, so that the meat placed on top could say with the prophet: 'The sun shall not strike us by day, nor the moon by night' (Ps. 120:6)." } One of these, with excessive rain and storms, dissolves offerings of tribulations; the other, with intense heat of persecutions, dries up whatever has been offered. Forgive, reader, the difficulty of the passages: or if you can find something better, teach: we gladly learn what we do not know.

<h2 id='tocuniq314'>(Vers. 44 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 44 and following) 'And outside the front gate of the treasury of the singers in the inner court, which was on the side of the gate facing north, and their faces were towards the south: one on the side of the east gate, which faced the way of the north. And he said to me: 'This is the treasury that faces the south, for the priests who keep watch at the temple. And the treasury that faces the way of the north shall be for the priests who keep watch at the altar: These are the sons of Zadok who approach from the sons of Levi to the Lord, to minister to him.' And he measured the atrium in length one hundred cubits, and in width one hundred cubits, squared, and the altar before the face of the temple. And he brought me into the vestibule of the temple: and he measured the vestibule five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. And the length of the vestibule twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and they went up to it by eight steps, and the columns thereof (thus in the manuscripts. But the Vulgate has "were") on the front of them, one on this side, and another on that side. 490. Regarding the treasuries, the Seventy translated the exedrae. And that which we have said about the exedrae, or the treasuries of the singers, was omitted by them. Again, after the measurement of the vestibule of fifty cubits here and fifty cubits there, they added from their own, and the width of the gate is fourteen cubits, while in the Hebrew it is only mentioned as the width of three cubits here and three cubits there. I have reminded the reader of these things so that they may not be disturbed by the diversity of translations, but may be content with the Hebrew truth, especially in matters of the measurements of the temple. Therefore, after the wall, which the Septuagint translated as 'περίβολον' and which went around the entire temple in a square shape, we read about the prophet being led into the inner courtyard, and then to the North, and to the South, and to the Eastern gate, and again to the North. We have spoken about these things as best we could, and the previous discourse showed us the differences in names and measurements that we observed. The meaning of these, as briefly shown by the testimony of the Savior, is: 'In my Father's house are many mansions' (John 14:2). With these things being completed, he enters the temple, that is, the Holy of Holies, of which it is now said, and within the inner gate, the treasuries, or the singers' exedra. To them is that command given. Sing to the Lord a new song (Ps. XCV, 1). They cry out with the angels: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will (Luke II, 14). The inner courtyard was located on the side of the gate that looked toward the north, and toward the south, and toward the east; so that the singers of the Lord always remember, and those who are occupied in the office of angels, through whom they have reached the highest steps; and that they may carefully understand the mysteries of each place. Finally, that man whose pen and rope were in hand, having led the prophet into the inner courtyard which overlooks the southern road, spoke these words: 'This is the treasury or chamber; and as Theodotius established it, it is the chamber that is separate for the dwelling of the priests, who keep watch in the guard posts of the temple. Furthermore, the treasury that overlooks the northern road will be for the priests who keep watch for the service of the altar.' In which it should be noted that the priests to whom the custody of the temple is delegated dwell in the south treasury, which overlooks the southern road where the light is fullest. And those who stand guard at the altar, where the sacrifices for sin are offered, should dwell in the north treasury, which overlooks the northern road and where those coming from the north offer sacrifices for their sins, desiring to receive salvation. Both of these groups, serving the Lord in their respective duties, are called sons of Zadok, which means just or righteous, for they justify the Almighty God, as it is written: The Lord is just and loves justice; his countenance beholds equity (Psalm 10:8). But these are the sons of Sadoc, of the sons of Levi, who is interpreted as 'assumed': and they themselves are assumed by the Lord, so that they may approach Him, and it is not said of them alone, as of Moses: Moses approached the Lord; but also all those who serve and minister to Him are said to draw near to the Lord. But this man who brought Ezekiel into the inner court, and so to speak, to the Holy of Holies, measured the court itself, in which there were two chambers or treasuries assigned to the temple guards, or the dwellings of the altar, and he found it to be two hundred cubits in length and in width, forming a square: so that the priests of God who serve in ministry, and who have entered through a narrow and restricted way, may have spacious walkways and may dwell in a perfect and complete number of virtues. And in the atrium itself there was an altar before the face of the temple, so that the prayer of the saints to God never ceases. The aforementioned man also brought Ezekiel into the vestibule, or πρόπυλον of the temple, which was measured five cubits from here and five cubits from there, for the one who was brought in had been instructed in divine senses and knew neither right nor left, but entered by the royal way. And the width of the gate itself, through which there was an entrance to the vestibule of the temple, measured three cubits from here to there. In the observance of the Holy Scriptures, it is proper not to say 'right' or 'left' in order not to mention anything sinister in the Holy of Holies, but rather 'from here' and 'from there', that is, from both sides. And immediately the discerning reader understands that the number three pertains to the mystery of the Trinity, which is the gate for those who approach God, for the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, and the Holy Spirit is in both. The number three is the one door of those who, after the baptism of the Trinity, come to salvation. But what follows: The length of the vestibule is twenty cubits, and the width is eleven cubits, seems to raise the question of how the dual number, which refers to two decades, and the eleventh, which seems to have one less, can be said to complete the sacred number of twelve in the vestibule of the temple. Most people solve this as follows: Although the priests are holy and placed in the ministries of the temple, and offer daily sacrifices to Christ: nevertheless, because they dwell in this mortal and fragile body, subject to illnesses and vices, they have the number twenty and eleven. Whereas the Apostle says: 'Wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from the body of this death?' (Rom. VII, 24). Not that we believe, according to the most savage heresy, that bodies are to be abolished; but that it is ours to put on, not to strip off, and to receive immortality in this mortal state, and to put on incorruption in this corruptible state. However, what follows, 'And he ascended by eight degrees to it' (I Cor. XV), that is, to the inner gate, presents a great difficulty to those who know the Hebrew language. Finally, Symmachus, whom we have followed in this place, placed eight steps: Seventy, ten; Theodotion and Aquila's second edition, eleven; however, the first edition did not indicate a number, but simply said, and the steps by which it was ascended: so that either according to the custom of the previous gates, we understand eight steps, as Symmachus understood, or certainly those which the inner gate had, whose number Scripture did not mention (for which in Hebrew it is written, Urob (), that is, width, Aste (), Esre (). But if it is read this way, undecim signifies: 493; but if we read it as Esre, which means ten, we do not read Eser (ten), but a pronoun. These may seem like delusions to experts in the Hebrew language, but we are not now writing about controversies or speeches, which often involve the arrangement of words, but rather explanations and commentaries on Hebrew books. But let us return to what we started. The perfect number, whether eight or ten steps, or eleven as we have already mentioned, is ascended to the gate of the holy ones, on the front of which there were columns, one on this side and another on that side. He did not say 'two' so as not to incur a dual number, but 'one and one,' which is a perfect number and imitates the unity of God. These were the two pillars, of which it is also said in the Apocalypse: 'He who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more' (Rev. 3:12). And Peter and John are called the pillars of the Church (Gal. 2), through whom we enter into the Holy of Holies, and by whose doctrine our entrance to Christ is made.


<h2 id='tocuniq315'>(Cap. XLI.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter XLI - Verses 1 and following) 'And he brought me into the temple and measured the front of the six cubits wide on one side and the front of the six cubits wide on the other side, the width of the tabernacle. And the width of the gate was ten cubits, and the sides (or shoulders) of the gate were five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other side. And he measured its length of forty cubits and its width of twenty cubits.' After many mysteries and various entrances, and the peculiarities of each place, finally, at last, a man came, whose line was that of a mason, and a measuring rod in his hand, he brought the prophet Ezekiel into the temple and measured the front of the temple. For which reason, the Septuagint translated it as 'threshold', and Theodotian as 'post', and Symmachus as 'entrance'. And on both sides the breadth of the tabernacle was six cubits, containing the symbol of all creatures: for in six days the world was made. Through the knowledge of which we enter into the temple of God, and by the order and constancy of creatures we come to know the Creator. And the breadth of the gate of the temple was ten cubits, which is a sacred and perfect number, and in which, on the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, there is fasting and propitiation. On the tenth day of the first month, which is called Nisan, the lamb is taken for sacrifice and the preparation of the Passover. Then, on the seventh month, tithes are offered in the storehouses of God, or, as Scripture commonly refers to them, winepresses. Hence the Apostle says: 'Be ye also enlarged' (2 Corinthians 6), meaning that after entering the temple through ten cubit-wide gates, the sides of the gates themselves, or as it is properly said in Hebrew, the shoulders, are measured, which always pertain to works. And Isachar desired the good (Gen. XLIX), resting among the clergy, and seeing rest, because it is good, and the land, because it is fertile, he placed his shoulder to the work, and became a farmer. And in the vestment of the high priest, the shoulder piece is bound to the breastplate, so that the works of reason may be united, and the man of the Church can say: I have understood from your commandments (Ps. CXVIII, 104). The gates of the shoulders, on either side, had five porches, so that through earthly and divine senses, about which we have often written, we may enter the innermost part of the temple, whose measurements are forty cubits in length and twenty cubits in width, or more accurately, the length and width of the gates: because he had spoken only of the width and shoulders above. But there is no doubt that the number which makes 20800, which is close to eighty, is significant. Hence in Ecclesiastes it is commanded: Give a portion to seven and also to eight (Eccl. XI, 2). I am aware that there has been frequent discussion about the mystery of this number, whether it is because through tribulations and hardships of this world we enter into the sanctuary of the Lord, thus the gate had a length of forty cubits, a number always associated with labor. Wherefore both Moses and Elias fasted forty days, not eating bread, nor drinking water, as it is written, Deuteronomy 9, 3 Kings 19. Likewise, the people of Israel were vexed and tried for forty years in the wilderness, and after many labors, entered the land of promise. And the Lord and Savior, in the weakness of assumed flesh, was tempted for forty days in the wilderness, so that after victory, angels might come and minister to Him, as it is written, Matthew 4. But when we are able to say with the Apostle through tribulations and distress: In all things we suffer tribulation, but are not crushed, 2 Corinthians 4. And with the Prophet: In tribulation, Thou hast made me wide, Psalm 4. Then for us the widest entrance is opened, which has a width of twenty cubits, so that after overcoming the struggles and earthly things, which themselves are the number two, we may enter the innermost parts of the temple and hear the Lord commanding His disciples: Have confidence, I have overcome the world, John 16." }


<h2 id='tocuniq316'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>

(Verse 3, 4.) And he entered inside (or into the inner courtyard) and measured the front (or threshold) of the gate, two cubits, and the gate, six (alternative: ten) cubits, and the width of the gate, seven cubits (or the width of the gateposts, seven cubits on either side). And he measured its (or the doors') length, twenty cubits, and its width, twenty cubits before the face of the temple. And he said to me: This is the Most Holy Place. Let us make progress, always a greater progress is opening up for us. Therefore, after entering the temple, we enter again inside, or as the Seventy translated, the inner courtyard, in front of which, or Ael, instead of Symmachus, around the gate, Theodotion the Aelam, the Hebrew Ul (), the entrance Aquila, we interpret as 'the front'. There were two cubits: so that according to the higher sense we enter through the dual number to that place where the Holy of Holies is. And the gate itself was six cubits wide, through which we entered and obtained eternal rest, which is shown in the number seven. For this reason, the Seventy translated it, and placed a width of seven cubits on both sides of the gate, in Hebrew and other editions only once, seven cubits, on the width of the gate. But what follows: And its length was measured, or as the Seventy translated, the doors were twenty cubits, for which in most codices forty are contained according to the Seventy, it also signifies a width of twenty cubits in front of the face of the temple, that which always meets us as a measure of past labor and struggle before the face and entrance of the temple. For just as the number duplex possesses a certain ratio in individual numbers, so do two have the same ratio in tens. And this should be considered, that entering inward through the gate of two cubits in front, and having six cubits, and seven on each side in width, and twenty cubits in length, and 496 as many in the very doors of the temple, let the prophet be taught what that place is, or by what name it is called. For he said to me: This is the Holy of Holies. But if before the temple, or as Scripture calls it, before the face of the Holy of Holies, how great a beatitude should we consider in the innermost parts of the temple! About which the prophet speaks: This is my labor in my sight, until I enter into the sanctuary of God, and understand their last things (Ps. LXXVII, 16, 17). But it is also worth noting that in the description of the tabernacle, they are called Holy of Holies, in the plural number; here, however, it is Holy of Holies, in the singular number, so that after the sacred things we come to the holy things: just as after many songs we come to the Song of Songs, which is the song of all songs, and in which, as we sing, we are joined in embrace with the Bridegroom.


<h2 id='tocuniq317'>(Vers. 5 seqq.)</h2>

(v. 5-6) And he measured the wall of the house, six cubits wide; and the width of each side chamber, four cubits, all around the house on every side. The side chambers were in three stories, one above the other, thirty chambers in each story; they rested on ledges which were for the side chambers all around, that they might be supported, but not fastened to the wall of the temple. As one went up from story to story, each story was wider than the one below, corresponding to the structure of the house, and therefore ascending in a spiral running around the house; ascending round and round, from the lowest story to the highest, the rooms were wider at every successive level, because the structure of the house was such that the greater were the increments of the height, the greater was the width." } Therefore, the temple was wider in the upper parts, and thus, from the lower parts, it was ascended to the upper parts in the middle, and from the middle to the narrower parts and Thrael. However, what is placed in the Septuagint, 'And from the middle to the narrower parts', that is, to three chambers, and Thrael, is not found in Hebrew. Instead of Thrael (which I do not know what it means, for it is not found in Hebrew), it is read among them, the Uraithi (), which both we and others have translated, and I saw that it follows the order of the testimony.


<h2 id='tocuniq318'>(Vers. 8 seqq.)</h2>

(Verset 8 et suivants) 'And I saw in the house a height all around, with foundations of six cubits in size, and a width on the outside wall of five cubits. And the interior of the house had side chambers all around, with a width of twenty cubits around the house on every side. And there were doors for the side chambers toward the prayer area, one door toward the north and one door toward the south. And the width of the prayer area was five cubits all around.' (which is not included in the Septuagint). And the building that was separate and facing the road towards the sea, was seventy cubits wide: but the wall of the building was five cubits wide all around, and its length was ninety cubits. After reaching the Holy of Holies, which we mentioned above, that venerable man measured the wall of the Holy of Holies, which, because of the structure of the world and every visible creature, which was created in six days, had a height of six cubits and a width of one cubit on each side, not on one side, but all around. But the width of the house all around was four cubits, so as to represent the four elements from which all things are composed, especially the human bodies which the holy ones fight against and subject their souls to the power, deserving to enter the interior and know the secrets of the Lord. The sides of the house that were around it, and were separated from the walls of the temple by a space of four cubits, were joined together: so that one side would touch the other side, and have in length not thirty-three cubits, but twice thirty-three, that is, sixty-six. In the book of Leviticus, the Old Testament speaks of the birth of a child, after seven days by the sea, and the mother and the child must wait for thirty-three days to be purified (Lev. XII). However, if the child is a female, the number is doubled, that is, sixty-six days. And because, in order to enter the holy of holies, we need not only the first birth but also a second, to be born in the flesh and be reborn in the spirit: therefore, the number is not sixty-six but twice thirty-three, as both births are owed to God the Creator and His mercy, and they surround the two sides of the house that support the temple building with a double wall. And what follows according to the Hebrew: 'And there were certain prominences that would come out through the wall of the house on the sides all around, so that they would contain and not touch the wall of the temple,' that signifies that holy men burst forth from the wall of the temple in the multitude of believers, namely through all the sides around, and they hold the foundations of the Church, and yet do not touch the wall of the temple: only being content to have seen so much and from afar to have adored the unspeakable mysteries. For now we see through a glass darkly, and cannot fully touch and comprehend the truth. But that which was a square in shape, ascending upward in a spiral, and leading into the upper room of the temple in a circle: and therefore the temple was wider in the upper areas, and thus one ascended from the lower to the higher and middle parts: I believe it is clear to the reader, that those things which are below, namely fasting and self-control in eating, are always narrower, and gradually as we ascend to the highest things, a wider path is opened to us, and we are filled with what is written: In my distress you have enlarged me (Ps. 4:1). But we ascend to the upper room of the temple by a round and winding staircase, which, among all forms, is approved as more beautiful even by the philosophers of this age: while both the sky, and the sun, and the moon, and the other stars, and the point of the earth, in human bodies also, the eyes, as if other stars, and the shape of the head, which is the receptacle of all the senses, and the smooth fingers, and women, and arms, exhibit this roundness. Furthermore, I think that the upper room of the temple, which we ascend from lower to higher, is the same that Elias and Eliseus had in the book of Kings, and that Tabitha, which means 'gazelle' in Greek, and our damsel possessed in the Acts of the Apostles, who had reached the heights through her good works (1 Kings 17; 2 Kings 4; Acts 9; Acts 10). But the Apostle Peter, on whom the Lord established the foundations of the Church, surpassed the upper room and came to the roof, which is more significantly called 'δῶμα' in Greek, that is, the roof terrace: and he learned the mysteries of the Church, which were previously unknown to the world. The Savior also made the Passover in the upper room, and in a large and wide upper room, and having cleaned and prepared it from all filth, and having spread a spiritual banquet, where he handed over to his disciples the mystery of his body and blood, and left to us the eternal feast of the spotless lamb. And he added: And from the middle to the saddest, that is, the third upper rooms and Thrael, it seems to me that it should be marked with an obelus. For why is it necessary to discuss uncertain and unwritten things, when we should focus on the books that the Hebrews hold? It follows: 'And I saw in the temple a height founded on 499 cubits all around, with a span of six cubits; and on the outer side of the wall of the temple, a width of five cubits; and between the treasure chambers (which Symmachus calls exedrae) a width of twenty cubits all around the temple. These numbers show that by means of this world and earthly senses, and by means of the dual number of two decades, which relates to twenty, we not only deserve to ascend to the Holy of Holies and their rooms, but also to always remember that through the six days of our condition and the five senses, and through the twenty cubits of width, we ascend to the room of the temple, leaving behind earthly humility and the sense of the letter, and pass over to the summit of the Church, rejoicing in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.' And the doorway, he says, of the side facing the north (Jer. 1:14), from which evil spreads over all the earth, and which the Lord promises to drive away from us, saying: And I will drive away the one who is from the north from you (Joel 2:20). And it is a beautiful place for prayer at the door facing the north, as the Apostle says (1 Thess. 5), let us pray without ceasing, and let us say with Jeremiah: Let not the pupil of my eye be silent (Lam. 2:18), either desiring to avoid present evils or giving thanks for past ones. For as long as we are in the tabernacle of this body, we groan and say: Wretched man that I am, who will deliver me from this body of death? (Rom. VII, 24). But there was also a door leading to the southern road, which itself had a place of prayer next to it in the Hebrew manner, extending five cubits all around. For after the cold of the North, we pass to the warmth of the South, and yet we again seek a place of prayer, at the door of the North, in order to escape dangers; in the South, to give thanks for what is past and to have a secure possession of victory. But the five cubits, which in this place indicate divine senses, by which we ascend from earthly things to higher things. And the building, he says, which was separate and turned towards the road facing the sea, was seventy cubits wide: so that after labors and dangers, and the waves and shipwrecks of this age, and the seventy years, about which Jeremiah writes, and Daniel, and Zachariah (Jeremiah 25 and 29; Daniel 9, Zechariah 9); but also the lawful Sabbaths of the seven decades we attain 500: so that we may have eternal rest, and through the five cubits in width we may come to a length of ninety cubits: in which age Sarah gave birth to a son according to the promise, who, at the age of ninety years, that is, nine decades, Isaac was born, joined to Abraham, who had reached one hundred years, that is, ten decades, bearing a mystery. (Genesis 21) The following Scripture will show what the number signifies.

(Verse 13 and following) And the house was measured in length one hundred cubits. And the separate building, and its walls, were one hundred cubits in length. And the width of the front of the house, and that which was separate opposite the East, one hundred cubits. And the length of the building opposite its face, which was separate at the back, was one hundred cubits. And there was an outstanding (that is, prominent) projection on both sides of one hundred cubits. And there was an inner temple and vestibules of the courtyard." } Thresholds and slanting windows are displayed, forming a loop around each threshold, and a wooden floor surrounds the loop. The ground extends up to the windows, and the windows are closed. Above the doors, extending to the inner house, and outside, around every wall, inside and out, to the measure. Cherubim and palm trees are carved, with a palm tree between each cherub. Each cherub has the face of a man next to the palm tree on one side, and the face of a lion next to the palm tree on the other side. These carvings are throughout the entire house. From the ground up to the top of the entrance were carved cherubim and palm trees on the wall of the temple. The threshold was square. The appearance of the sanctuary was facing the appearance of the wooden altar, with a height of three cubits and a length of two cubits. And its angles, and its length, and its walls were wooden. Seventy cubits: And it was measured against the length of the house, which was one hundred cubits: and the remaining parts and separations and its walls, in the length of one hundred cubits: And the width against the face of the temple, and the remaining parts against one hundred cubits. And he measured the length of the wall separating the face of the others, which were behind the back of that house, and the rest from here and there a length of one hundred cubits. And the temple and the corners, and the outer Aela paved with wood, and three windows made like a net, for light to shine through, so that one could look through them. And the house, and those things which were close by, were paved with wood all around. And the floor, 501, and from the floor to the windows. And the windows were made in three layers, so that one could see through them: both to the inner and outer house, and through the entire surrounding wall on the inside and outside, with measurements and carvings of cherubim and palm trees between the cherubim. There were two cherubim faces: a human face towards one palm tree, and a lion face towards the other palm tree. The entire wall was carved all around, from the floor up to the cherubim's ceiling, with carved palm trees. And the sanctuary and the temple were opened on all four sides opposite the face of the saints: a vision like the appearance of a wooden altar: its height was three cubits, and its length two cubits: and its width two cubits: and it had horns, and its bases and walls were wooden. The word 'contra', which the Septuagint translated at the beginning of the testimony, where it is written: 'And he measured against the house', is not found in Hebrew, and therefore it should be marked with a dagger: so that it is more accurate and truer, and it was measured against the house with a length of one hundred cubits, and the rest. The Holy of Holies and the inner temple are described as having a length of ninety cubits and a width of three hundred cubits, which is the perfect number of ten decades. This is so that we may serve the Lord in mind, speech, and deeds, remembering the example of the Apostle who said: 'So that we may know the breadth and length and depth and height' (Ephesians 3:18). In Hebrew, the term 'separate structure' and its walls are interpreted by the Septuagint as separating and not attaching to the walls of the temple, but having their own nearby walls. The temple itself, including its corners and the porch, which is also called πρόπυλον or vestibule, was covered with wood, symbolizing wisdom. This recalls the wood of life located in paradise, as mentioned in the Scriptures (Gen. II). The windows were made like nets, resembling lattices, so that they would be closed with interlaced and decorated wooden shutters, and not with stone or glass. The Hebrew language refers to these as oblique windows, which were only present in three parts of the temple: on the right, on the left, and at the back, that is, to the south, north, and west. But the eastern part did not have windows, because it let in bright light from within, and all the interior of the temple was filled with the light of the doors, so that one could see inside through each window and hole in the barriers. And not only were the exterior surfaces covered in wood, but there was such an abundance of wood all around, that the floors and everything from the floor to the windows were connected with wood. The windows next to the Seventy were opened in three ways: so that when they were opened, a triple intelligence in the Temple of God would be revealed, according to what is said elsewhere: But you, describe them in three ways (Prov. 22:20). And through them, both the interior and the exterior are seen: so that we may know the invisible things that are within, and the visible things that are outside: so that one thing may show the mind, another the flesh, another the spiritual intelligence, and another the simple history, and through all the surrounding walls, both inside and outside, their measures were observed. For nothing is done without reason and measure in the temple of God, and especially in the holy of holies, which was made by God. The Cherubim were also carved, undoubtedly from wood, reaching from the floor to the windows, and the carvings were so well done that they appeared to be attached rather than sculpted. The Cherubim are interpreted as a multitude of knowledge. Therefore, inside the inner parts of the temple, after the multitude of knowledge, palm trees were carved, in which the sign of victory is, as the Apostle says: 'But I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus' (Philippians 3:14). What palm trees were between the Cherub and the Cherub, so that one Cherub would be surrounded on both sides by two palm trees. This Cherub did not, as we read in the beginning of this prophet, have four faces, namely, of a man, lion, calf, and eagle, but only two, that is, of a man and lion, of which the first pertains to reason, the following to fury, which is more significantly called θυμὸς in Greek. By fury, however, we mean not that which is close to disturbance and vice, but that which strengthens the softness of the mind and makes the spirit of the combatant stronger." } For in the beginning we are subject to concupiscence, which is related to the calf, because of earthly works; and there are other things that are carnal, others that are spiritual, of which the last is attributed to the eagle. But when we enter the holy of holies, and possess the inner chambers of the temple, we have no need for anything else but reason and fortitude, of which one is related to perception and prudence, the other to the perseverance of the soul. Therefore, every wall around the temple, from the floor to the ceiling, had cherubim and palms intricately carved: after which the sanctuary and temple were opened at the four corners opposite the face of the saints. For we first have a multitude of knowledge, through which we achieve victory over the enemy, and then a sanctuary and temple are opened to us, which has four corners, and a very strong position, and which is inclined in no direction. For it has the nature of a square measurement, to stand firm on its base, and in a mystical number, which is clear to a wise reader, it possesses the four elements from which everything is composed, solid and enduring. And they looked at everything in front of the face of the sanctuary: in front of which the sanctuary, or in which the sanctuary was, the appearance of a wooden altar three cubits high, two cubits long, two cubits wide, which, when joined together, make seven cubits. This altar had horns; and both its bases and walls, that is, its sides, were made of wood, in which the mysteries of the Holy Scriptures, human speech cannot explain: how the altar, in which the fire had to be kindled, namely the table of incense, should suffer nothing from the fire, but, so to speak, become purer through the fire. For just as the works of the saints, about which the Apostle writes: The fire will test the quality of each one's work (1 Corinthians 3:13), do not perish, but are made clearer through the fire, so also the wood of the altar, which is from the trees of paradise, is not consumed by nearby fire, but is made purer. And it is not surprising to believe this about the sanctuary, and the inner parts of the temple and the altar of incense, since even linen, which is a type of flax or has a resemblance to flax, the more it is burned, the cleaner it is found. Forgive, reader, the difficulty, and grant pardon to the poverty of understanding. For through oblique windows made in the manner of a net, and that are always closed, we can barely introduce the eye of our inner heart into the house, so that everything we perceive, we see in shadow and in image, and with the Apostle we cry out: O the depth of the riches of wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways are past finding out (Rom. XI, 13)! And: Who has known the mind of God (Isaiah XL, 13), except for he who is the angel of great counsel, and can reveal his mysteries to those worthy? Moreover, in Rome, they call the raised portions on the walls of dining rooms solaria, or Meniana from the one who first invented them, which some of the Greeks call ἐξώστρας.

<h2 id='tocuniq319'>(Vers. 23 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 23 onwards) And he spoke to me: This is the table before the Lord, and there were two doors in the temple and in the sanctuary, and in the two doors on each side there were two smaller doors that folded into each other. For there were two doors on each side of the larger doors, and in these temple doors there were carvings of Cherubim and palm trees, just as there were also carvings on the walls. Therefore, the wood on the front of the vestibule was thicker: on it, there were oblique windows, and palm tree designs on the shoulders of the vestibule, on both sides of the width and length of the walls of the house. In this place, the Septuagint edition disagrees greatly with the Hebrew truth. Hence, I will only point out that they have translated 'crassioribus lignis' as 'σπουδαῖα', which means necessary or worthy of care, and 'obliquis fenestris' as 'absconditas'. Also, at the end of the testimony, they have measured the 'laquearia superliminaris' or vestibule, and the 'latera domus compacta' or joined sides, which they called 'ἐζυγωμένα', and for which we can translate as of equal weight. Therefore, that man who had led the prophet into the hidden part of the temple, and had shown him among other things a wooden altar, which had both angles and horns according to the LXX, and had wooden walls, said to him: This altar that you behold is the table before the Lord, which burns in the likeness of a ruby and is not consumed; concerning which the holy one speaks to God: You have prepared a table before me, against those who afflict me (Ps. XXII, 5). There were also two doors in the temple and in the sanctuary itself, through which the sacraments of both instruments are shown, and in the two doors on each side there were two small doors that folded inward upon themselves: so that in the history you may have a spiritual understanding, and in the tropology the truth of the history, of which each one requires the other, and if one is lacking, knowledge is imperfect. What follows, that there were two doors on each side of the doors, is clear according to the letter. For in the larger dining rooms, it is customary for two to stick together and join each other so that the main entrance is not closed or opened with two large doors, but with four smaller ones. In these doorways of the temple, or holy of holies, there were carved cherubim, about which we have already spoken, and sculptures of palm trees, so that after a multitude of knowledge, victory would be offered to those entering. These sculptures of palm trees were also present on all the walls of the temple. And the reasons why the Cherubim were carved on the very doors, and the likenesses of palm trees were carved out. And also why the woods in the vestibule of the outer gate were thicker, so that they might have strength and be able to receive carvings. And beautifully, according to spiritual understanding, the doors are stronger and carved, so that they may have strength and beauty, so that no one can break into the holy of holies like Uzziah and claim priesthood for himself (2 Chronicles 26). Moreover, the windows which were there were oblique or hidden, so that even the light which was offered from within did not have perfect knowledge, nor clear light, and was hidden in large part. Now, we see in an enigma (1 Cor. XIII, 12); and we do not yet know as we ought to know: but when that which is perfect is come, then that which was in part shall be destroyed. And there was a likeness of palms on either side. Gracefully within the interior of the Temple, and in the Holy of Holies, the right and left were not placed: so that nothing left-handed would seem to be said about those things which are great and mysterious; but on either side, according to what is written in the Gospel: 'If someone strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also' (Matthew 5:39). Could he not have said 'left cheek' as well? But when the right cheek is struck, the other right cheek is offered: because in a holy man, both right sides are perfect. And in the shoulders of the vestibule on both sides of the house, and the width of the walls: for which seventy were transferred, in the ceilings of Aela, that is, the propylaea or entrance hall, and the sides of the house, of equal weight or measurement: through which it is secretly shown that the posts above the threshold or vestibule (for this is what the shoulders seem to signify), and the sides of the house, and the width of the walls, are all full of reason and measurement, and nothing is found in the temple of the Lord that is not established without measurement and wisdom.

Book Thirteen.

505-506 Thirteenth Book of Explanations on the Book of Ezekiel, the second is an exposition of the temple, which I also desire, with the help of our Savior, to dictate to the end, calling it the fourteenth. In the fourteenth psalm, David sings this same number: Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle, or who shall rest in thy holy mountain? (Psalm 14:1). We must understand this as difficult and even impossible. Hence, in another place, he earnestly prays as if a man of desires and says: One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, that I may see the delight of the Lord, and may visit his holy temple (Psalm 26:4-5). And again: How lovely are your tabernacles, O Lord of hosts: my soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord. I go before the curses of my rivals, those who consider not what they themselves can do, but what I cannot do; and though they judge our actions, they do not offer their own actions to be judged. They never fight in the battle, but judge those who do with idle and even arrogant minds. It is easy to dictate to the people, to criticize each blow, to laugh at the blood of others, and to speak like an inexperienced trainer about where the wound should be inflicted. In my explanation of the temple of Ezekiel, and the other things that pertain to the end of that volume, I confess that I write nothing worthy of the magnitude of the subject, and in a few [words], if I should receive any thanks, to give them to the Savior. For it is written: Unless you believe, you shall not understand (Isaiah 6). And in another place: If you have faith like a mustard seed, and you say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' it shall be done (Matthew 17:19). And how does the Apostle commemorate the mustard seed as not a small portion of faith, but as the whole faith, saying: And if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains (I Cor. XIII, 2)? Therefore, this mustard seed, even if it is small, grows into a great tree, and the birds of the sky dwell in its branches (Luke XIII). Therefore, to you, daughter Eustochium, who gladly receive whatever may be ours, I want to testify, and I briefly remind you of that of the rhetorician Victorinus, so that you may know that obscurity in books arises from three things: either from the magnitude of the subject matter, or from the incompetence of the teacher, or from the hardness of the listener. Of these three, I readily confess the first and the second in this work; the third, your keen intellect and desire for the Scriptures easily reject: you, who possess God not as a mere occasional guest, but as a constant resident, by virtue of your virginity and continence. Therefore, let us proceed to the thirteenth chapter of the book of Ezekiel, whose beginning is as follows:

<h2 id='tocuniq321'>(Cap. XLII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 42 — Verses 1 and following) 'And he brought me to the outer courtyard by way of the north, and he led me into the treasury which was opposite the separate building, and facing the temple towards the north. The width of the entrance of the north gate was one hundred cubits, and the length fifty cubits, opposite the twenty cubits of the inner courtyard, and opposite the stone pavement of the outer courtyard, where there was a portico joining the triple portico.' And before the treasuries was a walkway ten cubits wide, looking towards the interior of the road with a width of one cubit; and their doors were facing the North, where there were treasuries that were lower in the upper parts, because the porches that protruded from the lower and middle parts of the building supported them. For they were narrow, and they did not have columns like the columns of the courtyards: therefore, they protruded from the lower and middle parts of the building from the ground by fifty cubits. And the outer court had chambers before the courtyard's gates, which were in the way of the outer court: the length of these chambers was fifty cubits. For the length of the chambers of the outer court was fifty cubits, and the length before the face of the temple was one hundred cubits. And there was an entrance below these chambers on the east side for those entering from the outer court: in the width of the court's enclosure, which was opposite the eastern way, facing the separate building. And there were before the building treasuries, and a road before their face, according to the likeness of treasuries, which were on the north side, according to their length, and so was their breadth. And every entrance thereof, and the likeness, and their doors, according to the doors of the treasuries that were toward the south ( Vulgate: the Known), to the entrance at the head of the way, that ( Vulgate: adds way) was before the separate vestibule by the eastern way for those entering. LXX: And he led me into the outer courtyard opposite the north gate, and he brought me in, and behold, there were five alcoves on the side of the building, and a separate building next to the north side. And it was fifty cubits long towards the north, and fifty cubits wide, with the same measurements as the gates of the inner courtyard and the columns of the outer courtyard, arranged in order facing the portico. And there was a walkway ten cubits wide in front of the alcoves, one hundred cubits long, leading to the inner courtyard, with its entrance facing north. And the walkways of the dining rooms were similarly constructed, as the columns of the upper floors stood out from the lower columns, creating a similar space. And there were triple porticoes, which did not have columns like the ones on the outer side, so they stood out from the lower ones, and in the middle of the ground was a space of fifty cubits, and the external light was like that of the atrium of the outer exedras, which faced the exedras of the North, with a length of fifty cubits. The length of the projecting porticos overlooking the outer courtyard was fifty cubits. And these are opposite their faces, all one hundred cubits, and the entrance of these porticos is towards the Eastern entrance, so that one may enter through them into the outer courtyard, according to the light that was at the beginning of the walkway towards the South, opposite the southern face of the rest of the building, and separate. And the porticos and the walkway are opposite their faces, according to the measurements of the porticos and the path towards the North, and their length and width and all their exits and entrances, and the light fixtures, and the entrance of the porticos towards the South, and the entrance from the beginning of the walkway to the space of the pen: and to go towards the East through them. » What the LXX translated to the East is not in Hebrew, and it is clearly superfluous. For how is it brought out to the outer gate to the East when it follows against the gate of the North? That which we have placed above, and in this place: And he brought me into the treasury, which will be opposite the separate building, and opposite the temple facing the North, for which it is held in the LXX: And he brought me: and behold, there are five chambers remaining from the building and next to the separate building to the North: for the separate, which Aquila and Symmachus translated, the second edition of Aquila, and Theodotion put the same word, Gezer [], in all places expressing similarly: and many other things that are placed in the present place between Hebrew and LXX not only in order, but also in number, and in the interpretation of words, they differ, so if we wanted to stick to each one, and seek and explain the reason for their diversity, we would deviate greatly from the purpose. And I wanted to pass over in silence the present testimony of despair and greatness, but I considered it better to say anything than to say nothing at all, taking up that Socratic principle: I know that I don't know. For it is part of knowledge to know that you don't know. Therefore, after contemplating more carefully the things that were inside, the prophet was led by a man, whose cord and reed were in his hand, to the outer courtyard, along the road that leads to the North, which he had already seen from above before he entered the inner parts. But we see things differently when it comes to perfect knowledge, compared to the beginning of learning. And it is necessary that whoever has seen the inner secrets, according to the same form and measures, also sees what is external. However, he was taken into the treasury, or as the Septuagint translated it, the exedra, or as Theodotius, the pastophorion, which is turned into a chamber: which was a separate building. But what the Septuagint added for the treasury, five exedras, is not found in Hebrew. The treasury was a separate building, as we have already mentioned. Gazera. It was separate, receiving those who came from the North, and it was facing the North, that is, it looked towards the parts of the North, but it was not located in the North, so that it would be easier for those who were leaving the cold of the North, from which evils come forth upon the earth (Jeremiah 1). We read in the book of Numbers that the tribes of Dan and Naphtali, and the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, the handmaids of Rachel and Leah, held their camps on the northern side. Now also the face of the entrance to the North was a hundred cubits in length and fifty in width: so that from the ten decades, a square and perfect number, and from the seven weeks, which is the number of remission, and into the beginning of unity, that is, the eighth, the spaces for the priestly duties in the temple of God were shown. And that which is connected to it according to the Hebrew version, opposite the twenty cubits of the inner courtyard, which the Seventy translated, were described as the gates of the inner courtyard, has this meaning: that the number of the outer courtyard, consisting of one hundred and fifty, is the same as the number of the inner courtyard, which is twenty. For if you calculate four times fifty in the number twenty, you will find both Testaments: so that the Law is kept in the Gospel and the Gospel is born from the root of the Law. For the number seventy, they have interpreted the likeness of the interior court, perhaps fearing the number twenty, in which the gifts of Esau are offered in the interior court. It follows: And against the pavement laid with stone of the exterior court, where there was a porch, joined to a triple porch; for which seventy have translated: And as the columns of the exterior court were placed in order, opposite the face of the triple porches. But it signifies that the pavement of the exterior court was laid with living stone: so that the feet of the priests might not be defiled with the dust of summer or the mud of winter. And so, as the Lord was about to ascend to the Father, he washes the feet of the Apostles (John 13), so that with clean and purified steps they may ascend to the kingdoms of heaven. And he commands the Apostles that when they enter any city and are not received, they should shake off the dust from their feet (Matthew 10; and Mark 6), so that they allow no earthly possessions to remain with them. And not only was the pavement covered with stone, but there was also a triple portico attached to the portico. A Portico, protecting priests from rain and heat, and joined to a triple portico, demonstrates the mystery of the Trinity, which, though divided into the names of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, is nevertheless joined in one divinity. There was also, before the treasury or the exedra or the chamber, a walkway ten cubits wide, looking towards the interior, a cubit in length. And what was added by the Septuagint is: By a hundred cubits of length, it is excessive: because in Hebrew it is not found, which the translators took away, looking towards the interior, a cubit in length, which we have translated from the truth of the Hebrew. However, it signifies that before the doors of all the treasuries, whether exedrae or chambers, there was a walkway, having a width of ten cubits, which is a perfect number itself, either because of the Decalogue or because of the sacrament of the Gospel. For if you come from one to two and three to the fourth number, the number becomes ten, the decimal (also called "denary") number of the Gospels: on the width of which the priests walk, progressing before each treasury. In this way, they always look towards the interior of the path that leads to the one cubit, namely the worship of one divinity, as the Son says to the Father: I have revealed your name to men (John 17:6). For she is the way, looking inward, which says in the Gospel: I am the way, and the truth, and the life (John 14:6): because no one comes to the knowledge of the Father, except through the Son. It follows: And their doors to the north, where there were treasure rooms in the lower and middle parts: because the porticos that emerged from the lower and middle parts of the building supported them. For they were lower and did not have columns like the columns of the courts: therefore they rose from the lower and middle parts, fifty cubits from the ground. What is joined: the doors of them, it is understood, of the exedras, or of the treasuries, about which there was talk above. The treasuries were in the higher parts, that is, in the lower dining rooms. To these dining rooms Elijah and Elisha went up (2 Kings 4:10-11; 1 Kings 17:19) and the Lord, when he was to celebrate the Passover with his disciples (Mark 14:14), and Tabitha, who, by the faith of the Apostle and the merit of her virtues, was raised from the dead (Acts 9:36-41). These are the dining rooms of which it is written in the psalm: He waters the mountains from his dining rooms (Psalm 103:13). For unless a mountain has been made, and has risen to higher things, it will not be watered by the rains of the Lord, which are watered in the first, second, and third upper rooms by the diversity of merits. The treasure houses themselves, that is, the treasuries of the Lord's treasures, are in the higher things of a humbler nature (Ephesians III). However much someone may be higher, they are thrown down with humility, along with the Apostle, saying: I am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God (I Corinthians I, 95). However, the treasuries themselves were located in the lower rooms because they supported the porticos that protruded from the lower and middle parts of the building. And the reason why the treasuries were placed in the lower rooms and were lower was because they supported the porticos, which enjoyed the freedom of air and protruded from the lower and middle parts of the building. Thus, the second treasury would be higher than the floor of the first room, and the third treasury would be higher than the second room, and the higher one ascended, the higher treasury they used, which increased in humility, as the Lord says: 'If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be the last of all and the servant of all' (Mark 9:34). For they were not carried by other columns, as we read in the columns of the atriums, but they projected from the lower and middle parts of the earth by fifty cubits, as a symbol of the remission of all debts. These are the deep and hidden things, about which it is commanded: Describe them in threefold manner, with counsel and knowledge, so that you may respond with words of truth to those things which are presented to you (Prov. 22:20-21). Therefore, the lower and outer parts of the columns need support, but the higher and inner parts, namely the columns, do not need the help of others. After this it is said: And there was an outer narthex beside the treasuries, which were in the way of the outer court before the treasuries; the length thereof was fifty cubits: for the length of the treasuries of the outer court was fifty cubits, and the length before the face of the temple, a hundred cubits. Peribolus signifies a wall that was on the outside, and surrounded the treasuries in the way of the outer court, having a length of fifty cubits: of which number's mystery we have frequently spoken. Moreover, the length in front of the face of the temple was not fifty cubits, as before the treasury, but one hundred cubits; as after the remission of all sins, we await perfect rewards in the number one hundred (Leviticus 12). Concerning the perimeter, or wall, which in Hebrew is called Gader, the Septuagint interprets it as light, which comes from outside and illuminates the eyes of our hearts: our natural light, which operates in the senses, is not sufficient to have the perfect brilliance of knowledge unless it enters from outside through the grace of God. The first thing that illuminates the eyes of our hearts and makes the outer atrium, which stretches out with a width of fifty cubits, shine is the atrium itself. Afterwards, when we come before the face of the temple, we will receive the rewards in the perfect number of one hundred. Now, there was an entrance beneath the treasury from the East for those entering from the outer atrium. For it is necessary for us to possess the riches of God, and to find the entrance beneath the treasury of the East from the outer atrium, and to come through the width of the courtyard, which faces the way of the East, to the building that is separated for the holy ones, before which are the treasuries, and in the same way, along the way, are the treasuries that were in the way of the North. For even though we may reach the entrance to the East, the similarity of the ancestors is found in the smaller things, and we cannot reach the light of the East except through the way of the North, that is, by striving from the smaller and lower things to the greater and higher things. In the very entrance, however, the length was the same as the width, that is, the same measurement on all sides: and every entrance and similarity, and the doors themselves had the same measurement and similarity as the treasuries that were on the way facing the South. Indeed, by the East we withstand the cold of the North, and we arrive at the South, where the bridegroom reclines at noon and is surrounded by full light. But at the beginning of this same way, that is, the Eastern, which is open to those entering, there is a door, which unless it is opened by the one who says, 'I am the door' (John 10:9) and who holds the key of David, separated from the vestibule of the holy virtues, and which receives those coming from the North, we cannot arrive (Isaiah 22). It is unnecessary to discuss in detail each word of this passage according to the LXX: for even the things that have been said are not lacking in obscurity, and those things which we are silent about are nearly similar to those that we have mentioned.

<h2 id='tocuniq322'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verse 13, 14.) And he said to me: The treasuries of the north, and the treasuries of the south which are before the separate building, these are the holy treasuries in which the priests who approach the Lord in the holy of holies eat. There they shall put the holy of holies, and the offering for sin and for guilt: for it is a holy place. But when the priests enter, they shall not go out from the holy place into the outer court, and there they shall put on their garments in which they minister, for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and thus they shall go out to the people. That man, who was a leader and prophet, after he had led him into the outer courtyard, and showed him all the things that the previous discourse had narrated, including the treasuries and the halls, where he stayed for a long time, said to him: These are the treasuries, or halls, and chambers to the North and to the South, which are in front of the separate building, and are called the holy treasuries, in which the priests who approach the Lord in the holy of holies eat. From these things we learn that there are many diversities of foods, which priests are allowed or not allowed to eat, and among those which are allowed to be consumed as food, they are not consumed in all places, nor by all, nor at all times. I believe that the treasuries of the North and South contain either the simplicity of history or the mysteries of spiritual understanding, so that through the North we may come to the South. For the letter should not be read in such a way, and the foundations of history should not be laid, that we do not reach the heights; nor should the roof of a most beautiful building be placed in such a way that the foundations are not solid." } But the priests who eat in the cellars, in which many riches are contained, they themselves are the ones who approach the Lord: of whom Scripture testifies (Exod. XXIV), that Moses approached the Lord, and the others could not approach. In the construction of the mystical temple, and in the sacrament of the Church, there are many priests and apostolic men who approach the Lord, and not in any place, but in the holy of holies. And that which is said in the Septuagint: Sons of Sadoc, which is interpreted as just, is not in Hebrew. There, he says, the priests shall place the holy of holies, and the offering, that is, the victim of burnt offering, both for sin and for ignorance: so that they may not only continually offer sacrifice, but may also, by the diversity of times and the quality of sin and ignorance, know how to appease the Lord, because that place itself is holy, and the priestly dignity dwells in it, which is able to intercede for others. But when it is necessary to proceed to those who cannot penetrate the inner recesses of the temple, nor know the secrets of divine knowledge: let the priests go out, he says, to them in the outer court: by no means with the garments with which they were adorned on the inside, namely the bowels of mercy, and the Lord Savior, of whom it is written: Clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. XIII, 14); nor should they use the words about which God speaks: My mystery for myself and mine: so that they do not fall into that which the Savior prohibits, saying: Do not give what is holy to dogs, nor throw your pearls before swine (Matth. VII, 6). But they shall put their garments inside, with which they are clothed when they serve in the innermost parts of the temple; for they are holy, and should not be shown to those who do not have perfect sanctity: and they shall receive other garments, and thus proceed to the people. Thus, they shall speak to the people, as the people can hear. Hence, even the Apostle spoke to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 5), among whom there was heard fornication, and such fornication, which not even among the Gentiles: I gave you milk to drink, not solid food: for you were not yet able to digest it (1 Cor. 3:2). To them he says again: My little children, for whom I am again in the pain of childbirth until Christ is formed in you (Gal. IV, 19). For little ones and infants, solid food is not only not beneficial, but it kills them, as it is suitable for adults of mature age. However, what is added by the Seventy is this: Therefore the priests shall not go forth into the outer court, so that those who offer may always be holy, let us mark with a footnote, because it is not found in the Hebrew.


<h2 id='tocuniq323'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 and following) When he had finished measuring the interior of the house, he led me along the way of the gate that faced east, and he measured it all around. It had the same measurements on all sides (the house had a circular shape). He measured it against the east wind (while standing at the back of the gate facing east) with a measuring rod that was 500 cubits long. He measured the circumference of the house with the measuring rod. And measured against the north wind, he measured five hundred cubits, measuring with a reed in a circuit. And against the south wind, he measured five hundred cubits, measuring with a reed in a circuit. And against the west wind, he measured five hundred cubits, measuring with a reed. He measured the wall on all four sides, with a length of five hundred cubits and a width of five hundred cubits, dividing between the sanctuary and the area of the common people. ((The Vulgate adds this))" } It should be known that after the East and North winds, the South and West winds have a reversed order among the Seventy. For they first placed the West, that is the sea, and then the South, while among the Hebrews the South wind is placed first, and then the West. And what the Scripture now says: 'When he had completed the measurements of the inner house, he led me along the way of the gate which faces toward the East, and showed me all that has been mentioned, both inside and outside, and in the interior of the temple, that is, the holy of holies, which properly pertains to the building of the temple and the inner temple.' And now it follows: He led me along the way of the gate, which overlooked the Eastern way, and he measured it all around, resembling a house. By this it is shown that it is not the house itself, but the likeness of the house that is seen: for now we see through a glass darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. (I Cor. XIII). Therefore, Moses in the tabernacle and Solomon in the building made not the truth of the temple tent, but the likeness and figure: so that through those things which are smaller and earthly, we may understand those things which are in the heavenly and spiritual building." } But the man who led the prophet, not at all to the outer courtyard, but through the gate that faced the Eastern road, first measured against the Eastern wind, that is, towards the East, five hundred paces around; second, towards the North; third, towards the South; fourth, towards the sea, that is, towards the West, in the four principal directions, a wall around, both in length and width, that is to say: a square wall that had two thousand paces. But if the reed was six cubits long, and a παλαιστῇ [a Greek unit of measure] is one-sixth of a cubit, it is clear that the outer wall had a circumference of two thousand reeds, which makes twelve thousand three hundred and thirty-three cubits, plus a third of two thousand. The wise and diligent reader should read the book of Joshua and will find how this measurement is observed in the outskirts. Hence, even the legion of demons chose this number in the suffocation of the pigs (Luke 8), so that the one who was separated from the servants of God by the command of the Lord would be turned in the opposite direction to the destruction of those who lead a life worthy of filth and squalor. But every outer wall, which has a very spacious length and width in the shape of a square, contains the number of the apostles, that is, twelve hundred and eighteen thousand: so that a thousand number is assigned to each apostle, and yet it does not reach the measure of the fullness of Christ and the perfect man, unless the wrestler, who is three hundred and thirty-three cubits long and a cubit and a third, is joined to it: through which the mystery of the holy and venerable Trinity is demonstrated, which surrounds and fortifies all things, and makes the inhabitants of its temple most secure. Where the ark of Noah has a length of three hundred cubits, and a height of thirty cubits, which is completed in one cubit (Gen. 5). But what is added there, fifty cubits in width, signifies the sacrament of remission (as we often say). Hence, the Lord came to baptism at the age of thirty, and this very prophet at the beginning of his book puts his thirtieth year: which, adding three hundred and thirtieth, is completed with the addition of three and a third. But what our translation and the Septuagint have, for the sake of simplicity of interpretation, while paying little attention to the speed of dictation, is that its wall runs all around it, with a length of five hundred cubits and a width of five hundred cubits. The Hebrew text, however, does not include the word 'cubits', but simply 'length of five hundred' and 'width of five hundred', with the understanding that it refers to reeds. As mentioned earlier, in the fourth instance, it was stated that the wall of each section was measured by the person holding the reed, towards the east wind, the north wind, the south wind, and the sea, with five hundred reeds. But the number five hundred, which is close to fifty, which pertains to the remission of all sins, is not only demonstrated by the ancient Scripture (Leviticus 25), but also by the words of the Savior in the Gospel, saying: 'There were two debtors to a certain lender: one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty' (Luke 7:41). And a wall divides between the sanctuary and the common place. From this we understand that all the description above the temple, the ministry was delegated to the Priests, who are the sons of Zadok. However, this wall, which extends over such a large space and surrounds everything, separates the sanctuary from the area of the common people.

<h2 id='tocuniq324'>(Cap. XLIII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 43, verses 1 and following) 'And he brought me to the gate that looked towards the East: and behold, the glory of the God of Israel was entering by the way of the East, and there was a sound like the noise of many waters, and the earth shone with his majesty. And I saw a vision like the one I had seen when he came to destroy the city, and a vision like the one I had seen by the river Chebar. And I fell upon my face.' And the majesty of the Lord entered the temple through the gate that faced east. And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house. And I heard someone speaking to me from the house. And the man standing beside me said to me, 'Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever. And the house of Israel shall no longer defile my holy name, they and their kings, by their whoredom and by the dead bodies of their kings on their high places, by setting their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them. They have defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed, so I have consumed them in my anger.' Now therefore, remove far away her prostitution, and the ruins of her kings from me, and I will dwell in their midst forever. LXX: And he brought me to the gate, which looked toward the east, and he led me out, and behold the glory of the God of Israel was coming by way of the east, and the voice of the camps was like the voice of many moaning, and the earth shone like lightning from glory all around. And the vision that I saw was according to the vision that I saw when I entered to anoint the city. And the vision of the chariot that I saw, according to the vision that I saw above the river Chobar, and I fell on my face. And the glory of the Lord entered the house by way of the gate that faced east. And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house. And I stood there, and behold, a voice came from the house, speaking to me; and a man stood beside me, and said to me: Son of man, have you seen the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where my name will dwell in the midst of the house of Israel forever. And they shall no longer defile my holy name, both they and their leaders, in their promiscuity and in the murder of their leaders among them, when they set my threshold next to their thresholds, and my doorposts beside their doorposts. They made their wall between me and themselves like a connecting wall, and they defiled my holy name with their iniquities that they committed. So I consumed them in my anger and in my wrath. Now let them put away their promiscuity and the murder of their leaders from me, and I will dwell among them forever. First, we must discuss the variation in the translation. This phrase that the Septuagint includes, 'And he led me,' is not found in the Hebrew text. For if he had been brought to the gate facing east, why was it necessary for him to be led out, since he was brought in specifically to see what was happening at the eastern gate? Furthermore, when it says, 'The voice was like the sound of many waters,' it is undoubtedly the voice of God, as John also confirms in his Revelation. The Septuagint translates it as, 'And the voice of the camps was like the sound of many voices.' (Apoc. 14)." } In the third place, it is stated in Hebrew: I saw a vision according to the appearance that I had seen when he came to destroy the city. But he came, clothed in linen as he was in the beginning of this prophet, and he had an inkwell at his waist, along with six others, to destroy the city, not to anoint it, as the Septuagint translated, who said in the fourth place: And the vision of the chariot which I had seen, which is not found in Hebrew. Let us speak separately about each one, as far as the difficulty of explanation allows: lest, while we strive for brevity, the veil remains not only in Moses, but also in Ezekiel the prophet, in us who desire to contemplate the revealed truth of the Lord (Exod. 34; 2 Cor. 3). Therefore, the glory of the God of Israel entered by the Eastern way, by which it had also departed when the city of the Lord was struck by fury. Indeed, it enters, or rather returns to it because it had shown the temple of the Lord built on the mountain. And yet there is much more that is said in the following: The spirit lifted me up and brought me into the outer court, and behold the glory of the Lord filled the house. For here only does the glory of the God of Israel enter; but there it is said that the fullness of the glory of the Lord was in the Temple, of which Isaiah also writes: I saw the Lord sitting on a high and elevated throne, and the house was full of His glory (Is. 6:1); when beholding the revealed face, we are transformed into the image of the Creator. The voice also was of God, as the voice of many waters, of all the 521 peoples of the whole world, as John the Evangelist interprets (Apoc. XIV): or as the voice of armies, and as the voice of many that set up a shout, that the army of God might know the sacraments. Which, understanding, Jacob called the name of that place, camps (Genes. XXXII). Of which it is also written elsewhere: The chariots of God are ten thousandfold, thousands of them that rejoice (Ps. LXVII, 18). But there is another voice called the voice of the camp and the multitude, because of the unanimous praise of God. And the voice of those who sing is doubled to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of Sabaoth, the earth is full of His glory (Isaiah VI, 3). It follows: And the earth was resplendent with His majesty (Psalm XIX). This was properly fulfilled in the coming of Christ; when the sound of the apostles went out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world (Romans XVIII): and it is fulfilled in believers every day, and will be completely fulfilled when this corruptible body shall put on incorruption, and this mortal body shall put on immortality (I Corinthians XV). But what is inferred: And I saw a vision according to the appearance that I had seen, when it came to destroy the city; for which the Seventy translated: when I entered to anoint the city, as it is clear according to the Hebrew; according to the Septuagint it has the greatest obscurity: how Ezekiel entered to anoint the city; to the prophecy and threat of which he fell; unless perhaps we may say that the rebuke of the prophet is the anointing of the city, and the anointing of the oil of priestly and royal gladness, so that those who willingly receive and desire to hear become the anointed ones of the Lord, concerning whom it is written: Do not touch my anointed ones, and do no harm to my prophets (Psalm 105:15). But he can anoint the city according to the anagoge, of which it is written: Glorious things have been said of you, O city of God (Psalm 86:2); he who saw the vision of the chariot and the mysteries of God, which Ezekiel beheld upon the river Chebar, which signifies burden and weight. For what is heavier than the rivers of Babylon, over which David sat and wept when he remembered Zion? Of which it is written: The figure of this world passes away (Psalm 136). And I think that nothing is perpetual in the confusion of this world, but everything passes away and flows (1 Corinthians 7:31). And whoever considers this will fall on their face, understanding how far they are from the majesty of God, and will bend their knees to the Father in the name of Jesus Christ. When I fell, the majesty of the Lord entered the temple through the gate that faced east, and immediately the Spirit lifted me up (for I was unable to rise on my own), and He brought me into the court of death, for I had fallen outside. And behold, the glory of the Lord that I had seen coming from the east, the glory of the God of Israel, filled His house, and I heard a voice speaking to me from the inner house. What she said is not mentioned in Scripture, unless perhaps that of the Apostle: And I heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter (2 Cor. XII, 4). But the man, he says, who stood next to the prophet, said to him: we clearly understand the Lord. For who else can it be applicable to what follows: Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever, except those who dwell in the Church in the midst of the children of Israel who see God, and dwell forever, not according to the temple of Solomon for a time? And his place is that of which it is written: And his place was in peace (Ps. 75:2), which surpasses all understanding. And the place of his feet, as the Apostles say: Let us worship in the place where his feet stood (Ps. 32:7). And well said, they stood: for the feet of the Lord stand in the Church, they walk in the synagogue and pass by. But so that we may know that this is said about the Church, it is joined: And they shall no longer defile my holy name, the house of Israel: which properly belongs to those who dwell in holy conversation in the Church. But those who defiled the holy name of God are clearly identified: they and their kings, both the people and the priests, in their own fornications in which they fornicated against God; and in the ruins of their kings, who vainly assume the royal name through their pride. Furthermore, it follows: And in the highest places. For a haughty mind offends God; a humble one calls upon His mercy. Indeed, those who, after pride, or rather through pride, made their threshold beside the threshold of God, and their doorposts beside His doorposts. Let them hear these things, letter by letter, women burdened with sins, who are carried about by every wind of doctrine, always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth; having a mind joined to God, not to the proximity of the churches, and having a dwelling place next to God, to provoke His mercy upon themselves; rather, they are moved by the indignation of the Lord, when an unworthy inhabitant is in consecrated places of God. They have made, she says, their threshold next to my threshold, so that there is no difference between the sacred and the profane, and their doorposts next to my doorposts, so that there is one entrance for laity and priests." } And so the Apostle says: But let a man prove himself, and so let him approach the body and blood of the Lord (I Cor. XI, 28). And to make what he said more serious, he adds the following verse: And there was a wall between me and them, so that the shortest wall would separate the priestly sacrifices and the places of the sacraments of the body and blood of Christ. And they have defiled, he says, my holy name with the abominations they have done. What profit is there in residing near the house, and with a wall between our chamber and the Lord's altar, when in the things which we do in secret, and it is even shameful to mention them, the name of the Lord is contaminated and defiled? I believe this, that the name of the Lord is not polluted, unless he who has seen his name believes in it, and is counted by that name. And just as he who previously believed in Christ pollutes the name of God and makes the members of a prostitute, so does he pollute the name of God who first received the faith in his name. Otherwise, even though they are polluted and contaminated, the Gentiles and Jews cannot pollute and contaminate the name of God, because they pollute those to whom it is said: 'My name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you' (Rom. II, 24). Therefore, for these reasons, I consumed them in my anger because they did the things we have mentioned. And yet, the merciful Lord again commands the prophets to tell them to remove their former fornications from themselves and to abandon the ruins of their kings and princes, and to drive them away not so much from themselves as from God. And he immediately promises rewards for good works, saying, 'And I will dwell in their midst', of which it is said in the Gospel: 'There stands among you one whom you do not know' (John 1:26). And he will dwell not for a short time, as in the Synagogue, but forever, which is proven in the Church of Christ.


<h2 id='tocuniq325'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 10 and following) But as for you, son of man, show the house of Israel the temple, and let them be ashamed of their iniquities and measure the blueprint, and let them be ashamed of all that they have done. Show them the structure of the house and its blueprint, its entrances and exits, and every detail of it, and all its instructions. Show them the entire order and all its laws, and write it in front of their eyes, so that they may observe all its arrangements and its instructions, and follow them. This is the law of the house on the top of the mountain: All its boundaries are around it, it shall be most holy. This is therefore the law of the house. LXX: And you, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, and they will cease from their sins, and its vision and arrangement: and they themselves will endure their torment for all that they have done. And describe the house and its preparation, and its exits and entrances, and its substance and all its instructions, and all its regulations, and all its laws you will show to them, and describe before them: and they will keep all my ordinances and all my commandments, and they will do them, and the description of the house on the top of the mountain, all its borders around it are most holy. This is the law of the house. It is no small task to demonstrate to those who see with their eyes or with their minds and hear with their ears, so that they themselves may seem to have seen with you. Therefore, Josephus writes that those who were sent by Jesus son of Nave to describe the land were geometers and had the art which is now proper to philosophers, the art of Geometry. Therefore, to the house of Israel, those who perceive God with their souls, the house is shown, that is, the temple which Ezekiel saw situated on the mountain, and not only on any mountain, but as it is now called, on the summit of the mountain. Let us by no means think that it is the temple which is narrated as being constructed by Solomon in the books of Kings and Chronicles. For it belongs to another order and measure, and in each [temple] it has great diversity: and so much inferior to the temple which is now shown in Ezekiel, that not only its worshippers and ministers, but even its builder Solomon sinned and offended God, though he later repented, writing in Proverbs: Finally, I repented and looked to choose discipline (Prov. XXIV, 2). But this vision of Ezekiel, and through Ezekiel to the house of Israel, is such: that whoever contemplates it with their mind, shall cease from their iniquities, not some, but all: or as it is said in Hebrew, they shall be confounded and endure their torment for all they have done. Those who cease from committing past sins endure the torment of their iniquities, and greatly benefits the one who has sinned before, to see the house of God and understand the plan of all its construction, so that they may cease to sin and, having a desire for it, say to the Lord: Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house, and the place of your glory's habitation (Psalm 25:8). And again: One thing I have asked of the Lord, this I will seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life (Psalm 27:4), when I begin to live and be with Christ, who is the life of the believers. It follows: Its exits and entrances, the underlying meaning being the house. The exits, however, are those who go out to those who are outside, and the entrances are those who penetrate inward through the discipline of the masters. And every description of it, or rather its substance, as the Septuagint has translated, refers not so much to the nature of the house, as to its furnishings and riches. And you will show them all the precepts, the entire order, and all the laws of the temple, to those who have carried the burden of their iniquities and have ceased or been confused about what they had done before. Therefore, show it to them so that they may keep all the commandments that have been given. For it is of no benefit to know the description of the house and all its arrangements, as it is written: In my Father's house there are many dwelling places (John 14:2). And again: He established the boundaries of the nations according to the number of the children of Israel, even the angels of God (Deut. XXXII), unless you do what is commanded. But the house and law of God's commandments, and the city which is established on the top of the mountain, that is to be believed, of which it is written: A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden (Matth. I, 14). And: The streams of the river shall make glad the city of God (Ps. XLV, 4): which clearly refers to the Church, and is situated on that mountain, which is the highest of all mountains, and from which the prince of Tyre was wounded: and all the boundaries and territories of this house are holy of holies. In that house, that is, in the tabernacle that Moses built, and in the temple that was constructed by Solomon, only the inner parts, where there were 526 Cherubim, and the mercy seat, and the ark of the covenant, and the table of incense, were called holy of holies. But in this house which is shown to Ezekiel, and which is situated on the top of the mountain, all its boundaries are considered holy of holies. And what is being brought in: This is the law of the house, either it pertains to the past, about which it has already been said, or it pertains to those things that will be said later.


<h2 id='tocuniq326'>(Vers. 13 seqq.)</h2>

(V. 13 seqq.) These are the measurements of the altar: the exact cubit, which had a cubit and a handbreadth (or παλαιστὴν) in its length, and a cubit in its width. The definition (Vulg. adds 'of it') was from its lip around one handbreadth (Vulg. one handbreadth). This was also the ditch of the altar. And from the base of the land to the lowest step were two cubits, and the width of one cubit. And from the smaller step to the larger step were four cubits, and the width of one cubit. But the altar itself was four cubits, and from the altar upward there were four horns. The altar was twelve cubits long, twelve cubits wide, square on all sides. The projecting ledge was fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide on all four sides, and the surrounding border was half a cubit wide, with a rim of one cubit all around. But its steps were turned towards the East. 70: And this is the measure of the altar in exact cubits and παλαιστῆς, its height all around and a cubit of width, and a rim around it like the edge of a hand. And this is the height of the altar from the base of the riser to its upper edge, which was under two cubits, and a cubit of width. And from the smaller riser to the larger riser, four cubits of width and a cubit of height, and a space of four cubits for the hearth. And from the hearth to the upper parts of the horns, a cubit of distance. But the ark had twelve cubits in length, and twelve cubits in width, and the propitiatory of fourteen cubits in width by four parts thereof, and its railing by the circuit half a cubit, and the circuit thereof cubit: the steps of the entrance thereof were turned towards the east. And: O the depth of the wisdom and knowledge of God (Rom. XI, 33): 'Whose depth is so profound, and who shall find it?' It is much if we desire to compare the temple of Solomon and all its parts and tabernacles to this temple. Since this is very difficult, for now let us briefly compare the altar shown to Ezekiel, the altar we read about in Exodus. There the altar is described as five cubits in length and five cubits in width, that is, a quadrangle, and three cubits in height. But here, departing from the senses, it tends towards union, in which the perfect cubit, or the truest, is put, to which a handbreadth is added, that is, the παλαιστὴ, making the sixth part of a cubit, as we have said above. But in its bosom, that is, the altar, there was an elbow, which indeed received the things that were consumed by fire, and in its width another elbow: so that the inner parts, that is, the secrets, and the spaces of the altar which are shown in width, would be finished in one elbow. But what follows: And the boundary extends to its edge, for which Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion placed a boundary, the Seventy translated as measure again. The reason for this word, as I have already said, I cannot know; nor can I confidently say in what language it is spoken, unless I remind the reader that when I interpreted the definition above, I transferred it beyond the crown. And this is briefly demonstrated, that around the altar itself, that is, on the edge and in a circular form, there was a lip or a circle spread out, and like the crown of a lily, having a lot of beauty in appearance. This definition or measurement extended either around the palms of one hand, or with a width of a παλαιστῆς. The bottom and depths, and the earth attached to it, are contained in the number two, which is also assigned to unclean animals (Genesis VII). The upper part, reaching to the threshold or propitiatory, which Theodotius himself called Azara in Hebrew, has a width of one cubit, so that the number two transitions to solitude; and the lower part, which is inferior, reaches the bliss of unity. 528. And that which follows: And from the smaller step to the larger step, four cubits in width, and the length of one cubit, for which it is stated in the Septuagint: And from the smaller propitiatory to the larger propitiatory; and Theodotion translated it as: from the lesser propitiatory to the greater propitiatory. In both instances, Azara is to be understood, that the smaller propitiatory is a stone cut from the mountain without hands, and the larger propitiatory is the stone itself which grew into a great mountain and filled the whole earth (Dan. II). Or, in another sense, it is a lesser propitiatory when assuming the form of a servant (Philippians 2), and a greater propitiatory when receiving the glory that it had with the Father before the world began (John 17). For we first understand the more humble aspects of Christ, and thus we reach the height of his divinity; and yet, the propitiatory of both natures, that is, the lesser and the greater, belongs to the sacrament of one altar. Between the two propitiatory parts, smaller and larger, there were four cubits, signifying the four elements of the world, which themselves reach the height of one cubit. And it must be observed that in the measurement of the altar, the first cubit in width is not joined to any other, but is complete in itself; but the second cubit in width, after two cubits, increases to the top, and the third cubit, after the propitiatory part, smaller and larger through the four elements, tends to the mystery of one cubit; and the first, second, and third cubits in the altar of the Lord are by no means the first, second, and third; but one and one, and one is said to be one. But Ariel was also four cubits high, and from Ariel up to the top of the horns there were four cubits: or as it is said in the Septuagint, from Ariel up to the upper part of the horns one cubit. Ariel, as most believe, is interpreted as 'my light is God'. Concerning this, in the prophecy of Isaiah, it is written: 'Woe to you, Ariel, the city that David besieged, or surrounded', as we have explained more fully. But as I understand it, it means 'lion' or 'mighty one of God', which name is properly attributed to the altar, in which either the illumination of God is, or his lion-like nature and strength, as Jacob said to Judah: 'Judah, you are like a lion's cub; you have gone up from the prey, my son. He stooped down; he crouched as a lion and as a lioness; who dares to rouse him?' But it has four cubits, and it has four corners; or the upper parts of the four corners are finished with one cubit, so that the measure of the Gospels and the strength running throughout the whole world may be shown under the illumination of God and the strength of the lion, so that they may reach the divine confession of one cubit. And so that the gradually increasing obscurity of the present place may become clearer, it follows: And Ariel is twelve cubits in length, with twelve cubits in width, a square with equal sides. It is not doubted that the twelve tribes mentioned in the book of Revelation and the number of the Apostles, whose sacrament I remember having mentioned above (Rev. VII), belong to the twelve tribes. However, on the four sides of the world, the twelve cubits together make forty-eight cubits of the priestly cities, so that with these foundations divided throughout the whole world, the strength of the Church may be solidified. Furthermore, the rim, for which the Septuagint translates 'propitiatory' and Theodotion translates 'azara,' Symmachus translates as 'peridromē,' which means 'circuit,' was fourteen cubits in length and fourteen cubits in width, with four corners, and a crown around it half a cubit in circumference. For which again the Septuagint translates as 'gisum' and 'sinus,' or according to Symmachus, its completion and perfection, one cubit around, secretly shows that our Lord, who is truly called the propitiatory not only for our sins but for the whole world, came through fourteen generations from Abraham to David; and again through another fourteen generations to the captivity of Jechoniah, and by the sacrament of the same number descended to earthly things: so that in the third 'tessarakaidēs,' and by the sacrament of the divine gift, he may save the four corners of the world, about which it is written: 'Many will come from the East and West, and from the North and South, and will sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven' (Matt. VIII, 11). And what follows, the crown, or gisus around it, is understood to represent the propitiatory, which had a half cubit, and the curve of the propitiatory, or the completion and perfection, which Symmachus interpreted as 'peridromē,' had one cubit. This signifies that both sinners and the righteous are saved by the propitiation of the Lord, as the Apostle Paul says: 'For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son' (Romans 5:10). And concerning sinners, it is said that they have a measurement of half a cubit around; however, they are saved by the mercy of the Creator, according to what is written in the Psalms: 'You will save them for nothing.' (Psalm 55:8) As for the righteous, they are saved in one solitary and perfect number, and they imitate one divinity, as the same Apostle says: 'God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself.' (2 Corinthians 5:19) And what is placed at the end of this testimony, and its steps turned towards the East, the steps of this propitiatory or the twenty-four books of the Old Testament should be understood: those who had harps in the Apocalypse of John (Chapter 5), and crowns on their heads, or the mystery of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, in which true propitiation is given to us. And to speak more openly, the number of steps is left uncertain, so that no matter how much effort we can climb to higher things, we may think ourselves placed in lower things, and consider that of the Psalmist: They will go from strength to strength (Ps. 83:8).

<h2 id='tocuniq327'>(Vers. 18 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 18 seqq.) And he said to me: Son of man, thus says the Lord God: These are the rituals of the altar, on whatever day it is made, to offer a burnt offering on it and pour out the blood. And you shall give to the priests, the Levites who are of the seed of Zadok, who approach me, says the Lord God: to offer me a bull from the herd for sin. And you shall take some of its blood, put it on the four horns and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim all around; and you shall cleanse it and make atonement. And you shall take the calf that is offered for the sin, and burn it in a separate place of the house outside the sanctuary. And on the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish for the sin, and they shall make atonement for the altar as they made atonement with the calf. LXX: 531 And he said to me: Son of man, thus says the Lord God: These are the precepts of the altar on the day it is made, that burnt offerings may be offered on it, and blood poured out on it. And you shall give to the Levitical priests, who are of the seed of Sadduc, and approach to me, says the Lord God, to minister to me a calf from the cow for sin; and they shall take its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, and on its base around, and they shall cleanse and make atonement for it. And they shall take a goat for sin, and it shall be burned in a separate place outside the holy house. And on the second day they shall take two immaculate goats from the goats for sin, and they shall make atonement for the altar as they made atonement with the calf. After the prophet showed the altar and its cubit, two cubits and again a third cubit, and twelve cubits by twelve others, and four horns of the altar: Ariel also, twelve cubits, by twelve cubits, and a footrest, that is, a mercy seat fourteen cubits, by fourteen cubits: also its crown, and a hem of half a cubit and one cubit all around: and steps to the East, the number of which is uncertain, a man spoke, whose pen and cord were in his hand, and he instructed him how, with the work of the altar completed, the altar should be expiated and consecrated. And first a victim is offered, and it is given to the priests from the tribe of Levi, who are from the seed of Zadok, whom the Seventy call Sadduc, which I am not able to understand. But Zadok is interpreted as just: and according to the Seventy and Theodotion, a calf is offered; according to Symmachus, a bull, which is called Pharus in Hebrew. But the calf that was sacrificed for us, and many passages of Scripture, and the principal Epistle of Barnabas, which is found among the apocryphal writings, mention. And on the second day, a male goat from the goats is offered. Therefore, those who are going to celebrate the Passover take a lamb and a young goat from the flock, and those who could not celebrate the first Passover in the first month, celebrate it in the second month: one offering is for the righteous, and the other is for those who are repenting. But if we prefer the interpretation of the Seventy who said: 'On the second day, they shall take two unblemished young goats as a sin offering,' it is indeed bold what we are about to say, but the simple opinion of others must be put forth, who say that two unblemished young goats were offered on the altar of the Lord after the passion of the Lord, Jacob and Stephen: the former of whom was part of the number of the apostles, and the latter was the leader of the seven chosen for the ministry of the Lord (Acts 22). This is James who saw the transformed Savior on the mountain (cf. Matthew 17), who witnessed the rising of the synagogue leader's daughter with the Lord Peter and John (Matthew 17), who is listed first among the apostles with his brother (Mark 9). Herod killed him (Matthew 9), and like an unblemished lamb, he sacrificed himself on the day after the Savior's passion (Mark 3). The Jews also stoned Stephen, whose wisdom and teachings no one could resist (Acts 14), and he saw the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God, and said (Acts 14:7): 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.' The Jews stoned him with stones. And just as the Apostle mentions the firstfruits of believers in Achaia and Asia (1 Corinthians 16), so too were these the first fruits of the martyrs, whom the confession of Christ later crowned. And it should be noted that the whole calf is offered as a burnt offering, and the thickness of its body is consumed by divine fire. For we knew Christ according to the flesh: but now we no longer know Him according to the flesh (II Cor. V, 16). But James and Stephen, who were offered on the second day, either a goat, which is mentioned in the Hebrew offering, is indeed offered as a victim, but the burnt offering is reserved for the presence of the Lord. And as for the blood that Peter speaks of, 'You were redeemed from your futile way of life inherited from your fathers, not with perishable things like silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ' (I Peter I). And the apostle Paul teaches: 'You were bought with a price' (I Cor. VII, 23); and in another place: 'Making peace through the blood of His cross, whether on earth or in heaven' (Coloss. I, 20), that signifies that by the blood of the Savior, the four corners of the altar are purified, that is, the four wounds of the world: and the crown of the mercy seat, or the bases around, are sprinkled, so that everything may be purified and the propitiation may be firm. Therefore, on the second day, either two young goats, of which we have spoken above, or a male goat is taken; because this animal always hastens to high places and sustains no danger on steep slopes, and there it finds a path where destruction is for other animals. Hence, in the Greek language, the herd of goats and male goats is called 'sublimium conversatio', that is, 'aipolion' as if 'aipopoulion', since 'aipos' means high and 'polein' means conversation. Furthermore, the altar of Christ is cleansed by His blood, so that the prayers of the saints may reach God pure. It should also be noted that, according to the Hebrew text itself, Ezekiel is commanded to assume the role of a priest and offer a young bull as a burnt offering, and sprinkle its blood around the altar, the corners, and the crown, or base. However, the Septuagint interpreters show other priests performing this act, of whom it is said: You shall give the Levite priests who are of the seed of Zadok, who come near to me.


<h2 id='tocuniq328'>(Vers. 23 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 23 onwards) 'And once you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer an unblemished calf from the herd and an unblemished ram from the flock. You shall present them before the Lord, and the priests shall sprinkle salt on them and offer them as a burnt offering to the Lord. For seven days you shall make a sin offering each day, a male goat, and an unblemished calf and ram from the flock. For seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and cleanse it, and they shall consecrate it and fill its hand. After the days are completed, on the eighth day and beyond, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings on the altar, and also the peace offerings, and I will be appeased towards you, says the Lord God. LXX: And when you have completed the atonement, you shall offer an unblemished calf from the herd, and an unblemished ram from the flock, and you shall present them before the Lord, and the priests shall sprinkle salt on them; and they shall offer them as burnt offerings to the Lord. For seven days you shall make a sin offering of a goat daily, and a calf from the herd, and an unblemished ram from the flock they shall make for seven days. And they shall make atonement for the altar, and cleanse it, and fill their hands, and complete the days. And it shall come to pass from the eighth day and beyond, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings on the altar, for your salvation, and I will accept you, says the Lord God. After the altar and its measurements were shown on the top of the mountain; and again, the expiation and consecration of the prophet were shown, through an unblemished calf and a goat, or two young goats, the first of which were brought to the Lord Savior, the two following to the apostles and ministers, so that in the consecration of the spiritual altar, which properly belongs to the Church, the law and the prophets are not thought to be excluded, therefore, after the altar is consecrated, an unblemished calf and a ram are offered before the Lord; and the sons of Zadok, that is, the righteous priests, sprinkle salt on their heads, so that both the Law and the Prophets may be seasoned with the taste of the Gospel. And there is no sacrifice (according to the command of the law and the interpretation of the Apostle, who says (Col. IV, 6): Let your speech be seasoned with salt) that lacks salt. But both offerings are made as a burnt offering to the Lord, like the fatty substance of the letter, which is signified in the Law, and the cloudy prophecy, with the fire of the Lord, that is, the Holy Spirit, of whom Paul says, fervent in spirit (Rom. XII, 11), they are transformed into a spiritual and subtle substance. We want to know more clearly who the calf from the spotless herd is, and the ram with the purest fleece from the sheep, let us understand Moses and Elijah (Num. XII, III Reg. XIX); the former of whom was the gentlest among all men who dwelt on the earth; the latter being similar to Moses in fervor of faith. Hence he dared to say: I am left alone. But as for what is written in Hebrew: You shall offer a calf, in the Septuagint, the priests shall offer, there is no question. And indeed Ezekiel, to whom these things are said, is from the number of the priests, of full and perfect age; and by the grace of the priesthood, he increased in the degree of prophecy. And Moses and Elijah are seen on the mountain with the Lord, that is, the law and the prophets, who foretold to him what he would suffer in Jerusalem. But after the altar is cleansed, for seven days a goat or young goat is offered for sin daily, and a calf from the herd, and an unblemished ram from the flock, so that through these sacrifices for seven days the altar may be perfectly expiated. In seven days, the Sabbath is shown which, according to the Apostle (Hebrews IV), is reserved for the people of God: in which we hope for eternal and true rest, and we do not engage in the servile work of sins. But in the goat, and the calf, and the ram, three general sins are demonstrated, to which all mortal kind is subject. For we sin either in thoughts, or in speech, or in action. Thought is referred to the ram, which is the first of all sins, and from which the other two sins arise. But the kid, or the goat, is skilled in speech and discourse, always discussing lofty matters. However, the work itself is properly attributed to the calf: because he is devoted to the plow and both physical and earthly labor. Therefore, we must offer these pure sacrifices for seven days of true and complete Sabbath, and cleanse the altar, so that our prayer may reach God in a pure form. And the phrase, 'they shall cleanse it and fill his hand,' which is translated from Hebrew by other interpreters, signifies that the gifts for the altar itself, for the sake of which the sacrifice is offered, must also be fulfilled, just as it is offered for the priests and the people and the high priest; lest anything appear to have been left empty in the sight of the Lord. For which reason, the Seventy will place it: and they will purify it, and they will fill their hands, so that the priests may be heard, who, when they are full of good works, for this, their hands will be full, the Sabbath being completed, they may come to the eighth day of the resurrection, and may say with the Apostle: We have risen with Christ (Rom. 6, Col. 3); and beyond the eighth day, they may strive for heavenly things, and may offer burnt offerings for us, or those which are for the peace and salvation of our sins: so that through the fire of the Holy Spirit, everything we think, say, and do may be transformed into a spiritual substance: and may the Lord, pleased with such sacrifices, become merciful to us.


<h2 id='tocuniq329'>(Cap. XLIV.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 44, verses 1 onwards) And he brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces eastward and was shut. And the Lord said to me: This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter by it, for the Lord, the God of Israel, has entered (or will enter) by it; therefore it shall remain shut. Only the prince may sit in it, to eat bread before the Lord. He shall enter by the way of the vestibule (that is, the porch of the gate) and shall go out by the same way. Concerning that which is written in Hebrew: It shall be closed to the prince, the LXX translated it: It shall be closed, for the leader himself shall sit in it. There are many gates that the Scripture of Ezekiel mentions in the description of the temple, both inside and outside. The previous discourse also discusses the form of the altar, its consecration, and the sacrifices. When this was finished, he came to the outer sanctuary gate, which faced east and was closed. Immediately, that man who was the prophet's guide and showed him everything spoke to him: This gate that you see closed will always be closed and will not be opened, and no man shall pass through it. And it renders the reason why it is always closed: because the Lord God of Israel has entered, or will enter through it: and it will be closed according to the Hebrew, for the prince, whom the LXX translated as 'leader'. This prince and leader, that is, the Prince, will sit in it to eat bread before the Lord: and he will enter through the way of the gate's vestibule, and he will go out through it. What gate is this, which is always closed, and only the Lord God of Israel enters through it? Indeed, those of which the Savior speaks in the Gospel: Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, and woe to you, teachers of the law, who take away the key of knowledge. You yourselves do not enter, and you hinder those who are entering (Matthew 23:23). Isaiah also writes about this under the same name of the book: The words of this book are like the words of a sealed book. When you give it to a man who is not learned, saying, Read this, please, he will say, I do not know how to read. And they will give the man who knows letters, saying: Read; and he will say: I cannot read, for it is sealed (Isaiah 29:11). But this book is one that no one can loose and open the seals, neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth, unless it be the one of whom it is said in the Apocalypse of John: Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root and the offspring of David, has conquered so as to open the book and its seals (Revelation 5:5). For before the Savior assumed human flesh and humbled himself, taking the form of a servant (Phil. 2), the Law and the Prophets and all the knowledge of the Scriptures were closed, and paradise was closed. But after he hung on the cross and spoke to the thief, 'Today you will be with me in paradise' (Luke 23:43), immediately the veil of the temple was torn and everything was opened. And with the veil removed, we say: But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory (2 Cor. 3:18)." } But if all things are revealed, for in Christ, according to the word of Paul, all things are revealed (Ibid., XIII), how will the gate be closed and not opened, and the man not pass through it? From these things we learn, although we have come to the highest knowledge, by comparison to divine knowledge, now we know in part and partially understand; but when that which is perfect comes, then that which is in part will be destroyed. Hence, in another place, the Apostle himself speaks of being imperfect and again being perfect. But if it lacks interpretation, it seems to be the opposite. For he says: Not that I have already obtained it, or have already become perfect. Brothers, I do not consider myself to have taken hold of it; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. And let us keep thinking this way, if we are perfect. But the meaning of this place is as follows: In comparison with other people who do not have knowledge of the Scriptures and the mysteries of God, I admit that I am perfect; but as far as the knowledge of the divine majesty is concerned, now I see it in an enigma and through a cloud and darkness, and I say with the prophet: Your knowledge is wonderful for me, it is strengthened, and I will not be able to reach it (Ps. 138:6). Therefore, this gate, which is closed to everyone (for no man should pass through it and perish), will be closed to the prince or the leader, and it will be opened by his coming, who will sit in it to eat bread before the Lord, about whom he himself professes in the Gospel, saying: My food is to do the will of Him who sent me, and to complete His work (John 4:34). He is both a prince and a pontiff according to the order of Melchizedek, and a sacrifice and a priest, who in the presence of the Father eats heavenly bread with us, and drinks wine, of which he speaks in the Gospel: I will not drink from the fruit of this vine until I drink it new in my Father's kingdom (Matt. XXVI, 29): namely, in that kingdom about which he and others also say: The kingdom of God is within you (Luke XVII, 21). And the gate will be closed. For no one can know the passions of the Lord, and his body and blood, as the sacraments of the majesty, and so great is our prince of goodness and clemency, that even though he sits alone at the door which is closed, and eats bread before the Lord, he desires to have many participants at his table and feast, and says: Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone opens to me, I will enter in to him and will sup with him, and he with me. (Apoc. III, 20). But He alone eats bread in the presence of the Lord, because His substance and divine nature are separate from all the substances of creatures. He enters and exits through the same gate of the vestibule: because He is both inside and outside, that is, infused and encompassing all things. He enters through the gate in order to bring with Him those who cannot enter without His teaching and help; and He exits in order to bring in others again; and to speak to those who do not grasp more difficult things. But as for the Eastern gate, it is always closed beyond the boundaries of the world, and it is not open to human sight. The Gospel of John proves this, saying: No one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known (John 1:18). In other words, it will be closed to all except the ruler. The ruler alone will sit within it, to partake of the bread of perfect and complete knowledge. For no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him (Matthew 11:27)." } Beautifully, certain ones understand the closed gate, through which only the Lord God of Israel enters, and the leader to whom the gate is closed, to be the Virgin Mary, who both before and after giving birth remained a virgin. For at the time when the angel was speaking: The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, the holy child who will be born from you will be called the Son of God (Luke 1:35), and when he was born, the virgin remained eternal to confound those who think that after the birth of the Savior she had sons from Joseph, on account of his brothers who are mentioned in the Gospel (Mark 3). I know that in my youth, at Rome, I wrote a small book against Helvidius, a heretic of that time.

<h2 id='tocuniq330'>(Vers. 4 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 4 and following) And he brought me by the way of the north gate into the presence of the house, and I saw, and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord, and I fell on my face. And the Lord said to me, Son of man, set your heart, and see with your eyes, and hear with your ears, all that I am speaking to you concerning all the statutes of the house of the Lord and all its laws, and set your heart to the ways of the temple through all its exits of the sanctuary. The man who is the leader of the prophet, and who knows everything in the temple by showing it, after he had shown the closed gate that should never be opened, and yet it was open to him who entered through the closed doors, leads the prophet to the way of the gate 539 of the North, which itself must undoubtedly signify the temple, being also in view of the house. And when the prophet saw the house of the Lord full of the glory of the Lord, namely the same house that he saw opposite in the North, he immediately fell on his face, unable to bear the majesty of the glory of the Lord. And since he had been cast down in humility, he says to him, not as a man, but as the Lord: Son of man, set your heart, and the rest. In the consummation of the tabernacle and the building of the temple that was constructed by Solomon, the glory of the Lord appeared, which was later destroyed in comparison to the glory of the Gospel, as the Apostle says: For that which was glorified has not been glorified in this part, because of the excellent glory. For if that which is destroyed is through glory, much more that which remains is in glory (2 Corinthians 3:10). And we must be careful not to think that the destruction of the former glory is an abolition; but rather we must understand that after the perfect has come, that which was in part will be destroyed. Just as if you compare the rays of the sun to a lamp, or the light of a lamp to a lantern. Therefore, it is also said about John the Baptist: He was a shining lamp in the house (John 5:35). But when the sun of justice came, the light of the lamp was hidden, as the prophet himself and John the Baptist said: He must increase, but I must decrease (John 3:30). But the prophet fell on his face, lest, desiring to see more than human frailty can behold, he should lose even the light of his eyes. Therefore the Lord familiarly calls him the son of man, and commands him to set his heart, and see with his eyes, and hear with his ears. For first the mind must be opened to understand what is said; secondly, the heart must be understood as the eyes, of which it is said to Abraham: Lift up your eyes and look at the stars of heaven (Gen. 15:5); thirdly, to be heard with these ears, of which the Savior says: He who has ears to hear, let him hear (Luke 8:8); so that he may understand all the ceremonies of the temple and its lawful observances, and finally set his heart in the ways of the temple, because there are different entrances to God. Whether it signifies the paths of the temple, the order of ceremonies, or the exits of the sanctuary. Therefore, it is a prologue and preparation for the prophet, to understand what he will later learn about the order of the temple. And it should be noted that in the plight of this world, which is situated in evil and set in the cold of the North, the celestial order of ceremonies is shown to us.

(V. 6 seqq.) And you shall say to the rebellious house of Israel: Thus says the Lord God: Enough of all your sins, O house of Israel, because you bring in foreign sons (or foreigners) uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary and to defile my house, and you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and you nullify (or transgress) my covenant in all your sins; and you have not kept the precepts of my sanctuary, and you have appointed guards of my observances in my sanctuary for yourselves. When he says, 'Let all your sins and iniquities be enough for you, and let us exhort penance for past sins, so that we do not increase sins with sins, and so that we provide material for future fire,' but let us hear that which Isaiah speaks: 'Woe to those who draw sins like a long rope, and like the yoke of a calf's strap iniquities' (Isaiah 5:18). And the first sin is that they bring in alien sons, or strangers uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, so that they may be in the sanctuary of God, and defile the house of God. For a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump (1 Cor. V, 6); and in some copies it is found in Proverbs: Do not introduce the wicked into the tents of the righteous. We are pressed in this place by the Jews and Ebionites, who accept the circumcision of the flesh: how can we explain this passage to those uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh? by which, clearly, after spiritual understanding, we must also receive circumcision of the flesh. But those of us who read Paul saying: But as for me, I bear witness to every man who is circumcised, that if you become circumcised, Christ will benefit you nothing (Gal. V, 2). And Jeremiah said: Behold, your ears are uncircumcised, and you do not want to listen (Jer. VI, 10). And in Exodus, Moses spoke before the Lord, saying: Behold, the children of Israel did not listen to me; how then will Pharaoh listen to me? But I am of slow speech (Exod. VI, 12), which the seventy translated as: Am I not rational? This is better understood in Hebrew: But I am uncircumcised in lips, let us inquire of them, or rather force them to circumcise their ears and cut off their lips, so that they may appear to fulfill the Scripture. But if they begin to interpret the circumcision of the ears, since we do not tolerate hearing anything shameful and dishonorable, and the circumcision of the lips, since we do not speak anything indecent: let us tell them that they must also observe the same exposition in their hearts and in their flesh. We circumcise the heart with the knife of God, and the foreskin is removed from our hearts, when shameful thoughts never come out of our hearts, nor is it said of us: 'The heart of this people has become fat, and their ears they have made heavy' (Acts 28:27). Therefore, the flesh is likewise circumcised so that we do not perform earthly works, which we are compelled to do out of bodily necessity, such as eating, drinking, sleeping, and wearing clothes. We circumcise these things, not for indulgence, luxury, and laziness, but for the sustenance of nature and the support of this body. Whoever drinks wine in moderation for the sake of the stomach and frequent illnesses, and detests drunkenness, circumcises their own flesh (I Tim. V). He who sleeps as much as nature requires, will hear from Solomon: If you sit down, you will be without fear. If you sleep, you will sleep soundly and you will not fear the coming of terror, nor the attacks of the wicked (Prov. III, 24). And he who flees from fornication and returns to his wife's bed, so as not to be tempted by Satan (I Cor. VII), will hear with the people of Israel: On this day I have taken away the reproach of Egypt from you. He will also use clothing that repels the cold; not those that reveal bodies with thinness. The flesh, weakened by fasting and restrained by continence, avoids the reproach of the Egyptians who delight in abundant flesh, and that can be said which is read in many according to the Septuagint edition: 'Just as my flesh grew weak in a deserted, impassable, and waterless land, so I appeared to you in holiness.' If and when, therefore, we desire to introduce aliens into the temple of God, let us circumcise their ears, and lips, and heart, and all flesh, and eyes, taste and smell, so that we may do all things with the fear and understanding of God. Let the bishops, presbyters, and all the ecclesiastical order hear this, so that they may not bring in uncircumcised sons in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, lest they be defiled in the sanctuary of God and defile his house. For if they do this, what follows will be applicable to them: And you offer my bread, that is, the loaves of the offering, in all the churches and throughout the world, budding from one loaf, and not only loaves, but also the fat which is written: He satisfied them with the fat of wheat (Ps. 80:17), and the blood which was shed in Christ's passion. And it should be read thus, and the order of reading should be restored thus: When you bring in uncircumcised foreign sons into my sanctuary in heart and body, and you defile my house, do you dare to offer bread and fat and blood, mystical sacraments, and not understand that you have violated, and surpassed, my covenant in all your sins and impieties, and have not kept the precepts of my sanctuary, nor have you placed the keepers of my ceremonies in my sanctuary. But there is a threat against those who have not heard the Apostle forewarning: Do not lay hands quickly on anyone, nor share in the sins of others (1 Timothy 5:22). Or certainly it should be understood like this: You have disregarded my covenant in all your crimes, and have not kept the precepts of my sanctuary, and you dare to appoint unworthy and foreign guards to observe my sanctuary for yourselves, so that it is understood, not for me. And there is a sense: They who serve and minister to you in carnal things, and defile my sanctuary for your refreshments.

<h2 id='tocuniq331'>(Vers. 9, seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 9, seqq.) Thus says the Lord God: Every uncircumcised foreigner, both in heart and in flesh, shall not enter my sanctuary; every foreign son, who is among the sons of Israel. But even the Levites who have gone far from me and have wandered after their idols, they shall bear their iniquity, who were in my sanctuary, serving as gatekeepers of the house and ministers of the house; they themselves were sacrificing burnt offerings and sacrifices of the people, and they stood before them to minister for them. Therefore, because they ministered to them in the presence of their idols, and the house of Israel became a stumbling block of iniquity, therefore I have lifted my hand against them, says the Lord God, and they shall bear their iniquity. And they shall not come near me to serve as priests, nor shall they come near any of my sanctuaries, as the Most Holy Place. But they shall bear their disgrace and the sins they have committed. And I will give them keepers of the house for all its services and for everything that is done in it. But the Levite priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel strayed from me, they shall come near me to minister to me; and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and the blood, says the Lord God. They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table to minister to me, and they shall keep my ordinances. LXX: Therefore thus says the Lord: Every foreign-born son, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, shall not enter into my holy places among all the foreign-born sons who are in the midst of the house of Israel, but also the Levites who have strayed far from me when Israel went astray from me after their own thoughts, and they shall bear their iniquity and shall be ministers in my holy places, gatekeepers at the gates of the house, and servants of the house. These people will offer burnt offerings and sacrifices to the people, and these people will stand before the people to serve them. Because they served them before their idols, and the house of Israel became a torment of iniquity. Therefore, I have raised my hand against them, says the Lord God, and they will bear their iniquity. They will not come near to me to serve as priests, nor to offer to all the holy things of the children of Israel, nor to the most holy things of mine. And they will bear their disgrace in the error in which they have gone astray. And they shall set them to keep the watch of the house, for all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein. The priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord GOD. They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge. I have provided evidence based on both editions, so that from the comparison of them we may be able to know what the LXX have understood and what the Hebrew text holds. The Septuagint signifies this, that foreigners who are uncircumcised in heart and flesh, who dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, should not enter the sanctuary of God. But the Levites, that is, the priestly class, who have strayed far from the Lord in the error of the children of Israel and have wandered after their idols, after they have received their iniquity, let them stand in the sanctuary of the Lord, being priests and gatekeepers, ministers of the house, and let them offer holocausts and sacrifices for the people. And let these ones be before their eyes to minister to them what they have ministered to them in the presence of their idols, and let the house of Israel become a torment of iniquity for them. And therefore, the Lord God says that he has lifted up his hand against them, so that they may not approach him and serve as priests, nor offer to him in the Most Holy Place, and let them bear their disgrace in the error in which they have strayed, so that they may be placed in the observance of the house's guards in all its works, and in everything that is done in the house. But if this is so, how can it be possible for the Levites, who have strayed far from God and have gone astray after their idols, to serve in the house and sacrifice burnt offerings and the sacrifices of the people, and for them to stand in their presence to serve them? For what more will the priests, the sons of Zadok, who have kept the ceremonies of the sanctuary of God, do, of whom it is said: They will approach me to serve me, and they will stand in my presence to offer me fat and the rest? But this is the meaning of the Hebrew: Every uncircumcised foreigner in heart and flesh shall not enter my sanctuary, even though he may seem to be with the people of Israel. But the Levites, that is, the priestly order, who have gone far astray from me in the error of the sons of Israel, and have followed idols, shall bear their iniquity because they have been serving in my sanctuary as gatekeepers of the house, and as its ministers. For they themselves offered burnt offerings and the sacrifices of the people, and they stood in their presence to minister to them. Therefore, because they ministered before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have stretched out my hand against them, says the Lord God, and they shall bear their iniquity and shall not approach me to serve as priests, nor shall they come near to any of my sanctuaries, even to the most holy place, but they shall bear their shame and the sins they have committed. For those who were accustomed to offer burnt offerings and sacrifices and all kinds of offerings as part of their priestly duties shall be brought to the lowest rank and shall be gatekeepers in the house, a perpetual disgrace, so that they may be seen by the entire people as they enter and leave, and understand the lowly position to which they have been reduced. But the priests, he said, that is, the Levites, who are the sons of Zadok, that is, the righteous, or the righteous of God, and who during the time of the error of all the Israelites, guarded the ceremonies of my sanctuary, they themselves shall approach me to minister to me, and stand in my sight, and offer me the fat, that is, the fattest sacrifice and blood, namely, the living and pleasing sacrifice to God, and they themselves shall enter my sanctuary, and approach my table, to burn incense to me, and observe all the rites of the sacrifice. But if this is so, that those who in the time of error and persecution followed idols which they had devised from their own heart, and not only asserted with their voice, but also confirmed with the subscription of their hand, that the Son of God is a creature, and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever, how do they assume for themselves the summit of the priesthood and the pontificate, and dare to offer victims to God, once worshippers of idols? But, as the most fervent poet testifies,

Whatever is done by many goes unpunished: The multitude of sinners has made it easier for the impious to obtain forgiveness, so that those who should have been made to repent for their sacrilege are now reclining on the pontifical throne, and regurgitating the nausea of false faith, rather the open shortcuts of hidden perfidy. Let them at least hear and observe the commandments of the almighty God. No uncircumcised foreigner, both in heart and in flesh, shall enter my sanctuary. Although he may be a son, although he may be joined by blood, although he may cling to us through ancient kinship: if he is uncircumcised in heart or in flesh, he shall not be admitted into the sanctuary of God: lest we make ministers of Christ, our ministers, and defile the altars of the Lord with carnal refreshments. Therefore, because we have set them aside: And I will give them as keepers of the house in all its services, and in all that is done in it: namely, the Levites who have strayed far from God in the error of the sons of Israel, and have followed idols to which they offered sacrifices. Taking into account the order of reading and the overall sense, Symmachus interpreted more accurately, saying: For I have appointed them as guardians of the doors of the entire ministry and all that is done in it, so that it does not pertain to those who are to come in the future, but to those who have been.

<h2 id='tocuniq332'>(Vers. 17 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 17 seqq.) When they enter the gates of the inner courtyard, they shall be dressed in linen garments (or robes): and they shall not wear anything made of wool (or they shall not be dressed in garments made of wool) when they serve at the gates (or near the gates) of the inner courtyard and inside. Linen turbans shall be on their heads (or they shall have linen turbans on their heads) and linen undergarments shall be around their waists, and they shall not be bound in sweat (or forcibly). And when they go out of the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them up in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments. Neither shall they shave their heads, nor shall they suffer their hair to grow long, but they shall only poll their heads (or they shall not shave their heads, and shall not cut their hair close: they shall cover their heads). And not every priest shall drink wine when he enters the inner courtyard. First, the words of the story must be revealed. Among other things that the Lord's discourse instructs the priests is also this to be observed, that they should be clothed in linen garments at the very gates of the inner courtyard, that is, in tunics: neither should they use woolen garments either at the gates of the inner courtyard or inside, that is, in the adyta and holy of holies: and the headbands or linen veils should be on their heads, and the linen undergarments around their loins. And what follows according to the Septuagint: 'And they shall not be girded violently,' for which Aquila and Symmachus translated as 'in sweat.' Theodotion, expressing the Hebrew word itself, placed it as 'in Jeze (): Aquila's second edition, Busa ((Al. Buza)),' which means that they should not be girded violently, tightly like prisoners, lest they become unfit for priestly and Levitical duties, such as holding and slaughtering victims, and also unable to drag and run. And because he had once commanded what garments the priests should wear when they were inside the ministries, he now commands that, when they go out to the treasure chambers or unburned places of the saints, they should take off their former clothes and put on others, so that if they have holy garments, they should not sanctify the people outside who are not yet sanctified and have not prepared themselves for the sanctification of the temple, in which the Nazarite of the Lord shall be. Through this we learn that we should not enter the holy of holies in everyday and any common clothes that are defiled for everyday use, but with a clean conscience and clean garments, hold the sacraments of the Lord. And what follows: 'But they shall not shave their heads, nor let their hair grow long, but they shall trim their heads,' is clearly shown that we should not have shaved heads like priests and worshipers of Isis and Serapis, nor again let our hair grow long, which is properly luxurious, and that of barbarians and fighters; but so that the honorable appearance of priests may be shown on their faces. For the LXX said, 'They shall not shave their heads, nor let their hair grow long, but they shall cover their heads,' from which we learn that baldness should not be made with a razor, nor the head so closely shorn that we appear to be like the shaven, but only to the extent that the hair is allowed to grow so that the skin is covered. Or certainly priests should always cover their heads, according to that saying of Virgil (Aeneid. lib. III):

To veil his hair with a purple covering. But this is a violent interpretation. However, not only do priests and Levites not drink wine in their ministry, but they do not even enter the holy of holies, lest their minds be oppressed and their senses become dulled. Hence the Apostle says: It is good, he says, not to drink wine and not to eat meat (Rom. XIV, 21). And in another place: And do not be drunk with wine, in which there is debauchery (Ephes. V, 18). For the people ate and drank, and they rose up to play. And he clearly demonstrates why he granted Timothy permission to drink a little wine: because of his stomach and frequent illnesses (I Tim. 5). The Egyptian priests use linen garments not only on the inside but also on the outside. Furthermore, divine worship has one attire for ministry and another for common use in life. Undergarments are rightly worn to preserve modesty and decorum, so that when ascending the steps of the altar and moving about in ministry, they do not reveal indecency. Superstition of the pagans has a rocky head. But as far as my knowledge is concerned, I do not think anyone abstains from wine among the pagans. What the whole will indicate according to reason, the following words will show. To be holy and spiritual garments, the Apostle teaches, saying: Put on the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. XIII, 14). And in another place: Put on compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience (Coloss. III, 12). And again: Having stripped off the old man with his works, and having put on the new one who is renewed in knowledge, according to the image of the Creator (1 Corinthians 15:54); which I also think signifies this: For it is necessary for this corruptible to put on incorruption, and this mortal to put on immortality. But when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then the saying that is written will come to pass, and the rest. Concerning the priestly garments in Exodus, it is written more fully (Exodus 28); and we once published a book (Epistle 64, to Fabiola), for the interpretation of which a diligent reader should be sent. For we cannot grasp a broad subject in a short discourse. We make these garments with our own labor, which are woven upon, such as the tunic that the Lord had, which could not be torn (John 18); with which we are clothed when we know the secret and hidden mysteries of the Lord, and we have a spirit that searches even the deep and profound things of God, which are not to be shown to the common people, nor to be spoken to the multitude, who are not sanctified and prepared for the holiness of the Lord. Lest if they hear greater things, they may not be able to bear the majesty of knowledge and be overwhelmed as if with solid food, when they are still nourished with the milk of infancy. However, on the contrary, Scripture teaches that evil clothing is the worst, as it is sung in the Psalms about the traitor Judah: 'He was clothed with curses as with a garment' (Psalm 108:29). And a little later: 'Let it be to him as a garment with which he is girded, and as a belt with which he is always girded' (Psalm 109:19). Therefore, even the Lord, who suffered for us and bore our sins, is said to have dirty garments in Zechariah, about which it is written: 'And Jesus had dirty clothes' (Zechariah 3:4), which he later takes off, as Scripture says: 'Take away from him the filthy garments, and clothe him with clean clothes,' etc. But what follows: Vittae, or ribbons, will be on their heads, I think it signifies a crown of grace, of which it is written: For thy crown shall receive the grace. Neither will it make a question for us concerning the covered and uncovered head, which the Apostle speaks of: A woman ought to have a covering over her head, because of the angels. For if a woman is not covered, let her be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. For a man ought not to cover his head, being the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man (2 Cor. XI, 10). For if it is the men's responsibility not to cover their heads, it seems contradictory that now priests are required to cover their heads. But if we read more carefully, the present issue is resolved by the previous statements. For it is said above: When they minister in the gates of the inner court, and inwardly. For if we enter into holy places and stand in the presence of the Lord, we ought to cover our heads: For no living creature shall be justified in the sight of the Lord (Ps. CXLII, 2)." } And: From infancy, the heart of man is inclined towards evil. Finally, we also use our female members inwardly, so that no impurity of conscience or shameful act of marriage may appear in the sight of God. The Savior wants the apostles to gird themselves with these female members, saying: Let your loins be girded, and your lamps burning in your hands (Luke 12:35). And the Apostle speaks to the believers, saying: Therefore, gird up your loins with truth (Ephesians 6:14). And the imitators of Christ hear that which is written of him: He will be girded with righteousness and surrounded with truth (Isaiah XI, 5). And by this same belt, the one who is holy and has ascended to the summit of virtues is not forcefully constrained: so that he may not seem unwilling to observe the good of self-control and to eat bread in the sweat of his face, but rather to do the commandment of the Lord willingly. Furthermore, when he goes outside and mingles with the people, he takes off his priestly vestments in the treasury, where the Lord's riches are kept; and the priests use other clothing and a different teaching for the common people, so that the people may not be sanctified by their robes. It is burdensome for a multitude to take on a task beyond their capacity, as Solomon says: 'The net is for men, to quickly sanctify what is theirs; for when he makes a vow, repentance quickly takes it away' (Prov. XX, 25, sec. LXX). Moreover, the Nazarenes offer themselves willingly, and whoever makes a vow and does not fulfill it is guilty of breaking the vow. Therefore, concerning widows it is said: 'When they have grown wanton, they desire to marry in Christ, having condemnation because they have set aside their first faith' (I Tim. V, 11, 12). It is better not to promise, than to promise and not do. Anna offered Samuel, who remained in eternal sanctity (I Reg. I). And Manoah offered Samson his son, but the lust of Delilah defiled the sanctification of his hair (Judg. XIII). Finally, the Lord left him and was condemned to blindness, except that later, as his hair grew, he regained his former strength and killed many more foreigners dead than alive, as a foreshadowing of Christ. But the Lord wants his priests to have perpetual locks of sanctity, and to cover their heads not with any external covering, but with their natural hair, not for the sake of adornment and luxury, but for the sake of decency. Therefore, even the hair of the apostles' heads is counted, as the Savior says: But the very hairs of your head are all numbered (Mat. X, 30). Of that head, of which it is written in Ecclesiastes: The wise man's eyes are in his head (Eccl. II, 14). But the head of man is Christ, whom the sinner tramples upon and despises, and, so to speak, shaves with a razor, and takes away his beauty. This was also done by the sons of Ammon to those whom David had sent as messengers (2 Kings 10). But if the transgression of the law dishonors God, consequently, he honors Him who keeps the precepts of the law, so that what is written may be fulfilled: That all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father (John 5:23). Furthermore, what follows is clear: Every priest, when about to enter the inner atrium, should not drink wine. It is evident that the state of the mind is overturned in drunkenness and debauchery, and we do not fully understand when the mind is occupied with the satisfaction of wine. But drunkenness is shown not only in the drinking of wine, but also in all things by which the mind is intoxicated and fluctuates in contracts and worldly affairs, in losses and gains, love and hatred, and it cannot maintain its state. And because we are surrounded by frail flesh and are forced to do some things that pertain to the body, such as providing for our food, clothing, and other necessities, it is at least required of us that when we return to ourselves and understand why we were born, and when we enter the innermost parts of the temple, we depart from the vices of the world and do not even commit the smallest sins. Through this, it is shown that we both commit small sins out of necessity for the flesh and that there is also a time when, entering the inner courtyard, we must be free from all worldly and foreign drunkenness.


<h2 id='tocuniq333'>(Vers. 22 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 22 and following) They shall not take as wives widows and those who have been divorced (or expelled), but virgins (The Vulgate reads 'virgins') from the seed of the house of Israel. But they shall take the widow who has been widowed by a priest: and they shall teach my people what is holy and what is impure, and they shall show them the difference between clean and unclean. And when there is a dispute (as added in the Septuagint, of blood), they shall stand in my judgments and shall judge my laws, and they shall keep my ordinances in all my appointed feasts. This place contains the instructions of the priests, who, after many things which we have already explained above, are commanded not to take widows, divorced women, or women who have been rejected as wives. The widow and the divorced woman are the synagogue, that is, the congregation of the Jews, which did not receive the Lord. Therefore, it is rightly called the rejected woman or the widow synagogue. But the crowd of heretics, who went out from us because they were not of us, is called the rejected woman. But he says, 'I want to present all of you as a holy virgin to Christ,' concerning the virgin from the seed of the house of Israel, who was nurtured in the house of God, in the law and the prophets, about whom the Apostle also speaks (2 Cor. XI, 2). This is the virgin of whom the divine word speaks elsewhere: Love her, and she will keep you; embrace her, and she will exalt you; honor her, so that she may embrace you (Prov. IV, 8). But who is the virgin that should be loved and that keeps her lover, will be known by whoever reads it: I loved her and sought her from my youth, and I sought to take her as my spouse, and I became a lover of her beauty (Wisdom VIII, 2). And again: And the Lord loved her above all things. Not only should priests marry a virgin, but also a widow who was previously the wife of another priest; namely the knowledge that another worshipper of God discovered. For we should not only be satisfied with new doctrine, but also cultivate the old and join it to our company, if she has been educated in sacred worship. It is also the duty of a priest to teach the people what is holy and profane, clean and unclean; so that we first refer to the teachings, and then to the works that are done through the flesh. For who understands sins? And when there is a controversy about every matter, whether as the Seventy translated it, of blood, that is, what pertains to mortal crime, the priests shall stand in my judgments, so that they do not judge according to honor, nor show partiality to the poor or the rich in judgment: but rather, they shall stand in the judgments of God, and remember that Psalm: God stands in the assembly of the gods, and in the midst of gods he judges, calling gods those who have the power to judge over men: for with what judgment they judge, they shall be judged (Mat. VII). The laws, he says, and my precepts are to be observed by all in my solemnities, so that they may know how Christ has been sacrificed as our Passover; how we ought to fulfill the seven weeks of joy and gladness, and to humble our souls in fasting; and to understand the sound of the trumpets and the spiritual tabernacles, in which we say: I am a stranger and a pilgrim like all my fathers (Ps. XXXVIII, 13). These are the true solemnities of God, which someone interpreting the Pentateuch will explain consecutively. The first duty of a priest is not only to teach what he knows, but also to keep all the feasts of God, so that he can instruct others on what they should observe, having observed them himself. The duty of priests is to have knowledge of the law, and we learn in Malachi, who says: The lips of the priest shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at his mouth: because he is the angel of the Lord of hosts (Mal. II, 7).

<h2 id='tocuniq334'>(Vers. 25 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 25 seqq.) And they shall sanctify my Sabbaths, and they shall not enter the dead person, lest they be defiled (for which the Seventy translated, and they shall not enter upon the soul of the man, lest they be defiled): except for the father, he said, and the mother, the son and the daughter, the brother and the sister who does not have a husband, they shall be defiled. And after he has been cleansed, seven days shall be numbered for him, and on the day of his entry into the sanctuary and into the inner court, so that he may minister to me in the sanctuary, he shall offer a sacrifice for his sin to the Lord God (or he shall offer appeasement). But they will not have an inheritance; I am their inheritance, and you shall not give them any possessions in Israel; I am their possession. Furthermore, it is commanded to the priests: in which it must be observed, that it is not said absolutely: and they shall sanctify the Sabbaths; or according to Isaiah: My soul hates your New Moons and Sabbaths (Isaiah 1:13): but with a distinction, my Sabbaths. Therefore, it is also written in the Gospel: The priests in the temple violate the Sabbath, and they are without guilt (Matthew 12:5): not the Sabbath of God, but the Sabbath of the law, the Sabbath of the Jews, which they rightly violate who are the chosen race, royal and priestly. Furthermore, let us understand the Sabbath that has been sanctified, as the Apostle also teaches, to be left for the people of God, of whom it is said: 'If they shall enter into my rest' (Ps. 94:11), which is called Sabbath in Hebrew. But the Sabbath of God sanctifies, who does not bear the burden of sin on the Sabbath, nor says: 'As heavy burdens, they have pressed upon me' (Ps. 37:5). He who is such does not gather wood on the Sabbath; nor does he build upon the foundation of Jesus Christ wood, hay, straw (1 Cor. 3); nor does he kindle a fire to consume useless material, and remains in one place on the Sabbath day; nor does he go outside, but remains like a column placed in the temple of God, upon which John writes in the Apocalypse: 'He who conquers, I will make him a column in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more' (Rev. 3:12). And what follows: They shall not enter a house where there is a dead man, lest they be defiled: it belongs properly to the priestly office not to touch the dead, so that he who intercedes for the sins of others may himself approach the altar in purity. Concerning these dead ones, the Savior speaks in the Gospel: Let the dead bury their own dead (Matt. VIII, 22). They become defiled in their dead father when they abandon their Creator, and in their dead mother when they depart from the Church; and in their son and daughter, this pertains to different thoughts and different actions, which is more significantly expressed in Greek as τὰ νοητὰ καὶ αἰσθητά. Moreover, if a brother and sister, who are reborn in the same spirit, believe that one of them is dead, they defile themselves by such a belief; but this only applies if the sister remains a virgin and has not been stained by the touch of any man. From this we understand the privilege of virginity, which is taken away by the touch of any man, whether rightly or wrongly spoken, we leave it to the judgment of the reader. This is also confirmed by the natural affection in this matter, as written in the order of charity: Love me in order (Song of Songs 2:4), after God the creator of all things, the father and mother of the flesh should be loved; son and daughter; brother and sister; but only if they do not venture outside the home or come under the power of another. But after the priest has been purified according to the order of purification that is written in the Mosaic law, seven days shall be counted for him, either as a perfect number of repentance, or after the consummation of the world, when we pass into the true octad, so that he may enter the Holy of Holies (for this is the inner court) and be able to minister in the sanctuary and always offer a victim for the sin of conscience: and there should be no time when he does not remember that he was defiled by his father and mother, son and daughter, brother and sister. For we are indeed compelled to do many things in the constraints of this world, either by the condition of the flesh or by the fragility of nature. But whoever has become such that he may minister in the sanctuary, and enter the inner court, and always offer sacrifice to God, so that he may be a true priest, indeed an imitator of Him of whom it is written: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek (Ps. 109:4), this one shall have no inheritance except God who is his inheritance; nor shall he receive possession among the people of Israel, that is, among the common folk; but [he shall have] a priestly [inheritance], so that the Lord may say of him: I am the inheritance and I am their possession." } When they find him, they will speak and say: I will hold him, and will not let him go; and they will sing with the prophet: The Lord is my portion (Ps. 2:26).

<h2 id='tocuniq335'>(Vers. 29, 30.)</h2>

(Verse 29, 30.) They themselves shall eat the offering for sin and the offering for guilt (or for ignorance), and every vow (or separation) in Israel shall be theirs. And the firstfruits of all the firstborn and all the offerings of everything they offer shall belong to the priests, and you shall give the priests the firstfruits of your food, that he may put a blessing on your house (or that he may bless your homes). For the victim and sacrifice, which is called Manaa in Hebrew, Aquila and Symmachus interpreted it as a gift. Again, for the vow which the Seventy translated as ἀφόρισμα, which means separation, Aquila and Symmachus and Theodotius interpreted it as a dedication, which is called Herem in Hebrew. And it should be considered that all the things which the Lord now speaks through the prophet, He had already spoken through Moses. And it should be asked why He repeats the same things that were said: so that the things which are in the minds of men, either erased by negligence in reading or despising and forgetting in hearing, may be renewed by the living voice, which is not written with pen and ink, but with the Spirit and Word of God. And so the Savior left no written work of his own, which in many cases the apocryphal writings concoct delusions about: but he speaks to the Father and his Spirit daily in the hearts of believers. And this will be the response against those who slander the prophets, why they repeat what is contained in the Pentateuch in their own writings. Therefore, let the priests eat the victim for sin and transgression, or ignorance, about whom it is written: They shall eat the sins of my people (Hosea IV, 8). There is not so much joy in offering gifts as there is fear of condemnation if we use them unworthily. The first fruits, according to the letter, are those of animals and things that are born first, and those that the earth first produces. The first fruits of our food are also offered to the priests, so that we may not taste any new fruits unless the priest has tasted them first. We do this so that the priest may return the blessing and our offering to his house, or that the Lord may bless our homes according to his own invocation. The dignity of priests is great, but their downfall is also great if they sin. Let us rejoice in their ascent, but let us fear their fall. The joy of having reached great heights is not as great as the sorrow of falling from them. For we will not only give an account for our own sins, but also for the sins of all those whose gifts we misuse, and we are not at all concerned about their salvation.

<h2 id='tocuniq336'>(Vers. 31.)</h2>

(Verse 31.) Priests shall not eat any dead or torn thing from birds or animals. And according to the letter, it is fitting for every chosen type, both royal and priestly, which specifically pertains to Christians, who are anointed with spiritual oil, as it is written: God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your companions (Ps. 45:8). These precepts apply, so that the priests do not eat any dead thing, whether from birds or animals, whose blood has not been shed, as it is stated in the Acts of the Apostles that it was strangled. And these things, which must be observed, are warned about in the letter of the Apostles from Jerusalem (Acts 15). And they condemn the priests who do not abstain from eating thrushes, blackbirds, dormice, and other things of this kind out of gluttonous desire." } We can say, according to the anagoge, that the morticinum represents the death of the soul, and it imitates Nabal of Carmel, who is interpreted as foolish. When he heard about David's anger, he trembled with fear, and his heart died within him (1 Samuel 25). But when seized by beasts, so as not to be torn apart by their bites, the prophet sighs, saying: 'Do not deliver the soul of those who confess to you to the beasts' (Psalm 73:19). He is to be called the one devoured by the bites of the lion and the leopard, who does not change its spots, and the she-bear that rages when her cubs are taken, and the wolves of Arabia (the rage of the rabies), and the other beasts that we understand to represent the variation of demons. But we say that birds are those that raise their beaks to the sky, and those animals that bend down towards the earth, only serve their stomachs, and they serve those things that are beneath their stomachs.

<h2 id='tocuniq337'>(Cap. XLV.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 45, verses 1 and following) And when you begin to divide the land as an inheritance, set apart the first fruits, sanctified for the Lord, from the land of twenty-five thousand in length and ten thousand in width. It shall be sanctified in all its borders all around. It shall be sanctified on all sides, five hundred by five hundred, divided into four parts all around, with fifty cubits of outskirts. And you shall measure this according to the standard: the length shall be twenty-five thousand, and the width shall be ten thousand. And in it shall be the sanctuary, the most holy place. It shall be made holy from the ground for the priests who minister in the sanctuary, who draw near to minister to the Lord; and it shall be for them a place for houses and a sanctuary of holiness. The length shall be twenty-five thousand cubits, and the width ten thousand cubits. As for the Levites who minister in the temple, they shall have twenty chambers (for the Septuagint translates it as 'they shall possess the city to live in'). And you shall give a possession of the city five thousand in breadth, and five and twenty thousand in length, over against the oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house of Israel. And a portion shall be for the prince on both sides of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border. And the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people, but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes. Regarding the rituals of the priests, their worship, and the food they should consume and avoid: now he describes the land of the holy place, and before he divides it into three parts, he commands that a location be chosen from all the tribes, which should have a length of twenty-five thousand and a width of ten thousand. And because it is not specified whether it is cubits or feet or cubits, it is understood to mean the measuring rod that was in the man's hand, which measured six cubits and one-sixth of a cubit, that is, a παλαιστήν. Let the diligent reader calculate how many paces a mile's worth of reeds cover, and how many thousands in length and width there are. After this description, it again commands that from the consecrated land, chosen from all the tribes of Israel, namely, a length of twenty-five thousand reeds and a width of ten thousand reeds, be selected for building the sanctuary, that is, the temple of the Lord, with an additional inner area of five hundred reeds all around, that is, two thousand in total. And so that other buildings would not be joined to the building of the temple by chance, it is commanded that there be a fifty cubit empty space around the suburb, or as Symmachus and Theodotius and the Seventy translated, in a boundary, and separation, and space. With this description finished, another measure of complete separation of sanctification is commanded, that a piece of land measuring twenty-five thousand reeds in length and ten thousand in width be measured after the upper measure, in which there should be no temple, that is, no holy place, but a holy and most holy place, and the priests who approach the ministry of the Lord shall dwell there. But they dwell in that place, when they fulfill the priestly office, and let it be, as we have said, possession of twenty-five thousand acres in length and ten thousand in width. Moreover, the Levites, who serve the priests and have their own ministries, shall receive a place to build twenty treasuries; next to Aquila, dining halls; next to Symmachus, chambers; next to Theodotion, garrisons, or as the Septuagint translated, a city. By which we understand that a certain separate place for the dwelling of the Levites, called by the name of a city, which place is five thousand cubits in width, and twenty-five thousand in length. But all these, that is, the sanctuary, and the other sanctuary, the holy of holies, and the dwelling places of the priests, and the houses of the Levites who minister to the priests, are called separate and consecrated places for service and for the sanctification of the house of Israel. After the fourfold description of the Holy Land, the fifth division is given. The leader or ruler of the people shall take possession from here and there, that is, from both sides of the sanctuary, and reside in the city. Their possession shall overlook the separate place of the temple and the face of the city. And it shall stretch from the side of the sea, that is, from the west, to the other side of the sea, having a width that the prophet describes later in the description of each tribe. Finally, it follows: In terms of length, each of the 559 parts, which three each receive, from the Western boundary, that is, the sea, to the Eastern boundary, where it ends, we will know in the description of the tribes. And this will be the possession of the duke or prince in the land of Israel. These things have been said for the sake of understanding the simple narrative of history. But if we wish to compare spiritual things with spiritual, and, according to certain interpreters, ascend to higher things, who assert that the future is figured in the present, and that everything that is said pertains to the heavenly Jerusalem, which is the mother of us all, and to the church of the early Christians, it will not indeed be difficult to say what has been said by others: but we fear that a wise reader will by no means accept this kind of interpretation. At the present time, and for the Church which now labors in the world, and for those who hasten to go to heaven, everything should be referred, so that others may be chosen from the whole world to possess God, who are holy; others, who have advanced to greater things, may hold the most holy. In the ministers also there is a different order of priests and Levites, some of whom offer sacrifices to God daily with their prayers and virtues; others are in a lower and lesser degree, so that they may minister to those who have reached the highest peaks of virtue, and in the end there may be a leader or prince who can receive possession against one tribe; he may compensate for the merit of one with the merits of many, and while he is still in the world, possess a width from sea to sea; then from the West, or from the sea to the East, leaving the present and hastening to the future, and have his own assured possession, and never desire the possessions of others, and let each tribe hold its own portion: which can properly refer to bishops and presbyters, of whom it is said that they should not devastate and depopulate beyond the people of God, nor possess the land of Israel as an inheritance: but each should have his own possession which is appointed to his rank. However, twenty-five thousand are referred to the senses, which are repeated four times. Furthermore, ten thousand are for perfect knowledge, so that in one part only simple history is contained, and in the other part there is also discussion about theology and supernatural virtues, because the number ten is perfect. Also, it should be considered that priests, who are in a higher rank, possess twenty-five thousand in length and ten thousand in width. But the Levites, that is, the lower order, have the same number in length, that is, twenty-five thousand: but their width is limited to the number five. Hence only twenty gazophylacia are held: in which number the gifts of Esau are offered. But the true leader in the people, who truly deserves to receive the name of leader, receives possession of the sanctuary from both sides: namely from all those who are subject to his will, and from the city that he inhabits, and he receives the reward of many people's welfare. In the front temple, which is called the sanctuary, five hundred on each side are described by pens; and again fifty cubits, by which all the possession of the priests is separated. But in the second sanctuary, where the holy of holies are, the width of the temple and the space are not described, but the number is uncertain. Indeed, we find this also in the possession of the prince, who has possession in the people of Israel without any number, while the progress of all flows back to the prince: and the salvation of the students is the reward of the teachers.


<h2 id='tocuniq338'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) Thus says the Lord God: Ample for you, O princes of Israel: cease wickedness and plundering, and do justice and righteousness, and separate your borders from my people, says the Lord God. For the plundering have multiplied misery by seventy: for the borders, oppression. The meaning is this: Because you have received your share, O princes, the Scripture says that you will also give to the prince on both sides as a separation of the possession of the sanctuary and the city; and your power is so great that your possession has taken a part of one tribe. Therefore, I command and admonish that your wickedness and plundering suffice up to this point, while you invade and plunder what is not yours. And because it is written: 'Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.' (Ps. XXXVI, 27), judging the orphan, and defending the widow; separate your borders from my people, so that you do not move the boundaries. And because this very neighborhood oppresses the lowly, who cannot endure the arrogance of the mighty and powerful, so it is said through Isaiah: 'Woe to those who join house to house and field to field, until there is no more room.' Let this be said for the people of that time. Moreover, it can be applied to our leaders, who, like the Pharaohs and the Egyptians, oppress the children of Israel with power, and do not remember the scripture: 'They have made you a ruler, do not exalt yourself, but be among them as one of them' (Eccl. XXXII, 1). And that which the Lord speaks in the Gospel according to Luke: 'But if that servant says in his heart, 'My master is delayed in coming,' and begins to beat the male and female servants, to eat and drink and get drunk, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in pieces and put him with the unfaithful' (Luc. XII, 45, 46). He also instructs his disciples in the Gospel according to Matthew with these precepts: You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many (Matthew 20:25). There are many things in Sacred Scripture that, if I were to delve into them, would humble the pride of the great and challenge everyone to humility, as the Lord says: Learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart (Matthew 11:29).


<h2 id='tocuniq339'>Book Fourteen</h2>

Book Fourteen.

What I should have said at the beginning of Ezekiel's temple, I am now going to say out of order at the end, in memory of that verse (Virgil. lib. VI Aeneid.):

This is the labor, that house, and the unfathomable error.

The same poet also sings about this in another place (Aeneid. V).

As once in Crete there was a labyrinth, with winding passages hidden by its walls, and an intricate deception with a thousand paths, where the unsuspecting could be misled by signs and fall into an irretrievable error.

So I also entered into the depths of these Scriptures, the ocean of God's mysteries, so to speak, the labyrinth of which it is written: He made darkness his hiding place; and: Thick clouds surround him (Ps. 18:12). Indeed, I dare not claim to possess a perfect knowledge of the truth, but I have provided some indications of the teaching for those who desire to know, not by my own strength, but by the mercy of Christ, who himself unravels the deceit and ambiguities hidden in our errors, guiding us with the blind footsteps of the Holy Spirit. By following him, we may arrive at the port of explanations of the prophet Ezekiel, in whom the fourteenth and final book is found. If by your request, Virgin of Christ Eustochium, I shall bring my writing to its end, and the Lord of this life shall grant me the time, I shall pass on to Jeremiah, the one prophet who remains for us; his interpretation will indeed be the product of my toil, your prayers, but properly speaking, Christ's mercy.

<h2 id='tocuniq340'>563 (Cap. XLV.—.Vers. 10, seqq.)</h2>

563 (Chapter XLV. Verse 10, etc.) 'A just balance and a just ephah and a just bat shall be to you. The ephah and the bat shall be equal, and one measure shall be for both, so that the bat shall contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth part of a homer: according to the measure of the homer shall be the equal balance. Now a shekel has twenty obols. Furthermore, twenty shekels, and twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels make a mina.' LXX: A just balance, and a just measure, and a just dry measure shall be to you: I am the Lord your God, that brought you out of the land of Egypt. And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all my judgments and do them: I am the Lord. Decima pars gomor choenix, et decima pars gomor ephi Gomor erit aequum ad pondus viginti oboli. Viginti sicli: quinque et viginti sicli, et quindecim sicli mina erit vobis.\" This passage in the LXX does not match, and cannot be fully understood, as not only the numbers of measures but also the names have been changed. For they have interpreted pro ephi as a measure, a general name for a specific one, and for bato choenica: for homer as well, which in Hebrew is called κόρος, they translated it as gomor: and again for bato choenica. Let us therefore speak according to the Hebrew and the letter, and let us explain more clearly what seems to us in each case. The scale, which in Hebrew is called Mozene (), is understood in these things which are hung. Ephah, however, which is corrupted in the Greek language as Ἔφι, pertains to the measure of various fruits, for example, wheat, barley, legumes. Furthermore, the bath (which is also the same measure as the ephah) is used only for liquid substances, such as wine and oil, and the like. The cor measures thirty modii and holds the same amount in both dry and liquid substances. One-tenth of a cor, which is measured by the modius, is called an ephah, which is equivalent to three modii. And one-tenth of a cor in liquid substances is called a bath or vadus, so that the ephah and the bath are of the same measure. Furthermore, a sestertius, which is called στατὴρ in Greek, has twenty obols. But a mina, which is called mna, has sixty sestertii, which make twelve hundred obols. However, the mention of twenty sestertii, and twenty-five sestertii, and fifteen sestertii should not confuse the reader as they make a mina. For the difficulty lies in the numbers, to engage the attentive mind of the listener. Therefore, many things are said in parables and riddles so that those who have ears to hear may hear (Luke 8). And all prophecy contains truth in obscurity, so that the disciples may hear inwardly: the common and lowly people, who are outside, may not know what is said. Therefore, divine Scripture commands that the weights be just, saying: There shall not be in your bag a great and a small measure: a true and just balance shall you have, and a true and just measure shall you have ((to oneself)) (Leviticus 19:36). And in Proverbs it is said: Both the great and the small balance are abominable in the sight of God (Proverbs 11:1). Which indeed not only in commerce, and in the use of daily life, is to be observed by us, but in all things justice is to be guarded, the Scripture says: You shall make a balance and weights for your words, and in your words, and in your actions, and in your thoughts, may you do everything with measure and reason. And indeed we read in another place: For a faithful person, the whole world is full of riches: but for one who is unfaithful, not even a tiny coin. He may have said it in different words: The unbeliever possesses nothing in the world: but also needs the smallest portion. About this, it is said in other words in the Gospel: He will not come out from there, unless he gives back the last quarter (Matthew 5:26), that is, even the smallest and most minute coin. We read that ten minas were given to each servant to trade with (Luke 19): and in another parable talents were divided among the servants: and a debtor owed five hundred denarii, and fifty (Matthew 25): and the workers of the vineyard, who each received a denarius (Luke 7): and the widow woman, who had lost a drachma, and barely found it through the lighting of a lamp (Matthew 20, Luke 15). It is not the time to discuss all these things, which have meaning.

<h2 id='tocuniq341'>(Vers. 13, 14)</h2>

And these are the firstfruits which you shall offer: one-sixth of an ephah of wheat from the bushel, and one-sixth of an ephah of barley from the bushel. Also, the measurement of oil: one-tenth of a cor, and ten baths make up a cor, for ten baths fill a cor. LXX: And these are the firstfruits which you shall separate: one-sixth of a measure of wheat from the gomer, and one-sixth of an ephah of barley from the bushel, and a decree of oil, a cotyle, that is, a cyathus, of oil ten cotyles, for ten cotyles are a gomer. 565 And here, in the 70th edition, all the names of measures were confused, so that their meaning cannot be understood. For they had previously called the measure ephi and the choenix measure bato, and the gomer measure coro, and the shekel measure appendiculum, and they now called the measure ephi, and the coro measure gomer, and now they even called it corum. And in the measure of oil they called the bato measure kotyle, which means a cyathus. Let us first say, according to the letter, that the people were supposed to give one-tenth of all their produce to the Levites, as prescribed by the law. Again, from the tithes themselves, the Levites, that is, the lower degree of ministers, gave tithes to the priests: and this is what is called the δευτεροδεκάδη. There were also other tithes, which each person from the people of Israel separated in their own barns, to eat them when they went to the temple in the city of Jerusalem, and in the vestibule of the temple, and the priests and Levites invited them to feasts. There were also other tithes, which were entrusted to the poor, and these are called πτωχοδέκαδαι in Greek. However, the first fruits that were offered from crops were not defined by a specific number, but left to the discretion of the offerer. We have received the tradition of the Hebrews, not commanded by law, but established by the discretion of the teachers: the one who had much would give a fortieth part to the priests, the one who had little would give a sixtieth part, and it was allowed to offer anything between the fortieth and sixtieth parts. Therefore, what was left doubtful in the Pentateuch is specifically defined here due to the greed of the priests, so that they do not demand more from the people in the offering of first fruits, that is, they should offer a sixtieth part of those things that are produced from the earth. For if a corus, which is called in Hebrew Homer (), and is said by the LXX gomor, has thirty modios, both in dry and liquid species: an epha and a batus, as we have said above, are a tenth part of a corus, and it is prescribed that a sixth part of both epha and batus should be given to the priests in the offering of first fruits, which makes half a modium out of three modios, it is clearly calculated that the priests should receive a sixtieth part of the first fruits. For now, let this be sufficient to know and understand the literal and Hebrew truth. Now let us return to spiritual understanding, in which we must first inquire how it is to be done. Honor the Lord with your righteous labors, and give Him the fruits of your righteousness, that your storehouses may be filled with grain and your vats overflow with wine (Prov. III, 9); so that when you have offered the firstfruits of your labors and virtues, and have said, 'Behold, I have brought you the firstfruits of the produce of the land which you have given me, O Lord,' you may deserve to hear: 'Blessed are you in the city, and blessed are you in the field; blessed are the sons of your womb, and the produce of your land, and the increase of your cattle' (Deut. XXVIII, 3), and so on, and possess, according to the Apostle (Ephes. I), every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus: considering that whatever you have, you do not consider to be of your own virtue, but of His mercy, who has given the fruits. And if indeed we have such knowledge of the Scriptures that we may unfold and teach the mystical and hidden things to men, that is, to rational animals, we offer the first-fruits of our grain. But if, after the anagoge, we follow only the pure history, which can nourish the simple, according to what is written, 'Thou shalt save man and beast, O Lord' (Ps. 35:7), we offer the first-fruits of our barley, which Isaac sowed, but in a foreign land, and for it there sprang forth a hundred-fold (Gen. 26). The one who gives the firstfruits of barley can say: The Lord feeds me, and nothing will be lacking to me, he has placed me in a place of pasture: he has led me by the waters of refreshment (Ps 22:1, 2). But the one who feeds rational beings turns the sentiment and says: You have prepared a table before me against those who afflict me. And after he has offered the firstfruits of oil and wine, he joins and speaks: You have fattened my head with oil, and your inebriating cup is how excellent it is, with that oil which is most pure without dregs, it is prepared for the lamp of the Lord. He who prepares it, his face is exhilarated with oil; with the oil of exultation with which Christ was anointed before his companions; and the olive will sing like a prophet; But I am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of God (Ps. LI, 10). And with that wine that flows from the true vine in the presses of the Savior, as the Lord says: I am the vine, you are the branches, my Father is the vinedresser (John XV, 5). From these presses, we read three psalms, the eighth, the eightieth, and the eighty-third, which all refer to the sacraments of the Church. And in the old law, things were indeed without measure and innumerable: for God did not give the spirit by measure. But in the second building of the temple, which is contained in the prophecy of Ezekiel, there is a certain measure, that is, the number sixty, by which the world is completed, as it is said to us: With what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you again (Matt. VII, 2).

<h2 id='tocuniq342'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 and following) And one ram from the flock of two hundred, from those which nourish Israel, for a sacrifice, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them, says the Lord God: All the people of the land shall be bound by these firstfruits to this prince in Israel. And over the prince there shall be burnt offerings, and sacrifice, and drink offerings in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the Sabbaths, and in all the solemnities of the house of Israel. He himself will make a sacrifice for sin, and a burnt offering, and a peace offering, to make expiation for the house of Israel. Above, it was said what portion of them which are to be offered, the measure both of dry and liquid spices, should be offered to the prince: now he observes the same order of firstfruits in animals: that one from the flock of two hundred rams should be commanded to be offered, which Israel feeds, for a sacrifice and a burnt offering, and a peace offering, to make expiation for the people of Israel, says the Lord God. What we have translated about the provisions for Israel is written in Hebrew as Memmasce, which Aquila and Symmachus interpret as 'from the waters,' and the Septuagint and Theodotion interpret as 'from the sources of drinking water.' One of these interpretations refers to irrigation, and the other to canals or pools, indicating that the first fruits of the ruler should be nurtured only in irrigated areas. Just as we read in previous passages that a sixtieth part should be offered to the ruler from what is attached and subject to measurement, now a two-hundredth part of the animals is commanded to be offered, and by such laws all the people are subject, offering what is necessary to the leader or ruler so that through him burnt offerings, sacrifices, and libations may be offered for the people, and the house of God may be cleansed. From this, it should be noted that just as the people are indebted to offer first fruits to the ruler, so the ruler is indebted to offer sacrifices for the people, whom according to tropology we can understand no other than the Lord Savior. This is the one who receives a ram from 568 animals, or as the Hebrew language more significantly shows, βόσκημα, which can be referred to all animals and not specifically to a ram, and he receives an animal or a ram that has been raised in irrigated places, namely the holy Scriptures, and can say, 'The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside still waters' (Psalm 23:1-2). These were wetlands, or rather canals, to which Jacob would lead his flocks so that they could drink and conceive in them, and according to the color of the rods, they would give birth to offspring for the Lord (Gen. XXX). For sacrifice, that is θυσίᾳ, Aquila and Symmachus translate it as a gift: which is called Manaa in Hebrew (), and properly does not pertain to the offering but to those things that are offered in sacrifice, such as flour, porridge, and oil. On the other hand, a burnt offering is that which is offered entirely to God and is consumed by sacred fire. Pacifica, when we are reconciled to God; and the Apostle speaks for us: We pray for Christ, be reconciled to God (2 Cor. 5:20). And in another place: God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself (Ibid., 19). But this prince, to whom the firstfruits are offered, is also the king, as is shown on the title of the cross in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin letters. And when the Jews insisted that the triumphal title should be removed, the crowd of Gentiles answered Pilate: What I have written, I have written (John 19:22). Under the prince, he says, there will be. The dignity of priesthood will be conferred beautifully, to whom the duty is subject; so that he may know that he should offer sacrifice and libations which are offered from wine (or smoke) for the people in all solemnities: namely, on the calends, that is, on the first day of the month, as well as on the sabbaths: when darkness covers everything, the beginning of lunar light is: and on the rest of the sabbaths: so that he may do it indeed for sin, to atone for the house of Israel, which is the Church of the living God, column and foundation of truth. For this is the house of the living God, and the house of Israel, which is in need of atonement for their sins.

<h2 id='tocuniq343'>(Vers. 18 seqq.)</h2>

(Verses 18 onwards) Thus says the Lord God: In the first month, on the first day of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish, and you shall cleanse the sanctuary. And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the house, and on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the doorposts of the gate of the inner court. So you shall do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who has sinned unintentionally or through ignorance, and you shall make atonement for the temple. In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, there will be for you a solemnity of the Passover: you shall eat unleavened bread for seven days. And on that day the prince shall make atonement for himself and for all the people of the land, offering a young bull for sin. And during the seven days of the solemnity, the prince shall offer a burnt offering to the Lord: seven young bulls and seven unblemished rams each day for seven days, and a male goat for sin each day. And he shall offer an ephah of flour with each bull, and an ephah with each ram, and a hin of oil with each ephah. In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month, during the solemnity, he shall do as it was said above for seven days: both for sin and for burnt offering, and in sacrifice and in oil. I have included the entire passage so as not to disturb the reader's attention by dividing it into individual sections. And first, we must speak about the variety of interpretations. Where we rendered it, in the four corners of the base of the altar. The Septuagint translated it as above, and over the four corners of the temple, and over the altar. And where we said, for each one who is ignorant and deceived by error: they substituted for the ignorant and for the child. In that also where we said, the sacrifice of an ephah by a calf, and an ephah by a ram, and a hin of oil for each ephah: their edition maintains: you shall offer the sacrifice, and the cooking of the calf, and the cooking of the ram, and the cooking of the oil. In the last verse also, where we said: in the sacrifice and in the oil: they said, as in manna, as in oil: In the first, he says, month and on the first day of the month (no doubt, meaning Nisan) you shall take a calf from the herd: not one that has been raised at home, but one that is in the herd, that is, from the flock and the number of many. Also on the seventh day of the same month: which two solemnities, namely, the first day of the month and the seventh of the same, are not found in the Mosaic law. But the fourteenth day of the month, on which the Passover is celebrated, and which Moses commanded to be observed, when we eat unleavened bread for seven days. And the fourth solemnity, of which it is said: On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, in the solemnity (Exodus XII), and so on, seems to me to signify the scenopegia, which he has placed here without a name. Therefore, let us go through each thing and briefly discuss what seems good to us. There are spiritual solemnities, as the Apostle teaches: Therefore let no one judge you in food, or in drink, or in regard to a feast day or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come (Colossians 2:16). And thus God speaks through Isaiah: I do not accept your new moons, or sabbaths, or great days: your fasts, and holidays, and new moons, and solemnities, my soul hates (Isaiah 1:13). It is clear that whoever hates the Jewish feasts loves his own, namely the Sabbath that was left to the people of God, so that we may see what has been given to us by God, and speak not in the learned words of human wisdom, but in the teaching of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. For in the present age, which is under the power of the evil one, we cannot see good days, but in the new age: of which days the Holy Spirit sings in the Mosaic song: Remember the days of old: understand the years of generation upon generation (Deut. XXXII, 7). Of which Saint spoke in the psalm: In the night I ponder in my heart (Ps. LXXVI, 7). And again: And I have considered eternal years in my mind, and I have pondered (Ibid., 6). Let him who does not accept this understanding answer how he can explain what Isaiah prophesies about the future and the new age: There will be a month from month to month, and a Sabbath from Sabbath to Sabbath: and all flesh will come to worship the Lord (Isa. LXVI, 23): when the true worshipers will no longer worship on Mount Gerizim, nor in Jerusalem, but in spirit and truth (John IV); when there will be a new heaven and a new earth, and all creation will be set free from the bondage of corruption into the freedom of the children of God, and the sun will receive light seven times as much, and the moon will be compared to the sun (Rom. VIII, Isa. LXV). For we have come to Mount Zion, which is the interpretation of the watchtower, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to thousands of angels in festal gathering. Concerning this festal gathering, another prophet also speaks: What will you do on the days of the assembly and the days of the Lord's festivity? (Hos. 9:5) This is what is also said elsewhere, Celebrate, Judah, your festivities; fulfill your vows. (Num. 1:15) Therefore, if we have learned spiritual festivities, we will also be taught spiritual sacrifices accordingly. A calf is taken from the herd, or a bull, as Symmachus interpreted 571, free and not burdened by yoke, that is, the burden of sins, and blameless: who did not commit sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth, a young calf, bearing horns and hooves: so that in him the sanctuary may be cleansed and atoned for. And the priest will take, he says, from his blood which will be for the sin of all: who in other words is called the lamb in Exodus, and in the Gospel, John the Baptist saying: Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world (John 1:29). But the blood itself is precious, in which we are redeemed in the passion of the Lord and Savior; by whose flesh we are nourished, and by whose blood we are refreshed; by which the four corners of the altar are touched, which Theodotius placed there, the Hebrew word Azara (), or temple, as the LXX have translated: so that the house and altar may be sanctified. For all the elements of the world are sanctified by this blood: so that when someone is purified and cleansed, they may enter the gate of the inner court and be able to understand the secrets of the Lord, and subsequently come to the seventh day of the first month, and obtain rest, and offer a sacrifice to the Lord, both for their ignorance, of which David speaks: Remember not the sins of my youth, and my ignorances (Psalm 24:7), and for the little one, who, when he reaches the measure of a perfect man, will destroy those things that are of a child, and speak confidently: When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child (2 Corinthians 13:11). Or for one who has been deceived by error, and has sinned not so much by will as by a good opinion. But when the two solemnities of the first month are completed, that is, of the first day and of its seventh, he comes to the fourteenth day of the month, in which the solemnity of the Passover is, of which it is written: For Christ our Pasch is sacrificed (1 Cor. 5:7). Then we eat unleavened bread for seven days, in rest and security of all things, when we eat the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, destroying the leaven of malice and wickedness, our prince offering all these things for us, and first for himself. For he took on the human body, and through sin destroyed sin, he who suffers for us, and carries our infirmities: then, for his house, which is written in the LXX, but is not found in Hebrew, that is, for the Church, and for all the people of the earth, namely the whole human race, 572. For the Savior is the Savior of all men, and especially of the faithful, and he himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not only for ours, but for the whole world. But a calf is offered for the whole people of the earth, and on the remaining seven days of the Lord's passion, seven calves and seven unblemished rams are offered daily, to be consumed as a burnt offering and as the Lord's fire. And there are seven calves and seven rams, which symbolize the Lord's passion, so that they may imitate the true calf and the true ram, and the blood of the martyrs may purge the sins of the whole world for seven days. Also, a goat of the she-goats is offered for sin daily, namely for seven days. And it should be noted carefully that in the sacrifice of the calf, and the ram, and the hin of oil that is offered, these are the precepts of the Law. But in the offering of the goat, neither the hin nor (as the Septuagint has translated it) the preparation is included, which they have interpreted as the hin being πέμμα, that is, preparation. But the hin, which is a certain measure of oil, of which we have already spoken, is taken in the sacrifice of the calf and the ram: so that we may receive the nourishment of eternal light, and rest from labor, and the healing of weariness, after the appeasement of sins. In the seventh month also, on the fifteenth day of the month, which is the Feast of Tabernacles, the same order of offerings and sacrifices must be observed, both for sin and for burnt offering, and in the sacrifice, and in the oil; so that we may celebrate the Lord's feast, with darkness dispersed and the light of oil arisen: and that we may have brighter solemnities, in which all sins are forgiven.

<h2 id='tocuniq344'>(Cap. XLVI.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

Chapter 46, verses 1 and following. Thus says the Lord God: The gate of the inner court that faces east shall be closed for six days, during which the work is done; but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened, and also on the day of the new moon it shall be opened. The prince shall enter by the vestibule of the outer gate, and shall stand at the threshold of the gate; and the priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate and then go out; but the gate shall not be shut until evening. And the people of the land shall worship at the gate of that city on the Sabbath and on the first day of the month before the Lord. The prince shall offer this burnt offering to the Lord on the Sabbath day: six unblemished lambs and one unblemished ram, along with a grain offering of one ephah for each ram. The prince shall also offer a grain offering of whatever quantity he desires, along with one hin of oil for each ephah. And on the first day of the month, a young bull from the herd shall be offered, along with six lambs and unblemished rams. And he shall offer an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and lambs as his hand shall find, and a hin of oil per ephah. Where we have translated ephah, which is a tenth part of a cor, the LXX translated πέμμα, which in our language means "cooking". And where we have said sacrifice, they have put the Hebrew word Manaa, which Aquila translated as gift or sacrifice, and Theodotion translated as sacrifice. And in the meantime, before we discuss what these things signify, we must explain the words of Scripture themselves in a paraphrastic manner. The gate, he says, of the inner court shall be closed for six days, of which it is written: You shall work for six days and do all your works (Exod. XXIII, 12), and not just any gate, but the one that faces the East, from where the sun of justice rises. But on the Sabbath day, that is the seventh day, on which there is rest, it shall be opened each week, and again, once the thirty days are completed, when the end of one month and the beginning of another is, that is, the new moon, on the day of the kalends, it shall be opened, so that what the seventh day has as a privilege in the week, the beginning of the month also has as a privilege. But why it is opened on the seventh day, and on the kalends day the inner gate of the atrium which looks out to the East is shown, the following discourse will explain. And the prince will enter, he says, through the way of the vestibule gate on the outside, namely of the outer atrium: and he will stand at the threshold of the inner gate of the atrium, which looks out to the East: nor will he enter the inner atrium, but while he stands there, other priests will perform the burnt offering for him, which offering Symmachus interpreted as holocaust: and the peace offerings, or those which pertain to salvation, so that after the prince's victim has been burned with sacred fire, and the leader reconciled to God, then he may be able to worship on the threshold of the inner gate of the atrium on which he has stood, and depart. What then? After the departure of the prince, will the gate be immediately closed? By no means! It will be open until evening; so that after the prince, all the people of the land may worship in front of the gate. They will worship on the Sabbaths and on the first days of the month when the gate is opened. And because he had said before: The priests will offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and had not indicated the number of burnt offerings; now he adds: But on the Sabbath day, the prince will offer this burnt offering to the Lord. However, the offering is not made by oneself, but by the priests, of whom it is written: 'And the priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings: six lambs, he says, without blemish, and one ram without blemish: and the measure of the ephah for the ram, which is called Epha (). But the sacrifice that can be offered by the hands of the one offering shall be six lambs; and for each ephah there shall be the measure of oil, which is called hin. But on the day of the new moon, which is the day of the new month, it shall have an additional privilege from the Sabbath, that a calf shall be sacrificed from the herd, or an unblemished bull.' Moreover, the rest, that is, six unblemished lambs and one unblemished ram, and their sacrifices, shall possess the ritual of the Sabbath: only in such a way that just as in the ram an ephah offering of flour and a hin of oil is offered, so shall it be offered in the calf. These things are set forth for the sake of clarity: now let us, with the gift of the Lord, unlock the spiritual meaning. But when we come to the seventh day, that is, the Sabbath day, on which eternal rest is, or to the first day of the month, when after a dark night and dreadful darkness, the beginning of light is, the Eastern gate is opened to us: and if any of us, through the merits of virtues, has attained the name and dignity of a leader by the way of the entrance-gate from without, that is, by the labors of this world: and shall enter the gate of the Church, which is still placed within earthly limits: not the interior court, for this is written in the present place; but to the threshold of the inner gate, and shall stand in it. But if the prince does not enter the inner courtyard, but stands at its threshold, there is no doubt that for now we see and know partially; and yet, with the face of the Lord not yet revealed, we contemplate His glory. Finally, with the prince standing at the threshold of the inner courtyard gate, the other priests, to whom this duty is delegated (whom we can understand as angelic virtues), will offer a burnt offering and peace offerings on his behalf. For we are born of the mercy of God, and every creature is unclean in comparison to the Creator, and it must be cleansed by divine fire, just as the lips of the prophet Isaiah were cleansed: so that after receiving peace through sacrifice, one may stand at the threshold and worship the omnipotence of God, and acknowledge one's unworthiness to enter the inner court, and then enter immediately. After the first one has exited, the inner gate of the court will not be closed until the evening of this age, but it will remain open: so that the people of the earth may come to the gate and worship Him: not at all times, but only when they have rested from sin and have received the light of faith, dispelling the darkness of ignorance. But this very burnt offering, which the prince offers through the priests on the Sabbath day, is concluded with the number of six unblemished lambs; namely, for the six days in which we work in the world, and a spotless ram, who is the prince of the flock; so that by each ram it is offered in the sacrifice of an ephah, that is, a tenth part of a cor. But in the sacrifice of the six lambs, a certain measure is not specified: but whatever amount the hand of him who offers may give, that is, according to the quality and quantity of the works (Matthew 25). But he shall offer a hin of oil for every ephah, which is the oil that five virgins have prepared for themselves, so that he may anoint the fine flour, or mix it, and every offering of God may be filled with the light of truth, and the face of the offerer may be brightened by the oil. But on the kalends, that is, on the thirtieth day, when the firstborn and the Levites are counted in the Law, apart from all of Israel, of which we have spoken above, an unblemished calf from the herd is offered, about which we have spoken more fully in the preceding chapter, and six lambs, and unblemished rams, and the rest that are offered on the sabbaths, so that we may obtain eternal rest and deserve to hear: Well done, good servant, because you have been faithful in few things, I will set you over many things, enter into the rest of your Lord (Matthew 25:21; Luke 19:17); and not only may we arrive at the gate of the inner court, but we may also enter its innermost sanctuary, and possess it through our actions: Planted in the house of the Lord, they will flourish in the courts of our God (Psalm 92:14).


<h2 id='tocuniq345'>576 (Vers. 8 seqq.)</h2>

576 (Verse 8 onwards) When the prince enters, let him enter through the way of the vestibule of the gate, and let him exit through the same way. And when the people of the land enter in the presence of the Lord during the solemnities, let the one who enters through the North gate to worship, exit through the way of the South gate, and let the one who enters through the way of the South gate, exit through the way of the North gate. He shall not return through the way of the gate through which he entered, but shall exit opposite to it. But the prince, in the midst of them, shall enter when they enter, and shall go out when they go out. And in the markets and solemnities, there shall be a sacrifice of one ephah by a calf, and one ephah by a ram. But the sacrifice of a lamb shall be according to his ability: and there shall be a hin of oil for each ephah. That prince, of whom it is said above: 'And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate without, and shall go out by the same way, and shall enter by the same gate' (John 10), has free will and the power to lay down his life and to take it up again. And in coming to us, as well as in ascending to heaven, he exercises the same liberty of his majesty. Finally, he does not seek markets or festivities, nor does he observe any difference between days, because every time is a celebration for him. But the people only go to the markets and festivities, and they enter and exit through a different road each time. For it is written: 'And when the people of the land enter before the Lord at the festivities, let the one who enters through the North gate to worship, exit through the South gate, and let the one who enters through the South gate, exit through the North gate. They shall not return through the gate they entered, but shall go out opposite to it.' This is not only commanded to those who depart from Sodom, and it is said to them: Do not look back (Gen. XIX, 17); nor to those who put their hand to the plow, so that they do not look back at what is behind: but also to those who are established in the house of the Lord, it is ordered that they do not look back, and that they do not turn back to the poor and weak elements, and being initiated by the spirit, they are consumed by the flesh (or they are consumed): but that they may also advance from spiritual things to greater things, and say with the Apostle: Forgetting what is behind, and stretching forth to what is before (Phil. III, 13): so that they may not know in part and prophesy in part, but that they may come to perfection according to that perfection which human nature can attain, so that we may understand that Gospel saying: And when you have done all things, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done what we were obliged to do (Luke XVII, 10). And the Apostle, in the same Epistle, speaks of two perfections: for he writes as though he were imperfect, saying: Not as though I had already taken hold, or were already perfect: but I follow after, if I may by any means apprehend that for which also I am apprehended by Christ Jesus (Philippians 3:13). And immediately, as though he were perfect, he says: But one thing I do: forgetting those things which are behind, and stretching forth myself to those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Therefore, let us understand this: as many as we are perfect, let us know (Alex. we know) (Ibid. XIV). For how can the idea stand, that the one who said, 'Not because I have already received or because I am already perfect,' dare to say, 'Therefore, as many as we are perfect, let us know?' From this it is clear that every human being, and the whole of creation, although it has come to perfection, still needs the mercy of God and possesses complete perfection from grace, not from merit. And so it is commanded to the people of the land, that if one enters through the gate of the North to worship, they shall exit through the way of the gate of the South. Who is this people to whom this is commanded? Namely, the gentiles; so that anyone who, having forsaken the gate of the North, from which evils are kindled upon the earth, has entered the temple, shall not exit except through the way of the gate of the South, to the gate of light, to the gate of heat, to the gate where the bridegroom lies at midday (Jer. I). Finally, it is said in the same Song of Songs: Arise, north wind, and come, south wind (Song of Songs IV, 16). But he who enters through the southern gate should leave by the northern gate. Who is this people? It is the Jews, who, forsaking the gate of the way of light, go to the gate of the north, of which it is said: The north wind is a very strong wind (Jeremiah I). For even Jeremiah's pot is kindled by the face of the north. Let us also say this in another way: He who forgives sins enters through the northern gate, and he who follows virtues leaves through the southern gate. And on the other hand, if the righteous one should fall into sin, he enters indeed through the southern gate, but he exits through the way of the northern gate. The prince, however, he says, will be in their midst, namely, of those who enter and those who exit, according to what is written: He stands in your midst, whom you do not know (John 1:26). And the Apostle: Do you not know that Christ is in you? (2 Corinthians 13:5). But if it is said to those who do not know that Christ stands in their midst, how much more to those who know! But when Christ stood among the knowledgeable, then the dead body will be made because of sin, and the living spirit because of righteousness. The prince enters with those entering, and exits with those exiting, bearing witness to both virtue and sin. Therefore, in the markets and in the solemnities, namely the Sabbaths, the first days of the month, and all the festivities we have spoken of earlier, both a calf and a ram will be offered in sacrifice, each with a measure of ephah. But in the agnishowever, there will not be a fixed number, nor a most extreme will; but rather, one should use their abilities and act in good conscience: to offer as much as one is able, not as much as one desires, and above all, a hin of oil for each ephah, so that a similar offering may be anointed, and a lamp may be lit in the presence of the Lord; and let the one who uses it be able to say: But as for me, I am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of the Lord (Ps. LI, 10).

<h2 id='tocuniq346'>(Vers. 12 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 12 seqq.) However, when the ruler offers a voluntary burnt offering or a voluntary peace offering to the Lord, the gate that faces east shall be opened for him, and he shall make his burnt offering and peace offering as is customary on the Sabbath day. After he has left, the gate shall be closed. And he shall offer a year-old unblemished lamb as a burnt offering to the Lord every day ((the Vulgate adds always)): he shall offer it in the morning and in the morning he shall offer it again. And he shall offer a sacrifice (or a grain offering) upon it in the morning, one-sixth of an ephah (or measure) of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil, and ((the Vulgate adds that)) it shall be mixed (or according to Symmachus, sprinkled) with a sacrifice (or grain offering) of wheat, a lawful, perpetual offering to the Lord. You shall make a lamb and a sacrifice, and oil every morning, a perpetual burnt offering. Where we read 'immaculate,' it is written in Hebrew 'tamim,' which Aquila interprets as 'perfect.' And where LXX reads 'manah,' Theodotion translates it as 'sacrifice'; Aquila and Symmachus translate it as 'gift.' But for what we said 'spontaneous,' LXX translates it as 'confession,' and for 'prince,' they translated it as 'leader,' for this is what 'nasi' signifies. Moreover, the conversation is still about the prince, about whom Isaiah speaks: Behold, I have given him as a witness to the nations, a leader and teacher to the nations (Isa. 55:4). And Ezekiel: And I will be their God, and David a prince among them (Ezek. 34:24). Therefore, when this prince acts voluntarily and says: Let the voluntary, or spontaneous, pleasing things of my mouth be done, O Lord (Ps. 119:108): the voluntary burnt offering, that he may offer himself completely to God, and the peaceful voluntary, which is not found in the previous texts; for it is written: And the priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offering: and with regards to his voluntary and spontaneous offerings, which are now being mentioned, it is completely silent, so that they are not done out of necessity, but out of free will: after the burnt offering, let him offer the peace offering, and be reconciled to God. And where virginity is greater than marriage (I Cor. VII), because it is not demanded, nor restored, but offered. The reconciliations, which in Hebrew are called Selamim, are interpreted by the LXX as salutary: so that the reconciliation itself of the peacemakers may be the salvation of the offerer. Therefore, when the prince does this, the gate will be opened to him; or according to the Seventy, the gate that looks towards the East will be opened to him; that gate, namely, concerning which it is written: This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter through it (Ps. CXVII, 20), and where the sun of justice rises. And he will make his holocaust and his peace offering, of which we have spoken now. But he will make it, because it is a voluntary sacrifice, and no other priests will make it for him, as is usually done on the Sabbath day. Therefore, at all times, the holocaust and peace offering, which are offered voluntarily, have the gate of the Lord reserved for them; neither does he observe the Sabbath, but all days are considered rest to him. Finally, after he has offered his holocaust and peace offering, he immediately goes out, and the door is closed behind him, or the door is closed: so that his privilege may be preserved for the ruler, and his sacrifices may not be mixed with those of the people. And because he had said in general, a voluntary holocaust, or a peaceful voluntary offering to the Lord, without specifying a bull or a calf, and a ram or a sheep, and a male goat for sin, he teaches what the holocaust itself is: A lamb, he says, a one-year-old unblemished lamb, he shall make a holocaust: and not on specific days, but every day, and not at any hour, but in the morning, yes, in the morning he shall make it: specifically every morning, when the sun rises, the beginning of light. About what does David speak in the psalm: In the morning, you will hear my voice; in the morning, I will stand before you and see. (Ps. 5:4) And in another place: Weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning. (Ps. 30:6) And again: O God, you are my God; early will I seek you. (Ps. 63:1) But who is this spotless lamb, or perfect and humble, Isaiah explains more fully, saying: He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth. (Isaiah 53:7) And Jeremiah: But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; I did not know (Jer. XI, 19). And John the Baptist: Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world (John I, 29). This is the Lamb who is sacrificed in Egypt, whose blood arms the doorposts of faith, and the destroyer is excluded (Exod. XII). And the year of the Lord's favor, and the day of retribution were announced. Let not the reader be surprised, if he is also called prince, and priest, and calf, and ram, and lamb, for in the holy Scriptures we read of him as Lord, and God, and man, and prophet, and rod, and root, and flower, and prince, and judge, and king, righteous, and justice, apostle, and bishop, arm, servant, ointment, shepherd, son, and child, only-begotten, and firstborn, door, way, angel, arrow, and wisdom, and many other things, all of which, if I were to present the testimonies, would require a separate book. Therefore, in the holocaust of this immaculate and one-year-old lamb, which is always offered in the morning, the high priest himself will perform the sacrifice, whether it is a Manaa or a similar offering. The morning offering, a sextam partem ephi, is understood to be made of fine flour. And a sexta pars ephi is half a modius. For if an ephi is a tenth part of a corus, that is, three modii, there is no doubt that a sexta pars ephi would make half a modius. From the hin of oil, a third part is offered: to be mixed with or sprinkled on the flour sacrifice to God, a lawful, continual, and perpetual sacrifice, which is not interrupted on any day, but is always offered at all times, when the sun rises, in order to fulfill what is written at the end of this chapter: He shall make a lamb as a sacrificial offering, and oil in the morning, a perpetual holocaust.


<h2 id='tocuniq347'>581 (Vers. 16, 17 et seqq.)</h2>

Verses 16, 17 and so on. Thus says the Lord God: If a prince (or leader) gives a gift to one of his sons, it will be the inheritance of his sons and they will possess it as an inheritance. But if he gives a legacy from his inheritance to one of his servants, it will belong to that servant until the year of remission (for which Theodotius put the Hebrew word, Deror), but then it will return to the prince, and the inheritance will belong to his son. And the ruler shall not take the inheritance of the people by violence, nor from their possession, but shall give his own inheritance to his sons, so that my people may not be scattered, each one from his possession. So far, we have spoken about the ruler, now we turn to his heirs: indeed, about the gifts, inheritance, and legacies that he should give, and whose possession may be temporal or eternal. If, he says, he has given a gift or inheritance to his sons, they shall possess it, because they are entitled to it by succession, and possession cannot pass from one to another. But if he shall give to one of his servants in the name of a legate, he shall possess him as long as the seventh year of remission, which is called the Deror (), or the jubilee, that is, the fiftieth, shall come: when all sale and gift return to the former owners: so that the servant shall have the use for a time, and the ownership of the possession for the son of the prince. But what follows: And the prince shall not take of the inheritance of the people by violence (Lev. XXIII), or as the Seventy have translated, to oppress them, or as Aquila and Symmachus, to afflict and distress them: but he shall give his inheritance to his sons: it rebukes not only the priests and princes of that time, but also ours, who become richer by the dignity of the priesthood, and besides those things which are owed to them by the disposition of the Lord, they take by violence from the poor: or under the name of honor, they plunder the rich, so that they also owe nothing to their own sons, to whom paternal inheritance is due, except what has been left to them by their parents. Therefore, whoever is a rich priest, when he comes to the priesthood, whatever he has in excess, he should not give to his sons, but to the poor, and to the holy brothers, and to the faithful servants, who surpass the merits of children, in order to give back what belongs to the Lord, to his Master, who speaks in the Gospel: Whatever you have done to the least of these, you have done to me (Matthew 25:40). For he himself is received as a guest in the poor; he is visited in prison; he is clothed in nakedness; he drinks when he is thirsty; he is filled when he is hungry. Lest my people be dispersed from their possession, says he. For if the ruler has the power, either to take or to seize, or to hold under the guise of honor that which is not his own, and to leave nothing for his children, then the people who had been gathered in the name of God will be scattered and torn apart: either according to the Law, so that another's inheritance does not gradually pass to another, and the cord of division perishes, through which perhaps the inheritance comes to each one. Therefore, he disperses the people of God and takes away from them eternal possession of faith, who abandons the gifts or goods of others through theft, robbery, flattery, or deception under the guise of religion, to his sons, brothers, and relatives.

<h2 id='tocuniq348'>(Vers. 19 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 19 and following) And he led me through the entrance that was on the side (or behind) the gate, into the storerooms of the sanctuary, to the priests (or into the chambers and rooms) that faced north. And behold, there was a place sloping toward the west (or toward the sea: and as the Septuagint translated, separated). And he said to me: This is the place where the priests boil, for guilt and for sin (or for ignorance and therefore) where they boil the sacrifice (or the manna and the gift) so that they do not carry them to the outer court, and the people may be sanctified. And he led me into the outer court, and he brought me around through the four corners of the court. And behold, there was a small courtyard in the corner of the court, with small courtyards at each corner of the court. The small courtyards were arranged in the four corners of the court, forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide. The measurements of each one were the same: and there was a wall surrounding the four small courtyards. And beneath the porticoes around (or near) were kitchens built (or stalls, which Aquila interpreted as στιβάδας, Symmachus as περιφράγματα, Theodotion translated the Hebrew word as Turoth). And he said, he said to me: This is the house of the kitchens, in which the ministers of the house cook the sacrifices of the people [Vulg. adds to the Lord (or victim): For this in Hebrew signifies Zeba (): The man who held a reed in his hand and a measuring line of the mason, with which he measured the building 583, introduced, he said, me through the entrance, which was on the side of the gate, or behind the gate. And he did not specify whose gate, Eastern, Southern, or of another region: but he left it uncertain, so that I would go to the place of the sanctuary, and to the treasury, or to the chambers of the priests, which looked towards the north and towards the sea: namely, towards the north and towards the west: this Holy Scripture having this custom, that it always calls the western sea according to the position of the land of Judea. And it should be considered that the place of the priests, where for a fault, or ignorance, and for a sin they cook sacrifices, lest they be offered raw, is placed in the outer courtyard towards the North and West: from where the coldest wind rises, and where the light of the sun sets. From which it is shown that whatever pertains to food, is either for error, or for sin. But if a sacrifice is also offered for ignorance, how much more for the conscience of a fault! Therefore Job also offered a daily morning sacrifice for his sons (Job. I), fearing lest they had sinned in ignorance. But that which follows: That they do not offer in the outer courtyard, and the people should be sanctified, who had not been prepared for sanctification, that indicates, that we should not easily give holy things to those who are not sanctified: nor cast, according to the Gospel, pearls before swine, nor give the holy to dogs (Mat. VII). Finally Moses wants the people to be sanctified from every impurity, and from the embrace of wives, so that they may approach Mount Sinai, and sanctified receive the holy things (Exod. XIX). But if they are commanded to be sanctified to hear and receive the words of God, it is clear in the Law that that Apostolic saying is contained: Do not defraud one another, unless perhaps by agreement for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer (I Cor. VII, 5): and by agreement abstain from wives, so that we may devote ourselves to prayer. After this it is written: And he led me into the outer courtyard, and he led me around the four corners of the courtyard: and behold there was a small courtyard in the corner of the courtyard, each small courtyard placed in the four corners of the courtyard. That man whom he often mentions, led him from the place of the priests which turned towards the North, or 584 which was separated, where the priests cook for a fault, and for a sin, or for ignorance: but he led him into the outer courtyard. From which we understand that that courtyard from which he went out was inside, and that there were many courtyards in the Holy Scriptures, of which we read: You who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courtyards of the house of our God (Ps. CXXXIV, 2). And in John: And I have other sheep that are not of this courtyard, and it is necessary for me to bring them: and they will hear my voice, and there will be one courtyard and one shepherd (John. X, 16): for this in Greek means αὐλὴ, which Latin simplicity translates as ovile. But when he says, of this courtyard, he shows that there is another: which is either in the multitude of the Gentiles as a distinction from Israel, or in heaven as a separation from the earthly courtyard: and for the quality of merits each one is entrusted with a courtyard, about which we have already discussed more fully in the preceding. But this courtyard, of which we are now speaking, had small courtyards at each of the four corners, which the LXX call minor, and we, for the sake of ease of understanding, have called small courtyards. They were forty cubits long, and thirty wide. Concerning these numbers, I remember disputing with this same Prophet, that one refers to tribulations and constraints, and the other to perfect age. For forty days Moses, and Elijah, and the Lord and Savior fasted in the desert (Exod. XXXIV; III Reg. XIX; Mat. IV; Luc. III): and they do not approach the priestly office until after the twenty-fifth year of age, but after the thirtieth. Therefore the Lord was thirty years old when he came to baptism: and in this same Prophet the thirtieth year is mentioned at the beginning. Where there is food, there is also distress and temptation, through which food is prepared. And where we have come to the age of a perfect man, there all must be trodden down, and we must say: Having food and clothing, let us be content with these (I Tim. VI, 8). And: If the Lord gives me food to eat, and clothing to cover me (Gen. XXVIII, 20). Or certainly this: Food for the belly, and the belly for food: but God will destroy both it and them (I Cor. VI, 13). For we will not eat and drink in the future, but we will feed on that bread which descends from heaven, of which it is sung in the Psalms: The bread of angels man has eaten (Ps. LXXVI, 25). And: My food is to do the will of him who sent me (John. IV, 34). But that the measure of one small courtyard was four, which possessed the corners of the larger courtyard, signifies the four corners of the world (Genes. III): that in the sweat of our face we may eat bread, and all our labor may profit the belly: which four small courtyards, or one wall surrounded, and the kitchens were built below the porticoes all around, or they had adjacent dining areas: so where there is food, there is also the preparation of measures. And lest the prophet should perhaps not know what he saw, he said to him: This is the house of the kitchens, in which the ministers of the Lord cook the sacrifices of the people. Indeed, the sacrifices of the people, which are offered for a fault, or a sin, and ignorance, are food, and refreshments for the priests: so that they may remember that they should seek nothing else, since even in the temple meats are prepared for their refreshment.

<h2 id='tocuniq349'>(Cap. XLVII.—Vers. 1 seqq.)</h2>

(Chapter 47, Verses 1 and following.) And he brought me back to the door of the house, and behold, water was flowing out from under the threshold of the house toward the east. The face of the house was toward the east. And the water was flowing down from the right side of the temple toward the south of the altar. Then he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around to the outer gate facing east. And behold, the water was gushing out on the right side as the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand. He measured a thousand cubits and led me through the water, and it was ankle-deep (or, the water came up to the ankles). And he measured a thousand cubits, and led me through water up to the knees (or he passed through the water up to the thighs). And he measured a thousand cubits, and led me through water up to the loins (or he passed through the water up to the waist). And he measured a thousand cubits, a river that I could not pass through, for the waters had risen, a deep torrent (Some Greek manuscripts read 'deep water') that could not be crossed. For the LXX translated it: And he measured a thousand cubits, and could not pass through, for the water was carrying like a precipitous torrent, which cannot be crossed. These waters that flowed underground beneath the threshold of the house, that is, the temple, were not carried to the north and to the west, but also to the east and on the right side of the temple, that is, to the south, and specifically to the altar. From this it is clear that these waters are sacred and signify the teaching of our Savior, according to what is written: 'Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem' (Isaiah 2:3). And in another place: The knowledge of the Lord shall fill the earth as water covers the sea (Isaiah 11:9). Concerning these waters, the Prophet Zechariah prophesied, saying: On that day, living water shall flow out from Jerusalem, half to the eastern sea and half to the western sea (Zechariah 14:8). Concerning these waters, the Lord spoke to the Samaritan woman: If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water (John 4:10). And again: Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. (John, 4). And in the temple he cried out and said: If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me (as the Scripture has said), 'Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.' This he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive. (John 7:37-38). These are the waters of which the prophet spoke in the psalm: He leads me beside still waters. (Psalm 23:2). And Ezekiel said: 'I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses. For I will cleanse you from all your idols.' (Ezekiel 36:24, 25) 'The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voice, the rivers have lifted up their roaring.' (Psalm 93:3) These are the waters of Siloam that flow gently, of which Isaiah speaks: 'With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.' (Isaiah 12:3) And the Psalmist says: Bless the Lord from the fountains of Israel (Ps. 68). And likewise Isaiah speaks of the Lord as Savior: This one, he says, shall dwell in the lofty cave of the strongest rock. Bread shall be given to him, and his water shall be faithful (Isa. 33:16). For water gushed forth in the desert, and a valley in a thirsty land. And it is said to those who believe: Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; you are mine, and if you pass through water, I am with you (Isa. 43:1-2). And again: You who thirst, go to the water (Isaiah 55:1): And through Jeremiah God speaks (Isaiah 55:1): My people have committed two evils. They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and have dug for themselves cisterns that cannot hold water (Jeremiah 2:13). Therefore, just as we read in a positive sense about the waters that flow out from the threshold of the temple and are brought back to the teaching of the Church, so there are bitter waters and very bad waters which Jeremiah the prophet prohibits us from approaching, saying (Ibid. 18): What to you is the way of Egypt, that you may drink from the waters of Geon? The Hebrew word for 'turbid and muddy' is Sior. Concerning this, God speaks angrily about the heretics: Behold, I will feed them with bitterness and give them poisoned water to drink (Jeremiah 9:15), in which the Egyptian dragon reigns, who says: The rivers are mine, and I have made them; he sees all that is high and he himself is the king of those who are in the waters. Therefore, the man Ecclesiasticus prays to the Lord and says: Save me, Lord, for the waters have come up to my neck. I am stuck in the mire of the deep, and there is no substance, and the storm has engulfed me (Ps. 68:1-2). And again; Deliver me from those who hate me, and from the depths of the waters: let not the waterstorm cast me down, let not the deep swallow me up, nor let the pit close its mouth over me (Ibid. 15:16). And in another psalm: If it had not been that the Lord was on our side, let Israel now say: If it had not been that the Lord was on our side, when men rose up against us, perhaps they would have swallowed us alive." } When their anger was provoked against us, perhaps the water would have engulfed us (Psalm 123:1-3). And the Bride in the Song of Songs: Many waters cannot quench love, nor can rivers drown it (Song of Songs 8:7). This is the water of which Hosea says: The city of Galaad has scorned me, a city that works in vanities, stirring up the water and its men's strength are pirates (Hosea 6:7-8). This water is called Mara, which means bitterness; into it the wood of the Cross is thrown, and the bitter is turned into sweet." } Consider the law of Moses, if it is understood according to the carnal sense of the Jews, how bitter it is, digging out an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth (Exodus XXI): see Thamar's fornication (2 Samuel XIII), and the joining of the harlot by Hosea, Jeremiah's girdle (Hosea I, Jeremiah XIII), Moses' Ethiopian wife, and the killing of the Egyptian, and a thousand other things, which if we understand according to the literal meaning, and not according to the life-giving spirit, are bitter, and do not edify their reader as much as they destroy him (Numbers XII, Exodus II). Therefore, these waters that flow out of the temple of the Lord, and proceed to the East, and descend to the right side of the Temple, to the South altar, where the bridegroom feeds his guests, and reclines. But what follows: And he led me through the way of the North gate, and turned to the way outside the outer gate, the way that faced the East, it secretly shows that we cannot immediately reach the Eastern gate, unless we go through the way of the North gate and come to it in a long circuit. For unless we have overcome the extremely cold wind with the heat of faith, and have tread upon its regions, so that what is written by the Apostle may be fulfilled in us: 'But the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet speedily' (Rom. XVI, 20), we will not be able to enter the gate through which the waters flow and are on the right side. And note that these waters which enter through the gate of the East so flee to the left parts, that they are described as going from the right side of the altar to the South. And the man, he said, who had a rope in his hand, when he led me through the gate on the north side to the road that faced the East, and he himself was in the same place, measured a thousand cubits of the same water; and he led me through the water up to the ankles, which Aquila and Symmachus, and Theodotion have interpreted as ἀστραγάλοι, for which the LXX translated: and he shall pass through the water, the water of remission: which we can understand to signify the first sins of men, which are forgiven by the waters of the Lord as we enter, and show the saving grace of baptism and are the beginnings of progress, yet themselves are exalted. Finally, they reach the ankles, which are close to the heels. This is where the snake bites, as the Lord says: 'You shall strike his head, and he shall strike your heel' (Gen. III, 15, LXX). And in the Psalms concerning Judas the betrayer, it is said: 'Even the one who ate my bread has lifted up his heel against me' (Ps. XL, 10), or his heel, for this is what the Greek word πτέρνη (Mss. πτέρνα) means. After a thousand cubits, they reached the heel and measured another thousand cubits in water, and led me up to the knees. After the remission of sins, and during our journey, when we endeavor to ascend a little from earthly things to higher things, we bend our knees to the Lord, as the Apostle says: 'That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father' (Philippians 2:10). It is measured as three thousand other cubits, and it carried me through the water up to the kidneys. For we ascend to lofty things by steps: and yet those very lofty things themselves reach to the loins and kidneys, so that every ignoble desire in us may be cut off; and we may possess sanctification of the body, without which no one sees God. Hence also in this same prophet (Supra VIII): from the feet to the loins God of fire is seen. For they need fire, and the purifying works of the loins, as the just one says: For my loins are filled with illusions (Ps. XXXVII, 8), through which the enemy deceives us both in the day and in the night's phantasm. From the loins to the head and the crown, it shines with the gleam of the most precious metal, amber. So that it has nothing filthy in it, nothing of worthlessness. Hence, it is now said for the fourth time: And it was measured as a thousand, the river (which the Seventy did not translate) that I could not cross over: much better than the Seventy who said, and he could not cross over. For the prophet and all human nature, after the loins of the river of thoughts and the impulses of vices in the heart, cannot cross over. But that man who was clothed in Baddim, and a leader of prophets, passed through without difficulty: who did not commit sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth (Isa. 56). And he explains the reasons why the prophet could not pass through a thousand cubits: because, he says, the deep waters of the torrent had swelled, which could not be crossed. And how is it written, as the prophet boasts: Our soul has passed through the torrent (Ps. 124:5)? But it is easily solved if we know that this is written in Hebrew: A torrent has passed through my soul. Isaiah speaks about this torrent: Behold, I will extend peace to them like a river, and the glory like a torrent overflowing (Isa. 66:12). And in the thirty-fifth psalm about the holy ones, it is said: In the protection of your wings they will hope. They will be drunk with the abundance of your house, and you will give them to drink from the torrent of your delights; for with you is the fountain of life (Ps. 36:8-9). And on the one hundred and twenty-fifth: Convert, O Lord, our captivity, like a torrent in the South (Ps. 125:5). And concerning the Savior: He shall drink from the brook by the way (Ps. 110:7). For who among men can boast of having a pure heart (Prov. 20)? Or whose mind, through the windows of the eyes, has not been entered by the death of desire (Jer. 9), and (to say the least) the stimulation of the soul? For the world is placed in wickedness (1 John 5:19); and from childhood, the heart of man is inclined to evil, so that not even for one day from the beginning of his existence, human condition is without sin (Job. 15). And so David confesses in the psalm: Behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins my mother conceived me (Ps. 50:7). Not in the iniquities of my mother, or certainly my own, but in the iniquities of human condition. And so the Apostle says: Death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of the transgression of Adam (Rom. 5:14). We use the masculine form 'cubitos' instead of the neutral form 'cubita' according to the rules of grammar, as I have taught in previous explanations. We do this not out of ignorance, but out of custom for the sake of the simple and uneducated, of whom there are many in the congregation of the Church.


<h2 id='tocuniq350'>(Vers. 6 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 6 and following) And he said to me: Surely you have seen, son of man; and he brought me out, and turned me toward the bank of the river (or stream). And when I turned (or had turned), behold, on the bank of the river (or stream) there were very many trees (or very many trees) on both sides. And he said to me: These waters that go out to the hills of the East (or to the hills of the East), and go down to the plains of the desert (or this water that goes out into Galilee, which turns toward the East, and goes down to Arabia), will enter the sea, and they will come out, and the waters will be healed. And every living creature (or animal) that moves (or crawls), wherever the stream (or river) goes, will live: and there will be many fish after these waters come there: and they will be healed, and everything will live wherever the stream (or river) goes. And fishermen will stand by it from En-gedi to En-eglaim; it will be a place for spreading nets. Its fish will be of many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea, exceeding many. But the water that flows out of the swamps and marshes will not be healed; it will be given to the salt pits. And on the bank of the river, on both sides, there will grow all kinds of fruit-bearing trees, whose leaves will not wither and whose fruit will not fail. Each month they will bear fresh fruit, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing. Although the entire chapter is long, I wanted to present it all together so as not to interrupt the reader's understanding and divide the sequence of reading into parts that confuse the listener's comprehension. First, it should be said that in Hebrew it is called Nehel (נְהֵל), and in Greek it is called χειμάῤῥους. The LXX translated it as 'river'. Then, for Galilee, which is called Galila (גַּלְילָא) in Hebrew, Aquila interpreted it as θίνας, which signifies mounds of sand. Symmachus translated it as μεθόριον, which we can translate as 'border'. Symmachus also transferred to Arabia, an uninhabitable place; Aquila, low or flat; Theodotius, to Arabia. Let us therefore say what seems to us in each (case). That man who was the leader of Ezekiel, advises the prophet to look more carefully and see, and to attend to the hidden mysteries with the eyes of the mind. He calls the son of man, or in the form of the Lord Savior; for indeed Ezekiel is interpreted as strength, or the power of God: or certainly for the sake of the disturbance of human frailty; lest he forget his own condition, while great things are shown to him: and he leads him advisedly, and turns towards the edge of the stream, so that since he could not go across the middle depth, at least he may recognize those things which are on the banks. And when, he said, I turned myself, or he turned me, who was my guide and teacher; behold, on the bank of the torrent, or the river, there were many logs, or very many trees, on either side. This torrent, which is carried away like a torrent by the abundance of waters, and receives rain from the sky, as we mentioned in a previous lecture, is called a river by the LXX, because it has perpetual waters: not from rains collected here and there, but from a living and perpetual source. Of which river we read many things in the Holy Scriptures; but for now, a few things must be said, and firstly this: The rushing of the river gladdens the city of God (Psalm 46:4). And in another place: The river of God is filled with water, you have prepared their food, for so is your provision (Psalm 65:10). And again in the plural: The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voices, with the voices of many waters: The mighty waves of the sea are amazing (Psalm 93:2-4). And in Isaiah: I will make a way in the desert, and rivers in the wasteland (Isa. 43:19). And in another place of the same book, more clearly: A glorious river will appear in Zion, flowing through a thirsty land (Isa. 44:3). Along this river, there were many trees on both sides of the bank, like the two instruments, the old and the new, enclosing the flowing river. These trees were abundant, or rather very numerous, perhaps those that Scripture mentions in paradise, abounding with various fruits; and the guiding preceptor and teacher tells the prophet: These waters that come forth, whether into the Galilee of the Gentiles, according to the Septuagint, or (more truly, as it is written in Hebrew) towards the eastern sand hills, and descend to the plains of the desert, or towards Arabia, will enter the sea, or the outlets of the sea, and the waters will be healed. We have already said that water signifies either the grace of baptism or the teaching of the Gospel. If they [the waters] go out from the threshold of the Lord's temple and hold to the Apostolic discipline, they make the barren and infertile hills of sand fruitful and make all the plains and deserts so irrigated that they contain within them the sacrament of the Jericho river (2 Kings 2): which Elisha, representing both the Gospel and the Apostles, healed with Gospel and Apostolic salt, to the extent that where there was barrenness and death before, there would be abundance and life. Not only did they heal the deserts, but they entered the Eastern Sea, namely the Dead Sea in which nothing could be alive, and the most bitter sea, which in Greek is called 'lake of asphalt,' that is, a pool of bitumen. And in a remarkable way, the dead waters are healed by the Gospel waters, which, because they have nothing alive in them, have acquired the name of death. For they did not know Him who says: 'I am the life and the truth' (John XIV, 6). And truly, according to the letter, nothing that breathes and can move can be found in this sea, because of its excessive bitterness: not even small snails, worms, eels, and other types of animals or snakes, whose bodies we can know better than their names. In fact, if the Jordan, swollen by the rain, carries fish there, they immediately die and float on the oily waters. Since these things, as plain speech attests, have no usefulness, even if they happen, as the foolish superstition of the Jews believes, when the river is healed by the spiritual understanding of the Lord, it will have many fish, and all things that the river reaches will live; so that fishermen will stand on the shores from Engedi to En-galim: the former name signifies the source or spring of a young goat, and the latter name signifies the source or spring of young calves. For Engallim is situated at the beginning of the Dead Sea, where the Jordan enters. And Engaddi is situated at its end and termination. But I think that the Dead Sea is the one about which Zacharias speaks: In that day living water will go out from Jerusalem, and half of it toward the eastern sea (Zach. XIV, 8). Daniel also agrees in these words: I saw, and behold, four winds of heaven were struggling on the great sea (Dan. VII, 2). And David: The remarkable waves of the sea (Psal. XCII, 4). And concerning the person of the Savior in the psalm: 'Come into the deep sea and the storm overwhelmed me' (Psalm 68:2). The king of Egypt is also called a dragon according to the same Ezekiel (Ezekiel 32), who dwells in the sea and stirs up the rivers like his horns. And again, 'This great and wide sea' (Psalm 104:25). As long as it does not receive the waters of the river or the torrent, it kills everything it contains. But the Lord, of whom it is said, 'He will strike and heal us after two days; on the third day we shall rise and live in his sight' (Hosea 6:2), He speaks in the same prophet Hosea: 'I have bound up Ephraim, I have taken him up in my arms, and they did not know that I healed them in their corruption' (Hosea 11:9); who was wounded for our sins, and weakened for our iniquities. The discipline of our peace was upon him, and by his lividness, we were healed (Isaiah 53:5). He himself, by his death, healed that sea which is the saltiest and dead by excessive bitterness, who says through Isaiah: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, therefore he has anointed me; he has sent me to preach to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted (Isaiah 61:1). Hence, he cries out through Jeremiah: Return, O apostate sons, and I will heal your regrets (Jeremiah 3:22). For the impatient people said, unable to bear the pain of their wounds any longer: Summer has passed, the harvest is over, and we are not saved. Then the Lord answered them: Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is there no healing for the wound of my people? (Jeremiah 8:22) And Jeremiah himself cried out, saying: Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved. (Jeremiah 17:14). Finally, the angels who were the guardians of the people of the Jews at that time, when the foolish multitude cried out and said, 'His blood be upon us and upon our children' (Matt. XXVII, 25); and, 'The veil of the temple was torn and all the Hebrew sacraments were revealed,' they answered the Lord's command and said, 'We have healed Babylon and she is not cured: let us abandon her' (Jerem. LI, 9), the city of confusion and vices. And Josephus also tells in his history that after the Lord was crucified and the veil of the temple was torn or the threshold of the temple was shattered, a voice was heard in the innermost part of the temple of heavenly powers, saying, Let us go out from these seats. This whole statement is not made in vain, but necessarily, because the Dead Sea, when the river of the Lord flows into it, is said to be healed. Above this sea, at Engaddi, there is an eye and a fountain of goats, which are always offered for sin at Engallim, the fountain of the calves, which are sacrificed to the Lord and imitate the calf carrying its horns and hooves, which is sacrificed at the altar in the figure of the Savior. They will be fishermen, to whom the Lord Jesus speaks: Come to me, and I will make you fishers of men (Matt. 4:19): of whom also Jeremiah says: Behold, I will send fishermen (Jer. 16:16). And there will be many species, or rather genera, of fish in the once dead sea. These fish were extracted to the right side at the command of the Lord by Peter, and there were 595, one hundred and fifty-three: so that because of their multitude, the nets were torn (John 21). However, those who have written about the natures and properties of animals, and have learned about fishing in both Latin and Greek languages, such as Oppian of Cilicia, a most learned poet, say that there are one hundred and fifty-three genera of fish, all of which were caught by the apostles, and nothing remained uncaptured, as both noble and lowly, rich and poor, and every kind of human is drawn from the sea of this world for salvation. Moreover, what follows shows indirectly that on its shores and in its marshes, or in those areas that extend beyond the shores, the waters will not be healed. It indicates that those who are not in Noah's ark will perish during the reign of the flood, and those whom the river does not touch will not receive healing. Instead, they will be given to salt flats, according to what is written: When a pestilence strikes, the foolish is wiser (Prov. 19:25). For the examples of the wicked educate the good. Whether they are given in the saltworks, according to what is written in the Gospel: Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men (Matt. V, 13): so that they may forever lack fruits and vigor. This is also demonstrated by a city that is sprinkled with salt after ruin. But above the torrent or river, on its banks on both sides, every fruitful tree, or as all have translated with one voice, βρώσιμον (Al. βρῶμα), which gives food and nourishment, and which can be eaten, is called in the Hebrew language Machal () and nothing according to the Seventy shall grow old in it, but its fruits will be renewed daily, whether its leaves do not wither, and its fruit is not lacking; according to what is written in the first psalm. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither (Psalm 1:3). He says that each month it will produce its first-fruits, or as it is written in the Septuagint: Its fruit will give its first-fruits in its renewal; so that all the fruits of the believers may be first-fruits, and each month may be assigned to each apostle. But this will happen because its waters will come from the sanctuary: Lest we think it is the banks, or trees, or months that provide the abundance of so much fruitfulness, it states the causes and brings them forth: Because its waters will come from the sanctuary." } Therefore, it is not of the one who wills or of the one who runs, but of God who shows mercy (Rom. IX, 16). The chief among all these trees is the tree of life, which is understood as wisdom, about which it is written: The tree of life is for all who believe in it (Prov. III). And that which is said: Its fruits shall be for food, and its leaves for medicine, indicates the mysteries of divine books: one of which pertains to the letter, the other to the spirit: so that we may understand the simple words in the leaves, and the hidden meaning in the fruits. For just as the knowledge of the Scriptures leads to the kingdom of heaven, and provides us with the bread that says, I am the bread that came down from heaven (John. 6:41): so its leaves contain moral doctrine, and give healing, so that they may heal the wounds of sinners. For the leaves which are called Ale in Hebrew, because of the similarity of sound and meaning, were translated into Greek as ascension, which itself can be understood in such a way that after the nourishment of the fruits, we ascend to heavenly things through the admonitions of words.


<h2 id='tocuniq351'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Verse 13, 14.) Thus says the Lord God: This is the boundary where you shall possess the land in twelve tribes of Israel, for Joseph has a double portion. But you shall possess it each equally like his brother, to whom I raised my hand to give to your fathers: and this land shall fall to you as possession. Because we have said that Joseph has a double portion, it was transferred by the LXX, an increase of the portion. For Joseph means 'increase,' signifying an understanding of the matter and confusing the reader's mind. For when the tribe of Levi was subtracted and given over to temple sacrifices, there remained eleven tribes, of which Joseph was divided into two, Ephraim and Manasseh. They said to Joshua, son of Nun, 'Why have you given me just one portion and one share, when I am of such a great multitude and the Lord has blessed me?' To which Joshua responded: If you are a numerous people, go up into the forest and cut out for yourself the spaces in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaim, because the possession of the mountain of Ephraim is narrow for you. And again: Joshua said to the house of Ephraim and Manasseh: You are a numerous people and of great strength; you shall not have one portion, but you shall go to the mountain, and cut out for yourself and clear the spaces to dwell, and you shall be able to proceed further, when you have driven out the Canaanite, whom you say has iron chariots and is the strongest. We say this for a reason, because now the Scripture mentions Joseph, that is, Ephraim and Manasseh, having a double portion. However, each tribe receives equal portions according to its size, dividing the land not by the will of the one dividing, but by a lot that is in the power of the Lord. Finally, even Joshua himself, who was the one dividing the land, did not reserve a separate portion for himself, lest he appear to have chosen the best part; but he received Thamnath-sareh in the hill country of Ephraim from the leaders of all the tribes.


<h2 id='tocuniq352'>(Vers. 15 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 15 onwards) This is the boundary of the land on the north side, from the great sea, the route that goes to Ethalon, Sadada, Emath, Berotha, Sabarim, which is in the middle of Damascus and the border of Emath: the courtyard of Thicon (or house of Atthicon), which is near the borders of Auran (or Auranitis). And the boundary will extend from the sea to the courtyard of Enon (or Seraranan), the boundary of Damascus, and from the north to the north boundary of Emath, the northern side. In the description of the land of the Holy Land of the twelve tribes, by Joshua the son of Nun, and which is now commanded by Ezekiel, the difference is that there the land is divided among the tribes by lot, whereas here it is delegated by the command of the Lord. In the book of Numbers (Num. XXXIV), in which the entire promised land is divided into four regions in a brief discourse, the description of the Northern region is as follows: Starting from the great sea, they will begin at the northern boundary and go up to the highest mountain, from which you will come to Emath, and as far as the borders of Sadada. They will go along the borders of Zephrona and the town of Enam, also known as Aser Enon. And the Hebrews say that the northern boundary begins from the Great Sea, which borders Palestine, Phoenicia, and Syria, which is called Coele, and extends to the shores of Cilicia, and stretches through Egypt to Libya. As for the statement, 'The borders reach up to the highest mountain' (Num. XXXIV, 7), the same Hebrews believe that it either refers to Mount Amanus or Mount Taurus, which seems more likely to us. From there, it is said, you will come to Emath, which is now called Epiphania, with its name changed by the most cruel tyrant Antiochus: for it had the nickname Epiphanes. He says that they will go as far as the borders of Sadada, a place that is now located in the reading of Ezekiel, and will reach the borders of Zephrona, which is a city known today as Zephyrium in Cilicia. As for what follows: 'And the village of Enam,' which is written in Hebrew as 'Aser Enon,' or 'Enan,' this present place contains it. And for now, it suffices to briefly summarize the history, and to connect the description of both Numbers and Ezekiel together: so that the wise reader can understand which places they mentioned, whether they are the same, nearby, or different. Now that we have interpreted the names individually, let us follow the anagoge, and with the help of the Lord, let us discuss what seems to us in each case. Ethalon is interpreted as the beginning of mourning; Sadada, his side, understand it as from the side, not from the width; Emath, anger, which is called χόλος in Greek; Berotha, wells; Sabarim, the circuit of mountains; Damascus, the blood of a bag and a kiss, or a cup. But Thicon, the house or atrium, is interpreted by Symmachus as the central atrium, which leads to the borders of Auran. Therefore, Thicon signifies the wrath of Auranitides, which in Greek is translated as Auran, seventy times. Aser, however, Enon, which is the border of Damascus, is called the atrium of the fountain in our language. Therefore, the northern region begins from the great sea through the way of Ethalon, which means the cradle of sorrow, and through penance it comes to Sadada, where there is a declination on the side. For we understand the impending Emath, which is the wrath of God: or Emath, with the truth being discovered, the wells of Berotha are opened to us, which were dug by the princes, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: and after a long circuit, we reach the mountains of Sabarim, which are situated between Damascus, which means the blood of the sackcloth, and the border of Emath, as we have previously mentioned, the truth. For just as we turn away from impending evils through sorrow and avoid them by sidestepping, so after the blood and the bloody tunic of life, before we reach the borders of Emath, we go around and come to the mountains, of which it is written: Mountains surround it, and the Lord surrounds his people (Psalm 124:2). This place is called the court of Thicon, which means the middle court, as Symmachus interpreted, near the borders of Auran, which means anger, and let us say with the prophet: I will endure the anger of the Lord, for I have sinned against Him (Micah 4:9). And from the sea to the boundaries of Damascus, where the apostle Paul (Acts IX) saw the light in darkness from the Jewish fury and the shedding of blood of the Church, and taking up the garment of old persecution, he preached the Gospel in order to arrive at the courtyard of the eternal fountain, and being placed in the North, he grasped the boundary of truth.

<h2 id='tocuniq353'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(v. 18) Moreover, the eastern boundary shall be from the middle of Auram, and from the middle of Damascum, and from the middle of Galaad, and from the middle of the land of Israel, following the Jordan River into the eastern sea. (Vulgate adds: and also) That is the eastern boundary. As it is written in the Book of Numbers: From there they shall measure the boundaries against the eastern boundary from the town of Enan, that is, Aser Enon, as far as Sephama; and from Sephama the boundaries shall descend to Rebla, opposite the spring; from there they shall continue eastward to the Sea of Chenereth and extend along the Jordan River until they finally reach the sea. He had said before: And the border will be from the sea to Enon Aser, the border of Damascus (Num. XXXIV, 10, 11). From the northern end, that is, the court of Enan, the borders extend next to the book of Numbers to Sephama, which the Hebrews call Apama: and from Apama the borders descend to Rebla, which is now called Antioch in Syria. And so that you know that Rebla signifies this city, which is now the most noble in Coele Syria, it follows: Opposite the fountain, which is clearly signified as Daphne: from which fountain the aforementioned city enjoys very abundant waters. However, this hearth was built by Gnaeus Pompeius, who was the first to conquer Judea under Roman rule, with military force; and according to the fable of the poets, it acquired the name 'Daphne' because of the laurels and cypresses, which are very abundant trees in that place. From there, it is said, the boundaries extend towards the Eastern region to the Sea of Chinnereth, as far as the Sea of Tiberias. The body of water is called a 'sea' because it has about 600 fresh waters, according to the language of the Scriptures, which refer to collections of water as seas. And the borders, he says, will stretch as far as the Jordan, and they will be closed off at the sea, either the Dead Sea, or as others think, the tongue of the Red Sea, on whose shore Ahila is located, where the Legion now resides, and the Roman garrison. This is stated in the book of Numbers. But according to Ezekiel, in the midst of Auran: which is the city of Damascus in the wilderness, and in the midst of Galaad, which is connected to the hills of Mount Lebanon, it fell into the territory of Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh, and it is behind Phoenicia and Arabia: to this mountain Jacob arrived, coming from Haran, and was captured by Laban (Gen. XXXI), about which Jeremiah also speaks: Galaad, you are my beginning of Lebanon (Jeremiah XXII), which Galaad, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, took from the region of the Amorites; and the boundary of this region is the Jordan River, and the Eastern Sea, which in this place they understand to be the Dead Sea, not the tongue of the Red Sea. Let us speak according to the tropology: After the boundaries of the North, through Ethalon, and Sadada, and Berotha, and also Sabarim, Thicon, and Auran, and Damascus, and the courtyard of Enon, it reaches the eastern region as far as Emath: from the midst of the anger of Auran, and from the midst of the blood of Damascus, namely of penance, and from the midst of Gilead, which is interpreted as revelation, or hill of testimony, it shows the hope of salvation after anger and penance: and from the midst of the land of Israel, which contains the vision of peace, it reaches the sweetest streams of the Jordan: which, far from the separated sea, achieves the light of the East, so that it ends with the river Jordan, which is interpreted as the stream of judgment, and the boundary of the East. But what is set forth in the LXX as φοινικῶνος, that is, of palm grove, is not found in Hebrew: for which reason we have translated it as metiemini: And there is a clear error, because, deceived by the similarity of the letters, they read Thamorru instead of Thamoddu.

<h2 id='tocuniq354'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19.) But the southern plague extends from Thamar to the waters of contradiction (or to the waters of Mariboth, for this word 'contradictio' or 'διαδικασμὸς' means disputes). Also, Cades and the torrent, up to the great sea (Vulgate: plague). This is the 601st southern plague. It is written in the Book of Numbers as follows: It shall begin from the wilderness of Sin, which is near Edom, and it shall have borders against the eastern sea (some versions add 'saltiest'), which shall go around the southern plague by the ascent of the Scorpion, so that they pass by Senna and reach as far as the south to Kadesbarne. From there, the boundaries will go to a city named Addar, and they shall extend to Asemona. And the boundary shall go in a circuit from Asemona to the torrent of Egypt, and it shall end at the shore of the great sea (Num. 34:3-5). This briefly signifies (so that we do not seem to have passed from the exposition of Numbers to the very broad occasion of Ezekiel) to go from the solitude of Sin, which is near Edom, and to go around the boundary of the Red Sea, and through the ascent of Scorpio, and through Senna and Kadesh-barnea, and the courtyard of Addar, and to arrive from Asemona to the river of Egypt, which flows into the sea near the city of Rhinocorura. But this boundary of the southern, that is, the southern, region begins at Thamar, which is a city in the wilderness, which Solomon also built with marvelous works, and is now called Palmyra. And it is called Thamar in Hebrew, which in our language means "palm", until the waters of contradiction at Kadesh, which is certainly in the desert, and the river enters the great sea, which extends along the shores of Egypt and Palestine, and this is the southern region towards the South. After the plague, therefore, of the North and the East, when the sun of justice has risen for us, we receive the Midday, when their light is poured upon us from above, and, like Abraham, we enter into a feast (Gen. 19), and we are intoxicated with the wine that gladdens the heart of man (Ps. 103), like Joseph and his brothers (Gen. 43). But this possession begins, and these are the boundaries, namely, Thamar and the palm of victory over vices, up to the waters of contradiction. For virtue is always contradicted. Hence, also, the Jews who opposed Paul in the preaching of the Gospel claim that it is contradicted throughout the whole world. And in the Gospel we read Simeon saying: 'This child is destined for the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against.' Every contradiction, however, is a holiness, which is interpreted as 'the holy place,' as the Psalmist says: 'The Lord will shake the wilderness of Kadesh.' This means that it did not originally have the holiness of the Lord but was shaken and moved in order to receive God as a guest, who says: 'On whom does my Spirit rest, except on the humble and quiet one who trembles at my words?' The desert of Cades, all the way to the Great Sea in the south, is a torrid region, as we have said before; it does not have rain from the land, but rather has rain collected from the sky, with a variety of different virtues.

<h2 id='tocuniq355'>(Vers. 20.)</h2>

(Verse 20) And the plague of the sea, the great sea from the border in a straight line, until you come to Emath, this is the plague of the sea. About which the Book of Numbers writes more clearly and briefly. But the western plague will begin from the great sea, and it will conclude at the very end, that is, from sea to sea: namely, to the torrent of Rhinocorura, which flows into the sea, up to the place which is opposite the city of Emath in Syria, about which we have spoken above. But the setting sun, according to the laws of tropology, is always in the sea: always in the salt and waves, where daily shipwrecks occur, and the deaths of the wretched, and the loss of riches and goods, and yet when we have endured all these with patience, we come straight to Emath, that is, to the truth of the Lord, who, having conquered persecutions, has promised us eternal rewards.

<h2 id='tocuniq356'>(Vers. 21 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 21 onwards) And you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel, and you shall allot it as an inheritance to yourselves and to the strangers who have joined you, who have begotten children among you. They shall be to you as native-born among the children of Israel; they shall share in the inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. However, in whatever tribe the stranger resides, there you shall give him his inheritance,' says the Lord God. By this chapter we learn (and it escapes the eyebrow of the Jews) that there is no division between the people of Israel and the Gentiles. For if the foreigners and aliens come with those who are from the people of Israel, that is, the natives, the land is divided; there is no doubt that it is the same inheritance of the people of the Gentiles and the people of the Jews: if, however, they convert to the worship of the God of Israel, which has the proper name Christian, having the Jews with the letter of the Law, and for us the spirit: and having them holding onto the outer forms, and for us the one who is written on the pages. And with Moses, the land is divided by lot; but here, as we have said, it is delegated by the judgment of the Lord: and there is one possession for the stranger and for the Israelite, and in each tribe an inheritance is given, at the command of the Lord God.

(Chapter 48, verses 1 and following) And these are the names of the tribes, starting from the northern borders along the road to Ethalon: 603 Emath, Atrium Enon, the boundary of Damascus to the north near Emath, and from the east side there will be the sea, Dan as one tribe. And from the boundary of Dan to the eastern side up to the seashore, Aser as one tribe. And above the boundary of Aser from the eastern side up to the seashore, Nephthali as one tribe. And above the boundary of Nephthali from the east side up to the seashore, Manasse as one tribe. And over the territory of Manasseh from the east side to the west side, Ephraim one. And over the territory of Ephraim from the east side to the west side, Reuben one. And over the territory of Reuben from the east side to the west side, Judah one. The possession of the holy land is described, both according to the present prophecy of Ezekiel and according to the book of Numbers: now the possession of each tribe from the east side to the west side, that is, the sea, is described: and they first receive their borders from the north near the way of Ethalon going to Emath, the courtyard or Aser-Enon to the north border of Damascus near Emath, about which we have already spoken. But first, the tribe of Dan begins; secondly, Aser; thirdly, Nephthali; fourthly, Manasseh; fifthly, Ephraim; sixthly, Reuben; seventhly, Judah, which is on the left side, and the number seven is completed. Then the first fruits of the priests, and the Levites, and the sanctuary of the Lord in the midst, and the holy of holies. Also, the city itself is described on each side as a square, having four thousand and five hundred rods. The suburban areas of the priests and Levites are also described in order, along with the possession of the prince. And again, on the right side, there follow five tribes from the same direction of the East, up to the direction of the West, of which the first is Benjamin: the second is Simeon, having its own special possession, and not mixed with Judah as before: the third is Issachar: the fourth is Zebulun: the fifth is Gad: and there are three gates of the city on each side: and the name of the city is written on the gold plate on the high priest's forehead. We will discuss all of these in their proper places. And it should be noted that the forty-eight cities, which are given in the Book of Numbers to the Levites for dwelling with their suburbs, the names of which are given here, and the cities of refuge, are omitted: of which three are beyond the Jordan, namely Bosor, and Ramoth, and Gaulon, which are given to the two and a half tribes: and three are within the Jordan, namely Kadesh, and Shechem, and Kiriath-arba. For there was no need in the mystical description and the habitation of the saints and the perfect conversation for the aids of the fugitives to be described, which Israel still needed while situated in the land, and hastening to come to this city through many labors and dangers, and saying in each holy place: I am a stranger and a sojourner like all my fathers (Ps. 38:13). And in another place: I dwelt with them that make peace. My soul hath been long a sojourner.

<h2 id='tocuniq358'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Verse 8, 9.) And over the border of Judah from the east side to the west side, there shall be firstfruits which you shall separate, twenty-five thousand in length and in width: as every one of the parts from the east side to the west side, and there shall be a sanctuary in its midst. The firstfruits which you shall separate to the Lord, twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in width. It is superfluous to discuss at length and to labor again on those things on which we have already labored, as if they were not spoken. After describing the boundaries of the seven tribes from East to West, the first fruits are mentioned; the width of which is said to be twenty-five thousand stadia: but the length, like the individual tribes, extends from East to the sea, the exact measurement of which is uncertain. Because the measurement of each tribe is not described. However, if the width is twenty-five thousand stadia, it is presumed that the length is much greater, as it is always greater than the width. In the middle of the sanctuary, however, there is placed beside the first fruits, which are separated for the Lord, a length of twenty-five thousand cubits and a width of ten thousand cubits. Reading this, I can say nothing else but that of the Apostle: O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and how inscrutable His ways! (Rom. 11:33) And in another place: That you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, to know also the surpassing knowledge and charity of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God. (Ephes. 3:18) But the number twenty-five refers to the senses, of which it is said: You shall possess divine sense, and ten thousand refers to perfect and complete virtue, which reaches from the Ten Commandments of the Old Testament to the sacrament of the Gospel, as we have explained briefly before and as we will now remind you in part. For if you add one number to four, you will reach ten, and thus it will happen that the old Testament is contained within the new, and the new is expanded within the old.

<h2 id='tocuniq359'>(Vers. 10 seqq.)</h2>

(Vers. 10 seqq.) But these shall be the sacred precincts of the priests: toward the north, twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand cubits in breadth; toward the west, ten thousand cubits in breadth; toward the east, ten thousand cubits in breadth; and toward the south, twenty-five thousand cubits in length. The sanctuary of the Lord shall be in the midst of it. It shall belong to the consecrated priests, the descendants of Zadok, who kept my charge and did not go astray when the people of Israel went astray, as the Levites did. And there shall be firstfruits of the firstfruits of the land, a most holy offering, according to the boundaries of the Levites. The four boundaries of the sanctuary are described by the four cardinal points, which do not pertain to the people, nor to the common crowd, nor to the Levites, who are of lower rank, but specifically pertain to the worship of the priests: namely the North, and the West, and the East, and the South. And the order of the progress is narrated in parts, that by leaving the cold of the North, we may come to the West: so that vices may set for us and perish, and thence we may pass to the East: and with the rising of the sun of justice for us, we may come to the South, in which the most shining and perfect light is: and both from the North to the sea, and from the East to the South, let there be twenty-five thousand in length and ten thousand in width: so that the same measure of length and width may be preserved everywhere. But the sanctuary, that is, the Temple of the Lord, will be in the midst of the first fruits of the Priests, and will be surrounded on all sides with equal parts. And what he had said: These, however, will be the first fruits of the sanctuary of the Priests, so that all the Priests would not claim the possession of this place and the ceremonies to be observed with a common name, he specifically adds: The sanctuary will be for the descendants of Zadok, who is interpreted as just; of whom it is said: The Lord is just, and He loves justice; His countenance beholds uprightness (Psalm 10:8). Regarding Sadoc, the Seventy write Sadduc. This Sadoc speaks in the Gospel: For the Father does not judge anyone, but has given all judgment to the Son (John 5:22). And about this, under the mystical name of Solomon, the Prophet sings: O God, give your judgment to the king, and your justice to the king's son (Psalm 71:1). But those priests of the Lord will possess the sanctuary and will guard his ceremonies. They did not stray when the sons of Israel and the Levites strayed, as discussed earlier. They do not offer victims, but, content with the privilege of their name and the humility of their error, they always speak from the heart: I acknowledge my iniquity, and my sin is always before me (Psalm 50:4). May this priestly rank hear, and, overcome by the heat of the Arian persecution, and later embracing the true faith, may it submit its neck to power so as not to lack resources, even if it is not expelled from the temple, if it holds onto a certain shadow and image of its former name, and does not, lying on its back, belch out delights, as if it were spotless and pure, vomit out the nausea of its own incompetence and babbling barbarism. There will be, he says, first fruits from the first fruits of the earth for them, that is, for the priests: and for those who did not stray, when the children of Israel and the Levites strayed. But the firstfruits of the firstfruits, like the tithes of the tithes, and the most holy things, were to be given to the Levites, according to the boundary of the Levites. For the Levites have the areas adjoining the priests, but they cannot possess the center of it, that is, the territory itself.

<h2 id='tocuniq360'>(Vers. 13 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 13 and following) But the Levites shall also have a portion along the border of the priests, twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand cubits in width. The entire length shall be twenty-five thousand cubits and the width ten thousand cubits. They shall not sell any of it, nor exchange it, nor transfer the firstfruits of the land, for they are sacred to the Lord. The remaining five thousand cubits in width, along the twenty-five thousand, shall be for common use: for the city and for dwellings, and the city shall be in the middle of it. What we translate as profane, Aquila translated as βέβηλον, Symmachus and Theodotio as λαἳκὸν; the LXX said προτείχισμα which we can call an antemurale. Profane, however, is both common and secular, that is, common to all people and widely permitted to dwell. But what the LXX said, 'It shall not be measured, it shall not be taken away,' is clear that it means what we said, 'It shall not be changed, it shall not be transferred,' has no meaning. The possession of the Levites is also described, which is indeed adjacent to the boundaries of the priests, and has the same length and width for the multitude of Levites, which it has in the belly of the priests, but nevertheless uses its own terms, and understands itself to be separated from the priestly rank: to shake off the pride of the ministers, who, ignorant of the humility of their own status, swell up beyond the priests, that is, the elders, and consider dignity not based on merit, but on wealth. Certainly, the one who is the first among the ministers, because he preaches to the people individually and does not depart from the side of the Pontiff, considers it an injustice if he is ordained a presbyter. And he does not remember that he is a minister of the tables and widows, entrusted not only to the service and ministry of the priests, but also of the widows and the poor. And, he says, they shall not sell it, nor shall they exchange it, so that the eternal possession of the Levitical distribution may remain, nor shall the worth of dignity be overcome by price, nor shall we transfer it from one to another: because those things which are sanctified to the Lord belong not to those to whom they have been given, but to Him in whose name they are possessed. But the remaining five thousand in latitude, by twenty-five thousand, is understood to be in length, will be profane to the city: so that it is permitted for all the Israelites to dwell, and for all the common people; not because they are unclean, or because anything in the habitation of the Holy Land is considered contaminated, rotten and dirty; but because besides the priests, it is allowed for everyone to dwell in them. By this we understand that all the things we mention regarding the senses, that is, regarding bodily pleasures, which we experience through sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste, are profane and do not possess the sanctity of the temple, nor the priesthood, but of common worthiness. But the city will be in the middle, of which it is written: The stream of water makes the city of God joyful (Ps. 46:4). And: A city set on a hill cannot be hidden (Matt. 5:14), about which we will speak in what follows. Προτείχισμα, meaning a front wall, and διάστημα, meaning a space, which the Septuagint translated as suburban, we do not know what meaning they have in this place.

<h2 id='tocuniq361'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16) And the measurements of its wall are five hundred and four thousand on the north side, and on the south side the same, and on the east side the same, and on the west side the same. And it says: 'And these are its measurements,' to be understood, of the city. For at the end of the previous chapter it is written: 'And the city shall be in the middle of it,' that is, of the land. And it begins firstly from the North and places the Southern side directly opposite. And it restores equality: so that it places the Western side opposite the Eastern side, that is, the sea: and each side of the city has four thousand five hundred rods; which approximately make eleven thousand five hundred and eighty-five paces, so that, all together, the city, as is written at the end of this book, has a circumference of eighteen thousand rods, which make forty-four thousand three hundred and forty paces. And the forty-fourth Psalm, which is titled 'For those who shall be changed,' and belongs to the sons of Corah, that is, to the beloved of the Lord, or as Aquila interpreted, 'For lilies,' and Symmachus 'For flowers,' contains the sacraments of the Church, which is the city of the Lord, of which it is written in the same psalm: The queen stood on thy right hand in gilded clothing, surrounded with variety (Ps. 44:10). And again: All the glory of the king's daughter is within (Ibid.,14): so that she may not be like whitened sepulchers on the outside, but may wash all things within and without with the sprinkling of martyrdom (Matt. 23)." } And when we have departed from the North, with a very cold wind, we cross to the South, and after the rising of the light of knowledge within us, we fear the setting of courage, not at all considering the past but the future, not having a certain possession of virtue, but saying daily in prayer: Lead us not into temptation, which we cannot bear (Matthew 86:13).

<h2 id='tocuniq362'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) The suburbs of the city on the north side will be two hundred and fifty, and on the south side two hundred and fifty, and on the east side two hundred and fifty, and on the sea side two hundred and fifty. As for the suburbs, which are called in Hebrew Magras, they have again a distance of seventy cubits, that is, a space. And what is said, two hundred and fifty on each side, implies reeds, which are six cubits and one palm long, and on each side they make six hundred and seventeen and a little less steps, and in total one thousand reeds, having two thousand four hundred and sixty-eight steps: these distances surround the walls of the city in a circuit, so as to separate the city from the rest. From this it is clear that none of these spaces have the right to be used for the activities of the city and the collection of fruits, but they are intended to be free from the use and work of humans, so that the areas surrounding the city walls, the spontaneously growing shrubs and herbs, and everything else that the land produces, may have beauty.

But the remaining length along the holy district shall be three miles on each side. Ten thousand shall be to the east, and ten thousand to the west. It shall be equal in length to the tribal portions, with the holy district and the sanctuary in the middle of it. The produce of the city shall be for food for those who serve the city. And the ones who serve the city, those who come from all the tribes of Israel, shall cultivate it. The entire tribute of twenty-five thousand by twenty-five thousand shall be set apart as a holy district along with the property of the city. He wants the description of the holy city and its suburbs, as well as the remaining portion of the sanctuary to be divided into 10,000 plots in the East and another 10,000 plots in the West. These plots are to be assigned to those who work for the city for various purposes, whatever the city may need. The purpose is to ensure that the workers, who either build the city walls or restore the interrupted and ruined structures, are provided with a space of 610 (units) where they can sow and eat the produce of the land. This way, the city will have its own cultivation and well-maintained buildings, which can be repaired when needed." } And this (i.e., this thing) is not only contained in Israel or in the possession of the holy land with a spiritual mystery of the Church, but we also approve that it is happening under the Roman rule, so that certain villages belong to the rights of the cities, either by royal generosity or through the inheritances and donations of many, so that buildings are not gradually collapsing and public buildings, which are an ornament to the city, are not worn out by long neglect. But the workers, he says, or those who serve in the works of the city, will be from all the tribes of Israel, so that no one may consider themselves exempt from the work of the city, but all may eagerly build up the Church. We read that the same was done in the tabernacle, so that, according to the variety of their strengths, some would offer gold and silver, scarlet, fine linen, and purple, and various and diverse coverings; others would offer skins and hair of goats. And although the gifts were diverse according to the quality of their substance, there was one reward for those who gave: indeed, a greater reward for those who offered little, but more according to their strengths, as an example of the widow who, being poor, sent two small gifts into the treasury; she was praised by the judgment of the Lord, who said: Truly, I say to you, this widow, in her poverty, has contributed more than all the others. For all these others have contributed out of their abundance to the gifts of God, but she has given out of what she lacked, all the sustenance she had. Therefore, as we have said about the works of the city, it is necessary to briefly summarize that all the firstfruits of the sanctuary and the possession of the city, when calculated together, amount to two thousand four hundred and sixty-three, and a third part. For if twenty-five thousand reeds, which are six cubits and one palm in length, make ours, that is, Roman sixty, and one thousand, and six hundred and sixty-seven paces; there is no doubt that when multiplied by four, this exceeds the previous number. From which we understand that all things are to be understood spiritually, the possession of the Church is much wider than it once was in Judah, who did not even receive a share of the holy land: but they received forty-eight cities from each tribe, not the full possession but dwelling and habitation: so too the laity, although they have not reached the level of priesthood and Levite, nevertheless if they work in the city of the Lord, they partake of the holy land, the land of the meek, and the land of believers, of whom one said: I believe to see the goodness of the Lord, in the land of the living (Ps. 27:13).


<h2 id='tocuniq363'>(Vers. 21, 22.)</h2>

(Verse 21, 22.) But the rest will belong to the prince from all sides, whether from here or from there (Vulgate is silent whether from here or from there) of the firstfruits of the sanctuary and the possession of the city from the east boundary (or opposite face) of twenty-five thousand firstfruits until the eastern boundary, but also from the sea (Vulgate to the sea) from the east boundary (or opposite face) of twenty-five thousand until the boundary of the sea, likewise, it will be in the portion of the prince, and the firstfruits of the sanctuary and the sanctuary of the temple will be in its midst. Also, concerning the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city in the middle of the prince's territory, it will be between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, and it will belong to the prince. It has been previously discussed in more detail about this prince and how he would receive as much as one tribe alone. But now we learn something else, that whatever is left from all the tribes, only he will receive it, so that no tribe will fail to offer gifts to the prince, not from anywhere else, but from the firstfruits that serve the temple, the sanctuary, and the assigned parts of the city. For this is what it says: On the opposite side, or facing the eastern boundary of the twenty-five thousand offering, or facing the boundary of the sea, there shall be an offering between the seven and five tribes, and within that offering shall be the city and its suburbs, and in the midst of the city shall be the sanctuary of the temple. And concerning the possession of the Levites and the remaining possession of the city, whatever is left shall be assigned to the prince; and the furthest part shall belong to the seven tribes adjacent to the offering, the city, and the temple in the tribe of Judah; and the furthest part of the five tribes, with the same rights as described above, shall belong to the prince in the tribe of Benjamin, that furthest part itself. Since the sacraments of Holy Scripture are wonderful and worthy of contemplation, they should be more pondered than spoken about (Dan. XXXII). In the former division of the land beyond the Jordan by Moses, the land was divided among the two tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh (Joshua, XIII). But across the Jordan, by Joshua son of Nun and Eleazar son of Aaron, Judah possessed the land to the south (Joshua, XV); and Ephraim and the half-tribe of Manasseh possessed the land to the north (Joshua, XVIII). Then, after sending scouts through each tribe and receiving a report on the description of the land, Joshua and Eleazar gave Benjamin, next to Judah from the south, and next to Ephraim and the half-tribe of Manasseh, their inheritance. The second tribe, Simeon, received their inheritance within the tribe of Judah, in order to fulfill what was written about Levi and Simeon: 'I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel' (Genesis 49:7). The third tribe, Zebulun, received Galilee, where Mount Tabor is located. The fourth [lot falls to] Issachar, where Jezreel is, as far as the Jordan. The fifth [lot falls to] Asher, as far as Mount Carmel, which overlooks the great sea, and Tyre and Sidon. The sixth [lot falls to] Naphtali, in Galilee as far as the Jordan, where Tiberias, which was once called Chinnereth, is. The seventh [lot falls to] Dan, as far as Joppa, where the towers of Ailon, and Selebi, and Emmaus, which is now called Nicopolis, are. Although we will read later that they took for themselves the city of Laish, in the tribe of Dan, which is now called Paneas. Since this is the case, and there is such a difference between the previous description of the tribes and the one currently held, let us consider how both in the present description and in the past, the city and the Temple were placed between the tribe of Judah and Benjamin. In the previous description, Judah was in the south and Benjamin was in the north, but now it is the opposite, with Judah in the north and Benjamin in the south. After them comes Simeon, then Issachar, and then Zebulun, and fifth is Gad, as it is stated in what follows; for it is written:

<h2 id='tocuniq364'>(Vers. 23 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 23 and following) And to the rest of the tribes, from the Eastern border to the Western border, Benjamin received one portion. And next to the border of Benjamin, from the Eastern border to the Western border, Simeon received one portion. And along the border of Simeon, from the Eastern border to the Western border, Issachar received one portion. And along the border of Issachar, from the Eastern border to the Western border, Zebulun received one portion. And along the border of Zebulun, from the Eastern border to the sea, Gad received one portion. And the border shall extend from Gad to the south toward the Negeb. Then the boundary shall go from Thamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, and from there along the Great Sea. This shall be the land that you shall allot as an inheritance among the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions, declares the Lord God. What is set for the one portion and for the other is always the same, either a part, or a possession, or an inheritance; though the Eagle and Symmachus interpret it as a neutral gender τὸ ὅριον, which means boundary. And it should be noted briefly, in the last five tribes, the tribe of Gad, which was mentioned in the previous description beyond the Jordan, is placed in the same area that Judas previously held, namely the southern regions, and its boundary stretches from Thamar to the waters of Meribah-kadesh, as an inheritance opposite the Great Sea. Thamar itself, which we have already mentioned, is now called Palmyra, and was built by Solomon. For in Hebrew, a palm is called "Thamar," and some believe that it got this name because there are many palm trees there. And what follows: Even to the waters of contradiction at Cades, the inheritance against the great sea; for which seventy translated from Theman, and the water of Mariboth, (also called Marimoth) at Cades, the inheritance even to the great sea, it must be observed in Hebrew that the same word Nehela is ambiguous, and can mean both inheritance and torrent: and here it should be taken more as torrent than inheritance. For this is the torrent that enters the great sea of Rhinocorura, as we have already said. But the city which in the book of Joshua is called Kadesh-Barnea is in the desert, which extends to the city Petra. However, Mariboth, which is interpreted as 'contradiction', is not the name of a place, as many believe, but of waters, in which the people contradicted the Lord, and Moses offended God, as the Psalm says: They provoked him at the waters of contradiction, and Moses suffered for their sake (Ps. 105:32). And the entire inheritance of the holy land is bounded on the southern side by the borders of Egypt, Rhinocorura, and the river. And because Gad is interpreted as temptation, we pass from his possession of palm trees to the waters of contradiction until Kadesh, which is interpreted as holy, so that we may understand that even after the victory of the world we must be careful and always in fear, and remember that verse: Temptation is the life of men on earth (Job. VII, 1); and to attain holiness, despite the adversaries who oppose, and to obtain victory in such a way that we may contemplate the nearby stream full of rain.


<h2 id='tocuniq365'>(Vers. 30 seqq.)</h2>

(Verse 30 and following) And going out of the city from the Northern side, you will measure five thousand and four thousand. And the city gates from the tribes of Israel: three gates from the North. Gate of Reuben, one; gate of Judah, one; gate of Levi, one. And on the Eastern side, five thousand and four thousand, and three gates. Gate of Joseph, one; gate of Benjamin, one; gate of Dan, one. And on the Southern side, five thousand and four thousand you will measure, and three gates. Porta Simeonis, one: porta Issachar, one: porta Zabulon, one. And on the West side, five hundred and four thousand, and their gates three. Porta Cad, one: porta Aser, one: porta Nephthali, one: around eighteen thousand and the name of the city from that day, and the Lord is there. The measurement of the city, which has on each side four thousand and five hundred rods, was mentioned earlier: which makes eighteen thousand rods, as is also stated in the present chapter, that is, forty four thousand paces, and three hundred and forty paces. Now it is written that each side was eleven thousand and eighty-five paces, and that there were three gates, which Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotus call διεξόδους, and the Seventy call διεκβολὰς: we have interpreted them as exits and entrances of the city. And first, it should be briefly noted that the same tribes were encamped in a circle around the tabernacle, so that on the east side were Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun, the sons of Leah; and on the south side were Reuben, Simeon, and Gad, the two sons of Leah, and the third son of Leah's maidservant Zilpah. But towards the west are Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin, indeed the two sons of Rachel; for Joseph, from the tribe of Levi, which is appointed for sacrifices, was divided into the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. But towards the north are Dan, Asher, and Naphtali, of whom the first and third sons are the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant, and the second son is the son of Zilpah, Leah's maidservant, who are of lowly birth and positioned towards the north, for they were born from the stock of maidservants who were in contention with each other. According to the Book of Numbers and the description of the tabernacle, which was dictated by God to Moses (Num. XXXIV). But our city, which is the city of the great king, whose architect and builder is God, has another description of the tribes in the holy land, and the measurement of the city and the order of possession, and the boundaries of each tribe. For first, in opposition to the blows of the North Wind, three gates, or exits, of the city are set up, of which Ruben is the first-born, and Judah the founder of the royal line, and Levi, upon whose name, nothing is said in the description of the Tabernacle and the sacred things: so that possessing the first-born, we may despise the cold of the North as if it were a royal and priestly race. Secondly, towards the East, are Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan: both sons of Rachel, and one of Bilhah her maidservant. To the south, Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun, who are the three sons of Leah. Then to the west, Gad, Asher, and Naphtali: the first two being the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, and the third being the son of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid. Who is wise and understands these things: a person who understands will recognize them? For the ways of the Lord are right, and the righteous will walk in them; but transgressors will stumble in them (Hosea 14:10). I believe that these twelve gates, or exits, have been assigned to each tribe according to the quality of their merits and virtues, under the names of the Apostles and the Patriarchs: about which it is more clearly written in the book of Revelation of John, and many mysteries of the divine Scriptures testify (Revelation 21). And it is necessary that such a city hold within its walls eighteen thousand calamities: under which number, and in the twenty-second psalm, the natural law is written, and the grace of the Gospel is described: by which the Church, that is, the city of the Savior, is built. The name of this city will not be Jerusalem, which means vision of peace, but Adonai Sama (( Al. Adonaisan et Adonaisamia)) (), which is translated into the Latin language as Lord is here, who shall never depart from it, as he departed from the former people saying to the disciples: Arise, let us go hence (John XIV, 31). And to the Jews: Your house shall be left to you desolate (Matthew 23:38), but may it have eternal possession, and let it be a possession to itself, promising the same to His disciples: Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the world (Matthew 28:20).
