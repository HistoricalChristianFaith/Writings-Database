To the truly holy and blessed Lord Pope Augustine, Hieronymus sends greeting in Christ

1. Last year, through our brother Asterius the Hypodeacon, I sent a letter to your grace, offering the duty of greeting, which I believe has been delivered to you. Now I also ask, through our holy brother Presidius the Deacon, that you remember me first. Then so that you may have the bearer of the letters commended, and you may know him to be most trustworthy, and so that you may support and sustain him in whatever necessity may require - not that he may need anything, God willing, but so that he may avidly seek the friendships of good people, and he may think that he has achieved the greatest benefit in forming these connections. However, you will be able to learn from him himself why he sailed to the West.

2. We, who are situated in the monastery, are shaken by various disturbances from here and there, and we undergo the difficulties of a pilgrimage. But we believe in him who said: Have confidence, for I have overcome the world (John 16:33): with his help and as our bishop, we will achieve victory against the enemy, the devil. I beg you to greet our holy and venerable brother Pope Alypius on my behalf. The holy brothers who hasten to serve the Lord with us in the monastery greet you. May our Lord Christ, truly holy and worthy of acceptance, protect you and keep you in mind, our all-powerful Lord and Pope.
