<h1>Letter 142. To Augustine.</h1>

<p><i>There is good ground for supposing this to form part of the previous letter. If so, Jerome speaks in a figure of the success gained by Pelagianism in Palestine. "Jerusalem," he says, "is in the hands of Nebuchadnezzar and will not heed the voice of Jeremiah," that is, as the context shews, Jerome himself.This letter is among those of Augustine, number 123.</i></p>
