When I read the commentaries of our orthodox men, in Greek or Latin, on the interpretation of the Gospel, and recently written on that which is read, Hosanna to the Son of David (Matth. 21. 9); they not only differ, but also contradict each other. It is your desire that with that fervent zeal of yours, with opinions cut off and ambiguities removed, you write with a living sense what is meant among the Hebrews; that, as well as many others, you may give thanks in Christ Jesus on our behalf.
