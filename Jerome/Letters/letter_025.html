Ten names by which God is called among the Hebrews, explained by Marcella when asked by her.
<br><br>
Reading the ninetieth Psalm, in the place where it is written: "He who dwells in the aid of the Most High, in the protection of the God of heaven will abide", I said among the Hebrews that it is attributed to the God of heaven, the Almighty, which is interpreted by Aquila as "sufficient", which we can accept as robust and sufficient for achieving all things: and he is one of the ten Names by which God is called among the Hebrews. Immediately you eagerly requested that I arrange for you all the names with their interpretations. I will do what you asked.
<br><br>
The first name of God is El, which in the Septuagint is expressed by the word God, and Aquila as ἐτυμολογίαν, expressing ἰσχυρὸν, that is, strong.
<br><br>
Then Eloim and Eloe, which is also called God Himself.
<br><br>
The fourth Sabaoth, which is translated in the Septuagint as the mighty, and Aquilas as the hosts, carried.
<br><br>
The fifth Elion, which we call high.
<br><br>
The sixth Eser Ieje, which is read in Exodus: "I AM has sent me."
<br><br>
Seventh Lord (Adonai), whom we generally call Lord.
<br><br>
The eighth Ia, which is only used in God: and in Alleluia, the last syllable also sounds.
<br><br>
The ninth τετράγραμμον, which is ἀνεκφώνητον, that is unspeakable, is written with these letters, Jod, He, Vav, He. Which some, not understanding because of the similarity of the letters, have been accustomed to read as ΠΙΠΙ when they found it in Greek books.
<br><br>
The tenth, which was stated above, is Saddai, and it is not interpreted in Ezekiel. However, we ought to know that Elohim is of common number, so that one God is thus also called many, like heaven also is called the heavens, that is, Sanaim. Therefore, interpreters often differ, of which we have an example in our language: Athens, Thebes, Salonas.
