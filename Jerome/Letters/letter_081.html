<h1>Letter 81. To Rufinus.</h1>
<p><i>A friendly letter of remonstrance written by Jerome to Rufinus on receipt of his version of the "περὶ ᾿Αρχῶν" see the preceding letter). Being sent in the first instance to Pammachius this latter treacherously suppressed it and thus put an end to all hope of the reconciliation of the two friends. The date of the letter is 399 a.d.</i></p>

1\. That you have lingered some time at Rome your own language shews. Yet I feel sure that a yearning to see your spiritual parents<sup id="P3430_902466"><a href="#fn_P3430_902466">1</a></sup> would have drawn you to your native country,<sup id="P3431_902557"><a href="#fn_P3431_902557">2</a></sup> had not grief for your mother deterred you lest a sorrow scarce bearable away might have proved unbearable at home.
<br><br>
As to your complaint that men listen only to the dictates of passion and refuse to acquiesce in your judgement and mine; the Lord is witness to my conscience that since our reconciliation I have harboured no rancour in my breast to injure anyone; on the contrary I have taken the utmost pains to prevent any chance occurrence being set down to ill-will. But what can I do so long as everyone supposes that he has a right to do as he does and thinks that in publishing a slander he is requiting not originating a calumny? True friendship ought never to conceal what it thinks.
<br><br>
The short preface to the books "περὶ ᾿Αρχῶν" which has been sent to me I recognize as yours by the style. You know best with what intention it was written; but even a fool can see how it must necessarily be understood. Covertly or rather openly I am the person aimed at. I have often myself reigned a controversy to practise declamation.<sup id="P3434_903617"><a href="#fn_P3434_903617">3</a></sup> Thus I might now recall this well-worn artifice and praise you in your own method.<sup id="P3435_903747"><a href="#fn_P3435_903747">4</a></sup> But far be it from me to imitate what I blame in you. In fact I have so far restrained my feelings that I make no charge against you, and, although injured, decline for my part to injure a friend. But another time, if you wish to follow any one, pray be satisfied with your own judgement. The objects which we seek are either good or bad. If they are good, they need no help from another; and if they are bad, the fact that many sin together is no excuse. I prefer thus to expostulate with you as a friend rather than to give public vent to my indignation at the wrong I have suffered. I want you to see that when I am reconciled to anyone I become his sincere friend and do not-to borrow a figure from Plautus [Plautus, Aul. 2:2, 18] -while offering him bread with one hand, hold a stone in the other.

2\. My brother Paulinian has not yet returned from home and I fancy that you will see him at Aquileia at the house of the reverend pope Chromatius.<sup id="P3438_904733"><a href="#fn_P3438_904733">5</a></sup> I am also sending the reverend presbyter Rufinus<sup id="P3439_905019"><a href="#fn_P3439_905019">6</a></sup> on business to Milan by way of Rome, and have requested him to communicate to you my feelings and respects. I am sending the same message to the rest of my friends; lest, as the apostle says, ye bite and devour one another, ye be consumed one of another. [Gal. 5:15] It only remains for you and your friends to shew your moderation by giving no offence to those who are disinclined to put up with it. For you will hardly find everyone like me. There are few who can be pleased with pretended eulogies.
