<h1>Letter 58. To Paulinus.</h1>
<p><i>In this his second letter to Paulinus of Nola Jerome dissuades him from making a pilgrimage to the Holy Places, and describes Jerusalem not as it ought to be but as it is. He then gives his friend counsels for his life similar to those which he has previously addressed to Nepotian, praises Paulinus for his Panegyric (now no longer extant) on the Emperor Theodosius, compares his style with those of the great writers of the Latin Church, and concludes with a commendation of his messenger, that Vigilantius who was soon to become the object of his bitterest contempt. Written about the year 395 a.d.</i></p>
<br><br>
I. "A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things," [Matt. 12:35] and "every tree is known by his fruit." [Luke 6:44] You measure me by the scale of your own virtues and because of your own greatness magnify my littleness. You take the lowest room at the banquet that the goodman of the house may bid you to go up higher. [Luke 14:10] For what is there in me or what qualities do I possess that I should merit praise from a man of learning? that I, small and lowly as I am, should be eulogized by lips which have pleaded on behalf of our most religious sovereign? Do not, my dearest brother, estimate my worth by the number of my years. Gray hairs are not wisdom; it is wisdom which is as good as gray hairs. At least that is what Solomon says: "wisdom is the gray hair unto men." [Wisd. 4:9] Moses too in choosing the seventy elders is told to take those whom he knows to be elders indeed, and to select them not for their years but for their discretion. [Nu. 11:16] And, as a boy, Daniel judges old men and in the flower of youth condemns the incontinence of age.<sup id="P2425_621581"><a href="#fn_P2425_621581">1</a></sup> Do not, I repeat, weigh faith by years, nor suppose me better than yourself merely because I have enlisted under Christ's banner earlier than you. The apostle Paul, that chosen vessel framed out of a persecutor, [Acts 9:15] though last in the apostolic order is first in merit. For though last he has laboured more than they all. [1 Cor. 15:10] To Judas it was once said: "thou art a man who didst take sweet food with me, my guide and mine acquaintance; we walked in the house of God with company:"<sup id="P2428_622128"><a href="#fn_P2428_622128">2</a></sup> yet the Saviour accuses him of betraying his friend and master. A line of Virgil well describes his end:
<br><br>
"From a high beam he knots a hideous death."<sup id="P2430_622346"><a href="#fn_P2430_622346">3</a></sup> 
<br><br>
The dying robber, on the contrary, exchanges the cross for paradise and turns to martyrdom the penalty of murder. How many there are nowadays who have lived so long that they bear corpses rather than bodies and are like whited sepulchres filled with dead men's bones! [Matt. 23:27] A newly kindled heat is more effective than a long continued lukewarmness.
<br><br>
2\. As for you, when you hear the Saviour's counsel: "if thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and come follow me," [Matt. 19:21] you translate his words into action; and baring yourself to follow the bare cross<sup id="P2435_623001"><a href="#fn_P2435_623001">4</a></sup> you mount Jacob's ladder the easier for carrying nothing. Your dress changes with the change in your convictions, and you aim at no showy shabbiness which leaves your purse as full as before. No, with pure hands and a clear conscience you make it your glory that you are poor both in spirit and in deed. There is nothing great in wearing a sad or a disfigured face, in simulating and in showing off fasts, or in wearing a cheap cloak while you retain a large income. When Crates the Theban-a millionaire of days gone by-was on his way to Athens to study philosophy, he cast away untold gold in the belief that wealth could not be compatible with virtue. What a contrast he offers to us, the disciples of a poor Christ, who cram our pockets with gold and cling under pretext of almsgiving to our old riches. How can we faithfully distribute what belongs to another when we thus timidly keep back what is our own? [Cf. Luke 16:12] When the stomach is full, it is easy to talk of fasting. What is praiseworthy is not to have been at Jerusalem but to have lived a good life while there.<sup id="P2437_624124"><a href="#fn_P2437_624124">5</a></sup> The city which we are to praise and to seek is not that which has slain the prophets [Matt. 23:37] and shed the blood of Christ, but that which is made glad by the streams of the river, [Ps. 46:4] which is set upon a mountain and so cannot be hid, [Matt. 5:14] which the apostle declares to be a mother of the saints, [Gal. 4:26] and in which he rejoices to have his citizenship with the righteous. [Phil. 3:20., RV] 
<br><br>
3\. In speaking thus I am not laying myself open to a charge of inconsistency or condemning the course which I have myself taken. It is not, I believe, for nothing that I, like Abraham, have left my home and people. But I do not presume to limit God's omnipotence or to restrict to a narrow strip of earth Him whom the heaven cannot contain. Each believer is judged not by his residence in this place or in that but according to the deserts of his faith. The true worshippers worship the Father neither at Jerusalem nor on mount Gerizim; for "God is a spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth." [Joh. 4:24] "Now the spirit bloweth where it listeth," [Joh. 3:8, RV. marg] and "the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof." [Ps. 24:1] When the fleece of Judaea was made dry although the whole world was wet with the dew of heaven, [Judg. 6:36-40] and when many came from the East and from the West [Luke 13:29] and sat in Abraham's bosom: [Luke 16:22] then God ceased to be known in Judah only and His name to be great in Israel alone; [Ps. 76:1] the sound of the apostles went out into all the earth and their words into the ends of the world. [Ps. 19:4] The Saviour Himself speaking to His disciples in the temple<sup id="P2452_625962"><a href="#fn_P2452_625962">6</a></sup> said: "arise, let us go hence," [Joh. 14:31] and to the Jews: "your house is left unto you desolate." [Matt. 23:38] If heaven and earth must pass away, [Luke 21:33] obviously all things that are earthly must pass away also. Therefore the spots which witnessed the crucifixion and the resurrection profit those only who bear their several crosses, who day by day rise again with Christ, and who thus shew themselves worthy of an abode so holy. Those who say "the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord," [Jer. 7:4] should give ear to the words of the apostle: "ye are the temple of the Lord," [2 Cor. 6:16] and the Holy Ghost "dwelleth in you." [Rom. 8:11] Access to the courts of heaven is as easy from Britain as it is from Jerusalem; for "the kingdom of God is within you." [Luke 17:21] Antony and the hosts of monks who are in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Pontus, Cappadocia, and Armenia, have never seen Jerusalem: and the door of Paradise is opened for them at a distance from it. The blessed Hilarion, though a native of and a dweller in Palestine, only set eyes on Jerusalem for a single day, not wishing on the one hand when he was so near to neglect the holy places, nor yet on the other to appear to confine God within local limits. From the time of Hadrian to the reign of Constantine-a period of about one hundred and eighty years<sup id="P2460_627493"><a href="#fn_P2460_627493">7</a></sup> -the spot which had witnessed the resurrection was occupied by a figure of Jupiter; while on the rock where the cross had stood, a marble statue of Venus was set up by the heathen and became an object of worship. The original persecutors, indeed, supposed that by polluting our holy places they would deprive us of our faith in the passion and in the resurrection. Even my own Bethlehem, as it now is, that most venerable spot in the whole world of which the psalmist sings: "the truth hath sprung out of the earth," [Ps. 85:11, Vulg] was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz, [Ezek. 8:14] that is of Adonis; and in the very cave<sup id="P2463_628218"><a href="#fn_P2463_628218">8</a></sup> where the infant Christ had uttered His earliest cry lamentation was made for the paramour of Venus.<sup id="P2464_628437"><a href="#fn_P2464_628437">9</a></sup> 
<br><br>
4\. Why, you will say, do I make these remote allusions? To assure you that nothing is lacking to your faith although you have not seen Jerusalem and that I am none the better for living where I do. Be assured that, whether you dwell here or elsewhere, a like recompense is in store for your good works with our Lord. Indeed, if I am frankly to express my own feelings, when I take into consideration your vows and the earnestness with which you have renounced the world, I hold that as long as you live in the country one place is as good as another. Forsake cities and their crowds, live on a small patch of ground, seek Christ in solitude, pray on the mount alone with Jesus,<sup id="P2466_629270"><a href="#fn_P2466_629270">10</a></sup> keep near to holy places: keep out of cities, I say, and you will never lose your vocation. My advice concerns not bishops, presbyters, or the clergy, for these have a different duty. I am speaking only to a monk who having been a man of note in the world has laid the price of his possessions at the apostles' feet, [Acts 4:37] to shew men that they must trample on their money, and has resolved to live a life of loneliness and seclusion and always to continue to reject what he has once rejected. Had the scenes of the Passion and of the Resurrection been elsewhere than in a populous city with court and garrison, with prostitutes, playactors, and buffoons, and with the medley of persons usually found in such centres; or had the crowds which thronged it been composed of monks; then a city would be a desirable abode for those who have embraced the monastic life. But, as things are, it would be the height of folly first to renounce the world, to forswear one's country, to forsake cities, to profess one's self a monk; and then to live among still greater numbers the same kind of life that you would have lived in your own country. Men rush here from all quarters of the world, the city is filled with people of every race, and so great is the throng of men and women that here you will have to tolerate in its full dimensions an evil from which you desired to flee when you found it partially developed elsewhere.
<br><br>
5\. Since you ask me as a brother in what path you should walk, I will be open with you. If you wish to take duty as a presbyter, and are attracted by the work or dignity which falls to the lot of a bishop, live in cities and walled towns,<sup id="P2469_630966"><a href="#fn_P2469_630966">11</a></sup> and by so doing turn the salvation of others into the profit of your own soul. But if you desire to be in deed what you are in name-a monk,<sup id="P2470_631125"><a href="#fn_P2470_631125">12</a></sup> that is, one who lives alone, what have you to do with cities which are the homes not of solitaries but of crowds? Every mode of life has its own exponents. For instance, let Roman generals imitate men like Camillus, Fabricius, Regulus, and Scipio. Let philosophers take for models Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Let poets strive to rival Homer, Virgil, Menander, and Terence. Let writers of history follow Thucydides, Sallust, Herodotus and Livy. Let orators find masters in Lysias, the Gracchi, Demosthenes, and Tully. And, to come to our own case, let bishops and presbyters take for their examples the apostles or their companions; and as they hold the rank which these once held, let them endeavour to exhibit the same excellence. And last of all let us monks take as the patterns which we are to follow the lives of Paul, of Antony, of Julian, of Hilarion, of the Macarii. And to go back to the authority of scripture, we have our masters in Elijah and Elisha, and our leaders in the sons of the prophets; who lived in fields and solitary places and made themselves tents by the waters of Jordan. [2 Kings 6:1, 2 Kings 6:2] The sons of Rechab too are of the number who drank neither wine nor strong drink and who abode in tents; men whom God's voice praises through Jeremiah,<sup id="P2472_632569"><a href="#fn_P2472_632569">13</a></sup> and to whom a promise is made that there shall never be wanting a man of their stock to stand before God. [Jer. 35:19] This is probably what is meant by the title of the seventy-first psalm: "of the sons of Jonadab and of those who were first led into captivity."<sup id="P2474_632864"><a href="#fn_P2474_632864">14</a></sup> The person intended is Jonadab the son of Rechab who is described in the book of Kings [2 Kings, 10:15, 2 Kings, 10:16] as having gone up into the chariot of Jehu. His sons having always lived in tents until at last (owing to the inroads made by the Chaldean army) they were forced to come into Jerusalem, are described [Jer. 35:11] as being the first to undergo captivity; because after the freedom of their lonely life they found confinement in a city as bad as imprisonment.

6\. Since you are not wholly independent but are bound to a wife who is your sister in the Lord, I entreat you-whether here or there-that you will avoid large gatherings, visits official and complimentary, and social parties, indulgences all of which tend to enchain the soul. Let your food be coarse-say cabbage and pulse-and do not take it until evening. Sometimes as a great delicacy you may have some small fish. He who longs for Christ and feeds upon the true bread cares little for dainties which must be transmuted into ordure. Food that you cannot taste when once it has passed your gullet might as well be-so far as you are concerned-bread and pulse. You have my books against Jovinian which speak yet more largely of despising the appetite and the palate. Let some holy volume be ever in your hand. Pray constantly, and bowing down your body lift up your mind to the Lord. Keep frequent vigils and sleep often on an empty stomach. Avoid tittle-tattle and all self-laudation. Flee from wheedling flatterers as from open enemies. Distribute with your own hand provisions to alleviate the miseries of the poor and of the brethren. With your own hands, I say, for good faith is rare among men. You do not believe what I say? Think of Judas and his bag. Seek not a lowly garb for a swelling soul. Avoid the society of men of the world, especially if they are in power. Why need you look again on things contempt for which has made you a monk? Above all let your sister<sup id="P2478_634877"><a href="#fn_P2478_634877">15</a></sup> hold aloof from married ladies. And, if women round her wear silk dresses and gems while she is meanly attired, let her neither fret nor congratulate herself. For by so doing she will either regret her resolution or sow the seeds of pride. If you are already famed as a faithful steward of your own substance, do not take other people's money to give away. You understand What I mean, for the Lord has given you understanding in all things. Be simple as a dove and lay snares for no man: but be cunning as a serpent and let no man lay snares for you. [Matt. 10:16] For a Christian who allows others to deceive him is almost at much at fault as one who tries to deceive others. If a man talks to you always or nearly always about money (except it be about alms-giving, a topic which is open to all) treat him as a broker rather than a monk. Besides food and clothing and things manifestly necessary give no man anything; for dogs must not eat the children's bread. [Matt. 15:26] 
<br><br>
7\. The true temple of Christ is the believer's soul; adorn this, clothe it, offer gifts to it, welcome Christ in it. What use are walls blazing with jewels when Christ in His poor [Matt. 25:40] is in danger of perishing from hunger? Your possessions are no longer your own but a stewardship is entrusted to you. Remember Ananias and Sapphira who from fear of the future kept what was their own, and be careful for your part not rashly to squander what is Christ's. Do not, that is, by an error of judgment give the property of the poor to those who are not poor; lest, as a wise man has told us,<sup id="P2483_636529"><a href="#fn_P2483_636529">16</a></sup> charity prove the death of charity.Look not upon

In the words of Persius, God says:-
<br><br>

<br><br>
To be a Christian is the great thing, not merely to seem one. And somehow or other those please the world most who please Christ least. In speaking thus I am not like the sow lecturing Minerva; but, as a friend warns a friend, so I warn you before you embark on your new course. I would rather fail in ability than in will to serve you; for my wish is that where I have fallen you may keep your footing.
<br><br>
8\. It is with much pleasure that I have read the book which you have sent to me containing your wise and eloquent defence of the emperor Theodosius; and your arrangement of the subject has particularly pleased me. While in the earlier chapters you surpass others, in the latter you surpass yourself. Your style is terse and neat; it has all the purity of Tully, and yet it is packed with meaning. For, as someone has said,<sup id="P2491_637693"><a href="#fn_P2491_637693">19</a></sup> that speech is a failure of which men only praise the diction. You have been successful in preserving both sequence of subjects and logical connexion. Whatever sentence one takes, it is always a conclusion to what goes before or an introduction to what follows. Theodosius is fortunate in having a Christian orator like you to plead his cause. You have made his purple illustrious and have consecrated for future ages his useful laws. Go on and prosper, for, if such be your first ventures in the field, what will you not do when you become a trained soldier? Oh! that it were mine to conduct a genius like you, not (as the poets sing) through the Aonian mountains and the peaks of Helicon but through Zion and Tabor and the high places of Sinai. If I might teach you what I have learned myself and might pass on to you the mystic rolls of the prophets, then might we give birth to something such as Greece with all her learning could not shew.
<br><br>
9\. Hear me, therefore, my fellow-servant, my friend, my brother; give ear for a moment that I may tell you how you are to walk in the holy scriptures. All that we read in the divine books, while glistening and shining without, is yet far sweeter within. "He who desires to eat the kernel must first break the nut." [Plautus, Curc. I. 1:55] "Open thou mine eyes," says David, "that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law." [Ps. 119:18] Now, if so great a prophet confesses that he is in the darkness of ignorance; how deep, think you, must be the night of misapprehension with which we, mere babes and unweaned infants, are enveloped! Now this veil rests not only on the face of Moses, [2 Cor. 3:14, 2 Cor. 3:15] but on the evangelists and the apostles as well.<sup id="P2496_639480"><a href="#fn_P2496_639480">20</a></sup> To the multitudes the Saviour spoke only in parables and, to make it clear that His words had a mystical meaning, said:-"he that hath ears to hear, let him hear." [Luke 8:8, Luke 8:10] Unless all things that are written are opened by Him "who hath the key of David, who openeth and no man shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth," [Rev. 3:7] no one can undo the lock orset them before you. If only you had the foundation which He alone can give; nay, if even His fingers were but passed over your work; there would be nothing finer than your volumes, nothing more learned, nothing more attractive, nothing more Latin.
<br><br>
10\. Tertullian is packed with meaning but his style is rugged and uncouth. The blessed Cyprian like a fountain of pure water flows softly and sweetly but, as he is taken up with exhortations to virtue and with the troubles consequent on persecution, he has nowhere discussed the divine scriptures. Victorinus, although he has the glory of a martyr's crown, yet cannot express what he knows. Lactantius has a flow of eloquence worthy of Tully: would that he had been as ready to teach our doctrines as he was to pull down those of others! Arnobius is lengthy and unequal, and often confused from not making a proper division of his subject. That reverend man Hilary gains in height from his Gallic buskin; yet, adorned as he is with the flowers of Greek rhetoric, he sometimes entangles himself in long periods and offers by no means easy reading to the less learned brethren. I say nothing of other writers whether dead or living; others will hereafter judge them both for good and for evil.<sup id="P2500_641218"><a href="#fn_P2500_641218">21</a></sup> 
<br><br>
11\. I will come to yourself, my fellow-mystic, my companion, and my friend; my friend, I say, though not yet personally known: and I will ask you not to suspect a flatterer in one so intimate. Better that you should think me mistaken or led astray by affection than that you should hold me capable of fawning on a friend. You have a great intellect and an inexhaustible store of language, your diction is fluent and pure, your fluency and purity are mingled with wisdom. Your head is clear and all your senses keen. Were you to add to this wisdom and eloquence a careful study and knowledge of scripture, I should soon see you holding our citadel against all comers; you would go up with Joab upon the roof of Zion, [1 Chron. 11:5, 1 Chron. 11:6] and sing upon the housetops what you had learned in the secret chambers. [Cf. Luke 12:3] Gird up, I pray you, gird up your loins. As Horace says:-
<br><br>
"Life hath no gifts for men except they toil." [Horace, Sat. I. 9:59, 60] 
<br><br>
Shew yourself as much a man of note in the church, as you were before in the senate. Provide for yourself riches which you may spend daily yet they will not fail. Provide them while you are still strong and while as yet your head has no gray hairs: before, in the words of Virgil,Diseases creep on you, and gloomy age,
<br><br>
"And pain, and cruel death's inclemency." [Virgil, Georg. 3:67, 68] 
<br><br>
I am not content with mediocrity for you: I desire all that you do to be of the highest excellence.
<br><br>
How heartily I have welcomed the reverend presbyter Vigilantius,<sup id="P2511_642800"><a href="#fn_P2511_642800">22</a></sup> his own lips will tell you better than this letter. Why he has so soon left us and started afresh I cannot say; and, indeed, I do not wish to hurt anyone's feelings.<sup id="P2512_643075"><a href="#fn_P2512_643075">23</a></sup> Still, mere passer-by as he was, in haste to continue his journey, I managed to keep him back until I had given him a taste of my friendship for you. Thus you can learn from him what you want to know about me. Kindly salute your reverend sister<sup id="P2513_643550"><a href="#fn_P2513_643550">24</a></sup> and fellow-servant, who with you fights the good fight in the Lord.
