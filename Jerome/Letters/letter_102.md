To our truly holy Lord and Most Blessed Pope Augustin, Hieronymus wishes salutations in the Lord.

1. In the very moment of departure of our holy son Asterius, my necessary hypodiaconus, your blessed letters reached me, in which you satisfy me that you did not send the book to Rome against my wish. I had not heard of this, but some copies of a letter seemingly written for me by our brother the deacon Sysinnius, have reached here. In this letter you urge me to παλινῳδιαν upon a certain chapter of the Apostle, and to imitate Stesichorus wavering between abuse and praise of Helen, so that, as one who lost his eyes by detracting, he may regain them by praising. I confess without hesitation to your favor, although your writing and arguments seemed difficult to me: nevertheless, I did not think that I should easily rely on the examples of letters; lest, perhaps, when I reply, you justly complain that I should have proven your statement before, and then write back. A long illness of the holy and venerable Paula caused a delay additionally. For while we were sitting with [you] who were languishing for a long time, we have almost forgotten your letter or that of the one who had written under your name, mindful of that verse: music is an annoying narrative in mourning (Eccli. 22:6). Therefore, if the letter is yours, write it openly or send more true copies so that we may discuss the Scriptures without any resentment and either correct our error or teach [others] not to have reproached [someone] in vain.

2. May it be far from me to dare to touch anything from the books of your blessedness. It is enough for me to prove my own, and not to pick apart what belongs to others. Furthermore, your wisdom knows best that everyone is abundant in his own understanding, and it is childish to seek fame for oneself by accusing illustrious men, as young boys used to do. I am not so foolish as to be harmed by the differences in your explanations: because neither are you harmed, if we should feel differently. But true reproof is between friends, if not seeing our own faults, we consider the faults of others, as Persius said, like a beggar's cloak. It remains, that you love the person who loves you, and in the field of scriptures, do not challenge an elder as a young person. We have had our time, and we have run as far as we could: now with you running and crossing long distances, leisure is due to us: at the same time (so that I may say something about poets with your honor and indulgence), remember Dares and Entellus (Virgil, Aeneid 5), and the common proverb: that a tired ox plants its foot more firmly. We have written these sad things: may we deserve your embrace, and by mutual comparison either teach or learn something.

3. He sent to me, as usual in his recklessness, his cursed book, Calpurnius by name, surnamed Lanarius, which, so far as the zeal of the man enabled him, I find had made its way even to Africa. To this I briefly replied in part, and have sent you copies of his work, to be more thoroughly considered when opportunity serves, and at the earliest possible moment to be issued; in which I have taken care that I should not injure the Christian character in any respect, but only refute the senseless lies and folly of one who raves in his ignorance. Remember me, holy and venerable Pope. See how much I love you, that I would not even want to respond when provoked: nor would I believe it to be yours, what I might have criticized in someone else. A common brother greets you humbly.
