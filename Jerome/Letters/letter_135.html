<h1>Letter 135. From Pope Innocent to Aurelius.</h1>
<p><i>Shortly after the synod of Diospolis the Pelagians exulting in their success made an attack upon Jerome's monasteries at Bethlehem which they pillaged and partially burned. This gained for him the sympathy of Innocent who now (a.d. 417) asks Aurelius to transmit to him the letter which follows this.</i></p>

Our fellow-presbyter Jerome has informed us of your most dutiful desire to come to see us. We suffer with him as with a member of our own flock. We have been swift also to take such measures as have appeared to us expedient and practicable. As you count yourself one of us, most dear brother, make haste to transmit the following letter<sup id="P5426_1502644"><a href="#fn_P5426_1502644">2</a></sup> to the aforesaid Jerome.
