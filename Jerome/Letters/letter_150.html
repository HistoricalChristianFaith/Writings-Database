<h1>Letter 150. From Procopius to Jerome.</h1>
<p><i>This letter is extant also among those of Procopius of Gaza, to whose works it properly belongs. As this Procopius flourished a century later than Jerome, the letter cannot be addressed to him.

Again Egypt and luxury, and we poor to you, and no account of those absent. That is nothing, just laugh at the Nile flowing with gold. Even if you lift your eyebrows more, we will endure contempt altogether. For there will be a time when you will see Elusa again, and you will weep for the sand scattered by the winds and destroying the vine down to the roots. Some foreign nymphs and Jupiter coming from the sea are there, but no rain. Then indeed I shall laugh and mock fortune myself. But you, now you will think me worthless, then fortunate. However, while the Nile permits you to live in delights, write only, and you call us minute and like those crawling on the ground. For thus we shall enjoy you writing, and I will bear your arrogance more gently with the expectation of the future.
