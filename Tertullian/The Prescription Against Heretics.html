</UL><P>The character of the times in which we live is such as to call forth from us even this admonition, that we ought not to be astonished at the heresies (which abound)<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3132_1135045">2</A></SUP> neither ought their existence to surprise us, for it was foretold that they should come to pass;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3133_1135152">3</A></SUP> nor the fact that they subvert the faith of some, for their final cause is, by affording a trial to faith, to give it also the opportunity of being "approved."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3134_1135377">4</A></SUP> Groundless, therefore, and inconsiderate is the offence of the many<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3135_1135463">5</A></SUP> who are scandalized by the very fact that heresies prevail to such a degree. How great (might their offence have been) if they had not existed.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3136_1135636">6</A></SUP> When it has been determined that a thing must by all means be, it receives the (final) cause for which it has its being.

</UL><P>Taking the similar case<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3140_1136172">7</A></SUP> of fever, which is appointed a place amongst all other deadly and excruciating issues (of life) for destroying man: we are not surprised either that it exists, for there it is, or that it consumes man, for that is the purpose of its existence. In like manner, with respect to heresies, which are produced for the weakening and the extinction of faith, since we feel a dread because they have this power, we should first dread the fact of their existence; for as long as they exist, they have they have their power; and as long as they have their power, they, have their existence. But still fever, as being an evil both in its cause<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3141_1136868">8</A></SUP> and in its power, as all know, we rather loathe than wonder at, and to the best of our power guard against, not having its extirpation in our power. Some men prefer wondering at heresies, however, which bring with them eternal death and the heat of a stronger fire, for possessing this power, instead of avoiding their power when they have the means of escape: but heresies would have no power, if (men) would cease to wonder that they have such power. For it either happens that, while men wonder, they fall into a snare, or, because they are ensnared, they cherish their surprise, as if heresies were so powerful because of some truth which belonged to them. It would no doubt be a wonderful thing that evil should have any force of its own, were it not that heresies are strong in those persons who are not strong in faith. In a combat of boxers and gladiators, generally speaking, it is not because a man is strong that he gains the victory, or loses it because he is not strong, but because he who is vanquished was a man of no strength; and indeed this very conqueror, when afterwards matched against a really powerful man, actually retires crest-fallen from the contest. In precisely the same way, heresies derive such strength as they have from the infirmities of individuals-having no strength whenever they encounter a really powerful faith.</P>

Now, that which he subjoins to evil things, he of course confesses to be itself an evil; and all the greater, indeed, because he tells us that his belief of their schisms and dissensions was grounded on his knowledge that "there must be heresies also."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3184_1145065">42</A></SUP> For he shows us that it was owing to the prospect of the greater evil that he readily believed the existence of the lighter ones; and so far indeed was he from believing, in respect of evils (of such a kind), that heresies were good, that his object was to forewarn us that we ought not to be surprised at temptations of even a worse stamp, since (he said) they tended "to make manifest all such as were approved; "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3185_1145501">43</A></SUP> in other words, those whom they were unable to pervert.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3186_1145577">44</A></SUP> In short, since the whole passage<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3187_1145627">45</A></SUP> points to the maintenance of unity and the checking of divisions, inasmuch as heresies sever men from unity no less than schisms and dissensions, no doubt he classes heresies under the same head of censure as he does schisms also and dissensions. And by so doing, he makes those to be "not approved," who have fallen into heresies; more especially when with reproofs he exhorts<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3188_1146021">46</A></SUP> men to turn away from such, teaching them that they should "all speak and think the selfsame thing,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3189_1146137">47</A></SUP> the very object which heresies do not permit.</P>

</UL><P>On this point, however, we dwell no longer, since it is the same Paul who, in his Epistle to the Galatians, counts "heresies" among "the sins of the flesh,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3193_1146506">48</A></SUP> who also intimates to Titus, that "a man who is a heretic" must be "rejected after the first admonition," on the ground that "he that is such is perverted, and committeth sin, as a self-condemned man."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3194_1146725">49</A></SUP> Indeed, in almost every epistle, when enjoining on us (the duty) of avoiding false doctrines, he sharply condemns<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn31.htm#P3195_1146862">50</A></SUP> heresies.

From the same source came Marcion's better god, with all his tranquillity; he came of the Stoics. Then, again, the opinion that the soul dies is held by the Epicureans; while the denial of the restoration of the body is taken from the aggregate school of all the philosophers; also, when matter is made equal to God, then you have the teaching of Zeno; and when any doctrine is alleged touching a god of fire, then Heraclitus comes in. The same subject-matter is discussed over and over again<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3216_1150094">68</A></SUP> by the heretics and the philosophers; the same arguments<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3217_1150167">69</A></SUP> are involved.

What indeed has Athens to do with Jerusalem? What concord is there between the Academy and the Church? what between heretics and Christians?

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VIII.-Christ's Word, Seek, and Ye Shall Find, No Warrant for Heretical Deviations from the Faith. All Christ's Words to the Jews are for Us, Not Indeed as Specific Commands, But as Principles to Be Applied.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>I come now to the point which (is urged both by our own brethren and by the heretics). Our brethren adduce <I>it</I> as a pretext for entering on curious inquiries,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3232_1153221">81</A></SUP> and the heretics insist on it for importing the scrupulosity (of their unbelief).<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3233_1153322">82</A></SUP> It is written, they say, "Seek, and ye shall find."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3234_1153414">83</A></SUP> Let us remember at what time the Lord said this. I think it was at the very outset of His teaching, when there was still a doubt felt by all whether He were the Christ, and when even Peter had not yet declared Him to be the Son of God, and John (Baptist) had actually ceased to feel assurance about Him.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3235_1153737">84</A></SUP> With good reason, therefore, was it then said, "Seek, and ye shall find," when inquiry was still be to made of Him who was not yet become known. Besides, this <I>was said</I> in respect of the Jews. For it is to them that the whole matter<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3236_1154070">85</A></SUP> of this reproof<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3237_1154098">86</A></SUP> pertains, seeing that they had (a revelation) where they might seek Christ.</P>

<P>"They have," says He, "Moses and Elias,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3239_1154235">87</A></SUP> -in other words, the law and the prophets, which preach Christ; as also in another place He says plainly, "Search the Scriptures, in which ye expect (to find) salvation; for they testify of me; "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3240_1154448">88</A></SUP> which will be the meaning of "Seek, and ye shall find." For it is clear that the next words also apply to the Jews: "Knock, and it shall be opened unto you."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3241_1154623">89</A></SUP> The Jews had formerly been in covenant with<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3242_1154686">90</A></SUP> God; but being afterwards cast off on account of their sins, they began to be<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3243_1154776">91</A></SUP> without God. The Gentiles, on the contrary, had never been in covenant with God; they were only as "a drop from a bucket," and "as dust from the threshing floor,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3244_1154974">92</A></SUP> and were ever outside the door. Now, how shall he who was always outside knock at the place where he never was? What door does he know of, when he has passed through none, either by entrance or ejection? Is it not rather he who is aware that he once lived within and was thrust out, that (probably) found the door and knocked thereat? In like manner, "Ask, and ye shall receive,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3245_1155372">93</A></SUP> is suitably said<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3246_1155408">94</A></SUP> to one who was aware from whom he ought to ask,-by whom also some promise had been given; that is to say, "the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob." Now, the Gentiles knew nothing either of Him, or of any of His promises. Therefore it was to Israel that he spake when He said, "I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3247_1155765">95</A></SUP> Not yet had He "cast to the dogs the children's bread; "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3248_1155841">96</A></SUP> not yet did He charge them to "go into the way of the Gentiles."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3249_1155920">97</A></SUP> It is only at the last that He instructs them to "go and teach all nations, and baptize them,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3250_1156032">98</A></SUP> when they were so soon to receive "the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, who should guide them into all the truth."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3251_1156164">99</A></SUP> And this, too, makes towards the the same conclusion. If the apostles, who were ordained<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3252_1156273">100</A></SUP> to be teachers to the Gentiles, were themselves to have the Comforter for their teacher, far more needless<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3253_1156398">101</A></SUP> was it to say to us, "Seek, and ye shall find," to whom was to come, without research,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3254_1156513">102</A></SUP> our instruction<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3255_1156543">103</A></SUP> by the apostles, and to the apostles themselves by the Holy Ghost. All the Lord's sayings, indeed, are set forth for all men; through the ears of the Jews have they passed on to us. Still most of them were addressed to <I>Jewish</I> persons;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3256_1156795">104</A></SUP> they therefore did not constitute instruction properly designed<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3257_1156905">105</A></SUP> for ourselves, but <I>rather</I> an example.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3258_1156977">106</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>I now purposely<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3262_1157220">107</A></SUP> relinquish this ground of argument. Let it be granted, that the words, "Seek, and ye shall find," were addressed to all men (equally). Yet even here one's aim is<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3263_1157397">108</A></SUP> carefully to determine<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3264_1157436">109</A></SUP> the sense of the words<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3265_1157475">110</A></SUP> consistently with<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3266_1157508">111</A></SUP> (that reason),<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3267_1157535">112</A></SUP> which is the guiding principle<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3268_1157592">113</A></SUP> in all interpretation. (Now) no divine saying is so unconnected<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3269_1157829">114</A></SUP> and diffuse, that its <I>words</I> only are to be insisted on, and their <I>connection</I> left undetermined. But at the outset I lay down (this position) that there is some one, and therefore definite, thing taught by Christ, which the Gentiles are by all means bound to believe, and for that purpose to "seek," in order that they may be able, when they have "found" it, to believe. However,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3270_1158227">115</A></SUP> there can be no indefinite seeking for that which has been taught as one only definite thing. You must "seek" until you "find," and believe when you have found; nor have you anything further to do but to keep what you have believed provided you believe this besides, that nothing else is to be believed, and therefore nothing else is to be sought, after you have found and believed what has been taught by Him who charges you to seek no other thing than that which He has taught.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3271_1158721">116</A></SUP> When, indeed, any man doubts about this, proof will be forthcoming,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3272_1159111">117</A></SUP> that we have in our possession<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3273_1159160">118</A></SUP> that which was taught by Christ. Meanwhile, such is my confidence in our proof, that I anticipate it, in the shape of an admonition to certain persons, not "to seek" anything beyond what they have believed-that this is what they ought to have sought, how to avoid<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3274_1159442">119</A></SUP> interpreting, "Seek, and ye shall find," without regard to the rule of reason.</P>

</UL><P>Now the reason of this saying is comprised in three points: in the matter, in the time, in the limit.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3278_1159811">120</A></SUP> In the matter, so that you must consider <I>what it is</I> you have to seek; in the time, <I>when</I> you have to seek; in the limit, <I>how long</I>. What you have "to seek," then, is that which Christ has taught,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3279_1160021">121</A></SUP> (and you must go on seeking) of course for such time as you fail to find,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3280_1160125">122</A></SUP> -until indeed you find<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3281_1160167">123</A></SUP> it. But you have succeeded in finding<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3282_1160225">124</A></SUP> when you have believed. For you would not have believed if you had not found; as neither would you have sought except with a view to find. Your object, therefore, in seeking <I>was</I> to find; and your object in finding <I>was</I> to believe, All further delay for seeking and finding you have prevented<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3283_1160534">125</A></SUP> by believing. The very fruit of your seeking has determined for you this limit. This boundary<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3284_1160658">126</A></SUP> has He set for you Himself, who is unwilling that you should believe anything else than what He has taught, or, therefore, even seek for it. If, however, because so many other things have been taught by one and another, we are on that account bound to go on seeking, so long as we are able to find anything, we must (at that rate) be ever seeking, and never believe anything at all. For where shall be the end of seeking? where the stop<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3285_1161110">127</A></SUP> in believing? where the completion in finding? (Shall it be) with Marcion? But even Valentinus proposes (to us the) maxim, "Seek, and ye shall find." Then shall it be) with Valentinus? Well, but Apelles, too, will assail me with the same quotation; Hebion also, and Simon, and all in turn, have no other argument wherewithal to entice me, and draw me over to their side. Thus I shall be nowhere, and still be encountering<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3286_1161564">128</A></SUP> (that challenge), "Seek, and ye shall find," precisely as if I had no resting-place;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3287_1161671">129</A></SUP> as if (indeed) I had never found that which Christ has taught-that which ought<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3288_1162554">130</A></SUP> to be sought, that which must needs<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn32.htm#P3289_1162606">131</A></SUP> be believed.</P>

Accordingly, after one of these had been struck off, He commanded the eleven others, on His departure to the Father, to "go and teach <I>all</I> nations, who were to be baptized into the Father, and into the Son, and into the Holy Ghost."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3392_1179945">203</A></SUP> Immediately, therefore, so did the apostles, whom this designation indicates as "<I>the sent</I>." Having, on the authority of a prophecy, which occurs in a psalm of David,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3393_1180136">204</A></SUP> chosen Matthias by lot as the twelfth, into the place of Judas, they obtained the promised power of the Holy Ghost for the gift of miracles and of utterance; and after first bearing witness to the faith in Jesus Christ throughout Jud&#181;a, and rounding churches (there), they next went forth into the world and preached the same doctrine of the same faith to the nations. They then in like manner rounded churches in every city, from which all the other churches, one after another, derived the tradition of the faith,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3394_1180697">205</A></SUP> and the seeds of doctrine, and are every day deriving them,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn33.htm#P3395_1180780">206</A></SUP> that they may become churches.

</UL><P>From this, therefore, do we draw up our rule. Since the Lord Jesus Christ sent the apostles to preach, (our rule is) that no others ought to be received as preachers than those whom Christ appointed; for "no man knoweth the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3405_1182203">213</A></SUP> Nor does the Son seem to have revealed Him to any other than the apostles, whom He sent forth to preach-that, of course, which He revealed to them. Now, what that was which they preached-in other words, what it was which Christ revealed to them-can, as I must here likewise prescribe, properly be proved in no other way than by those very churches which the apostles rounded in person, by declaring the gospel to them directly themselves, both vivG voce, as the phrase is, and subsequently by their epistles. If, then, these things are so, it is in the same degree<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3406_1182789">214</A></SUP> manifest that all doctrine which agrees with the apostolic churches-those moulds<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3407_1182886">215</A></SUP> and original sources of the faith must be reckoned for truth, as undoubtedly containing that which the (said) churches received from the apostles, the apostles from Christ, Christ from God. Whereas all doctrine must be prejudged<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3408_1183134">216</A></SUP> as false<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3409_1183196">217</A></SUP> which savours of contrariety to the truth of the churches and apostles of Christ and God. It remains, then, that we demonstrate whether this doctrine of ours, of which we have now given the rule, has its origin<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3410_1183427">218</A></SUP> in the tradition of the apostles, and whether all other <I>doctrines</I> do not <I>ipso facto</I><SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3411_1183529">219</A></SUP> proceed from falsehood.

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XXIII.-The Apostles Not Ignorant. The Heretical Pretence of St. Peter's Imperfection Because He Was Rebuked by St. Paul. St. Peter Not Rebuked for Error in Teaching.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Now, with the view of branding<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3440_1187816">242</A></SUP> the apostles with some mark of ignorance, they put forth the case of Peter and them that were with him having been rebuked by Paul. "Something therefore," they say, "was wanting in them." (This they allege, ) in order that they may from this construct that other position of theirs, that a fuller knowledge may possibly have afterwards come over (the apostles, ) such as fell to the share of Paul when he rebuked those who preceded him. I may here say to those who reject <I>The Acts of the Apostles</I>: "It is first necessary that you shows us who this Paul was,-both what he was before he was an apostle, and how he became an apostle,"-so very great is the use which they make of him in respect of other questions also. It is true that he tells us himself that he was a persecutor before he became an apostle,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3441_1188644">243</A></SUP> still this is not enough for any man who examines before he believes, since even the Lord Himself did not bear witness of Himself.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3442_1188794">244</A></SUP> But let them believe without the Scriptures, if their object is to believe contrary to the Scriptures.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3443_1188916">245</A></SUP> Still they should show, from the circumstance which they allege of Peter's being rebuked by Paul, that Paul added yet another form of the gospel besides that which Peter and the rest had previously set forth. But the fact is,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3444_1189179">246</A></SUP> having been converted from a persecutor to a preacher, he is introduced as one of the brethren to brethren, by brethren-to them, indeed, by men who had put on faith from the apostles' hands. Afterwards, as he himself narrates, he "went up to Jerusalem for the purpose of seeing Peter,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3445_1189480">247</A></SUP> because of his office, no doubt,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3446_1189532">248</A></SUP> and by right of a common belief and preaching. Now they certainly would not have been surprised at his having become a preacher instead of a persecutor, if his preaching were of something contrary; nor, moreover, would they have "glorified the Lord,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3447_1189800">249</A></SUP> because Paul had presented himself as an adversary to Him They accordingly even gave him "the right hand of fellowship,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3448_1189940">250</A></SUP> as a sign of their agreement with him, and arranged amongst themselves a distribution of office, not a diversity of gospel, so that they should severally preach not a different gospel, but (the same), to different persons,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3449_1190182">251</A></SUP> Peter to the circumcision, Paul to the Gentiles. Forasmuch, then, as Peter was rebuked because, after he had lived with the Gentiles, he proceeded to separate himself from their company out of respect for persons, the fault surely was one of conversation, not of preaching.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3450_1190515">252</A></SUP> For it does not appear from this, that any other God than the Creator, or any other Christ than (the son) of Mary, or any other hope than the resurrection, was (by him) announced.</P>

"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn34.htm#P3474_1194066">270</A></SUP> and also of that precept of which he says, "I charge thee in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Jesus Christ who witnessed a good confession under Pontius Pilate, that thou keep this commandment?

In like manner Valentinus, by his different expositions and acknowledged<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3539_1207662">320</A></SUP> emendations, makes these changes on the express ground of previous faultiness, and therefore demonstrates the difference<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3540_1207802">321</A></SUP> of the documents.

</UL><P>But if there be any (heresies) which are bold enough to plant themselves in the midst Of the apostolic age, that they may thereby seem to have been handed down by the apostles, because they existed in the time of the apostles, we can say: Let them produce the original records<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3557_1211311">332</A></SUP> of their churches; let them unfold the roll of their bishops, running down in due succession from the beginning in such a manner that [that first bishop of theirs<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3558_1211518">333</A></SUP> ] bishop shall be able to show for his ordainer and predecessor some one of the apostles or of apostolic men,-a man, moreover, who continued stedfast with the apostles. For this is the manner in which the apostolic churches transmit<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3559_1211827">334</A></SUP> their registers:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3560_1211861">335</A></SUP> as the church of Smyrna, which records that Polycarp was placed therein by John; as also the church of Rome, which makes Clement to have been ordained in like manner by Peter.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3561_1212052">336</A></SUP> In exactly the same way the other churches likewise exhibit (their several worthies), whom, as having been appointed to their episcopal places by apostles, they regard as transmitters of the apostolic seed. Let the heretics contrive<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3562_1212431">337</A></SUP> something of the same kind. For after their blasphemy, what is there that is unlawful for them (to attempt)? But should they even effect the contrivance, they will not advance a step. For their very doctrine, after comparison with that of the apostles, will declare, by its own diversity and contrariety, that it had for its author neither an apostle nor an apostolic man; because, as the apostles would never have taught things which were self-contradictory, so the apostolic men would not have inculcated teaching different from the apostles, unless they who received their instruction from the apostles went and preached in a contrary manner. To this test, therefore will they be submitted for proof<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3563_1213153">338</A></SUP> by those churches, who, although they derive not their founder from apostles or apostolic men (as being of much later date, for they are in fact being founded daily), yet, since they agree in the same faith, they are accounted as not less apostolic because they are akin in doctrine.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3564_1213590">339</A></SUP> Then let all the heresies, when challenged to these two<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3565_1213683">340</A></SUP> tests by our apostolic church, offer their proof of how they deem themselves to be apostolic. But in truth they neither are so, nor are they able to prove themselves to be what they are not. Nor are they admitted to peaceful relations and communion by such churches as are in any way connected with apostles, inasmuch as they are in no sense themselves apostolic because of their diversity as to the mysteries of the faith.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3566_1214217">341</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>Besides all this, I add a review of the doctrines themselves, which, existing as they did in the days of the apostles, were both exposed and denounced by the said apostles. For by this method they will be more easily reprobated,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3570_1214658">342</A></SUP> when they are detected to have been even then in existence, or at any rate to have been seedlings<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3571_1214776">343</A></SUP> of the (tares) which then were. Paul, in his first epistle to the Corinthians, sets his mark on certain who denied and doubted the resurrection.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3572_1214946">344</A></SUP> This opinion was the especial property of the Sadducees.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3573_1215025">345</A></SUP> A part of it, however, is maintained by Marcion and Apelles and Valentinus, and all other impugners of the resurrection. Writing also to the Galatians, he inveighs against such men as observed and defend circumcision and the (Mosaic) law.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3574_1215311">346</A></SUP> Thus runs Hebion's heresy. Such also as "forbid to marry" he reproaches in his instructions to Timothy.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3575_1215433">347</A></SUP> Now, this is the teaching of Marcion and his follower Apelles. (The apostle) directs a similar blow<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3576_1215554">348</A></SUP> against those who said that "the resurrection was past already."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3577_1215640">349</A></SUP> Such an opinion did the Valentinians assert of themselves. When again he mentions "endless genealogies,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3578_1215766">350</A></SUP> one also recognises Valentinus, in whose system a certain &#166;on, whosoever he be,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3579_1215866">351</A></SUP> of a new name, and that not one only, generates of his own grace<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3580_1215950">352</A></SUP> Sense and Truth; and these in like manner produce of themselves Word<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3581_1216035">353</A></SUP> and Life, while these again afterwards beget Man and the Church. From these primary eight<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3582_1216142">354</A></SUP> ten other &#166;ons after them spring, and then the twelve others arise with their wonderful names, to complete the mere story of the thirty &#166;ons. The same apostle, when disapproving of those who are "in bondage to elements,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3583_1216440">355</A></SUP> points us to some dogma of Hermogenes, who introduces matter as having no beginning,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3584_1216544">356</A></SUP> and then compares it with God, who has no beginning.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3585_1216649">357</A></SUP> By thus making the mother of the elements a goddess, he has it in his power "to be in bondage" to a being which he puts on a par with<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3586_1216804">358</A></SUP> God. John, however, in the Apocalypse is charged to chastise those "who eat things sacrificed to idols," and "who commit fornication."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3587_1216956">359</A></SUP> There are even now another sort of Nicolaitans.Theirs is called the Gaian<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn35.htm#P3588_1217050">360</A></SUP> heresy.

By the devil, of course, to whom pertain those wiles which pervert the truth, and who, by the mystic rites of his idols, vies even with the essential portions<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3667_1234845">418</A></SUP> of the sacraments of God.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3668_1234883">419</A></SUP> He, too, baptizes some-that is, his own believers and faithful followers;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3669_1235135">420</A></SUP> he promises the putting away<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3670_1235244">421</A></SUP> of sins by a layer (of his own); and if my memory still serves me, Mithra there, (in the kingdom of Satan, ) sets his marks on the foreheads of his soldiers; celebrates also the oblation of bread, and introduces an image of a resurrection, and before a sword wreathes a crown.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3671_1235543">422</A></SUP> What also must we say to (Satan's) limiting his chief priest<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3672_1235783">423</A></SUP> to a single marriage? He, too, has his virgins; he, too, has his proficients in continence.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3673_1235942">424</A></SUP> Suppose now we revolve in our minds the superstitions of Numa Pompilius, and consider his priestly offices and badges and privileges, his sacrificial services, too, and the instruments and vessels of the sacrifices themselves, and the curious rites of his expiations and vows: is it not clear to us that the devil imitated the well-known<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3674_1236477">425</A></SUP> moroseness of the Jewish law? Since, therefore he has Shown such emulation in his great aim of expressing, in the concerns of his idolatry, those very things of which consists the administration of Christ's sacraments, it follows, of course, that the same being, possessing still the same genius, both set his heart upon,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3675_1236973">426</A></SUP> and succeeded in, adapting<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3676_1237016">427</A></SUP> to his profane and rival creed the very documents of divine things and of the Christian saints<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3677_1237131">428</A></SUP> -his interpretation from their interpretations, his words from their words, his parables from their parables. For this reason, then, no one ought to doubt, either that "spiritual wickednesses," from which also heresies come, have been introduced by the devil, or that there is any real difference between heresies and idolatry, seeing that they appertain both to the same author and the same work that idolatry does. They either pretend that there is another god in opposition to the Creator, or, even if they acknowledge that the Creator is the one only God, they treat of Him as a different being from what He is in truth. The consequence is, that every lie which they speak of God is in a certain sense a sort of idolatry</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XLI.-The Conduct of Heretics: Its Frivolity, Worldliness, and Irregularity. The Notorious Wantonness of Their Women.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>I must not omit an account of the conduct<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3681_1238071">429</A></SUP> also of the heretics-how frivolous it is, how worldly, how merely human, without seriousness, without authority, without discipline, as suits their creed. To begin with, it is doubtful who is a catechumen, and who a believer; they have all access alike, they hear alike, they pray alike-even heathens, if any such happen to come among them. "That which is holy they will cast to the dogs, and their pearls," although (to be sure) they are not real ones, "they will fling to the swine."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3682_1238580">430</A></SUP> Simplicity they will have to consist in the overthrow of discipline, attention to which on our part they call brotherly.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3683_1238726">431</A></SUP> Peace also they huddle up<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3684_1238813">432</A></SUP> anyhow with all comers; for it matters not to them, however different be their treatment of subjects, provided only they can conspire together to storm the citadel of the one only Truth. All are puffed up, all offer you knowledge. Their catechumens are perfect before they are full-taught.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3685_1239119">433</A></SUP> The very women of these heretics, how wanton they are! For they are bold enough to teach, to dispute, to enact exorcisms, to undertake<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3686_1239269">434</A></SUP> cures-it may be even to baptize.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3687_1239323">435</A></SUP> Their ordinations, are carelessly. administered,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3688_1239487">436</A></SUP> capricious, changeable.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3689_1239529">437</A></SUP> At one time they put <I>novices</I> in office; at another time, men who are bound to some secular employment;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3690_1239766">438</A></SUP> at another, persons who have apostatized from us, to bind them by vainglory, since they cannot by the truth. Nowhere is promotion easier than in the camp of rebels, where the mere fact of being there is a foremost service.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3691_1240016">439</A></SUP> And so it comes to pass that to-day one man is their bishop, to-morrow another; to-day he is a deacon who to-morrow is a reader; to-day he is a presbyter who tomorrow is a layman. For even on laymen do they impose the functions of priesthood.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XLII.-Heretics Work to Pull Down and to Destroy, Not to Edify and Elevate. Heretics Do Not Adhere Even to Their Own Traditions, But Harbour Dissent Even from Their Own Founders.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>But what shall I say concerning the ministry of the word, since they make it their business not to convert the heathen, but to subvert our people? This is rather the glory which they catch at, to compass the fall of those who stand, not the raising of those who are down. Accordingly, since the very work which they purpose to themselves comes not from the building up of their own society, but from the demolition of the truth, they undermine our edifices, that they may erect their own. Only deprive them of the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the divinity of the Creator, and they have not another objection to talk about. The consequence is, that they more easily accomplish the ruin of standing houses than the erection of fallen ruins. It is only when they have such objects in view that they show themselves humble and bland and respectful. Otherwise they know no respect even for their own leaders. Hence it is [supposed] that schisms seldom happen among heretics, because, even when they exist, they are not obvious.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3695_1241496">440</A></SUP> Their very unity, however,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3696_1241542">441</A></SUP> is schism. I am greatly in error if they do not amongst themselves swerve even from their own regulations, forasmuch as every man, just as it suits his own temper, modifies the traditions he has received after the same fashion as the man who handed them down did, when he moulded them according to his own will. The progress of the matter is an acknowledgment at once of its character and of the manner of its birth. That was allowable to the Valentinians which had been allowed to Valentinus; that was also fair for the Marcionites which had been done by Marcion-even to innovate on the faith, as was agreeable to their own pleasure. In short, all heresies, when thoroughly looked into, are detected harbouring dissent in many particulars even from their own founders. The majority of them have not even churches.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3697_1242427">442</A></SUP> Motherless, houseless, creedless, outcasts, they wander about in their own essential worthlessness.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn36.htm#P3698_1242739">443</A></SUP> </P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XLIII.-Loose Company Preferred by Heretics. Ungodliness the Effect of Their Teaching the Very Opposite of Catholic Truth, Which Promotes the Fear of God, Both in Religious Ordinances and Practical Life.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>It has also been a subject of remark, how extremely frequent is the intercourse which heretics hold with magicians, with mountebanks, with astrologers, with philosophers; and the reason is,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3702_1243309">444</A></SUP> that they are men who devote themselves to curious questions. "Seek, and ye shall find," is everywhere in their minds. Thus, from the very nature of their conduct, may be estimated the quality of their faith. In their discipline we have an index of their doctrine. They say that God is not to be feared; therefore all things are in their view free and unchecked. Where, however is God not feared, except where He <I>is</I> not? Where God is not, there truth also is not. Where there is no truth, then, naturally enough, there is also such a discipline as theirs. But where God is, there exists "the fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3703_1243966">445</A></SUP> Where the fear of God is, there is seriousness, an honourable and yet thoughtful<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3704_1244079">446</A></SUP> diligence, as well as an anxious carefulness and a well-considered admission (to the sacred ministry)<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3705_1244246">447</A></SUP> and a safely-guarded<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3706_1244339">448</A></SUP> communion, and promotion after good service, and a scrupulous submission (to authority), and a devout attendance,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3707_1244549">449</A></SUP> and a modest gait, and a united church, and God <I>in</I> all things.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XLIV.-Heresy Lowers Respect for Christ, and Destroys All Fear of His Great Judgment. The Tendency of Heretical Teaching on This Solemn Article of the Faith. The Present Treatise an Introduction to Certain Other Anti-Heretical Works of Our Author.</FONT></P>

  </UL><P>These evidences, then, of a stricter discipline existing among us, are an additional proof of truth, from which no man can safely turn aside, who bears in mind that future judgment, when "we must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3711_1245226">450</A></SUP> to render an account of our faith itself before all things. What, then, will they say who shall have defiled it, even the virgin which Christ committed to them with the adultery of heretics? I suppose they will allege that no injunction was ever addressed to them by Him or by His apostles concerning depraved<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3712_1245557">451</A></SUP> and perverse doctrines assailing them,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3713_1245612">452</A></SUP> or about their avoiding and abhorring the same. (He and His apostles, perhaps, ) will acknowledge<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3714_1245726">453</A></SUP> that the blame rather lies with themselves and their disciples, in not having given us previous warning and instruction! They<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3715_1246165">454</A></SUP> will, besides, add a good deal respecting the high authority of each doctor of heresy,-how that these mightily strengthened belief in their own doctrine; how that they raised the dead, restored the sick, foretold the future, that so they might deservedly be regarded as apostles. As if this caution were not also in the written record: that many should come who were to work even the greatest miracles, in defence of the deceit of their corrupt preaching. So, forsooth, they will deserve to be forgiven! If, however, any, being mindful of the writings and the denunciations of the Lord and the apostles, shall have stood firm in the integrity of the faith, I suppose <I>they</I> will run great risk of missing pardon, when the Lord answers: I plainly forewarned you that there should be teachers of false doctrine in my name, as well as that of the prophets and apostles also; and to my own disciples did I give a charge, that they should preach the same things to you. But as for you, it was not, of course, to be supposed<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3716_1247263">455</A></SUP> that you would believe me! I once gave the gospel and the doctrine of the said rule (of life and faith) to my apostles; but afterwards it was my pleasure to make considerable changes in it! I had promised a resurrection, even of the flesh; but, on second thoughts, it struck me<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3717_1247706">456</A></SUP> that I might not be able to keep my promise! I had shown myself to have been born of a virgin; but this seemed to me afterwards to be a discreditable thing.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3718_1247882">457</A></SUP> I had said that He was my Father, who is the Maker of the sun and the showers; but another and better father has adopted me! I had forbidden you to lend an ear to heretics; but in this I erred! Such (blasphemies), it is possible,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3719_1248126">458</A></SUP> do enter the minds of those who go out of the right path,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3720_1248198">459</A></SUP> and who do not defend<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3721_1248239">460</A></SUP> the true faith from the danger which besets it. On the present occasion, indeed, our treatise has rather taken up a general position against heresies, (showing that they must) all be refuted on definite, equitable, and necessary rules, without<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3722_1248498">461</A></SUP> any comparison with the Scriptures. For the rest, if God in His grace permit, we shall prepare answers to certain of these heresies in separate treatises.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3723_1248737">462</A></SUP> To those who may devote their leisure in reading through these (pages), in the belief of the truth, be peace, and the grace of our God Jesus Christ for ever.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn37.htm#P3724_1249194">463</A></SUP> </P>
