</UL><P>The Spirit of God, and the Word of God, and the Reason of God-Word of Reason, and Reason and Spirit of Word-Jesus Christ our Lord, namely, who is both the one and the other,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11766_3301913">2</A></SUP> -has determined for us, the disciples of the New Testament, a new form of prayer; for in this particular also it was needful that new wine should be laid up in new skins, and a new breadth be sewn to a new garment.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11767_3302254">3</A></SUP> Besides, whatever had been in bygone days, has either been quite changed, as circumcision; or else supplemented, as the rest of the Law; or else fulfilled, as Prophecy; or else perfected, as faith itself. For the new grace of God has renewed all things from carnal unto spiritual, by superinducing the Gospel, the obliterator of the whole ancient bygone system; in which our Lord Jesus Christ has been approved as the Spirit of God, and the Word of God, and the Reason of God: the Spirit, by which He was mighty; the Word, by which He taught; the Reason, by which He came.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11768_3302881">4</A></SUP> So the prayer composed by Christ has been composed of three parts. In speech,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11769_3303037">5</A></SUP> by which <I>prayer</I> is enunciated, in spirit, by which alone it prevails, even John had taught his disciples to pray,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11770_3303163">6</A></SUP> but all John's doings were laid as groundwork for Christ, until, when "He had increased "-just as the same John used to fore-announce "that it was needful" that "He should increase and himself decrease"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11771_3303945">7</A></SUP> -the whole work of the forerunner passed over, together with his spirit itself, unto the Lord. Therefore, after what form of words John taught to pray is not extant, because earthly things have given place to heavenly. "He who is from the earth," says John, "speaketh earthly things; and He who is here from the heavens speaketh those things which He hath seen."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11772_3304325">8</A></SUP> And what is the Lord Christ's-as this method of praying is-<I>that</I> is <I>not</I> heavenly? And so, blessed <I>brethren</I>, let us consider His heavenly wisdom: first, touching the precept of praying secretly, whereby He exacted man's faith, that he should be confident that the sight and hearing of Almighty God are present beneath roofs, and extend even into the secret place; and required modesty in faith, that it should offer its religious homage to Him alone, whom it believed to see and to hear everywhere. Further, since wisdom succeeded in the following precept, let it in like manner appertain unto faith, and the modesty of faith, that we think not that the Lord must be approached with a train of words, who, we are certain, takes unsolicited foresight for His own. And yet that very brevity-and let this make for the third grade of wisdom-is supported on the substance of a great and blessed interpretation, and is as diffuse in meaning as it is compressed in words. For it has embraced not only the special duties of prayer, be it veneration of God or petition for man, but almost every discourse of the Lord, every record of <I>His</I> Discipline; so that, in fact, in the Prayer is comprised an epitome of the whole Gospel. </P>

</UL><P>The prayer begins with a testimony to God, and with the reward of faith, when we say, "Our Father who art in the heavens; "for (in so saying), we at once pray to God, and commend faith, whose reward this appellation is. It is written, "To them who believed on Him He gave power to be called sons of God."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11776_3305897">9</A></SUP> However, our Lord very frequently proclaimed God as a Father to us; nay, even gave a precept "that we call no one on earth father, but the Father whom we have in the heavens:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11777_3306088">10</A></SUP> and so, in thus praying, we are likewise obeying the precept. Happy they who recognize their Father! This is the reproach that is brought against Israel, to which the Spirit attests heaven and earth, saying, "I have begotten sons, and they have not recognized me."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11778_3306374">11</A></SUP> Moreover, in saying "Father," we also call Him "God." That appellation is one both of filial duty and of power. Again, in the Father the Son is invoked; "for I," saith He, "and the Father are One."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11779_3306588">12</A></SUP> Nor is even our mother the Church passed by, if, that is, in the Father and the Son is recognized the mother, from whom arises the name both of Father and of Son. In one general term, then, or word, we both honour God, together with His own,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11780_3306847">13</A></SUP> and are mindful of the precept, and set a mark on such as have forgotten their Father.</P>

</UL><P>The name of "God the Father" had been published to none. Even Moses, who had interrogated Him on that very point, had heard a different name.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11784_3307171">14</A></SUP> To us it has been revealed in the Son, for the Son is now the Father's new name. "I am come," saith He, "in the Father's name; "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11785_3307321">15</A></SUP> and again, "Father, glorify Thy name; "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11786_3307378">16</A></SUP> and more openly, "I have manifested Thy name to men."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11787_3307451">17</A></SUP> That <I>name</I>, therefore, we pray may "be hallowed." Not that it is becoming for men to <I>wish</I> God <I>well</I>, as if there were any other<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11788_3307596">18</A></SUP> by whom He may be wished well, or as if He would suffer unless we do so wish. Plainly, it is universally becoming for God to be <I>blessed</I><SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11789_3307760">19</A></SUP> in every place and time, on account of the memory of His benefits ever due from every man. But this petition also serves the turn of a blessing. Otherwise, when is the name of God not "holy," and "hallowed" through Himself, seeing that of Himself He sanctifies all others-He to whom that surrounding circle of angels cease not to say, "Holy, holy, holy? "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11790_3308135">20</A></SUP> In like wise, therefore, we too, candidates for angelhood, if we succeed in deserving it, begin even here on earth to learn by heart that strain hereafter to be raised unto God, and the function of future glory. So far, for the glory of God. On the other hand, for our own petition, when we say, "Hallowed be Thy name," we pray this; that it may be hallowed <I>in us</I> who are in Him, as well in all others for whom the grace of God is still waiting;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11791_3308610">21</A></SUP> that we may obey this precept, too, in "praying for all,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11792_3308687">22</A></SUP> even for our personal enemies.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11793_3308737">23</A></SUP> And therefore with suspended utterance, not saying, "Hallowed be it <I>in us</I>, "we say,-"<I>in all</I>."</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P11795_3308847"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter IV.-The Third Clause.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>According to this model,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11797_3308902">24</A></SUP> we subjoin, "Thy will be done in the heavens and on the earth; "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11798_3309165">25</A></SUP> not that there is some power withstanding<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn117.htm#P11799_3309369">26</A></SUP> to prevent God's will being done, and we pray for Him the successful achievement of His will; but we pray for His will to be done <I>in all</I>. For, by figurative interpretation of <I>flesh</I> and <I>spirit, we</I> are "heaven" and "earth; "albeit, even if it is to be understood simply, still the sense of the petition is the same, that <I>in us</I> God's will be done on earth, to make it possible, namely, for it to be done also in the heavens. What, moreover, <I>does</I> God will, but that we should walk according to His Discipline? We make petition, then, that He supply us with the substance of His will, and the capacity to do it, that we may be saved both in the heavens and on earth; because the sum of His will is the salvation of them whom He has adopted. There is, too, that will of God which the Lord accomplished in preaching, in working, in enduring: for if He Himself proclaimed that He did not His own, but the Father's will, without doubt those things which He used to do <I>were</I> the Father's will;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11800_3310369">27</A></SUP> unto which things, as unto exemplars, we are now provoked;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11801_3310445">28</A></SUP> to preach, to work, to endure even unto death. And we <I>need</I> the will of God, that we may be able to fulfil these duties. Again, in saying, "Thy will be done," we are even wishing well to ourselves, in so far that there is nothing of <I>evil</I> in the will of God; even if, proportionably to each one's deserts, somewhat other<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11802_3310832">29</A></SUP> is imposed on us. So by this expression we premonish our own selves unto patience. The Lord also, when He had wished to demonstrate to us, even in His own flesh, the flesh's infirmity, by the reality of suffering, said, "Father, remove this Thy cup; "and remembering Himself, <I>added</I>, "save that not my will, but Thine be done."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11803_3311208">30</A></SUP> Himself <I>was</I> the Will and the Power of the Father: and yet, for the demonstration of the patience which was due, He gave Himself up <I>to</I> the Father's Will.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P11805_3311379"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter V.-The Fourth Clause.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>"Thy kingdom come" has also reference to that whereto "Thy will be done" refers-<I>in us</I>, that is. For when does God not reign, in whose hand is the heart of all kings?<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11807_3311575">31</A></SUP> But whatever we wish for ourselves we augur for Him, and <I>to</I> Him we attribute what <I>from</I> Him we expect. And so, if the <I>manifestation</I> of the Lord's kingdom pertains unto the will of God and unto our anxious expectation, how do some pray for some protraction of the age,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11808_3311861">32</A></SUP> when the kingdom of God, which we pray may arrive, tends unto the consummation of the age?<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11809_3311979">33</A></SUP> Our wish is, that our reign be hastened, not our servitude protracted. Even if it had not been prescribed in the Prayer that we should ask for the advent of the kingdom, we should, unbidden, have sent forth that cry, hastening toward the realization of our hope. The souls of the martyrs beneath the altar<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11810_3312497">34</A></SUP> cry in jealousy unto the Lord "How long, Lord, dost Thou not avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the earth? "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11811_3312623">35</A></SUP> for, of course, their avenging is regulated by<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11812_3312688">36</A></SUP> the end of the age. Nay, Lord, Thy kingdom come with all speed,-the prayer of Christians the confusion of the heathen,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11813_3312851">37</A></SUP> the exultation of angels, for the sake of which we suffer, nay, rather, for the sake of which we pray!</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P11815_3312991"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VI.-The Fifth Clause.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>But how gracefully has the Divine Wisdom arranged the order of the prayer; so that <I>after</I> things heavenly-that is, after the "Name" of God, the "Will" of God, and the "Kingdom" of God-it should give earthly necessities also room for a petition! For the Lord had<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11817_3313282">38</A></SUP> withal issued His edict, "Seek ye first the kingdom, and then even these shall be added: "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11818_3313708">39</A></SUP> albeit we may rather understand, "Give us this day our daily bread," <I>spiritually</I>. For <I>Christ</I> is our Bread; because Christ is Life, and bread is life. "I am," saith He, "the Bread of Life; "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11819_3313917">40</A></SUP> and, a little above, "The Bread is the Word of the living God, who came down from the heavens."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11820_3314031">41</A></SUP> Then <I>we find</I>, too, that His body is reckoned in bread: "This is my body."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11821_3314123">42</A></SUP> And so, in petitioning for "daily bread," we ask for perpetuity in Christ, and indivisibility from His body. But, because that word is admissible in a carnal sense too, it cannot be so used without the religious remembrance withal of spiritual Discipline; for (the Lord) commands that <I>bread</I> be prayed for, which is the only <I>food</I> necessary for believers; for "all other things the nations seek after."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11822_3314545">43</A></SUP> The like lesson He both inculcates by examples, and repeatedly handles in parables, when He says, "Doth a father take away <I>bread</I> from his children, and hand it to dogs? "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11823_3314735">44</A></SUP> and again, "Doth a father give his son a stone when he asks for <I>bread</I>? "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11824_3314871">45</A></SUP> For He <I>thus</I> shows what it is that sons expect from their father. Nay, even that nocturnal knocker knocked for "<I>bread</I>."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11825_3315022">46</A></SUP> Moreover, He Justly added, "Give us <I>this day</I>," seeing He had previously said, "Take no careful thought about the morrow, what ye are to eat."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11826_3315183">47</A></SUP> To which subject He also adapted the parable of the man who pondered on an enlargement of his barns for his forthcoming fruits, and on seasons of prolonged security; but that very night he dies.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11827_3315502">48</A></SUP> </P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VII.-The Sixth Clause.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>It was suitable that, after contemplating the liberality of God,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11831_3315619">49</A></SUP> we should likewise address His clemency. For what will aliments<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11832_3315748">50</A></SUP> profit us, if we are really <I>consigned</I> to them, as it were a bull destined for a victim?<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11833_3315866">51</A></SUP> The Lord knew Himself to be the only guiltless One, and so He teaches that we beg "to have our debts remitted us." A petition for pardon is a full confession; because he who begs for pardon fully admits his guilt. Thus, too, penitence is demonstrated acceptable to God who desires it rather than the death of the sinner.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11834_3316350">52</A></SUP> Moreover, <I>debt</I> is, in the Scriptures, a figure of <I>guilt</I>; because it is equally due to the sentence of judgment, and is exacted by it: nor does it evade the justice of exaction, unless the exaction be remitted, just as the lord remitted to that slave <I>in the parable</I> his debt;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11835_3316661">53</A></SUP> for hither does the scope of the whole parable tend. For the fact withal, that the same servant, after liberated by his lord, does not equally spare his own debtor; and, being on that account impeached before his lord, is made over to the tormentor to pay the uttermost farthing-that is, every guilt, however small: corresponds with our profession that "we also remit to our debtors; "indeed elsewhere, too, in conformity with this Form of Prayer, He saith, "Remit, and it shall be remitted you."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11836_3317183">54</A></SUP> And when Peter had put the question whether remission were to be granted to a brother seven times, "Nay," saith He, "seventy-seven times; "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11837_3317341">55</A></SUP> in order to remould the Law for the better; because in Genesis <I>vengeance</I> was assigned "seven times" in the case of Cain, but in that of Lamech "seventy-seven times."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn118.htm#P11838_3317532">56</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>In summaries of so few words, how many utterances of the prophets, the Gospels, the apostles-how many discourses, examples, parables of the Lord, are touched on! How many duties are simultaneously discharged! The honour of God in the "Father; "the testimony of faith in the "Name; "the offering of obedience in the "Will; "the commemoration of hope in the "Kingdom; "the petition for life in the "Bread; "the full acknowledgment of debts in the prayer for their "Forgiveness; "the anxious dread of temptation in the request for "Protection." What wonder? God alone could teach how he wished Himself prayed to. The religious rite of prayer therefore, ordained by Himself, and animated, even at the moment when it was issuing out of the Divine mouth, by His own Spirit, ascends, by its own prerogative, into heaven, commending to the Father what the Son has taught.</P>

</UL><P>They who make this concession<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11945_3334751">115</A></SUP> ought to reflect on the nature of the word itself-what is the meaning of "woman" from the very first records of the sacred writings. Here they find it to be the <I>name of the sex</I>, not a <I>class of the sex</I>: if, that is, God gave to Eve, when she had not yet known a man, the surname "woman" and "female"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11946_3335110">116</A></SUP> -("female," whereby the sex generally; "woman," hereby a class of the sex, is marked).<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11947_3335285">117</A></SUP> So, since at that time the as yet unwedded Eve was called by the word "woman," that word has been made common even to a virgin.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11948_3335569">118</A></SUP> Nor is it wonderful that the apostle-guided, of course, by the same Spirit by whom, as all the divine Scripture, so that book Genesis, was drawn up-has used the selfsame word in writing "women," which, by the example of Eve unwedded, is applicable too to a "virgin." In fact, all the other passages are in consonance herewith. For even by this very fact, that he has not <I>named</I> "virgins" (as he does in another place<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11949_3336175">119</A></SUP> where he is teaching touching marrying), he sufficiently predicates that his remark is made touching <I>every</I> woman, and touching <I>the whole</I> sex; and that there is no distinction made between a "virgin" <I>and any other</I>, while he does not name her at all. For he who elsewhere-namely, where the difference requires-remembers to make the distinction, (moreover, he makes it by designating each species by their appropriate names, ) wishes, where he makes <I>no</I> distinction (while he does not name each), <I>no</I> difference to be understood. What of the fact that in the Greek speech, in which the apostle wrote his letters, it is usual to say, "women" rather than "females; "that is, <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>gunai=kaj</FONT> (<FONT FACE="Semitica Dict">gunaikas</FONT>) rather than <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>qhlei/aj</FONT> (<FONT FACE="Semitica Dict">theleias</FONT>)? Therefore if that word,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11950_3336952">120</A></SUP> which by interpretation represents what "female" (<I>femina</I>) represents,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11951_3337036">121</A></SUP> is frequently used <I>instead</I> of the name of the sex<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11952_3337467">122</A></SUP> he has named the <I>sex</I> in saying <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>gunai=ka</FONT>; but in the <I>sex</I> even the <I>virgin</I> is embraced. But, withal, the declaration is plain: "<I>Every</I> woman," saith he, "praying and prophesying with head uncovered,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11953_3337678">123</A></SUP> dishonoureth her own head."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11954_3337729">124</A></SUP> What is "<I>every</I> woman, but <I>woman</I> of every age, of every rank, of every condition? By saying" every" he excepts nought of womanhood, just as he excepts nought of manhood either from not being covered; for just so he says, "<I>Every man</I>."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11955_3337983">125</A></SUP> As, then, in the masculine sex, under the name of" man" even the" youth" is <I>forbidden</I> to be veiled; so, too, in the feminine, under the name of "woman," even the "virgin" is <I>bidden</I> to be veiled. Equally in each sex let the younger age follow the discipline of the elder; or else let the male "virgins,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11956_3338307">126</A></SUP> too, be <I>veiled</I>, if the female virgins withal are <I>not</I> veiled, because <I>they</I> are not mentioned by <I>name</I>. Let "man" and "youth" be different, if "woman" and "virgin" are different. For indeed it is "on account of the angels"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11957_3338591">127</A></SUP> that he saith women must be veiled, because on account of "the daughters of men" angels revolted from God.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11958_3338720">128</A></SUP> Who then, would contend that "<I>women</I>" <I>alone</I>-that is,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11959_3339001">129</A></SUP> such as were already wedded and had lost their virginity-were the objects of angelic concupiscence, unless "virgins" are incapable of excelling in beauty and finding lovers? Nay, let us see whether it were not <I>virgins alone</I> whom they lusted after; since Scriptures saith "<I>the daughters</I> of men; "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11960_3339369">130</A></SUP> inasmuch as it might have named "<I>wives</I> of men," or "females," indifferently.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11961_3339465">131</A></SUP> Likewise, in that it saith, "And they took them to themselves for wives,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11962_3339657">132</A></SUP> it does so on this ground, that, of course, such are "received <I>for wives</I>" as are devoid of that title. But it would have expressed itself differently concerning such as were <I>not</I> thus devoid. And so (they who are named) are devoid as much of <I>widowhood</I> as of <I>virginity</I>. So completely has <I>Paul</I> by naming the sex generally, mingled "daughters" and species together in the genus. Again, while he says that "nature herself,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11963_3340095">133</A></SUP> which has assigned hair as a tegument and ornament to women, "teaches that veiling is the duty of females," has not the same tegument and the same honour of the head been assigned also to virgins? If "it is shameful" for a woman to be shorn it is similarly so to a virgin too.

This custom,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11968_3340746">138</A></SUP> in short, even Israel observes; but if <I>Israel</I> did <I>not</I> observe it, <I>our</I> Law,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11969_3340865">139</A></SUP> amplified and supplemented, would vindicate the addition for itself; let it be excused for imposing the veil on virgins also. Under <I>our</I> dispensation, let that age which is ignorant of its sex<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11970_3341104">140</A></SUP> retain the privilege of simplicity. For both Eve and Adam, when it befell them to be "wise,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11971_3341223">141</A></SUP> forthwith veiled what they had learnt to know?<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11972_3341290">142</A></SUP> At all events, with regard to those in whom girlhood has changed (into maturity), their age ought to remember its duties as to nature, so also, to discipline; for they are being transferred to the rank of "women" both in their persons and in their functions. No one is a "virgin" from the time when she is capable of marriage; seeing that, in her, age has by that time been wedded to its own husband, that is, to time.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11973_3341773">143</A></SUP> "But some particular <I>virgin</I> has devoted herself to God. From that very moment she both changes the fashion of her hair, and converts all her garb into that of a `woman.'" Let her, then, maintain the character wholly, and perform the whole function of a "virgin: "what she conceals<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11974_3342101">144</A></SUP> for the sake of God, let her cover quite over.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11975_3342188">145</A></SUP> It is our business to entrust to the knowledge of God alone that which the grace of God effects in us, test we receive from man the reward we hope for from God.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11976_3342372">146</A></SUP> Why do you denude before God<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11977_3342659">147</A></SUP> what you cover before men?<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11978_3342710">148</A></SUP> Will you be more modest in public than in the church? If <I>your self-devotion</I> is a grace of God, and you have received it, "why do you boast," saith he, "as if you have not received it? "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11979_3342939">149</A></SUP> Why, by your ostentation of yourself, do you judge others? Is it that, by your boasting, you invite others unto good? Nay, but even you yourself run the risk of losing, if you boast; and you drive others unto the same perils What is assumed from love of boasting is easily destroyed. Be veiled, virgin, if virgin you are; for you ought to blush. If you are a virgin, shrink from (the gaze of) many eyes. Let no one wonder at your face; let no one perceive your falsehood.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11980_3343432">150</A></SUP> You do well in falsely assuming the married character, if you veil your head; nay, you do not seem to assume it <I>falsely</I>, for you <I>are</I> wedded to Christ: to Him you have surrendered your body; act as becomes your Husband's discipline. If He bids the brides of others to be veiled, His own, of course, much more. "But each individual man<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11981_3344005">151</A></SUP> is not to think that the institution of his predecessor is to be overturned." Many yield up their own judgment, and its consistency, to the custom of others. Granted that <I>virgins</I> be not <I>compelled</I> to be veiled, at all events such as <I>voluntarily are</I> so should not be prohibited; who, likewise, cannot deny themselves to be virgins,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11982_3344386">152</A></SUP> content, in the security of a good conscience before God, to damage their own fame.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11983_3344561">153</A></SUP> Touching such, however, as are betrothed, I can with constancy "above my small measure"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11984_3344741">154</A></SUP> pronounce and attest that they are to be veiled from that day forth on which they shuddered at the first bodily touch of a man by kiss and hand. For in them everything has been forewedded: their age, through maturity; their flesh, through age; their spirit, through consciousness; their modesty, through the experience of the kiss their hope, through expectation; their mind through volition. And Rebecca is example enough for us, who, when her betrothed had been pointed out, veiled herself for marriage merely on recognition of him.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11985_3345504">155</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>In the matter of <I>kneeling</I> also prayer is subject to diversity of observance, through the act of some few who abstain from kneeling on the Sabbath; and since this dissension is particularly on its trial before the churches, the Lord will give His grace that the dissentients may either yield, or else indulge their opinion without offence to others. We, however (just as we have received), only on the day of the Lord's Resurrection ought to guard not only against kneeling, but every posture and office of solicitude; deferring even our businesses lest we give any place to the devil.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11989_3346142">156</A></SUP> Similarly, too, in the period of Pentecost; which period we distinguish by the same solemnity of exultation.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn119.htm#P11990_3346271">157</A></SUP> But who would hesitate <I>every</I> day to prostrate himself before God, at least in the first prayer with which we enter on the daylight?

The first infusion of the Holy Spirit into the congregated disciples took place at "the third hour."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12005_3348643">166</A></SUP> Peter, on the day on which he experienced the vision of Universal Community,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12006_3348749">167</A></SUP> (exhibited) in that small vessel,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12007_3348926">168</A></SUP> had ascended into the more lofty parts <I>of the house</I>, for prayer's sake "at the sixth hour."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12008_3349182">169</A></SUP> The same (apostle) was going into the temple, with John, at the ninth <I>hour</I>,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12009_3349277">170</A></SUP> when he restored the paralytic to his health. Albeit these <I>practices</I> stand simply without any <I>precept</I> for their observance, still it may be granted a good thing to establish some definite presumption, which may both add stringency to the admonition to, pray, and may, as it were by a law, tear us out from our businesses unto such a duty; so that-what we read to have been observed by Daniel also,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12010_3349780">171</A></SUP> in accordance (of course) with Israel's discipline-we pray at least not less than thrice in the day, debtors as we are to Three-Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: of course, in addition to our regular prayers which are due, without any admonition, on the entrance of light and of night. But, withal, it becomes believers not to take food, and not to go to the bath, before interposing a prayer; for the refreshments and nourishments of the spirit are to be held prior to those of the flesh, and things heavenly prior to things earthly.</P>

"How mighty specimens of its efficacy do we read, and hear, and believe! <I>Old-world</I> prayer, indeed, used to free from fires,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12038_3353585">187</A></SUP> and from beasts,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12039_3353619">188</A></SUP> and from famine;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12040_3353652">189</A></SUP> and yet it had not (then) received its form from Christ. But how far more amply operative is <I>Christian</I> prayer! It does not station the angel of dew in mid-fires,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12041_3353854">190</A></SUP> nor muzzle lions, nor transfer to the hungry the rustics' bread;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12042_3354104">191</A></SUP> it has no delegated grace to avert any sense of suffering;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12043_3354190">192</A></SUP> but it supplies the suffering, and the feeling, and the grieving, with endurance: it amplifies grace by virtue, that faith may know what she obtains from the Lord, understanding what-for God's name's sake-she suffers. But in days gone by, withal prayer used to call down<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12044_3354559">193</A></SUP> plagues, scatter the armies of foes, withhold the wholesome influences of the showers. Now, however, the prayer of righteousness avers all God's anger, keeps bivouac on behalf of personal enemies, makes supplication on behalf of persecutors. Is it wonder if <I>it</I> knows how to extort the <I>rains</I> of heaven<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12045_3354882">194</A></SUP> -(prayer) which was <I>once</I> able to procure its <I>fires</I>?<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12046_3354968">195</A></SUP> Prayer is alone that which vanquishes<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12047_3355028">196</A></SUP> God. But Christ has willed that it be operative for no evil: He had conferred on it all its virtue in the cause of good. And so it knows nothing save how to recall the souls of the departed from the very path of death, to transform the weak, to restore the sick, to purge the possessed, to open prison-bars, to loose the bonds of the innocent. Likewise it washes away faults, repels temptations, extinguishes persecutions, consoles the faint-spirited, cheers the high-spirited, escorts travellers, appeases waves, makes robbers stand aghast, nourishes the poor, governs the rich, upraises the fallen, arrests the falling, confirms the standing. Prayer is the wall of faith: her arms and missiles<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12048_3355800">197</A></SUP> against the foe who keeps watch over us on all sides. And, so never walk we unarmed. By day, be we mindful of Station; by night, of vigil. Under the arms of prayer guard we the standard of our General; await we in prayer the angel's trump.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12049_3356089">198</A></SUP> The angels, likewise, all pray; every creature prays; cattle and wild beasts pray and bend their knees; and when they issue from their layers and lairs,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12050_3356281">199</A></SUP> they look up heavenward with no idle mouth, making their breath vibrate<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12051_3356381">200</A></SUP> after their own manner. Nay, the birds too, rising out of the nest, upraise themselves heavenward, and, instead of hands, expand the cross of their wings, and say somewhat to seem like prayer.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn120.htm#P12052_3356598">201</A></SUP> What more then, touching the office of prayer? Even the Lord Himself prayed; to whom be honour and virtue unto the ages of the ages! </P>
