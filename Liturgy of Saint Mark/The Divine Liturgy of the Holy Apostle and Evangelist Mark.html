  <P>The Priest prays secretly:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8485_2651762">3</A></SUP> We give Thee thanks, yea, more than thanks, O Lord our God, the Father of our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ, for all Thy goodness at all times and in all places, because Thou hast shielded, rescued, helped, and guided us all the days of our lives, and brought us unto this hour, permitting us gain to stand before Thee in Thy holy place, that we may implore forgiveness of our sins and propitiation to all Thy people. We pray and beseech Thee, merciful God, to grant in Thy goodness that we may spend this holy day<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn84.htm#P8486_2652325">4</A></SUP> and all the time of our lives without sin, in fulness of joy, health, safety, holiness, and reverence of Thee. But all envy, all fear, all temptation, all the influence of Satan, all the snares of wicked men, do Thou, O Lord, drive away from us, and from Thy Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. Bestow upon us, O Lord, what is good and meet. Whatever sin we commit in thought, word, or deed, do Thou in Thy goodness and mercy be pleased to pardon. Leave us not, O Lord, while we hope in Thee; nor lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one and from his works, through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine only-begotten Son.</P>

Graciously bestow upon them peace, health, and salvation. The prayers they offer up for us, and we for them, do Thou, O Lord, receive at Thy holy, heavenly, and reasonable altar. But all the enemies of Thy Holy Church put Thou speedily under their feet, through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine only-begotten Son:</P>

  <P>The Priest offers up the prayer of entrance, and for incense:</P>

  <P>The Priest: O Sovereign Lord our God, who hast chosen the lamp of the twelve apostles with its twelve lights, and hast sent them forth to proclaim throughout the whole world and teach the Gospel of Thy kingdom, and to heal sickness and every weakness among the people, and hast breathed upon their faces and said unto them, Receive the Holy Spirit the Comforter: whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained: Breathe also Thy Holy Spirit upon us Thy servants, who, standing around, are about to enter on Thy holy service,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8515_2656730">11</A></SUP> upon the bishops, elders, deacons, readers, singers, and laity, with the entire body of the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.From the curse and execration, from condemnation, imprisonment, and banishment, and from the portion of the adversary;</P>

</UL><P> O Lord, deliver us.</P>

<P>Purify our lives and cleanse our hearts from all pollution and from all wickedness, that with pure heart and conscience we may offer to Thee this incense for a sweet-smelling savour, and for the remission of our sins and the sins of all Thy people, through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine only-begotten Son:</P>

  <UL><P>(Aloud.) Through whom and with whom be the glory and the power to Thee, with Thy all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now, henceforth, and for evermore.</P>

  <P>The People: And to thy spirit.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Let us pray.</P>

  <P>The People: Lord, have mercy.</P>

  <P>The Priest says the prayer of the Trisagion: O Sovereign Lord Christ Jesus, the co-eternal Word of the eternal Father, who wast made in all things like as we are, but without sin, for the salvation of our race; who hast sent forth Thy holy disciples and apostles to proclaim and teach the Gospel of Thy kingdom, and to heal all disease, all sickness among Thy people, be pleased now, O Lord, to send forth Thy light and Thy truth. Enlighten the eyes of our minds, that we may understand Thy divine oracles. Fit us to become hearers, and not only hearers, but doers of Thy word, that we, becoming fruitful, and yielding good fruit from thirty to an hundred fold, may be deemed worthy of the kingdom of heaven. </P>

  <P>(Aloud.) Let Thy mercy speedily overtake us, O Lord. For Thou art the bringer of good tidings, the Saviour and Guardian of our souls and bodies and we offer glory, thanks, and the <I>Trisagion</I> to Thee, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now, henceforth, and for evermore.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen. Holy God, holy mighty, holy immortal. Holy, holy, holy,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8531_2659024">13</A></SUP> etc.</P>

  <P>VI. After the Trisagion the Priest makes the sign of the cross over the people, and says:- Peace be to all.</P>

  <P>The People: And to thy spirit.</P>

  <P>Then follow the Let us attend;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8535_2659291">14</A></SUP> The Apostle and Prologue of the Hallelujah.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8536_2659352">15</A></SUP> The Deacons, after a prescribed form, say:- Lord, bless us.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8537_2659543">16</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>The Priest before the Gospel is read, offers incense,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8541_2659905">18</A></SUP> and says:- Accept at Thy holy, heavenly, and reasonable altar, O Lord, the incense we offer in presence of Thy sacred glory. Send down upon us in return the grace of Thy Holy Spirit, for Thou art blessed, and let Thy glory encircle us.VII.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: when he is about to read the Gospel, says:-Lord, bless us.</P>

(Aloud.)Through whom and with whom be glory and power to Thee, with Thy all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: IX. Begin.</P>

  <P>Then they say the verse.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8552_2662160">21</A></SUP> The Deacon says-The three.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8553_2662215">22</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>The Priest: O Sovereign and Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, we pray and beseech Thee to fill our hearts with the peace of heaven, and to bestow moreover the peace of this life. Preserve for us through many years our most holy and blessed <I>Papas</I> <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>D</FONT>,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8555_2662564">23</A></SUP> and our most pious Bishop <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>D</FONT>, while they, according to Thy holy and blessed will, peacefully fulfil the holy priesthood committed to their care, and dispense aright the word of truth, with all the orthodox bishops, elders, deacons, sub-deacons,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8556_2662824">24</A></SUP> readers, singers, with the entire body of the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. Bless our meetings, O Lord. Grant that we may hold them without let or hindrance, according to Thy holy will. Be pleased to give to us, and Thy servants after us for ever, houses of praise and prayer. Rise, O Lord, and let Thine enemies be scattered. Let all who hate Thy holy name be put to flight. Bless Thy faithful and orthodox people. Multiply them by thousands and tens of thousands.Let no deadly sin prevail against them, or against Thy holy people, through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine only-begotten Son.</P>

  <P>(Aloud.) Through whom and with whom be glory and power to Thee, with Thy all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>The Priest: Peace be to all.</P>

  <P>The People: And to thy spirit.</P>

</UL><P>The Deacon: Take care that none of the catechumens<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8562_2663704">25</A></SUP> -</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="P8564_2663781"></A>

  <UL><P>Then they sing the Cherubic hymn.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8566_2663819">26</A></SUP> X. The Priest offers incense at the entrance,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8567_2663891">27</A></SUP> and prays:- O Lord our God, who lackest nothing, accept this incense offered by an unworthy hand, and deem us all worthy of Thy blessing, for Thou art our sanctification, and we ascribe glory to Thee.</P>

  <P>The holy things are carried to the altar, and the Priest prays thus:- O holy, highest, awe-inspiring God, who dwellest among the saints, sanctify us, and deem us worthy of Thy reverend priesthood. Bring us to Thy precious altar with a good conscience, and cleanse our hearts from all pollution. Drive away from us all unholy thoughts, and sanctify our souls and minds. Grant that, with reverence of Thee, we may perform the service of our holy fathers, and propitiate Thy presence through all time; for Thou art He who blesseth and sanctifieth all things, and to Thee we ascribe glory and thanks.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: XI. Salute one another.</P>

  <P>The Priest says the prayer of salutation: O Sovereign and Almighty Lord, look down from heaven on Thy Church, on all Thy people, and on all Thy flock. Save us all, Thy unworthy servants, the sheep of Thy fold. Give us Thy peace, Thy help, and Thy love, and send to us the gift of Thy Holy Spirit, that with a pure heart and a good conscience we may salute one another with an holy kiss, without hypocrisy, and with no hostile purpose, but guileless and pure in one spirit, in the bond of peace and love, one body and one spirit, in one faith, even as we have been called in one hope of our calling, that we may all meet in the divine and boundless love, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom Thou art blessed.</P>

  <P>Then the Priest offers the incense, and says:- The incense is offered to Thy name. Let it ascend, we implore Thee, from the hands of Thy poor and sinful servants to Thy heavenly altar for a sweet-smelling savour, and the propitiation of all Thy people. For all glory, honour, adoration, and thanks are due unto Thee, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now, henceforth, and for evermore. Amen.</P>

  <P>After the Salutation,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8573_2665882">28</A></SUP> the Deacon in a loud voice says:- XII. Stand and make the offering duly.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8574_2665981">29</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>The Priest: making the sign of the cross over the disks and chalices, says in a loud voice (the Nicene Creed):-I believe in one God, etc.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Stand for prayer.</P>

  <P>The Priest: Peace be to all.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Pray for those who present the offering.</P>

  <P>The Priest says the prayer of the Oblation.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8580_2666312">30</A></SUP>  O Sovereign Lord, Christ Jesus the Word, who art equal in power with the Father and the Holy Spirit, the great high priest; the bread that came down from heaven, and saved our souls from ruin; who gavest Thyself, a spotless Lamb, for the life of the world....</P>

</UL><P>We pray and beseech Thee, O Lord, in Thy mercy, to let Thy presence rest upon this bread and these chalices<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8582_2666700">31</A></SUP> on the all-holy table, while angels, archangels, and Thy holy priests stand round and minister for Thy glory and the renewing of our souls, through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine only-begotten Son, through whom and with whom be glory and power to Thee.</P>

  <UL><P>And when the People say, And from the Holy Spirit was He made flesh;</P>

  <P>The Priest makes the sign of the cross,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8585_2667171">32</A></SUP> and says:- And was crucified for us.</P>

</UL><P>The Priest makes the sign of the cross again,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8587_2667296">33</A></SUP> and says:- And to the Holy Spirit.</P>

  <P>The People: We lift them up to the Lord.</P>

  <P>The Priest: Let us give thanks to the Lord.</P>

  <P>The People: It is meet and right.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn85.htm#P8598_2667826">36</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>The Priest begins the Anaphoral prayer: O Lord God, Sovereign and Almighty Father, truly it is meet and right, holy and becoming, and good for our souls, to praise, bless, and thank Thee; to make open confession to Thee by day and night with voice, lips, and heart without ceasing;</P>

</UL><P>To Thee who hast made the heaven, and all that is therein; the earth, and all that is therein; The sea, fountains, rivers, lakes, and all that is therein;</P>

<P>To Thee who, after Thine own image and likeness, hast made man, upon whom Thou didst also bestow the joys of Paradise;</P>

<P>And when he trespassed against Thee, Thou didst neither neglect nor forsake him, good Lord,</P>

<P>But didst recall him by Thy law, instruct him by Thy prophets, restore and renew him by this awful, life-giving, and heavenly mystery.</P>

<P>And all this Thou hast done by Thy Wisdom and the Light of truth, Thine only-begotten Son, our Lord, God, and Saviour Jesus Christ, Through whom, thanking Thee with Him and the Holy Spirit,</P>

<P>We offer this reasonable and bloodless sacrifice, which all nations, from the rising to the setting of the sun, from the north and the south, present to Thee, O Lord; for great is Thy name among all peoples, and in all places are incense, sacrifice, and oblation offered to Thy holy name.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8606_2669152">37</A></SUP> </P>

<P>XIV. We pray and beseech Thee, <I>O lover of men, O good</I> Lord,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8608_2669283">38</A></SUP> remember in Thy good mercy the Holy and only Catholic and Apostolic Church throughout the whole world, and all Thy people, and all the sheep of this fold.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8609_2669484">39</A></SUP> Vouchsafe to the hearts of all of us the peace of heaven, but grant us also the peace of this life.</P>

<P>Guide and direct in all peace the king,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8611_2669674">40</A></SUP> army, magistrates, councils,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8612_2669746">41</A></SUP> peoples, and neighbour-hoods, and all our outgoings and incomings.</P>

<P>O King of Peace, grant us Thy peace in unity and love. May we be Thine, O Lord; for we know no other God but Thee, and name no other name but Thine. Give life unto the souls of all of us, and let no deadly sin prevail against us, or against all Thy people.</P>

<P>Look down in mercy and compassion, O Lord, and heal the sick among Thy people. Deliver them and us, O Lord, from sickness and disease, and drive away the spirit of weakness.</P>

<P>Raise up those who have been long afflicted, and heal those who are vexed with unclean spirits.</P>

<P>Have mercy on all who are in prison, or in mines, or on trial, or condemned, or in exile, or crushed by cruel bondage or tribute. Deliver them, O Lord, for Thou art our God, who settest the captives free; who raisest up the downtrodden; who givest hope to the hopeless, and help to the helpless; who liftest up the fallen; who givest refuge to the shipwrecked, and vengeance to the oppressed.</P>

<P>Pity, relieve, and restore every Christian soul that is afflicted or wandering.</P>

<P>But do Thou, O Lord, the physician of our souls and bodies, the guardian of all flesh, look down, and by Thy saving power heal all the diseases of soul and body.</P>

<P>Guide and prosper our brethren who have gone or who are about to go abroad. Whether they travel by land, or river, or lake, by public road, or in whatever way journeying, bring them everywhere to a safe and tranquil haven. Be pleased to be with them by land and sea, and restore them in health and joy to joyful and healthful homes. </P>

<P>Ever defend, O Lord, our journey through this life from trouble and storm.</P>

<P>Send down rich and copious showers on the dry and thirsty lands.</P>

<P>Gladden and revive the face of the earth, that it may spring forth and rejoice in the raindrops.</P>

<P>Make the waters of the river flow in full stream.</P>

<P>Gladden and revive the face of the earth with the swelling waters.</P>

<P>Fill all the channels of the streams, and multiply the fruits of the earth.</P>

<P>Bless, O Lord, the fruits of the earth, and keep them safe and unharmed. Fill them with seed, and make them ripe for the harvest.</P>

<P>Bless even now, O Lord, Thy yearly crown of blessing for the sake of the poor of Thy people, the widow, the orphan, and the stranger, and for the sake of all of us who have our hope in Thee and call upon Thy holy name; for the eyes of all are upon Thee, and Thou givest them bread in due season.</P>

<P>O Thou who givest food to all flesh, fill our hearts with joy and gladness, that at all times, having all sufficiency, we may abound to every good work in Christ Jesus our Lord.</P>

<P>O King of kings and Lord of lords, defend the kingdom of Thy servant, our orthodox and Christ-loving sovereign,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8630_2672462">42</A></SUP> whom Thou hast deemed worthy to reign over this land in peace, courage, and justice.</P>

<P>Subdue under him, O Lord, every enemy and adversary, whether at home or abroad. Gird on Thy shield and armour, and rise to his aid. Draw Thy sword, and help him to fight against them that persecute him. Shield him in the day of battle, and grant that the fruit of his loins may sit upon his throne.</P>

<P>Be kind to him, O Lord, for the sake of Thy Holy and Apostolic Church, and all Thy Christ-loving people, that we too in his peaceful reign may live a calm and tranquil life, in all reverence and godliness.</P>

<P>O Lord our God, give peace to the souls of our fathers and brethren who have fallen asleep in Jesus, remembering our forefathers of old, our fathers, patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, confessors, bishops, and the souls of all the holy and just men who have died in the Lord.</P>

<P>Especially remember those whose memory we this day <I>celebrate</I>, and our holy father Mark,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8635_2673454">43</A></SUP> the apostle and evangelist, who has shown us the way of salvation.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8636_2673928">44</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>The Priest: The Lord will bless thee in His grace, now, henceforth, and for evermore.</P>

  <P>The Deacon reads the record of the dead.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8640_2674145">45</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>The Priest bows and prays: XV. Give peace, O Sovereign Lord our God, to the souls of all who dwell in the tabernacles of Thy saints. Graciously bestow upon them in Thy kingdom Thy promised blessing, which eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man what Thou, O God, hast prepared for those who love Thy holy name. Give peace to their souls, and deem them worthy of the kingdom of heaven.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8642_2674638">46</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Grant that we may end our lives as Christians, acceptable unto Thee and without sin, and be pleased to give us part and lot with all Thy saints.</P>

<P>Accept, O God, by Thy ministering archangels at Thy holy, heavenly, and reasonable altar in the spacious heavens, the thank-offerings of those who offer sacrifice and oblation, and of those who desire to offer much or little, in secret or openly, but have it not to give.</P>

<P>Accept the thank-offerings of those who have presented them this day, as Thou didst accept the gifts of Thy righteous Abel:</P>

<P>The Priest offers incense, and says:-<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8647_2675263">47</A></SUP> -As Thou didst accept the sacrifice of our father Abraham, the incense of Zacharias, the alms of Cornelius, and the widow's two mites, accept also the thank-offerings of these, and give them for the things of time the things of eternity, and for the things of earth the things of heaven. Defend, O Lord, our most holy and blessed <I>Papas</I><SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8648_2675624">48</A></SUP> <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>D</FONT>, whom Thou hast fore-ordained to rule over Thy Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, and our most pious Bishop <FONT FACE='SPIonic'>D</FONT>, that they through many years of peace may, according to Thy holy and blessed will, fulfil the sacred priesthood committed to their care, and dispense aright the word of truth.</P>

<P>Remember the orthodox bishops everywhere, the elders, deacons, sub-deacons, readers, singers, monks,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8650_2676034">49</A></SUP> virgins, widows, and laity.</P>

<P>Remember, O Lord, the holy city<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8652_2676139">50</A></SUP> of our God, Jesus Christ; and the imperial city;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8653_2676228">51</A></SUP> and this city of ours, and all cities and all lands, and the peace and safety of those who dwell therein in the orthodox faith of Christ. </P>

<P>Be mindful, O Lord, of the return of the back-sliding, and of every Christian soul that is afflicted and oppressed, and in need of Thy divine mercy and help.</P>

<P>Be mindful, O Lord, of our brethren in captivity. Grant that they may find mercy and compassion with those who have led them captive.</P>

<P>Be mindful also of us, O Lord, Thy sinful and unworthy servants, and blot out our sins in Thy goodness and mercy.</P>

<P>Be mindful also of me, Thy lowly, sinful, and unworthy servant, and in Thy mercy blot out my sins.Be with us, O Lord, who minister unto Thy holy name.</P>

<P>Bless our meetings, O Lord.</P>

<P>Utterly uproot idolatry from the world.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8660_2677010">52</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Crush under our feet Satan, and all his wicked influence.</P>

<P>Humble now, as at all times, the enemies of Thy Church.</P>

<P>Lay bare their pride.</P>

<P>Speedily show them their weakness.</P>

<P>Bring to naught the wicked plots they contrive against us.</P>

<P>Arise, O Lord, and let Thine enemies be scattered, and let all who hate Thy holy name be put to flight.</P>

<P>Do Thou bless a thousand times ten thousand Thy faithful and orthodox people while they do Thy holy will.</P>

  <UL><P>The Deacon: Let those who are seated stand.</P>

  <P>The Priest says the following prayer:- Deliver the captive; rescue the distressed feed the hungry; comfort the faint-hearted, convert the erring; enlighten the darkened; raise the fallen; confirm the wavering; heal the sick; and guide them all, good Lord, into the way of salvation, and into Thy sacred fold. Deliver us from our iniquities; protect and defend us at all times.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Turn to the east.</P>

</UL><P>The Priest: bows and prays.For Thou art far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but in that which is to come. Round Thee stand ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands of holy angels and hosts of archangels; and Thy two most honoured creatures, the many-eyed cherubim and the six-winged seraphim. With twain they cover their faces, and with twain they cover their feet, and with twain they do fly; and they cry one to another for ever with the voice of praise, and glorify Thee, O Lord, singing aloud the triumphal and thrice-holy<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8672_2678572">53</A></SUP> hymn to Thy great glory:-</P>

<P>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth. Heaven and earth are full of Thy glory.</P>

  <UL><P>(Aloud.) Thou dost ever sanctify all men; but with all who glorify Thee, receive also, O Sovereign Lord, our sanctification, who with them celebrate Thy praise, and say:-</P>

  <P>The People: Holy, holy, holy Lord.</P>

  <P>The Priest makes the sign of the cross over the sacred mysteries: XVI. For truly heaven and earth are full of Thy glory, through the manifestation of our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ. Fill, O God, this sacrifice with Thy blessing, through the inspiration of Thy all-holy Spirit. For the Lord Himself, our God and universal King, Christ Jesus, reclining at meat the same night on which He delivered Himself up for our sins and died in the flesh for all, took bread in His holy, pure, and immaculate hands, and lifting His eyes to His Father, our God, and the God of all, gave thanks; and when He had blessed, hallowed, and broken the bread, gave it to His holy and blessed disciples and apostles, saying:-</P>

  <P>(Aloud.) Take, eat.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Pray earnestly.</P>

  <P>The Priest (aloud): For this is my body, which is broken for you, and divided for the remission of sins.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>The Priest prays: After the same manner also, when He had supped, He took the cup of wine mingled with water, and lifting His eyes to Thee, His Father, our God, and the God of all, gave thanks; and when He had blessed and filled it with the Holy Spirit, gave it to His holy and blessed disciples and apostles, saying:-(Aloud.)Drink ye all of it.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Pray earnestly again. </P>

  <P>The Priest (aloud): For this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for you and for many, and distributed among you for the remission of sins.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

</UL><P>The Priest prays thus:- This do ye in remembrance of me; for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show forth my death and acknowledge my resurrection and ascension until I come. O Sovereign and Almighty Lord, King of heaven, while we show forth<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8686_2680590">54</A></SUP> the death of Thine only-begotten Son, our Lord, God, and Saviour Jesus Christ, and acknowledge His blessed resurrection from the dead on the third day, we do also openly declare His ascension into heaven, and His sitting on the right hand of Thee, God and Father, and await His second terrible and dreadful coming, in which He will come to judge righteously the quick and the dead, and to render to each man according to his works.</P>

<P>XVII. O Lord our God, we have placed before Thee what is Thine from Thine own mercies. We pray and beseech Thee, O good and merciful God, to send down from Thy holy heaven, from the mansion Thou hast prepared, and from Thine infinite bosom, the Paraclete Himself,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8688_2681321">55</A></SUP> holy, powerful, and life-giving, the Spirit of truth, who spoke in the law, the apostles, and prophets; who is everywhere present, and filleth all things, freely working sanctification. in whom He will with Thy good pleasure; one in His nature; manifold in His working; the fountain of divine blessing; of like substance<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8689_2681664">56</A></SUP> with Thee, and proceeding from Thee; sitting with Thee on the throne of Thy kingdom, and with Thine only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ. Send down upon us also and upon this bread and upon these chalices Thy Holy Spirit, that by His all-powerful and divine influence He may sanctify and consecrate them, and make this bread the body.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn86.htm#P8690_2682079">57</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>The Priest: (aloud).And this cup the blood of the new testament, of the very Lord, and God, and Saviour, and universal King Christ Jesus.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Deacons, come down.</P>

  <P>The Priest (aloud): That to all of us who partake thereof they may tend unto faith, sobriety, healing, temperance, sanctification, the renewal of soul, body, and spirit, participation in the blessedness of eternal life and immortality, the glory of Thy most holy name, and the remission of sins, that Thy most holy, precious, and glorious name may be praised and glorified in this as in all things.</P>

  <P>The People: As it was and is.</P>

  <P>The Priest: XVIII. Peace be to all.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Pray.</P>

  <P>The Priest prays in secret: O God of light, Father of life, Author of grace, Creator of worlds, Founder of knowledge, Giver of wisdom, Treasure of holiness, Teacher of pure prayers, Benefactor of our souls, who givest to the faint-hearted who put their trust in Thee those things into which the angels desire to look: O Sovereign Lord, who hast brought us up from the depths of darkness to light, who hast given us life from death, who hast graciously bestowed upon us freedom from slavery, who hast scattered the darkness of sin within us, through the presence of Thine only-begotten Son, do Thou now also, through the visitation of Thy all-holy Spirit, enlighten the eyes of our understanding, that we may partake without fear of condemnation of this heavenly and immortal food, and sanctify us wholly in soul, body, and spirit, that with Thy holy disciples and apostles we may say this prayer to Thee: Our Father who art in heaven, etc.</P>

  <P>(Aloud.) And grant, O Sovereign Lord, in Thy mercy, that we with freedom of speech, without fear of condemnation, with pure heart and enlightened soul, with face that is not ashamed, and with hollowed lips, may venture to call upon Thee, the holy God who art in heaven, as our Father, and say:-</P>

  <P>The People: Our Father who art in heaven, etc.</P>

  <P>The Priest prays:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn87.htm#P8702_2684062">58</A></SUP> - Verily, Lord, Lord, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil; for Thy abundant mercy showeth that we through our great infirmity are unable to resist it.Grant that we may find a way whereby we may be able to withstand temptation; for Thou hast given us power to tread upon serpents, and scorpions, and all the power of the enemy. </P>

  <P>(Aloud.) For Thine is the kingdom and power.</P>

  <P>The People: Amen.</P>

  <P>The Priest: XIX. Peace be to all.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: Bow your heads to Jesus.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn87.htm#P8707_2684576">59</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>The People: Thou, Lord.</P>

  <P>The Priest prays: O Sovereign and Almighty Lord,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn87.htm#P8710_2684697">60</A></SUP> who sittest upon the cherubim, and art glorified by the seraphim; who hast made the heaven out of waters, and adorned it with choirs of stars; who hast placed an unbodied host of angels in the highest heavens to sing Thy praise for ever; before Thee have we bowed our souls and bodies in token of our bondage. We beseech Thee to repel the dark assaults of sin from our understanding, and to gladden our minds with the divine radiance of Thy Holy Spirit, that, filled with the knowledge of Thee, we may worthily partake of the mercies set before us, the pure body and precious blood of Thine only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ. Pardon all our sins in Thy abundant and unsearchable goodness, through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine only-begotten Son:<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn87.htm#P8711_2685508">61</A></SUP> </P>

  <P>(Aloud.) Through whom and with whom be glory and power to Thee, with the all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit.</P>

  <P>The Priest: XX. Peace be to all.</P>

  <P>The Deacon: With the fear of God.</P>

  <P>The Priest prays: O holy, highest, awe-inspiring God, who dwellest among the saints, sanctify us by the word of Thy grace and by the inspiration of Thy all-holy Spirit; for Thou hast said, O Lord our God, Be ye holy; for I am holy. O Word of God, past finding out, consubstantial<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn87.htm#P8716_2685996">62</A></SUP> and co-eternal with the Father and the Holy Spirit, and sharer of their sovereignty, accept the pure song which cherubim and seraphim, and the unworthy lips of Thy sinful and unworthy servant, sing aloud.</P>

  <P>The People: Lord, have mercy; Lord, have mercy; Lord, have mercy.</P>

  <P>The Priest divides it among those present, and saith:- The Lord will bless and help you through His great <I>mercy.</I></P>

  <P>The Priest: says the prayer of thanksgiving.O Sovereign Lord our God, we thank Thee that we have partaken of Thy holy, pure, immortal, and heavenly mysteries, which Thou hast given for our good, and for the sanctification and salvation of our souls and bodies. We pray and beseech Thee, 0 Lord, to grant in Thy good mercy, that by partaking of the holy body and precious blood of Thine only-begotten Son, we may have faith that is not ashamed, love that is unfeigned, fulness of holiness, power to eschew evil and keep Thy commandments, provision for eternal life, and an acceptable defence before the awful tribunal of Thy Christ:</P>

  <P>In a loud voice: Through whom and with whom be glory and power to Thee, with Thy all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit.</P>

O mightiest King, co-eternal with the Father, who by Thy might hast vanquished hell and trodden death trader foot, who hast bound the strong man, and by Thy miraculous power and the enlightening radiance of Thy unspeakable Godhead hast raised Adam from the tomb, send forth Thy invisible right hand, which is full of blessing, and bless us all.</P>
