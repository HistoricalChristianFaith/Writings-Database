</UL><P>Such are the details that have been transmitted concerning John. Not long after his death,
and three years after the elevation of Atticus to the bishopric of Constantinople, and during the
consulate of Bassus and Philip, Arcadius died. He left Theodosius, his son,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4653_2126822">1</A></SUP> who was just weaned, as his successor to the
empire. He also left three daughters of tender age, named Pulcheria, Arcadia, and Marina.</P>

<P>It appears to me that it was the design of God to show by the events of this period, that piety
alone suffices for the salvation of princes; and that without piety, armies, a powerful empire, and
every other resource, are of no avail. The Divine Power which is the guardian of the universe,
foresaw that the emperor would be distinguished by his piety, and therefore determined that
Pulcheria, his sister, should be the protector of him and of his government. This princess was not
yet fifteen years of age, but had received a mind most wise and divine above her years. She first
devoted her virginity to God, and instructed her sisters in the same course of life. To avoid all
cause of jealousy and intrigue, she permitted no man to enter her palace. In confirmation of her
resolution, she took God, the priests, and all the subjects of the Roman empire as witnesses to her
self-dedication. In token of her virginity and the headship of her brother, she consecrated in the
church of Constantinople, a holy table, a remarkable fabric and very beautiful to see; it was made of
gold and precious stones; and she inscribed these things on the front of the table, so that it might
be patent to all. After quietly resuming the care of the state, she governed the Roman empire
excellently and with great orderliness; she concerted her measures so well that the affairs to be
carried out were quickly decreed and completed. She was able to write and to converse with perfect
accuracy in the Greek and Latin languages. She caused all affairs to be transacted in the name of her
brother, and devoted great attention to bringing him up as a prince in the best possible way and with
such information as was suitable to his years. She had him taught by the most skilled men, in
horsemanship, and the practice of arms, and in letters. But he was systematically taught by his
sister to be orderly and princely in his manners; she showed him how to gather up his robes, and how
to take a seat, and how to walk; she trained him to restrain laughter, to assume a mild or a
formidable aspect as the occasion might require, and to inquire with urbanity into the cases of those
who came before him with petitions. But she strove chiefly, to lead him into piety, and to pray
continuously; she taught him to frequent the church regularly, and to honor the houses of prayer with
gifts and treasures; and she inspired him with reverence for priests and other good men, and for
those who, in accordance with the law of Christianity, had devoted themselves to philosophy. She
provided zealously and wisely that religion might not be endangered by the innovation of spurious
dogmas. That new heresies have not prevailed in our times, we shah find to be due especially to her,
as we shall subsequently see. With how much fear she worshiped God, it would take long for any one to
say; and how many houses of prayer she built magnificently, and how many hostelries and monastic
communities she established, the arrangement for the expenses for their perpetual support, and the
provision for the inmates. If any one pleases to examine the truth from the business itself, and not
to be convinced by my words, he will learn that they are not falsely described by me for my own
favor, if he will investigate the testimonial documents written up by the stewards of her house, and
if he will inquire from the true records whether the facts agree with my history. If these proofs
alone do not satisfy him so as to make him believe, let God himself persuade him who had her in favor
altogether and everywhere on account of her conduct, so that He heard her prayer readily, and
frequently directed beforehand the things which ought to be done. Suchindications of Divine love are
not conferred upon men unless they have merited them by their works. But I willingly pass over for
the present the many separate manifestations of Divine favor that were granted to the sister of the
emperor as proofs that she was loved of God, lest anybody should blame me for having set out to do
other things, and yet had turned to the use of encomiums. One incident relating to her seems,
however, so fitting in itself and to my ecclesiastical history, and so evident a demonstration of her
love for God, that I will relate it here, although it happened some time afterwards. It is as
follows:-</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P4656_2131411"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter II.-Discovery of the Relics of Forty Holy Martyrs.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>A Woman by name Eusebia,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4658_2131494">2</A></SUP> who was a
deaconess of the Macedonian sect, had a house and garden without the walls of Constantinople, in
which she kept the holy remains of forty soldiers,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4659_2131684">3</A></SUP> who had suffered martyrdom under Licinius at
Sebaste in Armenia. When she felt death approaching, she bequeathed the aforesaid place to some
orthodox monks, and bound them by oath to bury her there, and to hew out separately a place above her
head at the top of her coffin, and to deposit the relics of the martyrs with her, and to inform no
one. The monks did so; but in order to render due honor to the martyrs secretly, according to the
agreement with Eusebia, they formed a subterranean house of prayer near her tomb. But open to view,
an edifice was erected above the foundation, inclosed with baked bricks, and a secret descent from it
to the martyrs. Soon after, Caesar, a man among those in power, who had formerly been advanced to the
dignity of consul and prefect, lost his wife, and caused her to be interred near the tomb of Eusebia;
for the two ladies had been knit together by the most tender friendship, and had been of one mind on
all doctrinal and religious subjects. Caesar was hence induced to purchase this place so that he
might be entombed near his wife. The aforesaid monks settled elsewhere, and without divulging
anything about the martyrs. After this, when the building was demolished, and when the earth and
refuse were scattered about, the whole place was smoothed off. For Caesarius himself erected there a
magnificent temple to God to the honor of Thyrsus, the martyr. It appears probable that God
designedly willed the aforesaid place to disappear, and so long a time to elapse in order that the
discovery of the martyrs might be regarded as more marvelous and a more conspicuous event, and as a
proof of the Divine favor towards the discoverer. The discoverer was, in fact, no other than the
Empress Pulcheria, the sister of the emperor. The admirable Thyrsus appeared to her three times, and
revealed to her those concealed beneath the earth; and commanded that they should be deposited near
his tomb, in order that they might share in the same position and honor. The forty martyrs themselves
also appeared to her, arrayed in shining robes. But the occurrence seemed too marvelous to be
credible, and altogether impossible; for the aged of clergy of that region, after having frequently
prosecuted inquiries, had not been able to indicate the position of the martyrs, nor indeed had any
one else. At length, when everything was hopeless, Polychronius, a certain presbyter, who had
formerly been a servant in the household of Caesar, was reminded by God that the locality in question
had once been inhabited by monks. He therefore went to the clergy of the Macedonian sect to inquire
concerning them. All the monks were dead, with the exception of one, who seemed to have been
preserved in life for the express purpose of pointing out the spot where the relics of the holy
martyrs were concealed. Polychronius. questioned him closely on the subject, and find ing that, on
account of the agreement made with Eusebia, his answers were somewhat undecided, he made known to him
the Divine revelation and the anxiety of the empress, as well as the failure of her recourses. The
monk then confessed that God had declared the truth to the empress; for at the time when he was an
overgrown boy, and was taught the monastic life by its aged leaders, he remembered exactly that the
relics of the martyrs had been deposited near the tomb of Eusebia; but that the subsequent lapse of
time, and the changes which had been carried on in that locality, deprived him of the power of
recalling to his recollection whether the relics had been deposited beneath the church or in any
other spot. And further said Polychronius, "I have not suffered a like lapse of memory, for I
remember that I was present at the interment of the wife of Caesar, and, as well as I can judge from
the relative situation of the high road, I infer that she must have been buried beneath the ambo";
this is the platform for the readers. "Therefore," subjoined the monk, "it must be near the remains
of Caesar's wife that the tomb of Eusebia must be sought; for the two ladies lived on terms of the
closest friendship and intimacy, and mutually agreed to be interred beside each other." When it was
necessary to dig, according to the aforesaid intimations, and to track out the sacred relics, and the
empress had learned the facts, she commanded them to begin the work. On digging up the earth by the
ambo, the coffin of Caesar's wife was discovered according to the conjecture of Polychronius. Ata
short distance on the side they found the, pavement of baked bricks, and a marble tablet of equal
dimensions, each the measure of the bricks, under which the coffin of Eusebin was disclosed; and dose
by was an oratory, elegantly inclosed with white and purple marble. The cover of the tomb was in the
form, of a holy table, and at the summit, where the relics were deposited, a small orifice was
visible. A man attached to the palace, who happened to be standing by, thrust a cane which he held in
his hand into the orifice; and on withdrawing the cane he held it to his nose, and inhaled a sweet
odor of myrrh, which inspired the workmen and bystanders with fresh confidence. When they had eagerly
opened the coffin, the remains of Eusebia were found, and near her head was the prominent part of the
tomb fashioned exactly in the form of a chest, and was concealed within by its own cover; and the
iron which inclosed it on each side at the edges was firmly held together by lead. In the middle, the
same orifice again appeared, and still more clearly revealed the fact of the relics being concealed
within. As soon as the discovery was announced, they ran to the church of the martyr, and sent for
smiths to unfasten the iron bars, and easily drew off the lid. A great many perfumes were found
thereunder, and among the perfumes two silver caskets were found in which lay the holy relics. Then
the princess returned thanks to God for having accounted her worthy of so great a manifestation and
for attaining the discovery of the holy relics. After this she honored the martyrs with the costliest
casket; and on the conclusion of a public festival which was celebrated with befitting honor and with
a procession to the accompaniment of psalms, and at which I was present, the relics were placed
alongside of the godlike Thyrsus. And others who were present can also bear testimony that these
things were done in the way described, for almost all of them still survive. And the event occurred
much later, when Proclus governed the church of Constantinople.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chap III.-The Virtues of Pulcheria; Her Sisters.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>It is said that God frequently in many other cases revealed to the princess what was about to
happen, and that the most occurred to her and her sisters as witnesses of the Divine love.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4663_2138651">4</A></SUP> They all pursue the same mode of life; they are
sedulous about the priests and the houses of prayer, and are munificent to needy strangers and the
poor. These sisters generally take their meals and walks together, and pass their days and their
nights in company, singing the praises of God. As is the custom with exemplary women, they employ
themselves in weaving and in similar occupations. Although princesses, born and educated in palaces,
they avoid levity and idleness, which they think unworthy of any who profess virginity, so they put
such indolence far from their own life. For this reason the mercy of God is manifested and is
conquering in behalf of their house; for He increases the emperor in years and government; every
conspiracy and war concocted against him has been overthrown of itself.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter IV.-Truce with Persia. Honorius and Stilicho. Transactions in Rome and
Dalmatia.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Although the Persians had prepared to take up arms, they were induced to conclude a truce
with the Romans for a hundred years.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4667_2139795">5</A></SUP> </P>

<P>Stilicho, the general of the troops of Honorius, was suspected of having conspired to proclaim his
son Eucherius emperor of the East, and was, in consequence, slain by the army at Ravenna. He had, at
a former period, while Arcadius was still living, conceived bitter feelings of enmity against his
officers, and was hence impelled to bring the two empires into collision. He caused Alaric, the
leader of the Goths, to secure the office of general of the Romans, and advised him to seize Illyria;
and, having sent forward Jovian, the appointed prefect, he agreed to join him shortly with Roman
troops, and to reduce its subjects under the ruleof Honorius. Alaric quitted the barbarous region
bordering on Dalmatia and Pannonia, where he had been dwelling, and marched at the head of his
soldiery to Epirus; after remaining for some time in that country, he retreated to Italy, without
having accomplished anything. For he was about to migrate according to the agreement, but he was
restrained by the letters of Honorius. After the death of Arcadius, Honorius projected a journey to
Constantinople, in behalf of his nephew, to appoint officers faithful to his security and empire; for
he held his nephew in the place of his son, and he was fearful lest the boy might suffer on account
of his youth, since he would be exposed to plots; but when Honorius was on the very point of setting
out on this journey, Stilicho dissuaded him from his design, by proving to him that his presence was
requisite in Italy, to repress the schemes of Constantine, who sought to possess himself of the
sovereign power at Aries. Stilicho then took that one of the sceptres which the Romans call Labarum,
obtained some letters from the emperor, with which he set out, at the head of four legions, to carry
on war in the East; but a report having been spread that he had conspired against the emperor, and
had formed a scheme, in conjunction with those in power, to raise his son to the throne, the troops
rose up in sedition, and slew the praetorian prefect<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4669_2141935">6</A></SUP> of Italy and of Gaul, the military commanders, and
the chief officers of the court. Stilicho himself was slain by the soldiers at Ravenna. He had
attained almost absolute power; and all men, so to speak, whether Romans or barbarians, were under
his control. Thus perished Stilicho, on a suspicion of having conspired against the emperors.
Eucherius, his son, was also slain.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter V.-The Different Nations Took Up Arms Against the Romans, of Whom Some Were,
Through the Providence of God Defeated, and Others Brought to Terms of Amity.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>It happened about the same time that the Huns, who were encamped in Thrace, retreated
disgracefully and cast off many of their number although they had neither been attacked nor
pursued.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4673_2142699">7</A></SUP> Uldis, the leader of the barbarous
tribes who dwell near the Ister, crossed that river at the head of a large army, and encamped on the
frontiers of Thrace. He took possession by treachery of a city of Moesia, called Castra Martis, and
thence made incursions into the rest of Thrace, and insolently refused to enter into terms of
alliance with the Romans. The prefect of the Thracian soldiers made propositions of peace to him, but
he replied by pointing to the sun, and declaring that it would be easy to him, if he desired to do
so, to subjugate every region of the earth that is enlightened by that luminary. But while Uldis was
uttering menaces of this description, and was ordering as large a tribute as he pleased, and that on
this condition peace could be established with the Romans or the war would continue,-when affairs
were so helpless, God gave manifest proofs of special favor towards the present reign; for, shortly
afterwards, the immediate attendants and the leaders of the tribes of Uldis were discussing the Roman
form of government the philanthropy of the emperor, and his promptitude and liberality in rewarding
the best and good men. It was not without God that they turned to the love of the points so discussed
and seceded to the Romans, to whose camp they joined themselves, together with the troops ranged
under themselves. Finding himself thus abandoned, Uldis escaped with difficulty to the opposite bank
of the river. Many of his troops were slain; and among others the whole of the barbarous tribe called
the Sciri. This tribe had been very strong in point of numbers before falling into this misfortune.
Some of them were killed; and others were taken prisoners, and conveyed in chains to Constantinople.
The governors were of opinion that, if allowed to remain together, they would probably make a
revolution. Some of them were, therefore, sold at a low price; while others were given away as slaves
for presents, upon condition that they should never be permitted to return to Constantinople, or to
Europe, but be separated by the sea from the places familiar to them. Of these, a number was left
unsold; and they were ordered to settle in different places. I have seen many in Bithynia, near Mount
Olympus, living apart from one another, and cultivating the hills and valleys of that region.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VI.-Alaric the Goth. He Assaulted Rome, and Straitened It by War.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Thus was the Eastern Empire preserved from the evils of war,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4677_2145198">8</A></SUP> and governed with high order, contrary to all
expectations, for its ruler was still young. In the meantime, the Western Empire fell a prey to
disorders, because many tyrants arose. After the death of Stilicho, Alaric, the leader of the Goths,
sent an embassy to Honorius to treat of peace; but without avail. He advanced to Rome, and laid siege
to it; and by posting a large army of barbarians on the banks of the Tiber, he effectually prevented
the transmission of all provisions into the city from Portus. After the siege had lasted some time,
and fearful ravages had been made in the city by famine and pestilence, many of the slaves, and most
of the barbarians by race within the walls, deserted to Alaric. Those among the senators who still
adhered to pagan superstition, proposed to offer sacrifices in the Capitol and the other temples; and
certain Tuscans, who were summoned by the prefect of the city, promised to drive out the barbarians
with thunder and lightning; they boasted of having performed a similar exploit at Larnia, a city of
Tuscany, which Alaric had passed by for Rome, and had not taken. The event, however, proved that no
advantage could be derived from these persons for the city. All persons of good sense were aware that
the calamities which this siege entailed upon the Romans were indications of Divine wrath sent to
chastise them for their luxury, their debauchery, and their manifold acts of injustice towards each
other, as well as towards strangers. It is said that, when Alaric was marching against Rome, a good
monk of Italy besought him to spare the city, and not to become the author of so many calamities.
Alaric, in reply, assured him that he did not feel disposed to commence the siege, but that some
resistless influence compelled and commanded him to go against Rome; and this he eventually did.
While he was besieging the city, the inhabitants presented many gifts to him, and for some time he
raised the siege, when the Romans agreed to persuade the emperor to enter into a treaty of peace with
him.</P>

</UL><P>Although ambassadors were dispatched to treat of peace,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4681_2147545">9</A></SUP> the enemies of Alaric at the court of the emperor
sedulously guarded against the conclusion of any treaty with him. But after this, when an embassy had
been sent to him by Innocent, bishop of Rome, and Alaric was summoned by a letter of the emperor, he
repaired to the city of Ariminum, which is two hundred and ten stadia distant from Ravenna.</P>

<P>He encamped beyond the walls of the city; and Jovius, the prefect of Italy, held a conference with
him and conveyed his demands to the emperor, one of which was, that he might be appointed by an edict
to the generalship of the cavalry and infantry. The emperor gave full power to Jovius to grant Alaric
as much money and provision as he might desire, but refused ever to confer this dignity upon him.
Jovius unadvisedly awaited the messenger from the palace, in the camp of Alaric; and commanded the
decision of the emperor to be read in the presence of all the barbarians. On finding that the dignity
was denied him, Alaric was enraged at the result, ordered the trumpets to be sounded, and marched
towards Rome. Jovius, apprehensive of being suspected by the emperor of siding with Alaric, committed
a still greater act of imprudence by taking an oath on the safety of the emperor, and compelling the
principal officers to swear that they would never consent to any terms of peace with Alaric. The
barbarian chief, however, soon after changed his mind, and sent word he did not desire any post of
dignity, but was willing to act as an ally of the Romans, provided that they would grant him a
certain quantity of corn, and some territory of secondary importance to them, in which he might
establish himself.</P>

</UL><P>After having sent some bishops as ambassadors, on two different occasions, to treat on this
subject, but without effect, Alaric returned to Rome, and besieged the city; he took possession of
one part of Portus, and compelled the Romans to recognize Attalus, then prefect of the city, as their
king.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4686_2149684">10</A></SUP> When the Romans had been nominated
for the other offices, Alaric was appointed general of the cavalry and infantry, and Ataulphus, the
brother of his wife, was raised to the command of the force called the domestic cavalry. Attalus
assembled the senators, and addressed them in a long and very elaborate discourse, in which he
promised to restore the ancient customs of the senate, and also to bring Egypt and the other Eastern
provinces under the sway of Italy. Such was the boastfulness of a man, who was not destined to bear
the name of sovereign during the space of a single year. He was deceived by the representations of
some diviners, who assured him that he would be able to conquer Africa without a battle; he disobeyed
Alaric, who urged him to send a moderate force to Carthage, to slay the officers of Honorius, in case
of their attempting any resistance. He also refused to follow the counsels of John, to whom he had
given the command of the royal cohorts about his own person, and who advised him to entrust Constans,
on his proposed departure for Libya, with a document which they call edict, as though sent by
Honorius, by which Heraclean might be dispossessed of office; he had been entrusted. with the rule of
the soldiers in Africa. Had this artifice been adopted, it would probably have proved successful, for
the designs of Attalus were unknown in Libya. But as soon as Constans had set sail for Carthage,
according to the advice of the diviners, Attalus was so weak in mind that he did not think it
doubtful, but believed that the Africans would be his subjects, according to the prediction of the
diviners, and marched at the head of his army towards Ravenna. When it was announced that Attalus had
reached Ariminum, with an army composed partly of Roman and partly of barbarian troops, Honorius
wrote to him to acknowledge him as emperor, and deputed the highest officers of his court to wait
upon him, and offer him a share in the empire. Attalus, however, refused to share power with another,
and sent word that Honorius might choose an island or any spot of ground that he pleased for his
private residence, and that he would be allowed every imperial service. The affairs of Honorius were
reduced to so critical a condition, that ships were kept in readiness to convey him, if it were
necessary, to his nephew, when an army of four thousand men which had started from the west arrived
unexpectedly during the night at Ravenna; Honorius caused the walls of the city to be guarded by this
reinforcement, for he distrusted the native troops as inclined to treachery.</P>

<P>In the meantime Heraclean had put Constans to death, and had ranged troops along the ports and
coasts of Africa to hinder the merchant vessels from going to Rome. When, as a consequence, a famine
seized the Romans, they sent a deputation to Attalus about it. Being at a loss what measures to
adopt, he returned to Rome to consult the senate. The famine was so grievous that chestnuts were used
by the people to supply the place of corn, and some persons were suspected of having partaken of
human flesh. Alaric advised that five hundred barbarians should be sent into Africa against
Heraclean, but the senators and Attalus objected that Africa ought not to be entrusted to barbarians.
It then became evident to Alaric that God disapproved of the rule of Attalus; and finding that it
would be futile to labor for a matter which was beyond his power, and after receiving certain
pledges, he agreed with Honorius to deprive Attalus of his sovereignty. All the parties concerned
assembled together without the walls of the city, and Attalus threw aside the symbols of imperial
power. His officers also threw aside their girdles, and Honorius granted pardon to all for these
occurrences, and each was to hold the honor and office which he had first had. Attalus retired with
his son to Alaric, for he thought his life would not be in safety as yet, if he continued to dwell
among the Romans.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter IX.-The Disturbance Which the Greeks and Christians Had About Attalus.the
Courageous Saros; Alaric, by a Stratagem, Obtains Possession of Rome, and Protected the Sacred Asylum
of the Apostle Peter.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>The failure which had attended the designs i of Attalus was a source of deep displeasure the
pagans and Christians of the Arian heresy.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4691_2154100">11</A></SUP>
The pagans had inferred from the known predilections and early education of Attalus, that he would
openly maintain their superstitions, and restore their ancient temples, their festivals, and their
altars. The Arians imagined that, as soon as he found his reign firmly established, Attalus would
reinstate them in the supremacy over the churches which they had enjoyed during the reigns of
Constantius and of Valens; for he had been baptized by Sigesarius,<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4692_2154629">12</A></SUP> bishop of the Goths, to the great satisfaction of
Alaric and the Arian party.</P>

<P>Soon after, Alaric stationed himself among the Alps, at a distance of about sixty stadia from
Ravenna, and held a conference with the emperor concerning the conclusion of a peace. Saros, a
barbarian by birth, and highly practiced in the art of war, had only about three hundred men with
him, but all well disposed and most efficient. He was suspicious of Alaric on account of their former
enmity, and reasoned that a treaty between the Romans and Goths would be of no advantage to him.
Suddenly advancing with his own troops, he slew some of the barbarians. Impelled by rage and terror
at this incident, Alaric retraced his steps, and returned to Rome, and took it by treachery. He
permitted each of his followers to seize as much of the wealth of the Romans as he was able, and
toplunder all the houses; but from respect towards the Apostle Peter, he commanded that the large and
very spacious church erected around his. tomb should be an asylum. This was the only cause which
prevented the entire demolition of Rome; and those who were there saved, and they were many, rebuilt
the city.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter X.-A Roman Lady Who Manifested a Deed of Modesty.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>It is obvious that the capture of so great a city as Rome must have been attended with many
remarkable circumstances. I shall, therefore, now proceed to the narration of such events as seem
worthy of a place in ecclesiastical history.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn46.htm#P4697_2156255">13</A></SUP> I shall recount a pious action performed by a
barbarian, and record the bravery of a Roman lady for the preservation of her chastity. The barbarian
and the lady were both Christians, but not of the same heresy, the former being an Arian, and the
latter a zealous follower of the Nicene doctrines. A young man of Alaric's soldiers saw this very
beautiful woman, and was conquered by her loveliness, and tried to drag her into intercourse; but she
drew back, and exerted herself that she might not suffer pollution. He drew his sword, and threatened
to slay her; but he was restrained by the passion which he entertained toward her, and merely
inflicted a slight wound on her neck. The blood flowed in abundance, and she offered her neck to the
sword; for she preferred to die in her chastity than to survive, after having consorted lawfully with
a husband, and then to be attempted by another man. When the barbarian repeated his purpose, and
followed it with more fearful threats, he accomplished nothing further; struck with wonder at her
chastity, he conducted her to the church of Peter the apostle, and gave six pieces of gold for her
support to the officers who were guarding the church, and commanded them to keep her for her
husband.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XI.-The Tyrants Who in the West at that Time Rebelled Against Honorius. They
are Wholly Destroyed on Account of the Emperor's Love of God.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>During this period many tyrants rebelled against Honorius in the Western government. Some
fell upon one another, while others were apprehended in a marvelous way, and so evidenced that the
Divine love toward Honorius was not common. The soldiers in Britain<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn47.htm#P4701_2157942">14</A></SUP> were the first to rise up in sedition, and they
proclaimed Mark as tyrant. Afterwards, however, they slew Mark, and proclaimed Gratian. Within four
months subsequently they killed Gratian, and elected Constantine in his place, imagining that, on
account of his name, he would be able to reduce the empire firmly under his authority; and for no
other reason than this, several other persons of the same name were elected to the tyranny.
Constantine passed over from Britain to Bononia, a maritime city of Gaul; and after inducing all the
troops in Gaul and Aquitania to espouse his cause, he reduced to obedience l the inhabitants of the
regions extending to themountains which divide Italy from Gaul, and which the Romans have named the
Cottian Alps. He then sent his oldest son, Constans, whom he had already nominated Caesar, and whom
he afterwards proclaimed emperor, into Spain. Constans, after making himself master of this province,
and appointing his own governors over it, commanded that Didymus and Verinian, relatives of Honorius,
should be loaded with chains, and brought before him. Didymus and Verinian had at first differed
among themselves, but a reconciliation was effected between them, when they found themselves menaced
by the same danger. They combined their forces, which consisted. chiefly of armed peasants and
slaves. They attacked Lusitania in common, and slew many of the soldiers sent by the tyrant for their
capture.</P>

</UL><P>The troops of Constans were shortly afterwards strengthened by reinforcements, and Didymus
and Verinian, with their wives, were taken prisoners, and were eventually put to death.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn47.htm#P4705_2159778">15</A></SUP> Their brothers, Theodosiolus and Lagodius, who
were living in other provinces, fled the country; the former escaped to Italy, to the Emperor
Honorius; the latter fled to the East, to Theodosius. After these transactions, Constans returned to
his father, after he had posted a guard of his own soldiers for the road to Spain; for he did not
permit the Spaniards to act as guard, according to the ancient custom, a privilege for which they had
petitioned. This precaution was probably afterwards the cause of the ruin of the country; for when
Constantine was deprived of his power, the barbarous races of the Vandals, Suevi, and Alani took
confidence and conquered the road, and took possession of many forts and cities in Spain and Gaul,
and arrested the officers of the tyrant.</P>

<P>In the meantime, Constantine, who still thought that matters would go according to his purpose,
caused his son to be proclaimed emperor instead of Caesar, and determined to possess himself of
Italy. With this view, he crossed the Cottian Alps, and entered Liverona, a city of Liguria. He was
on the point of crossing the Po, when he was compelled to retrace his steps, upon being informed of
the death of Alavicus. This Alavicus was the commander of the troops of Honorius, and being suspected
of conspiring to place the entire Western government under the domination of Constantine, he was
slain when returning from a procession, in which, according to custom, it was his office to march in
advance of the emperor. Immediately after this occurrence, the emperor descended from horseback, and
publicly returned thanks to God for having delivered him from one who had openly conspired against
him. Constantine fled and seized Aries, and Constans, his son, hastened from Spain, and sought refuge
in the same city.</P>

<P>On the decline of the power of Constantine, the Vandals, Suevi, and Alani eagerly took the
Pyrenees when they heard that it was a prosperous and most abundant region. And since those who had
been entrusted by Constans with the guard of the passage had neglected their duty, the invaders
passed by into Spain.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XIII.-Concerning Gerontius, Maximus, and the Troops of Honorius. Capture of
Gerontius and His Wife; Their Death.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Meanwhile Gerontius, from being the most efficient of the generals of Constantine, became his
enemy;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn47.htm#P4711_2162182">16</A></SUP> and believing that Maximus, his
intimate friend, was well qualified for the tyranny, he invested him with the imperial robe, and
permitted him to reside in Tarracona. Gerontius then marched against Constantine, and took care to
put Constans, the son of Constantine, to death at Vienna.</P>

<P>As soon as Constantine heard of the usurpation of Maximus, he sent one of his generals, named
Edovicus, beyond the Rhine, to levy an army of Franks and Alemanni; and he sent his son Constans to
guard Vienna and the neighboring towns. Gerontius then advanced upon Aries and laid siege to it; but
directly, when the army of Honorius had come to hand against the tyrant, under the command of
Constantius, the father of that Valentinian who subsequently became emperor of Rome, Gerontius
retreated precipitately with a few soldiers; for the greater number of his troops deserted to the
army of Constantius. The Spanish soldiery conceived an utter contempt for Gerontius, on account of
his retreat, and took counsel how to slay him. They, gathered in close ranks and attacked his house
at night; but he, with one Alanus, his friend, and a few servants, ascended to the top of the house,
and did such execution with their arrows that no less than three hundred of the soldiers fell. When
the stock of arrows was exhausted, the servants made their escape by letting themselves down secretly
from the building; and Gerontius, although he might have been saved in a similar fashion, did not
choose to do so, because he was restrained by his affection for Nonnichia, his wife. At daybreak of
the next day, the soldiers cast fire into the house; when he saw that there was no hope of safety
left, he cut off the head of his companion, Alanus, in compliance with his wish. After this, his own
wife was lamenting, and with tears was pressing herself with the sword, pleading to die by the hand
of her husband before she should be subjected to others, and was supplicating for this last gift from
him. And this woman by her courage showed herself worthy of her religion, for she was a Christian,
and she died thus mercifully; she handed down to time a record of herself, too strong for oblivion.
Gerontius then struck himself thrice with his sword; but perceiving that he had not received a mortal
wound, he drew forth his poniard, which he wore at his side, and plunged it into his heart.</P>

Edovicus by Ulphilas, the General of Constantine. Death of Edovicus.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Although the city of Aries was closely besieged by the army of Honorius, Constantine still
resisted the siege, because Edovicus was announced as at hand with many allies.<SUP><A
HREF="footnote/fn47.htm#P4716_2164939">17</A></SUP> This frightened the generals of Honorius beyond
measure. Then they determined to return to Italy, and to carry on the war there. When they had united
on this plan, Edovicus was announced as in the neighborhood, so they crossed the river Rhone.
Constantius, who commanded the infantry, quietly awaited the approach of the enemy, while Ulphilas,
the fellow-general of Constantius, remained not far off in ambush with his cavalry. The enemy passed
by the army of Ulphilas, and were about to engage with the troops of Constantius, when a signal was
given, and Ulphilas suddenly appeared and assaulted the enemy from the rear. Their flight was
immediate. Some escaped, some were slain, while others threw down their arms and asked for pardon,
and were spared. Edovicus mounted his horse and fled to the lands of one Ecdicius, a landed
proprietor, to whom he had formerly rendered some important service, and whom he therefore imagined
to be his friend. Ecdicius, however, struck off his head, and presented it to the generals of
Honorius, in hope of receiving some great reward and honor. Constantius, on receiving the head,
proclaimed that the public thanks were due to Ecdicius for the deed of Ulphilas; but when Ecdicius
was eager to accompany him he commanded him to depart, for he did not consider the companionship of a
malicious host to be good for himself or the army. And the man who had dared to commit the most
unholy murder of a friend and a guest who was in an unfortunate situation,-this man went away, as the
proverb says, gaping with emptiness.</P>

himself to be ordained as presbyter. Those within the walls, having first received oaths, opened the
gates, and their Fives were spared. From that period the whole province returned to its allegiance to
Honorius, and has since been obedient to the rulers of his appointment. Constantine, with his son
Julian, was sent into Italy, but he was waylaid and killed. Not long afterwards Jovianus and Maximus,
the tyrants above mentioned, Saros, and many others who had conspired against Honorius, were
unexpectedly slain.</P>

</UL><P>This is not the proper place to enter into the details concerning the deaths of the
tyrants;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn47.htm#P4724_2167777">19</A></SUP> but I considered it necessary to
allude to the circumstance in order to show that to insure the stability of imperial power, it is
sufficient for an emperor to serve God with reverence, which was the course pursued by Honorius.
Galla Placidia, his sister, born of the same father as himself, dwelt with him, and likewise
distinguished herself by real zeal in the maintenance of religion and of the churches. After
Constantius, who was a brave and able general, had destroyed the tyrant Constantine, the emperor
rewarded him by giving him his sister in marriage; he also bestowed upon him the ermine and purple,
and admitted him to a share in the government. Constantius did not long survive the promotion; he
died soon after, and left two children, Valentinian, who succeeded Honorius, and Honoria. Meanwhile
the Eastern Empire was free from wars, and contrary to all opinion, its affairs were conducted with
great order, for the ruler was still a youth. It seems as if God openly manifested His favor towards
the present emperor, not only by disposing of warlike affairs in an unexpected way, but also by
revealing the sacred bodies of many persons who were of old most distinguished for piety; among other
relics, those of Zechariah, the very ancient prophet, and of Stephen, who was ordained deacon by the
apostles, were discovered; and it seems incumbent upon me to describe the mode, since the discovery
of each was marvelous and divine.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn47.htm#P4725_2169296">20</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P4727_2169504"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XVII.-Discovery of the Relics of Zechariah the Prophet, and of Stephen the
Proto-Martyr.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>I Shall first speak of the relics of the prophet. Caphar-Zechariah is a village of the
territory of Eleutheropolis, a city of Palestine. The land of this district was cultivated by
Calemerus, a serf; he was well disposed to the owner, but hard, discontented, and unjust towards his
neighboring peasants. Although he possessed these defects of character, the prophet stood by him in a
dream, and manifested himself; pointing out a particular garden, he said to him, "Go, dig in that
garden at the distance of two cubits from the hedge of the garden by the road leading to the city of
Bitheribis. You will there find two coffins, the inner one of wood, the other of lead. Beside the
coffins you will see a glass vessel full of water, and two serpents of moderate size, but tame, and
perfectly innoxious, so that they seem to be used to being handled." Calemerus followed the
directions of the prophet at the designated place and zealously applied himself to the task. When the
sacred depository was disclosed by the afore-mentioned signs, the divine prophetappeared to him, clad
in a white stole, whichmakes me think that he was a priest. At his feet outside of the coffin was
lying a child which had been honored with a royal burial; for on its head was a golden crown, its
feet were encased in golden sandals, and it was arrayed in a costly robe. The wise men and priests of
the time were greatly perplexed about this child, whoand whence he might be and for what reason hehad
been so clothed. It is said that Zechariah, the superior of a monastic community at Gerari, found an
ancient document written in Hebrew, which had not been received among the canonical books. In this
document it was stated that when Zechariah the prophet had been put to death by Joash, king of Judah,
the family of the monarch was soon visited by a dire calamity; for on the seventh day after the death
of the prophet, one of the sons of Joash, whom he tenderly loved, suddenly expired. Judging that this
affliction was a special manifestation of Divine wrath, the king ordered his son to be interred at
the feet of the prophet, as a kind of atonement for the crime against him. Such are the particulars
which I have ascertained on the subject.</P>

<P>Although the prophet had lain under the earth for so many generations, he appeared sound; his hair
was closely shorn, his nose was straight; his beard moderately grown, his head quite short, his eyes
rather sunken, and concealed by the eyebrows.parparpar</P>
