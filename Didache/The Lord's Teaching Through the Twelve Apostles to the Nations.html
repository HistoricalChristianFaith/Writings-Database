<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter I.-The Two Ways; The First Commandment.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>1. There are two ways,<SUP><A HREF="#P4977_1857601">2</A></SUP> one of life and one of death;<SUP><A HREF="#P4978_1857769">3</A></SUP> but a great difference between the two ways. 2. The way of life, then, is this: First, thou shalt love God<SUP><A HREF="#P4979_1857930">4</A></SUP> who made thee; second, thy neighbour as thyself;<SUP><A HREF="#P4980_1858111">5</A></SUP> and all things whatsoever thou wouldst should not occur to thee, thou also to another do not do.<SUP><A HREF="#P4981_1858269">6</A></SUP> 3. And of these sayings<SUP><A HREF="#P4982_1858348">7</A></SUP> the teaching is this: Bless them that curse you, and pray for your enemies, and fast for them that persecute you.<SUP><A HREF="#P4983_1858523">8</A></SUP> For what thank <I>is there</I>, if ye love them that love you? Do not also the Gentiles do the same?<SUP><A HREF="#P4984_1858727">9</A></SUP> But do ye love them that hate you; and ye shall not have an enemy.<SUP><A HREF="#P4985_1858859">10</A></SUP> 4. Abstain thou from fleshly and worldly lusts.<SUP><A HREF="#P4986_1858962">11</A></SUP> If one give thee a blow upon thy right cheek, turn to him the other also;<SUP><A HREF="#P4987_1859126">12</A></SUP> and thou shalt be perfect. If one impress thee for one mile, go with him two.<SUP><A HREF="#P4988_1859235">13</A></SUP> If one take away thy cloak, give him also thy coat.<SUP><A HREF="#P4989_1859305">14</A></SUP> If one take from thee thine own, ask it not back<SUP><A HREF="#P4990_1859385">15</A></SUP> for indeed thou art not able. 5. Give to every one that asketh thee, and ask it not back;<SUP><A HREF="#P4991_1859620">16</A></SUP> for the Father willeth that to all should be given of our own blessings (free gifts).<SUP><A HREF="#P4992_1859839">17</A></SUP> Happy <I>is</I> he that giveth according to the commandment; for he is guiltless. Woe to him <I>that receiveth</I>; for if one having need receiveth, he is guiltless; but he that receiveth not having need, shall pay the penalty, why he received and for what, and, coming into straits (confinement),<SUP><A HREF="#P4993_1860311">18</A></SUP> he shall be examined concerning the things which he hath done, and he shall not escape thence until he pay back the last farthing.<SUP><A HREF="#P4994_1860506">19</A></SUP> 6. But also now concerning this, it hath been said, Let thine alms sweat<SUP><A HREF="#P4995_1860597">20</A></SUP> in thy hands, until thou know to whom thou Shouldst give.</P>

Thou shalt not be double-minded nor double-tongued; for to be double-tongued is a snare of death.<SUP><A HREF="#P5008_1862218">30</A></SUP> 5. Thy speech shall not be false, nor empty, but fulfilled by deed.<SUP><A HREF="#P5009_1862309">31</A></SUP> 6. Thou shalt not be covetous, nor rapacious, nor a hypocrite, nor evil disposed, nor haughty. Thou shalt not take evil counsel against thy neighbour.<SUP><A HREF="#P5010_1862517">32</A></SUP> 7. Thou shalt not hate any man; but some thou shalt reprove,<SUP><A HREF="#P5011_1862624">33</A></SUP> and concerning some thou shalt pray, and some thou shalt love more than thy own life.<SUP><A HREF="#P5012_1862754">34</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>1. My child,<SUP><A HREF="#P5017_1863277">36</A></SUP> flee from every evil thing, and from every likeness of it. 2. Be not prone to anger, for anger leadeth the way to murder; neither jealous, nor quarrelsome, nor of hot temper; for out of all these murders are engendered. 3. My child, be not a lustful one; for lust leadeth the way to fornication; neither a filthy talker, nor of lofty eye; for out of all these adulteries are engendered. 4. My child, be not an observer of omens, since it leadeth the way to idolatry; neither an enchanter, nor an astrologer, nor a purifier, nor be willing to took at these things; for out of all these idolatry is engendered. 5. My child, be not a liar, since a lie leadeth the way to theft; neither money-loving, nor vainglorious, 6for out of all these thefts are engendered. 6. My child, be not a murmurer, since it leadeth the way to blasphemy; neither self-willed nor evil-minded, for out of all these blasphemies are engendered. 7. But be thou meek, since the meek shall inherit the earth.<SUP><A HREF="#P5018_1864324">37</A></SUP> 8. Be long-suffering and pitiful and guileless and gentle and good and always trembling at the words which thou hast heard.<SUP><A HREF="#P5019_1864465">38</A></SUP> 9. Thou shalt not exalt thyself,<SUP><A HREF="#P5020_1864553">39</A></SUP> nor give over-confidence to thy soul. Thy soul shall not be joined with lofty ones, but with just and lowly ones shall it have its intercourse. 10. The workings that befall thee receive as good, knowing that apart from God nothing cometh to pass.<SUP><A HREF="#P5021_1864826">40</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>1. My child, him that speaketh to thee the word of God remember night and day; and thou shalt honour him as the Lord;<SUP><A HREF="#P5026_1865506">42</A></SUP> for <I>in the place</I> whence lordly rule is uttered,<SUP><A HREF="#P5027_1865641">43</A></SUP> there is the Lord. 2. And thou shalt seek out day by day the faces of the saints, in order that thou mayest rest upon<SUP><A HREF="#P5028_1865871">44</A></SUP> their words. 3. Thou shalt not long for<SUP><A HREF="#P5029_1865962">45</A></SUP> division, but shalt bring those who contend to peace. Thou shalt judge righteously, thou shalt not respect persons in reproving for transgressions. 4. Thou shalt not be undecided whether it shall be or no.<SUP><A HREF="#P5030_1866275">46</A></SUP> 5. Be not a stretcher forth of the hands to receive and a drawer of them back to give.<SUP><A HREF="#P5031_1866512">47</A></SUP> 6. If thou hast <I>aught</I>, through thy hands thou shalt give ransom for thy sins.<SUP><A HREF="#P5032_1866699">48</A></SUP> 7. Thou shalt not hesitate to give, nor murmur when thou givest; for thou shalt know who is the good repayer of the hire. 8. Thou shalt not turn away from him that is in want, but thou shalt share all things with thy brother, and shalt not say that they are thine own; for if ye are partakers in that which is immortal, how much more in things which are mortal?<SUP><A HREF="#P5033_1867126">49</A></SUP> 9. Thou shalt not remove thy hand from thy son or from thy daughter, but from <I>their</I> youth shalt teach <I>them</I> the fear of God.<SUP><A HREF="#P5034_1867429">50</A></SUP> 10 Thou shalt not enjoin aught in thy bitterness upon thy bondman or maidservant, who hope in the same God, lest ever they shall fear not God who is over both;<SUP><A HREF="#P5035_1867612">51</A></SUP> for he cometh not to call according to the outward appearance, but unto them whom the Spirit hath prepared. 11. And ye bondmen shall be subject to your<SUP><A HREF="#P5036_1867799">52</A></SUP> masters as to a type of God, in modesty and fear.<SUP><A HREF="#P5037_1867900">53</A></SUP> 12. Thou shalt hate all hypocrisy and everything which is not pleasing to the Lord. 13. Do thou in no wise forsake the commandments of the Lord; but thou shalt keep what thou hast received, neither adding <I>thereto</I> nor taking away <I>therefrom</I>.<SUP><A HREF="#P5038_1868177">54</A></SUP> 14. In the church<SUP><A HREF="#P5039_1868215">55</A></SUP> thou shalt acknowledge thy transgressions, and thou shalt not come near for thy prayer<SUP><A HREF="#P5040_1868446">56</A></SUP> with an evil conscience.<SUP><A HREF="#P5041_1868515">57</A></SUP> This is the way of life.<SUP><A HREF="#P5042_1868619">58</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>1. And the way of death<SUP><A HREF="#P5047_1868896">60</A></SUP> is this: First of all it is evil and full of curse:<SUP><A HREF="#P5048_1869016">61</A></SUP> murders,<SUP><A HREF="#P5049_1869097">62</A></SUP> adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries, magic arts, witchcrafts, rapines, false witnessings, hypocrisies, double-heartedness, deceit, haughtiness, depravity, self-will, greediness, filthy talking, jealousy, over-confidence, loftiness, boastfulness; 2. persecutors of the good,<SUP><A HREF="#P5050_1869648">63</A></SUP> hating truth, loving a lie, not knowing a reward for righteousness, not cleaving<SUP><A HREF="#P5051_1869816">64</A></SUP> to good nor to righteous judgment, watching not for that which is good, but for that which is evil; from whom meekness and endurance are far, loving vanities, pursuing requital, not pitying a poor man, not labouring for the afflicted, not knowing Him that made them, murderers of children, destroyers of the handiwork of God, turning away from him that is in want afflicting him that is distressed, advocates of the rich, lawless judges of the poor, utter sinners.<SUP><A HREF="#P5052_1870409">65</A></SUP> Be delivered, children, from all these.<SUP><A HREF="#P5053_1870816">66</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>1. See that no one cause thee to err<SUP><A HREF="#P5058_1871186">68</A></SUP> from this way of the Teaching, since apart from God it teacheth thee. 2. For if thou art able to bear all the yoke<SUP><A HREF="#P5059_1871406">69</A></SUP> of the Lord, thou wilt be perfect; but if thou art not able, what thou art able that do. 3. And concerning food,<SUP><A HREF="#P5060_1871751">70</A></SUP> bear what thou art able; but against that which is sacrificed to idols<SUP><A HREF="#P5061_1872020">71</A></SUP> be exceedingly on thy guard; for it is the service of dead gods.<SUP><A HREF="#P5062_1872277">72</A></SUP> </P>

But if thou have not either, pour out water thrice<SUP><A HREF="#P5070_1873464">77</A></SUP> upon the head into the name of Father and Son and Holy Spirit. 4.

Neither pray as the hypocrites; but as the Lord commanded in His Gospel,<SUP><A HREF="#P5078_1874797">82</A></SUP> thus pray: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth. Give us to-day our daily (needful) bread,<SUP><A HREF="#P5079_1875239">83</A></SUP> and forgive us our debt as we also forgive our debtors.

Even as this broken <I>bread</I> was scattered over the hills,<SUP><A HREF="#P5089_1877180">90</A></SUP> and was gathered together and became one, so let Thy Church be gathered together from the ends of the earth into Thy kingdom;<SUP><A HREF="#P5090_1877422">91</A></SUP> for Thine is the glory and the power through Jesus Christ for ever. 5. But let no one eat or drink of your Thanksgiving (Eucharist), but they who have been baptized into the name of the Lord; for concerning this also the Lord hath said, Give not that which is holy to the dogs.<SUP><A HREF="#P5091_1877866">92</A></SUP> </P>

We thank Thee, holy Father, for Thy holy name which Thou didst cause to tabernacle in our hearts, and for the knowledge and faith and immortality, which Thou modest known to us through Jesus Thy Servant; to Thee be the glory for ever. 3. Thou, Master almighty, didst create all things for Thy name's sake; Thou gavest food and drink to men for enjoyment, that they might give thanks to Thee; but to us Thou didst freely give spiritual food and drink and life eternal through Thy Servant.<SUP><A HREF="#P5097_1879116">95</A></SUP> 4.

</UL><P>1. Whosoever, therefore, cometh and teacheth you all these things that have been said before, receive him.<SUP><A HREF="#P5108_1881138">103</A></SUP> 2. But if the teacher himself turn<SUP><A HREF="#P5109_1881242">104</A></SUP> and teach another doctrine to the destruction of this, hear him not; but <I>if he teach</I> so as to increase righteousness and the knowledge of the Lord, receive him as the Lord. 3.

Let every apostle that cometh to you be received as the Lord.<SUP><A HREF="#P5110_1881640">105</A></SUP> 5. But he shall not remain <I>except</I> one day; but if there be need, also the next; but if he remain three days, he is a false prophet. 6.

And every prophet that speaketh in the Spirit<SUP><A HREF="#P5112_1882423">107</A></SUP> ye shall neither try nor judge; for every sin shall be forgiven, but this sin shall not be forgiven.<SUP><A HREF="#P5113_1882647">108</A></SUP> 8. But not every one that speaketh in the Spirit is a prophet; but only if he hold the ways of the Lord. Therefore from their ways shall the false prophet and the prophet be known. 9.

Many hold that the term "nations" (or "Gentiles") points to a Jewish Christian as the author (so Bryennios), though this is denied by others (so Brown) A similar diversity of opinion exists as to the class of readers; but, if the early date is accepted, the more probable theory is, that the first part at least of the manual was for the instruction of catechumens of Gentile birth (so Bryennios, Schaff).

<br><br><sup id="P5059_1871406">69</sup>: Or, "the whole yoke." Those who accept the Jewish-Christian authorship refer this to the ceremonial law. It seems quite as likely to mean ascetic regulations. Of these there are many traces, even in the New-Testament churches.
<br><br><sup id="P5060_1871751">70</sup>: Apostolic Constitutions , vii. 20, begins with a similar phrase, but is explicitly against asceticism in this respect. The precepts here do not indicate any such spirit as that opposed by Paul.
<br><br><sup id="P5061_1872020">71</sup>: Comp. Acts xv. 20, 29; 1 Cor. viii. 4, etc., x. 18, etc. (Rom. xiv. 20 refers to ascetic abstinence.) This prohibition had a necessary permanence; comp. Apostolic Constitutions , vii. 21.
<br><br><sup id="P5062_1872277">72</sup>: Comp. the same phrase in 2 Clement, iii. This chapter closes the first part of the Teaching , that supposed to be intended for catechumens. The absence of doctrinal statement does not necessarily prove the existence of a circle of Gentile Christians where the Pauline theology was unknown. If such a circle existed, emphasizing the ethical side of Christianity to the exclusion of its doctrinal basis, it disappeared very soon. From the nature of the case, that kind of Christianity is intellectually weak and necessarily short-lived.
<br><br><sup id="P5066_1872875">73</sup>: Verse 1 is found, well-nigh entire, in Apostolic Constitutions vii. 22, but besides this only a few words of verses 2 and 4. The chapter has naturally called out much discussion as to the mode of baptism.

<br><br><sup id="P5070_1873464">77</sup>: The previous verses point to immersion; this permits pouring in certain cases, which indicates that this mode was not unknown. The trine application of the water, and its being poured on the head, are both significant.
<br><br><sup id="P5071_1873909">78</sup>: The fasting of the baptized is enjoined in Apostolic Constitutions , but that of the baptizer (and others) is peculiar to this document.
<br><br><sup id="P5074_1874064">79</sup>: The entire chapter is found almost verbatim in Apostolic Constitutions , vii. 23, 24.
<br><br><sup id="P5076_1874255">80</sup>: Comp. Matt. vi. 16.
<br><br><sup id="P5077_1874398">81</sup>: The reasons for fasting on Wednesday and Friday are given in Apostolic Constitutions (the days of betrayal and of burial). Monday and Thursday were the Jewish fast-days. The word "Preparation" (day before the Jewish sabbath) occurs in Matt. xxvii. 62, etc., and for some time retained a place in Christian literature.
<br><br><sup id="P5078_1874797">82</sup>: Matt. vi. 5, 9-13. This form of the Lord's Prayer is evidently cited from Matthew, not from Luke. The textual variations are slight. The citation is of importance as proving that the writer used this Gospel, and that the liturgical use of the Lord's Prayer was common.
<br><br><sup id="P5079_1875239">83</sup>: On this phrase, comp. Revised Version, Matt. vi. 11; Luke xi. 3 (text, margin, and American appendix).
<br><br><sup id="P5080_1875529">84</sup>: The variation in the form of the doxology confirms the judgment of textual criticism, which omits it in Matt. vi. 13. All early liturgical literature tends in the same direction; comp. Apostolic Constitutions , vii. 24.
<br><br><sup id="P5081_1875785">85</sup>: This is in accordance with Jewish usage. Dan. vi. 10; Ps. lv. 17. Comp. Acts iii. 1, x. 9.
<br><br><sup id="P5084_1875893">86</sup>: The eucharistic prayers of this and the following chapter are only partially reproduced in Apostolic Constitutions , vii. 25, 26; that of verse 2 has no parallel.
<br><br><sup id="P5086_1876187">87</sup>: This is a variation from the order of the New Testament and of all liturgies: probably this led to its omission in Apostolic Constitutions . The word "for" may be substituted for "concerning" here and in verse 3. [Possibly a response for recipients.]
<br><br><sup id="P5087_1876509">88</sup>: Peculiar to this passage, but derived from a common scriptural figure and from the paschal formula. Comp. especially John xv. 1; Matt. xxvi. 29; Mark xiv. 25.
<br><br><sup id="P5088_1876797">89</sup>: The word kla/sma is found in the accounts of the feeding of the multitude (Matt. xiv. 20, xv. 37, and parallels); it was naturally applied to the broken bread of the Eucharist.
<br><br><sup id="P5089_1877180">90</sup>: This reference to "hills," or "mountains," is used as an argument against the Egyptian origin of the Teaching.
<br><br><sup id="P5090_1877422">91</sup>: This part of the verse is found in Apostolic Constitutions . Schaff properly calls attention to the distinction here made between "Thy Church" and "Thy kingdom."
<br><br><sup id="P5091_1877866">92</sup>: Matt. vii. 6.
<br><br><sup id="P5094_1877896">93</sup>: This post-communion thanksgiving is found in Apostolic Constitutions , vii. 26, but with many omissions, alterations, and additions. Still, the correspondence in thought and language is very remarkable. Schaff cites a similar prayer at the Passover (after the Hallel cup).
<br><br><sup id="P5096_1878225">94</sup>: "After the participation" ( Apostolic Constitutions ) points to a distinct Eucharistic service. Here the Lord's Supper is evidently connected with the Agape [a noteworthy suggestion]; comp. 1 Cor. xi. 20-22, 33. This is an evidence of early date; comp. Justin Martyr, Apol. i. chaps. 64-66, where the Lord's Supper is shown to be distinct ( Ante-Nicene Fathers , i. pp. 185, 186).
<br><br><sup id="P5097_1879116">95</sup>: This last clause has no parallel in Apostolic Constitutions , and points to an earlier and more spiritual conception of the Eucharist. Verse 4 also is peculiar to this passage.
<br><br><sup id="P5098_1879575">96</sup>: The above rendering follows Bryennios; that of Harnack (formerly accepted by Hall and Napier) is: "Gather it, sanctified, from the four winds, into Thy kingdom," etc. The phrase "from the four winds" recalls Matt. xxiv. 31.
<br><br><sup id="P5099_1879900">97</sup>: This is peculiar; but comp. 1 Cor. vii. 31 for the last clause.
<br><br><sup id="P5100_1879994">98</sup>: The Codex reads tw= qew , which Bryennios alters to tw= u9iw= . The former is the more difficult reading, and is defended by Harnack.
<br><br><sup id="P5101_1880213">99</sup>: This exhortation indicates a mixed assembly; comp. Apostolic Constitutions . [If so, it belongs to the Agape .]
<br><br><sup id="P5102_1880341">100</sup>: 1 Cor. xvi. 22, Revised Version, margin: "That is, our Lord cometh. " Comp. Rev. xxii. 20.
<br><br><sup id="P5103_1880516">101</sup>: A limitation as compared with 1 Cor. xiv 29, 31, and yet indicating a combination of extemporaneous devotion with the liturgical form. The verse prepares the way for the next chapter.
<br><br><sup id="P5106_1880719">102</sup>: The Apostolic Constitutions (vii. 27) present scarcely any parallel to this chapter, which points to an earlier period, when ecclesiastical polity was less developed, and the travelling "Apostles" and "Prophets" here spoken of were numerous. [Elucidation II.]
<br><br><sup id="P5108_1881138">103</sup>: This refers to all teachers, more fully described afterwards.
<br><br><sup id="P5109_1881242">104</sup>: Lit. "being turned:" i.e. turned from the truth, perverted.
<br><br><sup id="P5110_1881640">105</sup>: Matt. x. 40. The mention of apostles here has caused much discussion, but there are many indications that travelling evangelists were thus termed for some time after the apostolic age. Bishop I.ightfoot has shown, that, even in the New Testament, a looser use of the term applied it to others than the Twelve. Comp. Rom. xvi. 7; 1 Cor. xv. 5, 7 (?); Gal. i. 19; 1 Thess. ii. 6: also, as applied to Barnabas, Acts xiv. 4, 14.
<br><br><sup id="P5111_1882289">106</sup>: Reach a place where he can lodge.
<br><br><sup id="P5112_1882423">107</sup>: Under the influence of the charismatic gift spoken of in 1 Cor. xii. 3, xiv. 2.Another indication of an early date.
<br><br><sup id="P5113_1882647">108</sup>: Probably a reference to the sin against the Holy Spirit. Matt. xii. 31, 32; Mark iii. 29, 30.
<br><br><sup id="P5114_1882970">109</sup>: Probably a love-feast, commanded by the prophet in his peculiar utterance.
<br><br><sup id="P5115_1883256">110</sup>: a0lhqino/j , "genuine."
<br><br><sup id="P5116_1883339">111</sup>: poiw=n ei0j musth/rion kosmiko\n e0kklhsiaj , "working unto a worldly mystery of (the) Church," or "making assemblies for a worldly mystery." Either rendering is grammatical: neither is very intelligible. The paraphrase in the above version presents one leading view of this difficult passage: the mystery is the Church, and a worldly one, because the Church is in the world. The other leading view joins e0kklhsiaj (as accusative) with poiw=n , "making assemblies for a worldly mystery." So Bryennios, who regards the worldly mystery as a symbolical act of the prophet. Others suggest, as the mystery for which the assemblies are called, revelation of future events, celibacy, the Eucharist, the ceremonial law. It seems, at all events, to point to incipient fanaticism on the part of the prophets of those days. [Elucidation III.] This was likely to take the form either of asceticism or of extravagant predictions and mystical fancies about the Church in the world. Did we know the place and the time more accurately, we might decide which was meant. This caution was evidently needed: Let God judge such extravagances.
<br><br><sup id="P5119_1884819">112</sup>: Verse 1 is almost identical with the beginning of Apostolic Constitutions , vii. 28; the remaining verses have no parallel.
<br><br><sup id="P5121_1885044">113</sup>: All professed Christians are meant.
<br><br><sup id="P5122_1885403">114</sup>: Comp. 2 Thess. iii. 10.
<br><br><sup id="P5123_1885526">115</sup>: The term occurs only here in the Teaching.
<br><br><sup id="P5124_1885664">116</sup>: "Christ-trafficker." The abuse of Christian fellowship and hospitality naturally followed the remarkable extension of Christianity. This expressive term was coined to designate the class of idlers who would make gain out of their professed Christianity. It occurs in the longer form of the Ignatian Epistles ( Trallians , vi.) and in literature of the fourth century.
<br><br><sup id="P5127_1886086">117</sup>: A large part of this chapter is found in Apostolic Constitutions vii. 28, 29, but with modifications and additions indicating a later date.
<br><br><sup id="P5129_1886312">118</sup>: "Who will settle among you" (Hitchcock and Brown). The itinerant prophets might become stationary, we infer. Chaps. xi.-xv. point to a movement from an itinerant and extraordinary ministry to a more settled one.
<br><br><sup id="P5130_1886557">119</sup>: Lit., "nourishment," "food."
<br><br><sup id="P5131_1886670">120</sup>: Matt. x. 10; comp. Luke x. 7.
<br><br><sup id="P5132_1886887">121</sup>: This phrase, indicating a sacerdotal view of the ministry, seems to point to a later date than that claimed for the Teaching . Some regard it as an interpolation: others take it in a figurative sense. In Apostolic Constitutions the sacerdotal view is more marked. [1 Pet. ii. 9. If the plebs = "priests," prophets = "high priests."] Here the term is restricted to the prophets: compare Schaff in loco.
<br><br><sup id="P5135_1887711">122</sup>: Verses 1 and 3 are given substantially in Apostolic Constitutions , vii. 30. This chapter would seem to belong more properly before chap. viii.; but the same order of topics is followed in Apostolic Constitutions ,-a remarkable proof of literary connection.
<br><br><sup id="P5137_1888036">123</sup>: Comp. Rev. i. 10. Here the full form is kata\ kuriakh\n de\ Kuri/ou . If the early date is allowed, this verse confirms the view that from the first the Lord's Day was observed, and that, too, by a eucharistic celebration.
<br><br><sup id="P5138_1888382">124</sup>: Comp chap. iv. 14. No parallel in Apostolic Constitutions .
<br><br><sup id="P5139_1888481">125</sup>: On this spiritual sense of "sacrifice," comp. Rom. xii. 1; Phil. ii. 17; Heb. xiii. 15; 1 Pet. ii. 5.
<br><br><sup id="P5140_1888628">126</sup>: "That hath the (or, any) dispute" ( a0mfiboli/an ); comp. Matt. v. 23, 24.
<br><br><sup id="P5141_1888919">127</sup>: [See Mal. i. 11. See Irenaeus, cap. xvii. 5, vol. i. p. 484.]
<br><br><sup id="P5142_1889071">128</sup>: Mal. i. 11, 14. Quoted in Apostolic Constitutions and by several Ante-Nicene Fathers, with the same reference to the Eucharist.
<br><br><sup id="P5145_1889218">129</sup>: The larger part of verse 1, and a clause from verses 2, 3, respectively, are found in Apostolic Constitutions , vii. 31. Verses 1, 2, both in the use of terms and in the Church polity indicated, point to an early date: (1) There are evident marks of a transition from extraordinary to ordinary ministers. (2) The distinction between bishops and elders does not appear [1 Pet. v. 1. Vol. i. p. 16, this series], and yet it is found in Ignatius. (3) The word xeirotone/w is here used in the sense of "elect" or "appoint" (by show of hands), and not in that of "ordain'" (by laying on of hands). The former is the New Testament sense (Acts xiv. 23; 2 Cor. viii. 19), also in Ignatius; the latter sense is found in Apostolic Canons , i. (4) The choice by the people also indicates an early period.
<br><br><sup id="P5147_1890171">130</sup>: Comp. 1 Tim. iii. 4.
<br><br><sup id="P5148_1890264">131</sup>: Or, "ministry." This clause and the following verse indicate that the extraordinary ministers were as yet more highly regarded.
<br><br><sup id="P5149_1890615">132</sup>: Comp. Matt. xviii. 15-17.
<br><br><sup id="P5150_1890681">133</sup>: The word a0stoxe/w , occurring here, means "to miss the mark;" in New Testament, "to err" or, "swerve." See 1 Tim. i. 6, vi. 21; 2 Tim. ii. 18.
<br><br><sup id="P5151_1891011">134</sup>: The reference here is probably to the Sermon on the Mount: Matt. v.-vii., especially to chap. vi.
<br><br><sup id="P5154_1891130">135</sup>: The resemblance between this chapter and Apostolic Constitutions , vii. 31, 32, is mainly in order of topics and in the identity of some phrases and terms. Verses 3 and 4 (to the word "world-deceiver") are reproduced almost verbatim. That the writer of the Teaching used Matt. xxiv. is extremely probable, but the connection of Apostolic Constitutions , with this passage is evident. In Barnabas , iv., there are a few corresponding phrases.
<br><br><sup id="P5156_1891645">136</sup>: Or, "over your life;" the clause occurs verbatim in Apostolic Constitutions .
<br><br><sup id="P5157_1891786">137</sup>: Comp. Luke xii. 35, which is exactly cited in Apostolic Constitutions .
<br><br><sup id="P5158_1891932">138</sup>: Matt. xxiv. 42.
<br><br><sup id="P5159_1892100">139</sup>: Here Barnabas , iv., furnishes a parallel.
<br><br><sup id="P5160_1892217">140</sup>: This reference to the last days as present or impending is an evidence of early date; comp. Barnabas , iv., and many passages in the New Testament. The mistake has been in measuring God's prophetic chronology by our mathematical standard of years.
<br><br><sup id="P5161_1892601">141</sup>: Comp. Matt. xxiv. 11, 12.
<br><br><sup id="P5162_1892724">142</sup>: Comp. Matt. xxiv. 10.
<br><br><sup id="P5163_1892794">143</sup>: o0 kosmopla/noj , found only here and in Apostolic Constitutions , vii. 32. Comp. 2 Thess. ii. 3, 4, 8; Rev. xii. 9.
<br><br><sup id="P5164_1892931">144</sup>: Not found in Apostolic Constitutions . The expression plainly implies the belief that Jesus Christ was Son of God.
<br><br><sup id="P5165_1893084">145</sup>: Comp. Matt. xxiv. 24. The rest of the verse has no parallel.
<br><br><sup id="P5166_1893353">146</sup>: Comp. 1 Pet. iv. 12. where pu/rwsij also occurs.
<br><br><sup id="P5167_1893512">147</sup>: Comp. Matt x. 22 and similar passages; none of them directly cited here.
<br><br><sup id="P5168_1893621">148</sup>: u9h' au0tou= tou= kataqe/matoj , "from under the curse itself:" namely, that which has just been described. Bryennios and others render "by the curse Himself;" that is, Christ, whom they were tempted to revile. All other interpretations either rest on textual emendations or are open to grammatical objections. Of the two given above, that of Hall and Napier seems preferable.
<br><br><sup id="P5169_1894053">149</sup>: "Truth" might refer to Christ Himself, but the personal advent is spoken of in verse 8; it is better, then, to refer it to the truth respecting the parousia held by the early Christians. For this belief they were mocked, and hence dwelt upon it and the prophecies respecting it. The verse is probably based upon Matt. xxiv. 30, 31; but some find here, as in verse 4, an allusion to Paul's eschatological statements in the Epistles to the Thessalonians.
<br><br><sup id="P5170_1894549">150</sup>: Professor Hall now prefers to render e/kpeta/sewj , "outspreading," instead of "unrolling," as in his version originally. Hitchcock and Brown, Schaff, and others, prefer "opening;" that is, the apparent opening in heaven through which the Lord will descend. "Outspreading" is usually explained (so Professor Hall) as meaning the expanded sign of the cross in the heavens, the patristic interpretation of Matt. xxiv. 30. Bryennios and Farrar refer it to the flying forth of the saints to meet the Lord. There are other interpretations based on textual emendations. As the word is very rare, it is difficult to determine the exact sense. "Opening" seems lexically allowable and otherwise free from objection.
<br><br><sup id="P5171_1895448">151</sup>: Zech. xiv. 5. This citation is given substantially in Apostolic Constitutions . As here used, it seems to point to the first resurrection. Comp. 1 Thess. iv. 17; 1 Cor. xv. 23; Rev. xx. 5. Probably it is based upon the Pauline eschatology rather than upon that of the Apocalypse. At all events, there is no allusion to the millennial statement of the latter. Since there was in the early Church, in connection with the expectation of the speedy coming of Christ, a marked tendency to Chiliasm, the silence respecting the millennium may indicate that the writer was not acquainted with the Apocalypse. This inference is allowable, however, only on the assumption of the early date of the Teaching .
<br><br><sup id="P5172_1896222">152</sup>: Comp. Matt. xxiv. 30. The conclusion is abrupt, and in Apostolic Constitutions the New-Testament doctrine of future punishment and reward is added. The absence of all reference to the destruction of Jerusalem would indicate that some time had elapsed since that event. An interval of from thirty to sixty years may well be claimed.
