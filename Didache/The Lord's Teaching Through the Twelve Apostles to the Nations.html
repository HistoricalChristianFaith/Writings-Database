<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter I.-The Two Ways; The First Commandment.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>1. There are two ways,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4977_1857601">2</A></SUP> one of life and one of death;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4978_1857769">3</A></SUP> but a great difference between the two ways. 2. The way of life, then, is this: First, thou shalt love God<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4979_1857930">4</A></SUP> who made thee; second, thy neighbour as thyself;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4980_1858111">5</A></SUP> and all things whatsoever thou wouldst should not occur to thee, thou also to another do not do.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4981_1858269">6</A></SUP> 3. And of these sayings<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4982_1858348">7</A></SUP> the teaching is this: Bless them that curse you, and pray for your enemies, and fast for them that persecute you.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4983_1858523">8</A></SUP> For what thank <I>is there</I>, if ye love them that love you? Do not also the Gentiles do the same?<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4984_1858727">9</A></SUP> But do ye love them that hate you; and ye shall not have an enemy.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4985_1858859">10</A></SUP> 4. Abstain thou from fleshly and worldly lusts.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4986_1858962">11</A></SUP> If one give thee a blow upon thy right cheek, turn to him the other also;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4987_1859126">12</A></SUP> and thou shalt be perfect. If one impress thee for one mile, go with him two.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4988_1859235">13</A></SUP> If one take away thy cloak, give him also thy coat.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4989_1859305">14</A></SUP> If one take from thee thine own, ask it not back<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4990_1859385">15</A></SUP> for indeed thou art not able. 5. Give to every one that asketh thee, and ask it not back;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4991_1859620">16</A></SUP> for the Father willeth that to all should be given of our own blessings (free gifts).<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4992_1859839">17</A></SUP> Happy <I>is</I> he that giveth according to the commandment; for he is guiltless. Woe to him <I>that receiveth</I>; for if one having need receiveth, he is guiltless; but he that receiveth not having need, shall pay the penalty, why he received and for what, and, coming into straits (confinement),<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4993_1860311">18</A></SUP> he shall be examined concerning the things which he hath done, and he shall not escape thence until he pay back the last farthing.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4994_1860506">19</A></SUP> 6. But also now concerning this, it hath been said, Let thine alms sweat<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn49.htm#P4995_1860597">20</A></SUP> in thy hands, until thou know to whom thou Shouldst give.</P>

</UL><P>1. My child,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn50.htm#P5017_1863277">36</A></SUP> flee from every evil thing, and from every likeness of it. 2. Be not prone to anger, for anger leadeth the way to murder; neither jealous, nor quarrelsome, nor of hot temper; for out of all these murders are engendered. 3. My child, be not a lustful one; for lust leadeth the way to fornication; neither a filthy talker, nor of lofty eye; for out of all these adulteries are engendered. 4. My child, be not an observer of omens, since it leadeth the way to idolatry; neither an enchanter, nor an astrologer, nor a purifier, nor be willing to took at these things; for out of all these idolatry is engendered. 5. My child, be not a liar, since a lie leadeth the way to theft; neither money-loving, nor vainglorious, 6for out of all these thefts are engendered. 6. My child, be not a murmurer, since it leadeth the way to blasphemy; neither self-willed nor evil-minded, for out of all these blasphemies are engendered. 7. But be thou meek, since the meek shall inherit the earth.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn50.htm#P5018_1864324">37</A></SUP> 8. Be long-suffering and pitiful and guileless and gentle and good and always trembling at the words which thou hast heard.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn50.htm#P5019_1864465">38</A></SUP> 9. Thou shalt not exalt thyself,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn50.htm#P5020_1864553">39</A></SUP> nor give over-confidence to thy soul. Thy soul shall not be joined with lofty ones, but with just and lowly ones shall it have its intercourse. 10. The workings that befall thee receive as good, knowing that apart from God nothing cometh to pass.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn50.htm#P5021_1864826">40</A></SUP> </P>

And thou shalt seek out day by day the faces of the saints, in order that thou mayest rest upon<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn50.htm#P5028_1865871">44</A></SUP> their words. 3. Thou shalt not long for<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn50.htm#P5029_1865962">45</A></SUP> division, but shalt bring those who contend to peace. Thou shalt judge righteously, thou shalt not respect persons in reproving for transgressions. 4. Thou shalt not be undecided whether it shall be or no.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn50.htm#P5030_1866275">46</A></SUP> 5. Be not a stretcher forth of the hands to receive and a drawer of them back to give.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn50.htm#P5031_1866512">47</A></SUP> 6. If thou hast <I>aught</I>, through thy hands thou shalt give ransom for thy sins.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn50.htm#P5032_1866699">48</A></SUP> 7. Thou shalt not hesitate to give, nor murmur when thou givest; for thou shalt know who is the good repayer of the hire. 8. Thou shalt not turn away from him that is in want, but thou shalt share all things with thy brother, and shalt not say that they are thine own; for if ye are partakers in that which is immortal, how much more in things which are mortal?<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn50.htm#P5033_1867126">49</A></SUP> 9. Thou shalt not remove thy hand from thy son or from thy daughter, but from <I>their</I> youth shalt teach <I>them</I> the fear of God.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn50.htm#P5034_1867429">50</A></SUP> 10 Thou shalt not enjoin aught in thy bitterness upon thy bondman or maidservant, who hope in the same God, lest ever they shall fear not God who is over both;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn50.htm#P5035_1867612">51</A></SUP> for he cometh not to call according to the outward appearance, but unto them whom the Spirit hath prepared. 11.

But if the teacher himself turn<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn51.htm#P5109_1881242">104</A></SUP> and teach another doctrine to the destruction of this, hear him not; but <I>if he teach</I> so as to increase righteousness and the knowledge of the Lord, receive him as the Lord. 3. But concerning the apostles and prophets, according to the decree of the Gospel, thus do. 4. Let every apostle that cometh to you be received as the Lord.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn51.htm#P5110_1881640">105</A></SUP> 5. But he shall not remain <I>except</I> one day; but if there be need, also the next; but if he remain three days, he is a false prophet. 6. And when the apostle goeth away, let him take nothing but bread until he lodgeth;<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn51.htm#P5111_1882289">106</A></SUP> but if he ask money, he is a false prophet. 7. And every prophet that speaketh in the Spirit<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn51.htm#P5112_1882423">107</A></SUP> ye shall neither try nor judge; for every sin shall be forgiven, but this sin shall not be forgiven.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn51.htm#P5113_1882647">108</A></SUP> 8. But not every one that speaketh in the Spirit is a prophet; but only if he hold the ways of the Lord. Therefore from their ways shall the false prophet and the prophet be known. 9. And every prophet who ordereth a meal<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn51.htm#P5114_1882970">109</A></SUP> in the Spirit eateth not from it, except indeed he be a false prophet; 10. and every prophet who teacheth the truth, if he do not what he teacheth, is a false prophet. 11. And every prophet, proved true,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn51.htm#P5115_1883256">110</A></SUP> working unto the mystery of the Church in the world,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn51.htm#P5116_1883339">111</A></SUP> yet not teaching <I>others</I> to do what he himself doeth, shall not be judged among you, for with God he hath his judgment; for so did also the ancient prophets. But whoever saith in the Spirit, Give me money, or something else, ye shall not listen to him; but if he saith to you to give for others' sake who are in need, let no one judge him.</P>

Every first-fruit, therefore, of the products of wine-press and threshing-floor, of oxen and of sheep, thou shalt take and give to the prophets, for they are your high priests.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn51.htm#P5132_1886887">121</A></SUP> 4.
