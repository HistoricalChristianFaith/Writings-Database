<blockquote>
<p>&quot; MY love is crucified.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon this passage I differ from all the commentators that I know. I believe the passage to have been written and inserted in the text by
Dionysius when writing this letter, which must have been before A.D. 98. I do not think it a quotation from the letter of Ignatius written just previous to his martyrdom. I think Dionysius quoted some previous writing of Ignatius, in which he spoke of our Saviour as &quot;My Love, Which is mine.&quot; That is the sense in this passage, to shew the exalted use of Love. In the letter of
Ignatius to the Romans, he seems to use &quot;love&quot; in the sense of human passion or fire, and says that that is crucified in him. In any case, there is no chronological difficulty. Ignatius was martyred A.D. 107, Dionysius, A.D. 119.</p>
