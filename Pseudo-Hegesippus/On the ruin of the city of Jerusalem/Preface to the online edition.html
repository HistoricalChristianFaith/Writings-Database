<title> Ps.Hegesippus, translated from Latin into English (2005). Preface to the

<p align="center"><b>Ps.Hegesippus, translated from Latin into English (2005).
Preface to the online edition</b></p>
<hr>

<P>There is a Latin text extant in numerous medieval manuscripts under the title
of <i>De excidio urbis Hierosolymitanae</i> (<i>On the ruin of the city of
Jerusalem</i>) or <i>Historiae </i>(<i>History</i>).&nbsp; The text is an
original composition which borrows very heavily from the <i>Jewish War</i> of
Josephus, and is sometimes considered as a free translation and rearrangement of
that work.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
<P>The author is given in the manuscripts sometimes as Hegesippus -- which may
be a corruption of Iosippus, the spelling of Josephus in many of the
manuscripts.&nbsp; In other manuscripts it is ascribed to Ambrose of Milan, and
indeed is sometimes transmitted to us together with some of his works.&nbsp;
Scholars have sometimes attributed the work to him; others to Isaac, a Jewish
convert active in Roman ecclesiastical politics in the 370's.&nbsp; Most
scholars today consider the work anonymous, and by convention refer to it as
Pseudo-Hegesippus.&nbsp; It should not be confused with the Latin translation of
the <i>Jewish War</i> made by Rufinus, which is more literal and arranged in
seven books, and was made later.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with the lost works
of the second-century writer Hegesippus mentioned by Eusebius. </P>
<P><i>De excidio</i> is arranged in five books.&nbsp; Books 1-4 correspond to
the same books of the <i>Jewish War</i>; book 5 contains the material from books
5-6 and part of book 7 of Josephus.&nbsp; But material from <i>Antiquities</i>
is also being used. In book 2 a version of the so-called <i>Testimonium
Flavianum</i> can be found, although this might have come from one of the
versions of the <i>Jewish War</i> into which that had been interpolated, or
perhaps from Eusebius, <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>.&nbsp; But in book 2
chapter 4 the story of the seduction of Paulina comes from <i>Antiquities </i>18.3.&nbsp;
Likewise Book 1 chapter 38 contains material about a pestilence which followed
Herod's execution of his wife Mariamne, which comes from <i>Antiquities</i>
15.7, 9.&nbsp; Neither appears in any version of the <i>Jewish War</i>, so
indicating that the author had direct access to a manuscript of <i>Antiquities</i>. </P>
<P>The work is usually dated to between 370-c.375 AD.&nbsp; It contains in book
2 chapter 9 what seems to be an allusion to the recent reconquest of Britain by
Count Theodosius, ca. 370 AD, so cannot be earlier than this.&nbsp; It also
refers to Constantinople by name.&nbsp; There is a reference to a Latin
translation of Josephus in letter 71 of St. Jerome, written between 386 and 400
AD.&nbsp; The author refers to the triumphant position of the Roman empire,
which suggests that it must precede the imperial crisis brought on by the
disastrous defeat and death of the emperor Valens in battle with the Goths at
Adrianople in 378, and still more so the sack of Rome in 410. </P>
<p>The most recent critical edition was used for this translation : <i>Hegesippi
qui dicitur historiae libri V</i>, edited by Vincente Ussani in the <i>Corpus
Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum</i> series, volume 66, Vienna:
H&ouml;lder-Pichler-Tempsky (1932).</p>
<p>The translation that follows was never originally intended for
publication.&nbsp; It is really a 'crib', originally written to assist an
individual who was working with the Latin and didn't need to look up every word
every time. &nbsp;The author, Dr Wade Blocker, has no time to turn it into a
real translation but has kindly allowed it to appear online so other people may
use it. &nbsp;Dr Blocker has very kindly allowed us all access to it, but
of course it must not be criticised for not being what it never attempted to
be.&nbsp; I suspect that most of us will simply be grateful that the translator
spent the time to make a version of the whole of so obscure a work, and had the
generosity to share it with the world.</p>

<p align="left">Dr Leah Di Segni, who is working on the sources for Scythopolis 
/ Beth Shean, has written to me, raising concerns in the accuracy of the 
translation.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">I have decided to leave this translation up - it is, after all, 
the only one - and to add here Dr Di Segni's concerns.&nbsp; Revising the 
translation is something that I have no time to do; and Dr Blocker is since 
dead.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Here are the comments:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="left">I'll copy down here the Latin, the translation online of the 
	chapter (II, 17) and my translation, which takes into account also Josephus' 
	text &#8212; for one must admit that pseudo-Hegesippus' Latin is atrocious, and 
	therefore difficult to understand. You can see that parts of the online 
	translation are perhaps clumsy but not incorrect, parts do not make sense 
	(at least not to me), parts are downright wrong. See for instance the 
	mistaken interpretation (marked in red) of <i>necessitudini,</i>&nbsp;<i>in 
	secundis </i>and<i> gentes </i>(gentiles, not "people", since the story is 
	about the hostility of the gentile inhabitants of Scythopolis to their 
	Jewish fellow-citizens).</p>
	<p align="left"><span lang="EN-GB">Et quidem immanitatis eius exemplum 
	recens Scythopoli* etiam in maius processerat, quo incitatos Damascenos reor. 
	nam cum Iudaei finitima quaeque popularentur, venerunt Scythopolim atque 
	illic inhabitantes Iudaeos temtare adorsi adversarios experti sunt, quos 
	sibi fidos arbitrabantur, quoniam more ingenii humani praeponderabat aput 
	eos salutis cura <font color="#ff2600">necessitudini</font>.
	<font color="#ff2600">in secundis</font> igitur constituentes tribule 
	collegium praeferunt inhabitantium societatem, tribulibus cladem minantur. 
	quod suspectum <font color="#ff2600">gentibus</font>, quia promtioribus 
	studiis odiorum in suos exsecutio praetendebatur, ne simulationis specie 
	dolus adornaretur atque urbem incautioribus incolis noctu adorerentur 
	prostratisque omnibus <font color="#ff2600">gentibus</font> apud Iudaeos 
	sibi gratiam reconciliarent. ac per hoc si vellent fidem suam etiam circa 
	gentiles probare, cum omni generatione sua urbe excederent vicinumque 
	peterent nemus.&nbsp; quo facto per biduum quieverunt Scythopolitae ut portio 
	Iudaeorum suspectionem deponeret, indueret securitatem. Tertia nocte cum iam 
	praesumta fides gratiae removisset custodiae sollicitudinem, incautis et 
	dormientibus vis inlata decemque et trinus milibus hominum necatis 
	quaecumque etiam habuerunt direpta sunt.</span></p>
	<p align="left">For when the Jews were laying waste every neighboring area, 
	they came to Scythopolis and there the inhabitants having attacked to test 
	the Jews submitted to their adversaries, whom they considered faithful to 
	themselves, inasmuch as in the manner of human nature concern of safety 
	outweighed <font color="#ff2600">distress</font>. <font color="#ff2600">In 
	favorable circumstances</font> therefore establishing a brotherhood of 
	fellow tribesmen they preferred an alliance of inhabitants, they threaten 
	ruin to the fellow tribesman. Which was suspected by t<font color="#ff2600">he 
	people,</font> because the performance was stretched out by the manifest 
	spirit of hatreds, lest treachery should be gotten ready under the guise of 
	pretense and they should attack the city at night with the residents less 
	cautious, and with all t<font color="#ff2600">he people</font> having been 
	overthrown they should restore favor to themselves among the Jews. .And 
	besides to show their loyalty by this even around the gentiles if they 
	wished, every generation they would go out from their city and seek out the 
	neighboring grove. Which having been done the Scythopolitans were quiet for 
	two days so that a part of the Jews would put aside mistrust, would put on 
	carelessness. On the third night when already the anticipated trust in grace 
	had removed any apprehension of the guard, incautious and sleeping, violence 
	having been inflicted, and ten and three thousands of men were killed and 
	whatever things they had were plundered.&nbsp;</p>
	<p align="left">My translation:</p>
	<p align="left">For when the Jews were laying waste all the neighbouring 
	places, they came to Scythopolis and tried to work upon the Jews residing 
	there, but experienced the hostility of those, whom they thought loyal to 
	themselves, for, as is the way of human nature, with them the care of safety 
	outweighed <font color="#FF0000">the ties of kinship</font>. Thus, putting 
	the bond of nationality <font color="#FF0000">in second place</font>, they 
	preferred the alliance of their fellow-citizens and threaten destruction to 
	their own nationals. This fact, that the enactment of hatred against their 
	own kin was displayed with such ready eagerness, was suspect to the
	<font color="#FF0000">gentiles</font>, lest a trap was prepared under an 
	outward pretence and they would attack the city at night with the 
	inhabitants less watchful and restore their favour with the Jews by the 
	destruction of all the gentiles. And because of this (the Scythopolitans 
	declared) that if (the Jews) wished to prove their loyalty also to the
	<font color="#FF0000">gentiles</font>, they should walk out of the city with 
	all their families and go to a nearby grove. This done, for two days the 
	Scythopolitans did nothing, so that the party of Jews would abandon 
	suspicion and assume false confidence. On the third night, when the 
	anticipated trust in the amity (of their fellow-citizens) had removed all 
	care of keeping watch, an attack was made against the unguarded and sleeping 
	(Jews), thirteen thousand people were killed and all their property was 
	plundered. </p>
	<p align="left">Another example, in the next chapter,&nbsp;<i>sed non diutius 
	cognato debita sanguini vindicta defuit </i>(but not for long did the 
	vengeance fail that was due to the blood of his kin) is translated &quot;but not 
	for long to a kinsman was the vengeance owed to the blood lacking", and&nbsp;<i>etiam 
	filios ac parentes Simonis deleta multitudine ceterorum eminus licet 
	missilibus ac telis petebant</i> (after killing the greatest number of the 
	others they aimed from afar at Simon's children and parents with javelins 
	and darts) becomes &quot;a mob even having killed the sons and parents of Simon 
	although beyond reach of the rest they attacked with missiles and darts". 
	Which is the more absurd, when the next few lines describe the hero, Simon, 
	killing his family with his sword!</p>
	<p align="left">I cannot evaluate how much of the translation is wrong, but 
	even a 2% of such misleading translation of the text would be enough, in my 
	opinion, to make it a stumbling block and a danger to the readers, instead 
	that a help.&nbsp; As I see it, in several instances Blocker's translation 
	is misleading, or to be clearer: it gives readers to understand something 
	that is not, or even is contrary to, what ps. Hegesippus wrote &#8212; not to 
	speak of Josephus. Since this is history, not a novel, I would think readers 
	will turn to it to learn about historical facts, and having them falsified 
	may be worse than not being able to access them at all. </p>
