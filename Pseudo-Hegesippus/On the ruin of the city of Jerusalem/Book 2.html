<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>I.</SPAN>&nbsp;Herod having been buried the judgments of the people were drawn out as they
customarily are against the dead: he was oppressive and intolerable to them; a
tyrant not a king he enforced an unjust rule against the citizens; an assassin
of his own family members, a plunderer of the people, who left behind nothing
for anybody; taxes increased, everything taken away, foreigners enriched, the
Jews impoverished; who brought an enemy into the temple, who defiled all things
sacred by sacrilege. He rewarded those who were unworthy, while tortures were
not lacking for the living, after the release from captivity Judea endured more
evils in a few years under the rule of Herod than it sustained in the captivity
itself under a barbarous enemy, when the kings of the Babylonians ruled them.
Beneath them exile was more tolerable than living at home under Herod, <B>[p.
129] </B>released to their homeland by the former, driven into exile by the
latter. More savage than Darius, more haughty than Artaxerxes, more rapacious
than the Medians. To have hoped for an end to their evils, as it was permitted
them to go out from exile, if he should end his day, but Archelaus as his
voluntary successor invoked the misery of servitude, who would renew Herod and
add new things. This misfortune in the kingdoms was that the master was chosen,
the greater misfortune that he was imposed upon the unwilling. It is seen a
solace of servitude, if they choose a master for themselves, that because he is
more kindly if the supreme power is bestowed, more haughty if it is seized upon.
By far therefore Archelaus would be more intolerable than Herod because the
first seized the throne, the latter received it. These things were not only in
Judea deliberated, but thrown in his face even in Rome Archelaus standing
against vociferous accusers before Caesar and the senate, where it was long
contested about confirming the kingdom of Archelaus or denying it. Finally when
in the temple of Apollo, which Caesar had founded, and embellished with many
ornaments, the opportunity was given for investigation, the son Antipater of
Salome powerfully in speaking described in detail those things we mentioned
above and many others: himself to marvel that Archelaus was alleging that the
kingdom was being sought from Caesar, when he had already by a daring usurpation
long exercised the kingship inside Judea without Caesar having been consulted.
Why was the golden seat and the crown brought forth unless they were emblems of
the kingdom? With what arrogance had he presumed to sit upon the royal throne?
From the lofty throne to greet the people encompassed by surrounding military
ranks; in the certain manner and practice of emperors the crown to be brought
forth, which ought to have been preserved for the judgment of Caesar not only in
behalf of the power of the Roman empire but in accordance with the law of
testament. Indeed Herod had not been able to snatch from Caesar or <B>[p. 130]
</B>the senate, what he had accepted from the senate or received from Caesar,
and to have expressed adequately by an earlier testament an indication of his
own wish, by which in sound mind and considered judgment he declared Antipas to
succeed him in the royal power, and by a later to have reserved all things to
the judgment of Caesar, although at this time of sound body, disturbed by the
great danger and not capable at this time of any understanding or judgment he
dictated not what he was thinking but what was forced upon him. The seizer of
power therefore proclaimed about himself that he was not deserving by your
judgment, Caesar, to be substituted in the kingship, for if he had been
confident of his merit, he would have hastened to seek rather than to seize.
Moreover by not seeking but by usurping those things that were set forth in the
petition even to prejudge in money matters he mitigated that wrong-headed
litigants might prejudice their cases. Here truly not the gain of property was
called into question but the law of the Roman empire was violated, respect was
disdained, its power was despised; the senate of the Roman court, which was
accustomed to grant and to take away the kingship, was deemed unworthy, that it
should maintain with Caesar the long established prerogative of conferring the
supreme authority. Which was about to be done, when he began to be king
lawfully, who before the royal power had grown haughty? In addition he had
killed very many, because wearied by things they had asked for help and the
alleviation of the taxes, he inflicted war on those demanding relief, he killed
eight thousand Jews engaged in the venerable celebration itself among them of
the Passover, men sacrificed instead of sheep, the blood spilled of the
consecrated who had come together for the feast of the temple, a pitiable
spectacle. If anyone should review the slaughter of those killed, he would think
the Babylonians to have returned. How much more cruelly were those things
committed by a citizen which in a barbarous enemy<B> [p. 131]</B> were
considered full of savage cruelty and impiety? This dole he gave to the
citizens, with this offering Archelaus committed the beginnings of his royal
power. Caesar and the senate ought to pity the remnants of Judaea, which once
supported by free peoples chose slavery, if only it should be permitted to
endure tolerably under a just king. For a long while a king was away from the
right of governing, since indeed to none among the Jews was the royal power
suitable, unless to him who should be from the begetting of Juda, as the law
asserted. But in truth that Idumaean race, which no origin of royal lineage
touched, had crept into the honor not due them, inasmuch as, Antipater was an
ancestor to them and to Archelaus, outstanding in wealth and strong in other
skills and especially in the friendship of the Romans and proven in war to the
elder Caesar. Since he was able to take over the kingdom for himself, he had
never however aspired to it, moreover he preferred to fend off with others
rather than to provide for himself, and deservedly he was considered as a good
parent, who had delivered Judaea into freedom with his own wounds and had not
led it into servitude. Herod by the testimony of Antonius who had been a
paternal host to him had aspired to the kingdom; from him the condition of the
Jews had been impaired, he had acted as an enemy not as a guide. Since therefore
he has been a seducer itself of the kingdom, in what way could a legitimate king
be created from him? It is not to be deprecated however that they are less under
the kingship, but to demand that beneath the Roman whose favor to themselves had
already been achieved in the Macchabaeans they had afterwards degenerated so
much through the usurpation of the kingdom, that they were much inferior to
those against whom they sought the Roman alliance. Finally themselves to pray 'that Judaea might obtain a guardian judgment from you under the condition that
Syria had, by which a test of our devotion might be given, <B>[p. 132]
</B>whether we who are called seditious and rebellious are able to be submissive
to moderate judges'. Against these things Nicolaus responding in behalf of
Archelaus claimed that a most stormy nation had paid the penalty for arrogance,
lest from this especially Archelaus should be indicted on the grounds of an
inexcusable offense, if through sedition they should disturb the peace and
depart from the Roman alliance in spirit and with arms. About the display of the
testament who should doubt, ' both that the last should customarily be preferred
to those earlier and ought to be seen as much more valid than the rest, in which
last the prerogative of confirming the royal power is reserved to Caesar, by
which respect for the Roman name would be increased rather than diminished, and
also there should not be taken away from kings by you, Caesar, what is allowed
to private citizens, that their testaments are valid, and whom they wish most
strongly to succeed them which they write with their final pen, and by them
again that conferring of honor upon you is preserved, that the confirmation of
the judgment should be sought from you, that he should succeed whom the father
has chosen, you should approve? When therefore was Herod wiser, when he reserved
to you, Caesar, the prerogative, or when he disregarded it? When Antipas is
substituted, Caesar is disregarded, When Archelaus is chosen as successor,
Caesar is approved of, without this support nothing is firm. And so by divine
judgment, when justice was absent, when support has been lacking for either
deceit or goodwill: when however fairness of mind was at hand, support was
sought, that the judgment should be confirmed. Consider therefore whether he
committed an injury who chose you, or if that ought to be rescinded which he
left to be ratified by you as judge, the master of all things, to whom by right
even kings concede power. For he who has investigated whom he should choose for
confirmation, has certainly investigated whom he should choose <B>[p. 133]
</B>for ruling, nor was he able to be mistaken in regard to the successor who
was not mistaken in regard to the confirmer. For he who selected you as the
arbiter certainly recognized that such a successor to himself should be
established that he whom you would establish should not displease you.' The
parties having been heard Caesar deferred his judgment. Then the decision having
been discussed with the senate he placed Archelaus before the people, that he
should perform the duty of a governor not with the status of a kingship. He
promised however that the kingship would be granted, if he bore himself such
that it should be approved. For already attempts of separation of the Israelite
people were being reported . He established two tetrarchs the sons of Herod,
Philippus, and Antipas who had contested with Archelaus for the kingship, he
reserved a legateship for the sister of Herod who had the name Salome, and also
he added other things. Also to the two daughters of Herod he added a thousand
talents, which had been left to himself, having decided that they should be
distributed and even another six hundred thousand and he decreed they should be
shared with the children of Ferora.</P><P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>II.</SPAN>&nbsp;In the meantime a certain young man, pretending to be Alexander and
because of sympathy from those, to whom the task of killing had been given by
Herod the father, others having been substituted in his place himself having
been sent away with his brother Aristobolus, he traveled to Miletus and from
thence to Rome, where it would be more difficult for him among strangers to be
recognized. In which place he easily aroused the Jews most eager for new things,
except that having learned these things Caesar had speedily ordered him to be
brought to him by a certain Celadus who knew Alexander well. Celadus when he saw
the young man, deceived by the similarity was undecided, but perceiving other
information not <B>[p. 134] </B>to harmonize he asked where was Aristobolus. But
he claimed him to remain alive on the island of Cyprus avoiding treachery there
because the brothers joined together would be more easily killed. Thereon taken
to Caesar he immediately revealed immunity having been promised that he relying
on the appearance of similarity had pretended that he was Alexander, that he as
the son of the king had obtained innumerable gifts from the Jews. Caesar laughed
at the trickery, but dismissed him with immunity and those, who had bestowed
gifts (upon him) as the son of the king beyond the manner of a private citizen,
he pronounced to have been sufficiently punished, because with their overflowing
expenditures they had suffered infinite losses. Archelaus however having set out
to Judaea, charged before Caesar because of the indecency of his behaviour and
his arrogance, his case having been examined between the parties, is banished to
Vienna and his wealth joined to the treasury of Caesar. This price he deservedly
paid who had not stifled his lusts for the wife of his half brother. For when
Alexander died handed over to death at the command of his father, Glafyra his
wife, descended from the the king Archelaus of Cappadocia, in what way we
related above, was joined in a second marriage to Iuba the king of Libya. Who
having died she returned to her father. Having gazed upon her there Archelaus,
who by no means considered that the brother of a married man the uncle of sons
should be conscientiously fled from, thus began to love (her) to distraction, so
that he cast out his wife Mariamme and substituted Glafyra in her place. Not
much later, when the woman returned to Judaea, she saw <B>[p. 135] </B>Alexander
in a dream and desired to be embraced. But he similar to one resentful having
fled from the embrace was seen to say: 'This is, Glafyra, the trustworthiness of
a promise? Thus you have guarded my love for you, mindful of which you ought to
be? But be you: as a young woman you had not shunned a second marriage, even a
third, even the brother of your husband? Thus my injury pleased you, that you
did not blush for shame to return to my home married to a third husband? But let
not my affront your contagion remain longer a concern for me, not for long will
the incest of a fraternal marriage be joyful. The woman arose and related the
dream to the household, and herself dead two days later gave credibility, that
marriages of this type are not unpunished by the laws of the living or by the
desires of the dead.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>III.</SPAN>&nbsp;Archelaus himself also saw in dreams nine large full ears of corn
being devoured by oxen, to whom inquiring the interpreter answered nine years to
be indicated by the nine ears, in which great and ample power would be enjoyed.
But in the ninth year of his reign there would be a change for him, because the
oxen, which are accustomed to plow the fields, indicate a change full of
trouble, which would consume and swallow up the previous rewards. When these
things had been learned on the fifth day there came from Caesar (a man) who
should conduct him to Rome for judgment, in which found guilty and driven into
exile he fulfilled his dreams by his death as well. The leadership of the tribe
which belonged to Archelaus was changed into the name of a province by which
term the Romans, when they drove back into their power by conquering, named
regions located at a great distance. There remained however <B>[p. 136] </B>the
tetrarchs Philippus and Herodes, the last who was previously called Antipas with
a changed name. For Salome dying had left the regions which she had held and the
rule over her people to Livia the wife of Caesar. This was the status of Judaea
when Caesar died, leaving Tiberius, his stepson, the son of his wife Livia by
her previous husband, the successor of the Roman empire, in whose honor Herodes
founded Tiberiadis. Philippus also thought a city should be named Livia from the
name of his mother. And because it has been proposed by us to reveal the causes,
by which the people of the Jews defected from the Roman empire and hastened
destruction for themselves, the event indicates that Pilatus the governor of the
province gave the beginning of its ruin, seeing that the first of all he did
hesitate to bring into the Jerusalem temples the images of Caesar. When the
people disturbed by this resisted and he decreed the images had to be received.
he forced very many into death. While these things were going on in Judaea,
Agrippa the son of Aristobolus arrived at Rome desiring to contend in court
before Tiberius against Herodes the tetrarch, but disdained by Tiberius, while
he was spending time in Rome, he associated very many to himself in friendship
and especially Gaius the son of Germanicus, who whether by reason of his
father's name was loved by the people, or from the nearness to the royal family
was considered the closest to the supreme power, or whether by a certain
presentiment he zealously cultivated, which consideration of either age or his
reputation allowed, so that on a certain day raising his hands he prayed, that
Tiberius would die soon and he would see Gaius as emperor. Which having been
revealed by Eutychus his freedman, Agrippa by order of Tiberius is commanded
into chains and tortured in the most severe fashion, <B>[p. 137] </B>he was not
released before Tiberius concluded his life. Whose loathsome times and
retirement to the wantonness of the island of Capri-- the intolerable
idleness--they incited no man however of effective work to his death, from
respect for the recent Roman empire, as I judge, or from terror of the savage
cruelty, because generally the more painful the harshness the safer it
is.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>IV.</SPAN>&nbsp;With him ruling the notorious mockery of Paulina a woman of the most
respectable type was made well known at Rome. Who although she had an excellent
reputation for chastity, was moreover of outstanding beauty and eminent
loveliness, neither tempted nor affected by the appeals of Mundus the leader of
the equestrian forces, from the fault of too much superstition she was open to
error, for instance by the bribed priests of Isis who as if Anubis conveyed
orders to her, which invited her to the temple, himself delighted by her
earnestness and modesty to request a night, he had what he wished to impart to
her in private. Accepting which gladly she reported to her husband, the god was
attentive to her prayers, her presence was demanded by the god, she was not able
to refuse obedience. And so in accordance with her and her husband's decision
she proceeds to the temple of Isis, and witnesses having been removed to a
distance as if about to receive knowledge of the sacred mystery she arranged
herself on her couch, thinking that her god would come to her in her dreams and
show himself to her in a vision. However when something of the night had passed,
by which a woman full of sleep might be more easily deceived, Mundus the mask
and dress of Anubis having been assumed comes to her, he removes his garments,
rushes into kisses. He says to the awakened woman that he is Anubis, he holds
forth the mask of Anubis. She believes him the god, she asserts herself happy
because the lord her god deemed her worthy to visit. <B>[p. 138] </B>She does
not refuse the embrace of him seeking it, she puts the question however whether
a god was able to unite to a human. He offered the examples that Alcmena had
accepted Jupiter the greatest of the gods and that Leda had been gained in the
sexual embrace of the same, and many others, who gave birth to gods. He
persuades the woman about himself and also that a god would be borne by her,
that they should mingle in intercourse. She returns to her husband quite happy,
saying that she a woman had had intercourse with a god and according to his
promise she would give birth to a god. The joy of the husband in the illicit
intercourse of his wife is great. Afterwards Mundus met the woman and said: "You
have been blessed, Paulina, by the embrace of a god, the great god Anubis, whose
mysteries you accepted. But learn that you just like to gods have not denied to
men, to whom they bestow what you would refuse, because they refused not to give
your charms to us nor names. Behold the god Anubis called Mundus also to his
sacred rites so that he should be united to you. What did your stubborness
profit you, except that it deprived you of the twenty thousands which I had
offered as payment. I mimicked the kind gods, who give us without price what
cannot be obtained from you at great price. But if human names give offense to
you, it pleases me to be called Anubis and the influence of his name supported
the performance." Stricken by this speech the woman understood she had been made
sport of and grieving the injury to her modesty she declared the trickery to her
husband. He having nothing which he should hold against his wife, to whom he had
himself allowed the opportunity of sleeping in the temple, and conscious of her
conjugal chastity took the grievance to the leader. Who provoked by the abuse of
a powerful man and the fabrication of this heinous crime seized the priests from
the temple, subjects them to questioning, <B>[p. 139] </B>puts them to death
when they confessed, and sinks the statue of Isis in the Tiber. The opportunity
of fleeing was granted to Mundus, for the reason that overcome by the force of
love and the grace of beauty it was judged that he should punished by a lighter
penalty for his offenses. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>V.</SPAN>&nbsp;This wantonness therefore which occurred with Tiberius reigning I
thought ought not to be passed over, so that from it the impropriety of the
emperor might be assessed. For indeed the life of uprightness of a good leader
is a certain rule and pattern of living for all, so the filth of an emperor is a
law for scoundrels. Pilatus was sent by him into Judaea, a wicked man and putting falsehoods in unimportant matters, he encircled the Samaritans as
they were going to the mountain which has the name Gadir--for it was sacred to
them--for the reason that he wished to learn their mysteries. And going up he
outstripped the people with cavalry and infantry, he spread abroad with a
contrived charge, that they had prepared to withdraw from the Romans and were
seeking a place of assembly for themselves. What indeed did he not dare, who had
put even Christ the lord on the cross, coming for the salvation of the human
race, pouring forth upon men with many and divine works the grace of his mercy
and teaching nothing other, unless that he should make peoples obedient first to
god, and then to emperors? A raving man who was the servant of the madness of
sacrilege, and who killed the author of salvation. And so through him the the
state of the Jews as destroyed, through him there was ruin for the nation and a
hastened destruction for the temple. For if Herodes, who handed over Johannes to
be killed, paid the price for his treachery and cruelty (by being) thrown out
from the royal power and given into exile, by how much more headlong fury is the
action to be understood given (against) him who killed Christ? What was the
cause of death for Johannes I shall set forth briefly. Philippus and Herodes
<B>[p. 140] </B>who was previously called Antipas we showed above to have been
brothers; the wife of Philippus (had been) Herodias whom Herodes unlawfully and
wickedly associated to himself by right of marriage. Johannes did not tolerate
this and said to him: "it is not lawful for you to have the wife of your
brother." Then the former provoked threw Johannes into prison. And not much
later he killed the just man and immovable executor of divine law. For not only
as a preacher of the gospel had he blamed the incest of the brother's marriage
bed, but even as an executor of the law he censured the transgressor of the law
who had taken by force the wife of a living brother, especially having seed of
him. Aroused by this the hatred and retribution of almost all Jews was hastened
against Herodes. The supporter of whom Herodias, seeing Agrippa to have had much
influence with Caesar, drove him to go to Rome, where he should win over the
favor of the emperor to himself, putting before him the affront of idleness,
because shunning work, while he stayed at home, he allowed indignities to be
brought forward against himself. For since from being a private citizen Agrippa
had been made a king, how much more therefore should Caesar not hesitate that he
should confer a kingdom upon him who had already long been a tetrarch. And so by
no means sustaining the reproaches of his wife, he proceeded to Rome, while he
was seeking the friendship of Gaius, impugned by Agrippa he lost even the
tetrarchy, which he had received from Julius Augustus, and going into exile in
Spain together with his wife Herodias he died from grief of mind. Tiberius
having died also Gaius succeeded, who, <B>[p. 141]</B> wishing himself as the
ruler both to be seen as and to be called a god, gave causes to the Jews of a
very serious rebellion, and lest he should destroy the empire with a quick end,
made a quicker end of the nation of the Jews. For not only did he not call his
men back from illegal acts, but he even threatened those sent into Judaea with the
ultimate punishment, unless they accomplished with their arms everything against
justice and the dictates of religion. Agrippa was very powerful in his state,
but while he wished to encircle Jerusalem with a great wall, so that it would
become impregnable to the Romans---for he foresaw its imminent
destruction---prevented by death he left the task unfinished. Nor did he
exercise less power while Claudius was ruling, because he was also in the midst
of his own beginnings, since with Gaius having been killed he had been thrust by
the soldiers into the rule of the empire, the senate resisting him from
weariness of the royal power, he sent Agrippa as his deputy, with whom as
negotiator the promise of moderation having been given, an accommodation having
been begun, a peace is agreed upon. In place of Agrippa the father Agrippa his
son is substituted as king by Claudius Caesar. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C6"></A>VI.</SPAN>&nbsp;Claudius himself also, three and ten years having passed, died, he
gave Nero to the Roman empire as its ruler having been captured by the
persuasions of his wife Agrippina, who was so powerful through trickeries, that
she rendered Britannicus the son of the emperor designated as the successor by
the law of nature without share in the rule. Whose art soon displeased her,
because as long as born from her he was deferent, she denied him the leadership,
unaware that exalted by his supreme power he did not acknowledge his mother and
would pervert the reward of (her) assistance into her destruction. Likewise
however he held Octavia the daughter of Claudius in marriage, the son-in-law was
preferred to the son in topsy-turvy order, the mischiefs of the state
preponderated, to which is owed the parricide, the sacrilegious man, the
incestuous man, so that in him crimes, not any <B>[p. 142] </B>merits of good
conduct, ruled. Under such an emperor, whether from consideration of his morals
or scorn of his indolence or because he was preparing a final destruction for
the Jews the protection of the supreme god having been withdrawn because of
their severe sacrilege, there broke out into great riots, brigandage, conflicts
because of their haughtiness, whom for twenty years Eleazarus the leader of the
robbers oppressively plundered, finally however captured by Felix, who was in
charge of Judaea, and sent to Rome he suffered severe punishment. Not thus even
were the people disheartened by the number killed of those inhabiting Judaea,
but in Jerusalem itself another kind of brigands sprang forth, who were called
dagger-men <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>. Not indeed hidden in secret, nor in
nocturnal darkness lying in ambush for those going about without any guard, but
in the light of day and in the middle of the city and a crowd of people, they
strike whomsoever they had approached closely, carrying short swords in their
hands, mingling in a crowd of people, where they pierce someone adhering close,
the unsuspecting victim falls with a hidden wound, and death prevents an outcry.
The corpse is in view but the assassin escaped notice, and if anyone had been
alarmed by another's wound, happening closer to himself, he was a part of those
struck down. Thus from the fear of the danger or the dissembling of the crime
the assassin is not caught. So great was the speed of the ambushers and the
skill of concealing themselves. The priest Ionathes is killed, many were added
daily, the fear of the living was greater than the calamity of those killed. As
if to a battle, each one came forth daily, the situation was worse however,
because an enemy is foreseen, an assassin was hidden. Death before the eyes,
fear in the mind. No one believed that he would return, nor was trust bestowed
upon friends while the assassin was feared. By which the majority were
terrified, indeed those innocent <B>[p. 143] </B>of the crime of brigandage or
the companionship of assassins, although unhurt by the band, the less resolute
purposely repaired to the desert. But while they are taking counsel with
themselves, they aroused fear of a separation, from which at first a suspicion
of war against the Romans, then a hatred blazed up. Alarmed by this the governor
of the province, cavalry and a foot column having been sent, engendered a
slaughter. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C7"></A>VII.</SPAN>&nbsp;Also an Egyptian false prophet instructed in the magic arts arrived,
he boasted himself with the prophetic spirit to pronounce heavenly prophecies;
he joined almost thirty thousand Jews to himself and assembling them at Mount
Olive he invaded Jerusalem with frequent assaults, so that even he accused the
Roman guards, who spread tshemselves before Jerusalem lest anything should be
provoked by the people. When indeed this arrogance was suppressed, just as in a
sick body another part was gravely inflamed. For many openly cried out that they
should separate from the Romans, that liberty should be preferred to servitude
and the food which was lacking to those who had gone out into the fields was
sought by force. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C8"></A>VIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;Finally in the city Caesarea a serious riot broke out between the
Jews and gentiles, the Jews claiming to themselves possession of the entire city
as founded by the Jew Herod, the gentiles resisting that the founder was indeed
a Jew, but he had made it known with the name of Caesar, and in fact had
constructed temples within it and had set up statues and from that it was to be
seen that it had been transferred more to the use of gentiles. The strife of
these controversies turned into bands, because the leaders of the Jews were not
able to restrain their people who were dedicated to rebellion and regarded the
gentiles with taunts, if they thought it should be conceded to them by the Jews.
And so they aroused Felix, so that while he wished passionately <B>[p. 144]
</B>to restrain the mob of each party that was not quieting down, he decided
upon arms when he was unable otherwise. To whom Festus succeeded, who very many
brigands having been seized gave the by no means small number to the ultimate
destruction. Albinus also the same power having been entrusted to him by the
Romans let pass no type of wickedness, a flagrant of plunder, so that he who did
not give money was dragged off in chains although blameless, he who gave even
though guilty was set free. Avarice give birth to arrogance, so that he
presented himself a tyrant to the poor, their agent to the rich. Likewise
however as he went past the wickedness of his predecessors, so by his successor
Florus as it were lazy and sluggish in shameful acts but passed by and left
behind last in a long interval, so that in comparison with those worse, he was
considered honest. And those who at first had complained as having been ruined,
afterwards longed for Festus as a good judge. For he stripped individuals,
Florus laid waste to cities, the most polluted in indecencies, the cruelest in
barbarity, disquieting everything with arms and sowing battles from battles, who
implored did not pardon and glutted did not spare. In the sight of Beronice, who
the sister of Agrippa the king had come to the temple for the sake of religion,
he raged against the people with the harshest slaughter, having judged that it
should not be granted to one praying, although he saw him paying attention to
his religion, standing with bare feet, and he considered him with contempt who
was praying. From this to Agrippa the king both she herself wrote and the people
of the Jews directed a prayer beseeching help for liberty. To whom returning
from Egypt very many ran to meet on the road more than sixty stadia from the
city of Jerusalem and led about through the city while they proved the justness
of their complaints, they began to insist that he should send ambassadors to
Nero. In truth he felt the pain of the citizens <B>[p. 145] </B>seeing however
that the attempts of war against the Romans should be moved with profound
prudence, lest hatred for himself and a very great danger to the people should
be brought forth, to the people collected together, in that place, which next to
the temple and separated by a bridge was called Xystus, he delivered a speech of
this type.</P><P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C9"></A>IX.</SPAN>&nbsp;"Although in the majority thoughtless of taking counsel and impatient
of moderation resentment may make some to seethe with angry complaints, however
when counsel is taken, the effect of resentment is given up, for if I had
learned that everyone out of this people so prompt at avenging injuries and at
waging war against the Roman empire not to prefer the opinion of the better and
quieter party which is for peace and which prefers calm, I would not have dared
to come before you, nor to give advice. For it is useless to persuade what has
to be done, when the assent of the hearers is for the worst. Because of the
experience untried by some of the misfortunes of war, by others careless hopes
of freedom, very sweet to aspire to but irrational for achieving, ---indeed
while freedom is being sought servitude is enhanced, and often is taken away
completely from many, to whom the name of freedom had remained, ---newness of
things may excite others whom his supporters displease by present worthlessness,
and if business is thrown into confusion it is considered a benefit, for that
reason I considered that a consultation should be undertaken with you, lest
either the sobriety of the more prudent be snatched away by the daring of the
more arrogant, or so that those who do not know to be wise at least warned by
our talk may recognize that there must be reconciliation with the more
experienced. I recommend therefore that silence be offered, so that we may
disclose those things which we think to be of advantage to you, <B>[p. 146]
</B>and let no one of you be disturbed, if he hears something contrary to his
own opinion. For no one will be able to judge how what is said may be, unless he
shall have first heard it, whose approval or disapproval, since he himself is
about to be the judge, disturbs to no purpose if he does not listen. It is
permitted after deliberation to each one to think what he thinks and, if
separation pleases him, even warned after sober considerations, to keep the
opinion of his ill-advised desire. But someone says: why should I wish to be
heard to no purpose, if they do not acquiesce who listen? Because if they do not
wish to assent when they shall have heard, a part of the assembly will be in
conflict with me, not the entire people; if however they are unwilling to
listen, even when a part of the audience raises a disturbance, the profit of
listening is taken away from all the people. And so my talk will die away among
those who may have wished to hear it, if silence is not granted to me by even
some part. For all the talk is cut off, as if it had all fallen away, as if it
is deprived of life by the impediment of the tumultuous racket and the noise of
the assembly. There are two things therefore to which I think response should be
given first, which are in the great mass of the complaints, that very many are
crying out about the injuries of the procurators and that many lament freedom
for themselves to have been destroyed. The joining of which propositions it
seems to me ought to be separated. For if the procurators are bad, what is
necessary to achieve freedom? You should not be seen to impugn the procurators
as agents of despotism not from their merits but from loathing of servitude. And
if servitude is intolerable, then complaints about the procurators are
superfluous. For if there is moderation in them, none the less servitude is
shameful. Let us consider therefore whether in either of them there is not
slight basis for wars. <B>[p. 147] </B>What however is more foolish than to
complain about injuries and to attach a war and to change insults to dangers,
while you run away from the judge, you bring on the enemy, while an unjust judge
is generally an interpreter of the law, is an enemy however even always just a
seeker after safety? It is fitting that a judge control himself and not be
irritated, to beware an enemy, that you not aggravate another, that you not
summon another, he becomes gentler with blandishments and such ought to be
avoided lest he is able to do harm. Care must be taken with judges lest there be
a quarrel greater than the injury and the dislike of the objection more serious
than the reward of the perpetrator. For often those who at first more modestly
commit offense, having been blamed are more immoderate, and who before stole
secretly afterwards engage in brigandage openly. Nothing accordingly so
irritates the fury of a wound than the incapacity to bear it. Finally in the
fierce countrymen themselves the tightest of bonds, if they stir themselves up,
are pressed in, if they should keep calm, they are loosened, the painful force
of attacks of fever is lessened by tolerating it, it is increased by
disturbances. But if they know country things to have regard for themselves so
that they are forgetful of nature, by which they lessen pain, how much more so
in men frequent experience has taught that of those who have been wounded
tolerance for those wounding has been a disgrace, that without an accuser they
have set right what they had not corrected by an accusation! But let it be, the
arrogance of the Roman judges has been intolerable, what therefore is more
tolerable, that everyone or one suffer? What moreover is the justice, when one
has done the injury, to carry a war to all? Now are all the Romans the
originators of the injury? Is Caesar himself? Or is the carefully chosen one
dishonest who was sent to you? But they are not able to see across the seas and
the eyes to stretch to the east from the west that they may see there what
things are being done here, <B>[p. 148] </B>nor to hear easily, what, although
solicitude should examine it, the great distance prevents by the difficulty of
inspections. Will the fault of one therefore give birth to a separation from the
Roman empire, when even without your complaints there may be a speedy correction
with no ill will of an accusation, no hardship of a journey? With annual changes
the Roman magistrates are moved, from which it happens that an arrogant one does
not remain long and a more moderate one quickly succeeds. Nothing therefore will
hurt anyone, since a remedy is bestowed even upon those who are keeping calm. To
weave reasons for war is pernicious, since the condition of war is harsh against
all, against the Romans it is a last resort. Whom if you wish to flee since you
are not able to conquer, the world must be abandoned by you. But you allege the
desire for freedom. That consideration of yours is too late. Before it had to be
fought so that you would not lose your freedom, you demanded it back as if
already lost. The experience of slavery is harsh, and therefore it ought not to
have been submitted to from the beginning or having been accepted it ought to be
borne with equanimity. It behooved to have resisted at that time, when you were
called into slavery. That would have been a just fight. He however who has once
given himself into slavery, although afterwards he may wish to withdraw, he is
not considered as a lover of liberty, but is adjudged to be a defiant slave.
Where was that defense of liberty when Pompeius was advancing upon your country,
when he entered the city as your master? Where were the weapons for liberty? Why
were they laid down by your fathers? And certainly they were braver than you.
They were strong in mind, they had abundant forces, they desired to fight back,
but they could not hold back even a small part of the Roman army. They were
conquered but spared. They acknowledged the yoke of servitude, they did not bear
the penalty of captivity. Why do you their heirs refuse what you owe by the law
of succession? The actions of your fathers bind you. How do you refuse
submission <B>[p. 149] </B>who are so much inferior to those who were
submissive? And what will be left you when you arouse Caesar and all the Roman
power against you? How can you resist them, who have triumphed in all things and
are now helped by all who were fighting against them? And the Athenians even who
surrendered their country to destruction for the freedom of all Greece, changing
their homes for exile lest Xerxes should rule over them, who sailed across the
land, marched across the waters, whom neither the seas stopped nor the land held
back, the passage of his march included the space of all Europe, the boundaries
of the earth narrower than the travels of his army, they so pursued him fleeing,
that fleeing with scarcely one ship and lacking assistance, he took himself away
from captivity. Truly these very men, who subdued all Asia because of little
Salamis and gloriously put Xerxes to flight who ruled the waves and subjugated
the seas in that he thought them subject to him, they now are subservient to the
Romans, and the leaders of all Greece are now submissive to the commands of the
Italians, and that Athens, which gave laws to others, now is a slave to foreign
laws. The Lacedaemonians also after the triumphs of Thermopylae and of dead
Leonidas, after Agesilaus the savior of Asia now love their masters. Macedonia
and Africa, which through two very strong leaders had poured out the rule and
control of the entire world into their authority, the power having been taken
from them are not resentful and content with such a great change of fortune they
desire the well-disposed whom they sought for slavery. Neither by the riches of
Philippus nor the triumphs of Alexander <B>[p. 150] </B>are the Macedonians
excited, which two leaders they consider not unmerited the most prudent of all,
because one held himself inside Greece, the other fleeing the Roman arms arrived
a conqueror all the way to the Caspian kingdoms and the limits of the Persian
conquests and the remote regions of the Indians. He obtained the name of the
Great, because he did not challenge the greatest of all. Whom an untimely death
took away from the triumph of the Romans, it served however in his descendants
by whom the plunder of the east was sought not for the support of domination but
as the reward of slavery, so that the highest of the slaves might reach to the
wealth of the victor. The great worth in Alexander: what was so wonderful? He
extended his conquests to the ocean, the Romans beyond the ocean. The witness is
Britain located outside the world but brought into the world by the valor of the
Romans. They are slaves who indeed themselves did not know what slavery was
having been born only for themselves and always free for themselves, who
separated from the power of the strongest by an intervening ocean were not able
to fear those whom they did not know. And so it was greater to have crossed to
the Britons that to have triumphed over the Britons. What should be done by
those elements already subject to Roman rule. The ocean taught them submission
to slavery after it itself had acknowledged to itself unaccustomed servitude to
the ships of the Romans and those crossing it. What shall I say about Hannibal?
Who was the victor over so many countries and waged war on the Romans, to whose
triumphs he opened the Alps, he laid out a path, he subjugated cities which were
acquired by the victors. And although frequently victorious he never however had
cut off hope to the beaten, and once beaten himself he was not able to recover.
He fell back voluntarily to the victories, which as victor he did not keep up,
and his arms having been abandoned to the victors <B>[p. 151] </B>he took
himself to king Prusia, a hired soldier who had been a leader, a fugitive who
had been a conqueror. A kindness to the inhabitants of Gaul a people wild by
nature and wilder from the natural walls, whom not the cement of walls but the
peaks of the Alps protect on the east, the ocean shuts in on the west, the
ruggedness of the Pyrenees on the south, on the north the flowing of the Rhine
and vast Germany were thought make them insuperable and inaccessible by the
benefit of the barriers. To the Romans however traveling above the clouds and
extending their rule beyond the Pillars of Hercules nothing was impassable: with
great facility of the enemy both those who hid were discovered and those who
resisted were conquered. From whose unexpected arrival Germany believed that the
mountains had sunk down, the Rhine had dried up: more powerful than the rest
from the size of their bodies and their contempt of death they previously
thought their Rhine a shield, now a guardian of their safety. And so now it is
filled not with the boats of the Germans but the warships of the Romans, which
going over all the waters of the two-horned river to the sea press the at one
time free tribes into slavery, so that those who had previously taken for
granted their rule over the entire world, now have paid the price of their own
slavery. What profited the Illyrians the gold dug out from the veins of their
lands, to whom it was not sufficient for the fight for freedom? How much more
valuable was the Roman iron, whom does the gold of the Pannonians serve? And so
Pannonius gives a tribute of gold and willingly transfers its wealth to the
Roman treasury, that it may be safer in its servitude. <B>[p. 152] </B>Nor did
the wild wave turbid with the gold of the Pactolus <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2 </SUP></A>raise its inhabitant into haughtiness: it was a willing slave to those
to whom it saw the states to be a slave. Nor does the Indian marvel at his jewel
or the Chinese his wool: they cultivate them for the use of their masters, not
the rewards of trade but the duties of performance. We hear of the proud states
of the Persians but we see their hostages also, and although they may rule many
nations, however they offer their children and they rejoice their nobility to
serve the Romans as a pledge of peace, at the same time they learn by serving to
rule themselves. They offer clothing, necklaces, elephants also. The kings
impose one tax to the Romans. We add Egypt overflowing with its wealth and not
lacking heavenly rain, which itself generates showers for itself and creates the
abundance of showers. Finally although it is hotter than all regions, it alone
does not complain of drought, and what occurs for no other place, it nourishes
its crops by irrigation, it sails in the sands, it sails through the crops where
rain is not known. Whose however extraordinary return and natural fruitfulness
serves the Romans so that it feeds the masters during four months. What shall I
say of that city named after the most powerful king? Which surrounded by the
wall of a river does not know a blockade, for which the greatest of all rivers
in a bowl spread out through a space of the land keeps at a distance the
hindrance of a blockade and by bringing in those things which are necessary for
use furnishes the remedy. What would have been more advantageous for rebelling
than for Egypt to be incited? Which numbers ten times seven hundred fifty
thousand men beyond the inhabitants of Alexandria subject to Roman rule. And
although it has such a great multitude, it prefers however to conduct itself
with the taxes of the Roman empire rather <B>[p. 153]</B> than to make war with
its own military service. I shall not pass over the Cyrenensians a race of the
Lacedaemonians who at one time fought with the Carthaginians about their
territories and rule, offering death as an end of the contest, defeated by which
offering but nevertheless having avenged the injury they conceded victory to the
Phileni brothers. Nor shall I pass by the Syrtes <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> frightful even just to hear about which draw all to themselves and cling to all
approaching in the shallow sea. Those experienced in things assert a third part
of the entire world from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pillars of Hercules to the
Red Sea and Ethiopia to be marked off. Who would count the people of so many
races, protected by which Carthage did not withstand the right wing of Scipio
and preferred to feed Rome against itself during two parts of the year rather
than relying upon the help of others to rebel against the Romans? Crete also
with one hundred noble cities, preferring rich kingdoms, surrounded on all sides
by the sea, accustomed to repel an enemy by the waves just as if by mountains,
fears one consul, and very many people bow down from fear of the six rods of the
fasces; Asia, the Pontus, Eniochians, the Scythian nomads, the Tauroscythians,
the Moetian kingdoms, and all the Bosphorians are made subject to the Roman
empire, and that before fifty ships reduced the unnavigable sea to peace. On the
other hand what shall I say about Armenia which not<B> [p. 154] </B>only
preserves the quiet of its borders, but truly even intent on the guardianship of
the Gates carefully searches out lest anybody about to disturb the peace should
creep in? All are therefore eager to serve the Romans, you alone refuse to be
submissive to them, to whom all are made subject? relying on what arms, proud
with what army? Where is the fleet of your ships, which might blockade the
straits, run through the seas of the Romans? For against their name the elements
have crossed, against which the world has crossed, which is shut off and bounded
by the Roman empire, finally it is called by most a Roman world. For if we seek
the truth, as we said above, the earth itself is within the Roman empire, having
progressed beyond which the Roman valor has sought another world for itself
beyond the ocean and in Britain has found a new possession for itself removed
from the confines of the world. Finally they to whom the law not only of the
Roman state but even almost of human activity itself is denied, are directed
there, and they live there as if exiles from the world. The ocean has submitted
to its boundaries, the Roman knows how to seek out its remote secrets. With
ourselves there will be war against whom not even nature has its rights. The
Euphrates inaccessible before unless to its inhabitants on both banks is Roman
and shows the entire east to be under the Roman empire. Hister in the northern
regions flowing among innumerable and savage tribes has receives hostages, it
restrains enemies. The southern region as far as it is able to be habitable
cultivates for the Romans and collects its harvest for them. In the west at one
time the farthest of the lands Gaditana beaches received new visitors who carry
their tribute to the Roman empire, it has its own resources with which it
directs its commerce. Where previously it valued only piracy, there now it
carries on commerce. Since therefore all places belong to the Romans, from where
for yourselves against <B>[p. 155] </B>the Romans will you seek help? From what
uninhabitable region will you seek allies? For whoever are in the world are
Romans all. Will you direct an embassy beyond the Euphrates to the Adiabenians?
Nor is it free to them to abandon their concerns nor does the Parthian allow the
peace sought for him to be granted lest himself in the neighbors be guilty of
rebellion. You should not think this war like as if they are battles waged by
you against Arabs and Egyptians. Roman weapons are different, and there are
other resources sought out from the entire world. Nor should you be deluded by
the protections for Jerusalem its walls: they have broken down the the stronger
wall of the ocean. But do you anticipate about assistance from religion when the
disciples of Jesus have already filled the Roman world? Or without the nod of
god do we think that religion to grow and the city of Rome to extend its rule
over all regions? Truly our religion long ago forsook us, because we abandoned
the faith and in great numbers sought things prohibited by heavenly edicts. From
where did the Egyptian come against us? How were we made captives of the
Assyrians? Did not scripture say these things would happen? Was it not written
that all the sacraments of the temple would be profaned? Those things already
too frequently profaned are displaying their strength and all the influence of
their mysteries. The temple has been contaminated with human blood, the couches
have been filled with bodies, the altars covered with gore. Battles have been
fought on the sabbath, transgression has occurred while the temple is defended
not by its usage and the solemnity of its festivals but by bloody battle. And
this certainly can be said again. Therefore how can we deserve divine aid as if
against enemies opposed to religion, when we ourselves <B>[p. 156] </B>are
inflicting violations upon our religion? What therefore is the remedy, when
human resources do not lend support, nor does divine grace bring aid? For some
to call upon the second of these for war is the custom, for you each is not
available. What therefore remains except certain destruction? But if you do not
turn aside while it is possible to beware, nothing else except that you
yourselves will burn up your country and will burn up the temple, and you will
give your wives and children also to death. To whom you will be the originators
of the greatest loss, since the inconsolable development of all these evils will
be ascribed to our blame which we are supporting. It adds to this that the wars
of other cities have ended with the destructions of their inhabitants, your
rebellion will be the destruction of the entire religion, which having diffused
over the entire world has spread its peoples everywhere, and in all cities there
is a part of us. Therefore in your battle all Jews will be implicated, nor will
there be any region free from our blood. And if the Romans are such, that they
do not take vengeance on the Jews and are not provoked by the war, how unjust is
it to make war on those whose kindness you hope for? It is well, dearest ones,
it is well, while the ship is still in port, to foresee the future storm, and
that anyone not throw himself into threatening dangers, lest, when you have
proceeded into the deep, already your are not able to avoid the shipwreck. And
frequently certainly a sudden storm arises, and war follows, even though it is
not inflicted; but it is better to attack an enemy that to ward him off. Not
provoked he spares more, and necessity excuses insolence, when truly anyone
plunges himself into abrupt danger, he is burdened with disgrace. He is not an
enemy whom you are able to avoid by flight. Wherever you will go, danger
follows, indeed you will surely find it. For all <B>[p. 157] </B>are friends of
the Romans, and whoever is outside the friendship of the Romans is an enemy of
everyone. May love of your country move you. If consideration of your hostages,
of your wives does not call you back, let contemplation of the most sacred
temple recall you, spare at least our religion, spare the consecrated priests,
whom the Romans will not spare nor the temple itself, who regret that they
spared them, inasmuch as for a long time all the nations wish to destroy our
religion, Pompeius however spared it although he could have destroyed it. I have
omitted nothing, I have warned of everything which pertains to our safety. I
recommend to you what I choose for myself, you consider closely what is
advantageous for yourselves. I wish for there to be peace with the Romans for
you and me. If you reject it, you yourselves take away my association. Either
there will be common good fortune, or peril without me." Saying this he wept,
Beronice his sister also, for she herself was in the heights of Xystus. And
Agrippa had influenced them greatly with his tears, so that the Jews say: 'It is
not the Romans we rebel against but Florus who has committed acts deserving of
war and whom we consider to be waging war.' Agrippa answered: 'But this is to
make war against the Romans, your acts seek injury of the Romans. Not to Florus
but to the Romans, tribute is being denied not to Florus but to Caesar, the
troops not of Florus but of the Romans are in the fort, which is called Antonia,
from which the colonnades having been pulled down and broken up you have
separated the temple so that the guard may be isolated. Restore the previous
situation. Let the tribute which is owed to Caesar be paid to Caesar, lest
Florus should report this, not himself but the rule of Caesar to have been
rejected by you.' The people had assented to his words, so that when Agrippa
<B>[p. 158] </B>had ascended into the temple, they begin to build the colonnade
as is was, they collect the tribute. Indeed within a short time diligent agents
having been sent out for the duty of this type the forty talents were collected,
which were lacking for the payment of the tribute. All the uproar of war had
been suppressed, but Agrippa wishing to join to this, that they should be
submissive to Florus, until a successor to him should come from Caesar, so
irritated the common people, that they indeed did not refrain from abuse of him,
but thrust out from the city it is uncertain whether some people stones having
been thrown may have struck him. Provoked by which offense the king seized their
leaders and sent them to Florus. Moreover he departed into his kingdom.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C10"></A>X.</SPAN>&nbsp;With him departing the instigators of war ambushes having been
arranged captured Masada a fortress the guards of the Romans having been killed
they stationed their own men. Eleazarus the son of the foremost of the priests a
man of reckless boldness, persuaded that an offering or sacrifice of a foreigner
should not be accepted, which was a trumpet call of war against the Romans and
aroused everyone into an uproar. And so those who were most prominent seeing
that this thing would be the cause of an abrupt withdrawal, stressed upon the
people that not only war against Caesar would be invited but even the
institution of religion would be violated and reverence for the temple would be
diminished, the traditions of the fathers would be complained of and condemned,
who from the offerings of foreigners decorated the temple, to which much more of
wealth accrued from the contribution of nations and the gifts of separate and
innumerable peoples, the sacred things of our ancestors would be forgotten, the
sacred rites would be changed. What will happen with those things which have
been previously collected, if in a similar manner offerings of the nations
should be prohibited to be collected in the future? Or if that should be
forbidden to the Romans alone which is permitted to all others, which would be
an incentive of war? Finally <B>[p. 159]</B> it would be wicked, if among the
Jews only it was not permitted to foreigners to sacrifice or to make offerings.
It was necessary for them to consider that the peace of Caesar would be broken,
who provoked by an offense of this nature without doubt it would come about that
he would take from the Jews every practice of sacrifices; that they should not
sacrifice for themselves who rejected the sacrifice of Caesar, this must be
prevented in time; for if such plans should come to Florus and without doubt
from there to Caesar, they would make destruction to the nation of the Jews. At
the same time wishing to build on this by the testimony of the priests they
asked if an offering of gentiles had ever been rejected by our ancestors. That
this should be less allowed, prepared for riot they made a great noise, not even
the attendants dared to insert themselves into such a great controversy of those
quarrelling. One remedy was seen to remain, that Florus and Agrippa the king
should arrive with a troop of soldiers, so they at least should desist from fear
who by no means were recalled from their plan. But Florus, who wished the strife
to be increased lest there be any reason for pardon to the Jews, from whom if
they were involved with war every opportunity would be extinguished of pressing
upon his brigandage and serious crimes, he allowed the madness of war to come
forth, he gave nothing of a response to the ambassadors. Agrippa, whom the
embassy of his relatives Cylus and Antipas and Costobarus especially canvassed,
for the common good, so that he should save the Jews for the Romans and their
religion for the Jews, the temple for the country, the city for the citizens and
the glory of rule for himself, tranquillity for the kingdom, sent three thousand
horsemen, Darius and Philippus the leaders of the troops, that relying upon the
help of the honest men should support the counsellors of the factions. From this
cause confidence arose for the honest men, anger for the disloyal; <B>[p. 160]
</B>combat became established, when the juster cause, which however being
nothing of weaponry does not aid the conflicts, inflamed the former, fury and
the number of their multitude inflamed the latter. There were scattered lines of
combatants. The foremost of the priests and that part of the common people,
which wished for peace, with the royal cavalry seized the higher part of the
city, the others situated in the lower part claimed for themselves the temple
and the neighboring sacred places. At first they provoke the fight on both sides
with stones and rocks and the hurling of missiles, they decide it with arrows,
afterwards hand to hand fighting when the necessity of fighting presented
itself. From skill and experience the royal troops prevail wishing to keep the
arousers of the war away from entry lest they should contaminate the temple. On
the other side it was the desire of Eleazarus to take possession with his men of
the higher part of the city which was called Sion. It was fought for seven days
without any intermission. The eighth was the day of a festival, on which all
were accustomed to bring in wood for the altars, lest at some time the fire
should die out, which it was necessary to maintain inextinguishable, it added
fury that all the attendants were shut out from the temple. The king's men
yielded to the sicarii who were rushing in more daringly than usual nor did they
dare to make a stand in the higher parts. The shrines of Agrippa and Beronice
were burned, every royal instrument was plundered. The fire was spread about, so
that even the hand written documents of debtors which were put away in the
public records office were burned, so that those without resources rose up
insolently against their lenders. Thinking themselves freed from every
obligation they burned the city with their own hands. The sinews of the city
were burned, the fort was stormed which has the name Antonia, all the guards
discovered were killed, it was afterwards burned. Bursting into Masada also
Manaemus the son of Judas the Galilaean, <B>[p. 161] </B>experienced in
sophistical art and confusing situations, takes possession of the weapons armory
and furnishes unarmed men with weapons. Going back into Jerusalem just as if in
the royal manner with accompanying attendants he had become haughty to such a
great extent that surpassing the practice of a private citizen not even from the
unlawful, which free people were not able to bear, it was thought that he must
be restrained. Many people rising up against him who upbraided him as a tyrant
propped up by the royal garments and a lord lying upon the freedom of the
citizens, he paid a heavy penalty as first overthrown he died from tortures. Not
however was the conflict removed, for a much more serious disturbance rose up.
At the end Metilius with the Roman soldiers pleaded that it should be permitted
to them to depart, a pledge having been given and sacraments offered, when
according to the agreement they had put down their weapons, they should depart
without fear, by Eleazarus and the allies of his faction they were cut down
unavenged, having decided that resistance should not be made against the
violence nor beseeching, but only crying out the broken pledge and the perjury
of the deceitful. And so all having been killed, Metilius himself the commander
by asking and imploring, at the same time promising that he would become a Jew
all the way also to circumcision alone is spared. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C11"></A>XI.</SPAN>&nbsp;All Judaea was on fire, the entire province of Syria also was aroused
to war. Finally the Caesarians killed whatever Jews they held, aroused by which
anguish the Jews having attacked many cities of Syria revolted. There was
nowhere law, nowhere respect for religion, he was more respected who had
plundered more amassing the rewards of bravery. It was a wretched spectacle,
when unburied bodies lay everywhere in the cities, old men mixed with boys,
women also nor on account of modesty of observers were any protections left
behind with which the pudenda might be covered; all places were disgusting and
full of <B>[p. 162] </B>miserable sights. Which although the painful and
abominable cruelties had exceeded foul horror, threatened even still worse
things to them in turn. There was brutal villainy between the Jews and the
Syrians, since there was no hope of safety unless they should mutually stop
themselves. Indeed what of the city, which had Jews and Syrians mixed together?
The days were passed in blood, the nights in terror, neither to hatred nor to
rapacity was there any limit. For beyond the difference of parties and culture
which had broken out into a public evil, inordinate desire of having and
pillaging had eagerly taken possession of the mind, so that they considered that
no one whom from desire for booty they had assigned to death should be spared.
What may I say about the small number of the murdered? For besides the
Antiochians and Sidonians and Apamenians it is difficult to find any people who
did not persecute the Jews dwelling with them. On the other hand the Gerasenians
followed those wishing to depart all the way to their own boundaries so that
they might go away without any treachery. But at Alexandria a controversy having
arisen between the gentiles and the Jews since the Jews were demanding vengeance
and were threatening to burn up with seized torches the people of the gentiles
gathered in the amphitheater, they turned against themselves the commander of
the place Alexander Tiberius who was looking after other matters. At first
indeed he tried to restore public harmony with peaceful words, but when he
noticed he was being mocked by those whom he was carefully warning, and that by
no other means was it possible for the riot to be stopped, he gave his soldiers
the power of attacking them, who having surrounded and attacked them made a
great slaughter through the entire city, when they killed some who were
resisting, others who were hiding in their homes, nor did any mercy <B>[p. 163]
</B>even of small children appear or respect for the aged or concern for the
modesty of women. And so fifty thousand of the Jews were slain. The streets were
overflowing with blood, all were filled with bodies, flames crackled through the
city from the fierce fire, which thrown into the houses of the Jews laid waste
their neighborhoods. Unbending however Alexander finally orders the soldiers to
abstain and the recall to be sounded, the anger of the mob however having once
come forth into the capability of killing was by no means soothed.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C12"></A>XII.</SPAN>&nbsp;They indeed paid the punishments of their crimes, who after they had
crucified Jesus the judge of divine matters, afterwards even persecuted his
disciples. However a great part of the Jews, and very many of the gentiles
believed in him, since they were attracted by his moral precepts, by works
beyond human capability flowing forth. For whom not even his death put an end to
their faith and gratitude, on the contrary it increased their devotion. And so
they brought in murderous bands and conducted the originator of life to Pilatus
to be killed, they began to press the reluctant judge. In which however Pilatus
is not absolved, but the madness of the Jews is piled up, because he was not
obliged to judge, whom not at all guilty he had arrested, nor to double the
sacrilege to this murder, that by those he should be killed who had offered
himself to redeem and heal them. About which the Jews themselves bear witness,
Josephus a writer of histories saying, that there was in that time a wise man,
if it is proper however, he said, to call a man the creator of marvelous works,
who appeared living to his disciples after three days of his death in accordance
with the writings of the prophets, who prophesied both this and innumerable
other things full of miracles about him. <B>[p. 164]</B> from which began the
community of Christians and penetrated into every tribe of men nor has any
nation of the Roman world remained, which was left without worship of him. If
the Jews don't believe us, they should believe their own people. Josephus said
this, whom they themselves think very great, but it is so that he was in his own
self who spoke the truth otherwise in mind, so that he did not believe his own
words. But he spoke because of loyalty to history, because he thought it a sin
to deceive, he did not believe because of stubbornness of heart and the
intention of treachery. He does not however prejudge the truth because he did
not believe but he added more to his testimony, because although disbelieving
and unwilling he did not refuse. In which the eternal power of Jesus Christ
shone bright because even the leaders of the synagogue confessed him to be god
whom they had seized for death. And truly as god speaking without limitation of
persons or any fear of death he announced also the future destruction of the
temple. But the damage of the temple did not move them, but because they were
chastized by him in scandal and sacrilege, from this their wrath flared up that
they should kill him, whom no ages had held. For while others had earned by
praying to do what they did, he had it in his power that he could order all
things what he wished to be done. John the Baptist a holy man, who never placed
the truth of salvation in second place, had been killed before the death of
Jesus. Finally to all things which he taught to be full of righteousness, with
which he invited the Jews to the worship of god, he had instituted baptism for
the sake of purification of mind and body. For whom freedom was the cause of his
death, because he was unable, the law having violated of the right of fraternal
marriage, to endure the wife abducted from a brother by Herod. For when this
same Herod was travelling to Rome, having entered the house of his brother for
the purpose of lodging, the wife to whom was Herodias the daughter of
Aristobolus, <B>[p. 165] </B>the sister of king Agrippa, unmindful of nature he
dared to solicit her, that the brother having been left behind she should marry
him, when he had returned from the city of Rome, with the consent of the woman
an agreement of lewdness having been entered into information of which thing
came to the daughter of king Areta still remaining in marriage of Herod. She
indignant at her rival insinuated to her returning husband that he should go to
the town Macherunta which was in the boundaries of king Petreus and Herod. He
who suspected nothing, at the same time because he had impaired the whole state
around the same, by which he could more easily keep the faith of the agreement
to Herodias if he should get rid of his wife, agreed to her diversion. But she
when he came near to her father's kingdom revealed the things learned to her
father Areta, who by an ambush attacked and completely destroyed in a battle the
entire force of Herod, the betrayal having been made through those, who from the
people of Philippus the tetrarch had associated themselves to Herod. Whence
Herod took the quarrel to Caesar, but the vengeance ordered by Caesar the anger
of god took away, for in the very preparation of war the death of Caesar was
announced. And we discover this assessed by the Jews and believed, the author
Joseph a suitable witness against himself, that not by the treachery of men but
by the arousing of god Herod lost his army and indeed rightly on account of the
vengeance of John the Baptist a just man who had said to him: it is not
permitted you to have that wife. But we construe this thusly as if in their own
people the Jews preserved their lawful rights, among whom the power of the high
priest had perished and the avarice of those killed and the arrogance of the
powerful, who thought the right to do what they wished was permitted to them.
For from the beginning Aaron <B>[p. 166]</B> was the chief priest, who
transmitted to his sons by the will of god and a lawful anointing the
prerogative of the priesthood, by whom by the order of succession are
constituted those exercising the chief command of the priesthood. Whence by the
custom of our fathers it became valid for no one to become the foremost of the
priests, unless he was from the blood of Aaron, to whom the first law of this
method of the priesthood was entrusted. It is not permitted to succeed to a man
of another descent even if a king. Finally Ozias, because he seized the office
of the priesthood, overspread with leprosy ejected from the temple, he spent the
rest of his life without authority. And without doubt he was a good king, but it
was not permitted to him to usurp the office of religion. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C13"></A>XIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;And so there were from the time when our fathers departed from
Egypt up to the building of the temple which Solomon founded thirteen leaders of
the priests who make up six hundred twelve years inasmuch as at first he who was
the foremost of the priests continued all the way to his death, nor was anyone
substituted in the place of those living. Afterwards they were substituted even
for the living. Therefore these thirteen inherited the priesthood through the
right of succession, at which times the power of judges and kings was both rule
by the best born and absolute rule. On the other hand from Solomon to the times
of the captivity, when the people emigrated into Syria the city having been
captured and the temple destroyed, there were eighteen leaders of the priests
through four hundred sixty years and six months and ten days. Moreover the
people were in captivity for seventy years. Afterwards Cyrus when he dismissed
the people from the territory of the Assyrians and gave them permission to
rebuild the temple he even permitted the chief of the priests Iosedec who <B>[p.
167]</B> had been taken away at the same time to return, in order that the
solemnity of the ancient rite might be restored through the knowledge of an
accustomed priest. He therefore and his male descendants to the number fifteen
from the return of the people up to Antiochus Eupator functioned in the office
in the order of succession and represented the leadership of the priesthood for
four hundred fourteen years, the first being Antiochus, whom we mentioned above,
and his commander Lysias, Onia the chief of the priests having been killed, in
his place they substituted Iacimus into the priesthood. Who although he was of
the family of Aaron, he was not however from the house itself. From which
Ananias a brother of Onia traveling into Egypt sought from Ptolomaeus Filometor
and Cleopatra the wife of Filometor, who had inserted the rites of the practices
in imitation of the Jerusalem ritual in the observances of the city of
Alexandria, that from there a leader of the priests should be substituted, for
the reason that Iacimus did not have a lawful right of succession of the
priesthood. But the same however three years having passed died; nor did he
deserve to have a successor, who had annulled the necessary formality of the
lawful succession. And so the state was three years without a leader of the
priesthood. Up to this time of the retreat of the fathers from the land of the
Egyptians it had maintained a democracy, for the reason that the people of the
Jews recognized themselves to have been led into captivity because of the
wickednesses of their kings. Afterwards the Asamonaeans, having gained the power
of presiding over the people, set up Ionathan as chief of the priests, who
having served for seven years the office having been received found the end of
life through the treachery of Tryphonis. In whose place however Simon a full
brother just as if through selection by hereditary right succeeded, whom <B>[p.
168]</B> we have received as killed during a dinner by the treachery of a
son-in-law. From whom to his son Hyrcanus, whom flight had taken away from
danger, the prerogative of the priesthood migrated. But to Hyrcanus Aristobolus
was substituted, who had joined the kingship to the mentioned office so that he
was a partaker of each, and to Aristobolus Alexander was substituted. Both the
kingship and the priesthood remained in the power of Alexander all the way to
the last day of his life, namely through seven and twenty years, but for the
most part in a doubtful status, for between himself and Demetrius the victory
was doubtful and there was great hatred from the citizens. Alexander dying, who
saw that the inheritance of his hatreds would be full of danger for his sons,
wished his wife Alexandria practiced in the exercise of rule and the association
of impartial advisors, more acceptable moreover to the people, because against
the fierceness of her husband she had frequently been a protection to those
imperiled, and a moderation to her husband, to control the governing of the
kingdom, at the same time establishing her the judge, to which of the sons the
powerful peak of the priesthood should be entrusted. She substituted Hyrcanus
for her father in the priesthood, either because of the prerogative of greater
age, or because it seemed to his mother with a gentler nature than his brother
he would stir up no troubles in charge of the business of the kingdom. To
Aristobolus she gave nothing of the public offices, but he actually with his
mother living, on the occasion however of her illness, exercised the kingship in
remote and well fortified places. Displeased by whom and made uneasy by the
complaints of Hyrcanus she the force of sickness having proceeded not beyond
nine years of rule left Hyrcanus the heir of everything, not that she
anticipated that he would watch over it, but that she should not support someone
unworthy or by a more favorable judgment arouse the insolence of a usurper.
Truly the death of Alexandria deprived Hyrcanus of the priesthood and the
kingship. For defeated in war he took himself to a fortified place, and the wife
and sons of Aristobolus having been held back, whom <B>[p. 169]</B> he had found
in the fort, he embraced them to change the situation, that all power and the
priesthood should go over to Aristobolus, he himself as a private citizen would
submit into the house of Aristobolus. But however he was not content for long to
have exchanged the royal court for a private household. So incited at first by
Antipater he went into Arabia as if contesting the unfairness of the agreement,
then when they were irresolute on his behalf against the Romans, whom
Aristobolus had enticed into partnership of himself through Scaurus, he turned
to the assistance of the Arab king, he took his complaint to Pompeius who was
arriving. Who struck down in battle the cheating Aristobolus who was already
governing in his third year, and before victory he gave him to prison and his
people having been overcome and the city captured, ordering him as a captive
with his sons to be taken to Rome, he gave back the position of the priesthood
to Hyrcanus and decided however that he should govern the citizens without a
crown and the headbands of royal power, an adviser indeed of great honor but of
peace, so that the peace should not be disturbed by a spirit of fraternal
haughtiness. Thus Aristobolus, although a captive, still deprived Hyrcanus of
the kingship, and for twenty four years afterwards exercised power more in
practice than in name.. Still however he was not the end of life for Hyrcanus
who was in his power. For he [i.e., Hyrcanus] yielded the remaining time of
infamy, as we recounted before, in fact overcome in battle with the Parthians
who were crossing the Euphrates he was captured and given into the power of
Antigonus a son of Aristobolus and his ears also having been cut off not thus
even did he satisfy the harshness of a wretched hardship. For after these things
also carried away an exile into Parthia, a weak old man he showed himself a
laughingstock to the barbarians, and it having been learned afterwards that
Herod was ruling, whose wife Mariamme <B>[p. 170]</B> his granddaughter had
gotten control of, he returned into Judaea. Where at first he was received with
the greatest appearance of respect, by which a veil of treachery was concealed,
not at all much later the crime having been alleged that he wished to regain
power he was killed. Herod therefore having gained the kingdom, which he had
received from the Romans at the price of the seige and surrender of the country,
in the place of Antigonus, who had held the supreme power for three years and
three months, he substituted as successors in the priestshood not of the family
of Asamonaeus, whom we have accepted to have been of illustrious lineage, but of
low birth whomever whom either lust or chance had given over, however fatigued
by the requests of Alexandra or terrified by the accusations of his
father-in-law he created Ionathen the brother of his wife a priest who served
for seventeen years. Whom presently he himself gave to death suspected of a
desire for supreme power, because around him the great favor of the entire
people was seen to blaze up from day to day. And so Anhelus being held in less
esteem, whom he had already nominated from the lowborn into the priesthood
before Ionathan, he chose the rest in order of this sort, about whom he had
nothing suspect. For what he was not able to tolerate in his relations, how
could he not be ware of in strangers? Archelaus followed a similar pattern in
making appointments of this character, with the appearance of an ancestral habit
he held the opinion of a mean mind in a certain manner inherent in human
mortals, that among them worthlessness of the stupid is less to be suspected
than the favors of the good, although the weak mind may be more insolent in
favorable circumstances, the more prudent will know to pay back reciprocally
with favors. And therefore from the kingship of Herod to the rule of the Romans,
which Archelaus having been deposed <B>[p. 171]</B> joined Iudaea to the other
provinces, and so from there all the way to the destruction of the temple and
the triumph of Titus there were twenty eight head priests during one hundred
seventy years. Truly for most of these it was only a position of dignity, for in
the hands of very few was there the exercise of power. It is evident therefore
that among the chiefs of the priests succession of the legitimate family did not
survive, because not all were from Aaron nor from his sons, who substituted in
his place left to others the appearance of the prescribed succession. And so
with avarice or treachery of their own the institutions of our elders were
destroyed, the laws of religion dishonored, the protections of antiquity
overthrown, not undeservedly the divine assistance deserted them. From that it
proceeded as if against an empty people with every type of injuries, so that
with domestic riots they turned their own hands against themselves, they were
afflicted with most serious brigandage, the most offensive judges were chosen by
lots, those more worthless succeeded the wicked. Finally Albinus the very worst
was considered of the best, in truth with Florus his successor he was considered
among the honest ones, who brought out the torch of war and inflamed the fight
between the Romans and the Jews, which was the cause for the great destruction
of the temple and the city.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C14"></A>XIV.</SPAN>&nbsp;For Cestius when he discovered the Jews to be on fire with madness
of war, who had received from the Romans the great task of ruling the military
in parts of Syria, in the twelfth year of the rule of Nero moved the forces of
the Roman foot soldiers, to whom the guardianship of restraining madness and
upholding peace was committed, so that he might punish murder. The forces of his
allies having been collected and having entered into Iudaea, the city which has
the name Zabulon, <B>[p. 172]</B> the inhabitants having melted away from fear,
full of riches, which fleeing to the tops of mountains the owners had not been
able to take away with them, having allowed it to be laid waste by the army,
having admired also the beauty of the public works, he ordered to be burned. And
as if this were not enough for vengeance, the army having been sent ahead lest
anyone should take himself from destruction by flight, by land and sea, a rush
by the boats which had been sent seized Joppa. Eight thousand men having been
killed and four hundred more almost, when the pillage of robbery stopped, the
city was burned. The neighborhood of Caesarea also having been pillaged, he
plundered what was found, he burned the villages. Whose attack he broke off all
the Sephorians coming forth to meet Cestius on the road, mollified by whose
goodwill and favor he left the city exempt from ruin. A brotherhood of bandits
was active in these places, but with the army coming they had departed into the
mountains. Who, having attacked Gallus carrying standards in command of the
twelfth legion, fought bravely, so that they killed about two hundred of the
Romans. But truly when the Romans seized the higher places the robbers were not
able to withstand the infantry in close combat, and fleeing easily surrounded by
the cavalry they are killed. And so above two thousand were cut down, a few
routed were able to hide in the steep places of the mountains, and all the
region was cleansed of brigandage. Gallus returned into Caesarea; Cestius with
all his troops proceeded to Antipatris, in which the Jews had amassed a not
inconsiderable multitude. But before they put together their troops, dispersed
through scattered areas they abandoned the region and villages to plundering and
fire. Lydda also was found empty of inhabitants and was burned by Gabaus, which
was fifty stadia from Jerusalem, where placed in view it received the Roman
army, it armed the Jews. Who, the celebration of the sabbath having been
postponed, which <B>[p. 173]</B> they initiated with solemn attention and
ancient observance, they sprang forth against the Romans with such great vigor,
that they would have routed the entire army if the cavalry had not come to the
assistance of the oppressed foot soldiers. Five hundred fifteen men of the
Romans were killed, but all were gravely endangered, of the Jews moreover twenty
two were lost in the battle. In which place shone the valor of Monobazus and
Cedaeus, who, it having been learned what had been raised up against the Romans
by the Jews, having attacked from the front thrust back very many and forced
them to retire into the city.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C15"></A>XV.</SPAN>&nbsp;Simon also drove off the ascending Romans in the vicinity of the city
from their baggage, whence Cestius held himself in the region for three days.
The enemy surrounded during this delay and situated on higher ground advanced
and watched everyone, lest anyone should break in with impunity. Considering
that without much loss on either side nothing could be attempted, king Agrippa
sent his men Borcius and Phoebus, who were to say to the people that whatever of
outrage had been committed by them against the Romans was pardonable, if only in
the future their arms having been put down they would take counsel for
themselves, reckoning what he believed that it would either be persuaded to all
that they should reject war, or that part would be plucked away from the rest.
But the mutinous to the contrary, from fear that the second of these might
happen, attacked the ambassadors and killed Phoebus. Borcius however having
received a wound was barely able to escape. Cestius, seeing contentions of this
type in the city, in which some rose up against the ambassadors, others
recommended that the Romans be received by the city, having tried to advance all
the way to Jerusalem drove back those resisting and himself approached to the
third stadia of the memorable city with the army and spent three days there, on
the fourth <B>[p. 174]</B> day an attack having been made he entered and
immediately burned Bethesda and Caenopolis. Who hastening to the heights of the
city, the mutinous fleeing into its interior, if he had thought the city could
be broken into, without a doubt the entire war could have ended. In fact Ananus
the son of Jonathan had assembled a great number, so that they should encourage
the Romans with their voices as if they were about to unbar the gates. But while
Cestius either is called back by Priscus and several of the centurions, who
having been corrupted by Florus desired that the war should flare up, or trusts
too little, Ananus with his people lets himself down from the wall. Who fleeing
back to their own supporters, the mutinous seized their place. The Romans trying
different approaches for five days, when they realized that a break in was
impossible for them, the strongest having been selected and with these and
archers they attacked the temple from the northern side. The Jews fighting
bravely also did not take a rest and the enemy having been driven back
repeatedly were elated. But at last some having been wounded by the multitude of
arrows, others struck and frightened yielded to the Romans to undermine the
wall, to the attackers to burn the door of the temple. Great alarm invaded the
mutinous and a certain confusion of their minds. Finally many as if by the
uninterrupted destruction of the about to be destroyed city took themselves away
in flight and not daring to make a stand they gave the people assurance that
with those departing, by whose multitude they had been surrounded, as if already
free and having put aside a certain blockade of the wicked they poured
themselves around the gates, which having been opened they received Cestius as
if he had come not to attack he city but to defend it. But also a certain
stupidity suddenly took possession of Cestius himself, so that he did not
consider the despair of the wicked nor the desire of the people, who if he had
brooded over the undertaking a short while, would have averted the war, would
have captured the city. But the opposite, as far <B>[p. 175]</B> as it is given
to be understood, the will of god put off for the Jews the imminent end of the
war, until ruin enveloped many and almost all of the Jewish race. It was
awaited, as I think, that in every sin the enormous size of the crimes would
grow and make equal the measure of the great shames to the increase of the
impiety. Why was it that, when he should have pushed on, Cestius suddenly called
back the army and lifted the seige? By what sudden reversal of the situation
contrary to what was expected the spirits of the good people broken, and the
robbers aroused that they took up confidence and having turned back from flight
to pursuing they attack the rear of the marching army and attacking confusedly
there they cut down many of the cavalry and foot soldiers. And already the day
was declining, whence fearing the nearness of night and the fog of darkness,
which they trusted more who were knowledgeable of the places, by which they
urged on on all sides those uncertain of the region, Cestius established a wall
before the city and on the following day, when he left the enemy, he armed it
against himself, as they thought fear to be the cause of his departure. And so
flowing around on the sides, at the rear, they cut down the hindmost, they
harass the advancing army with darts, the force of darts thrown into crowded
ranks is not at all easy to be eluded. If anyone dared to strike back, to be
open to a wound, if anyone turned himself to those harassing, to be left by his
companions, to be shut in by the enemy, he who follows always more protected
than he who precedes, for the latter covers his chest, the former uncovers his
back to the enemy. And so the Romans were vigorously urged on as if beset, and
already themselves burdened by the weight of their arms not able to sustain or
endure, the enemy being faster whom it was not easy to pursue, and there was
great fear lest the battle array be broken up. <B>[p. 176]</B> From the unfair
situation of the contest they were not able to do injury to the enemy, since
they themselves were being seriously harassed. Cestius adhered to his plan,
although through the entire march he saw that his forces were being wiped out,
and already very many of the first rank had been hurt. He halted for two days as
if about to renew the exhausted. But when he saw the number of the enemy to be
increasing more and more and everything crowded together around the
circumference to block the path to his adversaries and himself which would cause
delay there because more were collecting together, on the third day seeking the
saving of an easier passage he commanded that the baggage of the column be put
away. The pack animals were killed, most of the vehicles were smashed and other
things of this type, which were more of a burden than of use in perils, were
burned up or thrown aside, as instruments of sieges and kinds of weapons, by
which they were more frightened, lest they should arm the enemy against
themselves with their own supplies. But when the Jews noticed that flight rather
than battle was being prepared by the Romans, they occupied the confined parts
of the route, they made a stand in the less spread out places, they hindered in
the front, they hemmed in from the sides, they pressed from the rear, they
forced against the precipices, against which they were confined on all sides or
having fallen were thrown down. The many overspread the sky with javelins, they
covered the troops with arrows their duty never relaxing and disaster alone for
their adversaries. Already the foot soldiers were not able to hold out, and the
danger was truly greater for the cavalry, who from the precipitousness of the
rocks and the slipperiness the horses slipping and falling were rolled down and
hindered by the narrow path could not maintain ranks. On one side the cliffs, on
the other side the precipices denied the opportunity of either flight or
defense. The Jews on the contrary were more fired up with the anticipation of
victory, they were threatening weary troops, they were pressing hard against men
in a difficult predicament, they trampled upon those who were giving up hope,
and they would have completely destroyed almost all the the supplies of the
Roman army, if night had not come, by whose darknesss the fighting was hampered,
and for this reason the Romans were able to make <B>[p. 177]</B> their way into
the nearest town to which the name Bethoron, so that the Jews having poured
around on all sides spied out the exits from the place, lest the Romans should
escape. Cestius despairing of an open path attempted flight by trickery. And so
he chose forty men, to whom the despair of escaping had poured in contempt of
death. He stationed them in the fortifications with the order that during the
entire night with the greatest noise they should shout out the functions of
those spread out on the wall so that the preparation of the departing army
should not be made evident to Jews by any customary indications, by which those
whoever they are who are agitated are wont to give themselves away, while in
silence everyone went out with no indication to the mistrusting Jews, who heard
the usual noise of the guards, from which all thought the Romans to be remaining
in place. With this trickery Cestius led out the army, and had already
accomplished thirty stadia taking advantage of the loyalty in doubtful
circumstances of those few, who about to perish without payment preferred to
stand up for their comrades rather than destroy their own dangers. And indeed
night hid the trickery but day betrayed it. For when things were revealed in the
diffuse light and every place, in which the Romans stayed, appeared empty, an
attack having been made first against those, by whose simulated duties they had
been deceived, the Jews rush in and the forty men having been destroyed a light
task, they follow the army, which during the night had accomplished a great
distance and was urging on the march even faster during the day, lest it should
be involved in the dangers of the night. The road was full of baggage, which the
fleeing Romans had abandoned, lest anyone should be delayed by a too heavy pack.
Utensils lay everywhere, useful items, and even things necessary for fighting,
spear throwing machines battering rams and other equipment brought along for the
destruction of a city, which the Jews following passed by lest there should be
delays, returning they collected them, so that they should use these against
those, who had abandoned them. For having followed all the way to the city
<B>[p. 178]</B> Antipatris, they struck against everything passed by and having
dropped the hope of catching the Roman army, they turn back their track and
picking up the spoils from those killed they return to Jerusalem with triumph
and hymns. From which great rejoicing resulted, that few of their own having
been lost five thousand foot soldiers from the Roman army and three hundred
(eighty and three hundred) horsemen were killed. Which was done in the twelfth
year of the rule of Nero, as previously mentioned. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C16"></A>XVI.</SPAN>&nbsp;But that exultation was not from all the Jews. For there were those
who wished passionately after that to rescue themselves not from the battle with
Cestius but from trouble as if from the great danger of a sinking ship and to
swim away from the shipwreck of the state, before the rest Custobarus and Saulus
brothers with Philippus the leader of the troops of king Agrippa. These fleeing
took themselves to Cestius seeking that they should be sent into Achaia to Nero.
Whom Cestius being willing received nor did he deny their requests, that through
them Caesar might be taught the cause of the war to have been Florus; upon him
the greatest responsibility for the war lay, that the army had been surrounded
by an unexpected multitude of plotters, which it was established had been
rescued from danger more by the plan of its leader than entangled in it. Cestius
aroused against Florus had attempted to calm down the hatreds but had not been
able to. And so he had fallen into the war, not brought it on. These indeed had
been ordered, that alarmed by all the agitation of Caesar against Florus he
hoped the displeasure of Caesar concerning himself to be lessened, that he had
become fearful of the knowledge of a thing done badly. And so most however were
terrified by the defeat of the Roman army, the inhabitants of Damascus, fearing
the contagion of a mistrusted society on account of <B>[p. 179]</B> the sharing
of lodging, killed the Jews collected in the sports center, who inhabited the
city with them---because they either from mistrust or deceit had managed already
for a long time that they were separated from social intercourse with the
gentiles, lest they should change anything in the night or alone be open to
destruction---a very great truly mystery of silence so that the attempt of this
matter discussed should not be passed even to their wives, inasmuch as these
also from a great part of the Jews were mixed together in their cultures.
</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C17"></A>XVII.</SPAN>&nbsp;And so in a confined place all of them having attacked they killed
ten thousand Jews, which was easy as prevented by armed men and unarmed they
died. And indeed a recent example of his barbarity at Scythopolis proceeded even
farther, by which I think the Damascans were aroused. For when the Jews were
laying waste every neighboring area, they came to Scythopolis and there the
inhabitants having attacked to test the Jews submitted to their adversaries,
whom they considered faithful to themselves, inasmuch as in the manner of human
nature concern of safety outweighed distress. In favorable circumstances
therefore establishing a brotherhood of fellow tribesmen they preferred an
alliance of inhabitants, they threaten ruin to the fellow tribesman. Which was
suspected by the people, because the performance was stretched out by the
manifest spirit of hatreds, lest treachery should be gotten ready under the
guise of pretense and they should attack the city at night with the residents
less cautious, and with all the people having been overthrown they should
restore favor to themselves among the Jews. .And besides to show their loyalty
by this even around the gentiles if they wished, every generation they would go
out from their city and seek out the neighboring grove. Which having been done
the Scythopolitans were quiet for two days so that a part of the Jews would put
aside mistrust, would put on carelessness. On the third night when already the
anticipated trust in grace had removed any apprehension of the guard, incautious
and sleeping, violence having been inflicted, and ten and three thousands of men
were killed and whatever things they had were plundered. <B>[p. 180]</B> </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C18"></A>XVIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;The suffering of Simon bitter to see and pitiable to hear drives
an explanation, but it was remarkable from the strangeness of the thing. He was
among the people of the Jews born of Saulus a not at all ignoble father, gifted
with boldness of mind and strength of body, both of which he used in the
destruction of his fellow tribesmen, who killed very many of the people coming
in from outside in the frequent attack of the Jews, as if perhaps the
conspirators were present, alone he was accustomed to hold out against the
battle array and to rout the massed forces, he was the bond of the whole and a
troop in war, and generally the savior in desperate circumstances. He
demonstrated this to the citizens against his own people serving the forces of
the Scythopolitans, but not for long to a kinsman was the vengeance owed to the
blood lacking. For when, the good faith having broken, the surrounding
Scythopolitans, who out of a peaceful situation had taken themselves to the
grove, began to threaten with war and to press in, a mob even having killed the
sons and parents of Simon although beyond reach of the rest they attacked with
missiles and darts. Simon seeing the innumerable multitude superior in an easy
task, since he was not able to bear it longer, drew his sword and having turned
against the enemy shouted saying: I am receiving the proper return for my acts,
who threatened with the death of kinsmen rather than yours and demonstrated good
will and gave fraternal blood a pledge of peace to you, for which treachery is
justly assigned. Now while I grant a pledge to foreigners I have sent against my
family. I have betrayed my children and parents, whom however to be killed by
you was not necessary, if you consider the reward of wickedness. I die therefore
but angry at all, a friend to none, who have assailed my own people, with my own
hands I will first seek retribution from myself. I have killed associates of my
religion and sharers of my faith, I recognize what is owed for my wickedness. I
will pay for the parricide suited for such a great sacrilege, that it may be
both the penalty for the outrage and the glory for courage, lest anyone else
should boast about a wound of mine, <B>[p. 181]</B> my own right hand will
afterwards be turned against me myself, that it may be seen to be of fury that I
die, not of weakness. Lest anyone should mock the dying, that madness should be
a protector of parricide, parricide of sacrilege. Having spoken this he turned
his gaze upon his children and parents and with indignant eyes, since already
pathos mixed with anger was following, he transfixed his father snatched from
the crowd with his sword, after him the mother is drawn lest there should be any
who might appear as descendents. His wife voluntarily offers herself in
succession lest dislodged from such a great husband she might survive. The sons
run up, lest in death itself they should be judged unworthy of such a great
father. He hastened with a swift blow to forestall the enemy. And therefore all
his family having been killed he stood firm in the middle of his corpses and as
though they were triumphing over their domestic sufferings because he saw no one
of his to perish by an alien sword, he raised his right hand so that all should
see and exposing to all the terrifying death for himself victorious he
transfixed himself with his own sword. A remarkable young man because of his
strength of body and greatness of mind, but because he bestowed trust upon
foreigners rather than upon his own, he was worthy of such a death. </P>
