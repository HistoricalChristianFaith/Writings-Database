<P align="center"><b>PROLOGUE :</b></P>
<P>Having followed with my pen the four books of Kings which the sacred writings
embrace all the way to the captivity of the Jews and the destruction of the wall
and the triumphs of Babylon, I arranged this in the manner of history. The
prophetic speech also summarizes in a few words the things done by the
Macchabaeans; of the rest all the way to the burning of the temple and the booty
of Titus Caesar the excellent narrator Josephus (covers) with his historical
pen, would that he had been attentive to religion and truth as to tracking down
events and the staidness of speeches. He showed himself in his own words even a
partner of the treachery of the Jews, which he made known about their
punishment, and whose arms he deserted, but whose sacrilege he did not give up:
he lamented tearfully their hardships, but he did not understand the cause of
this hardship. Whence it was a concern for us relying not upon the help of
tricks but the purpose of faith to go in the history of the Jews a little beyond
the chain of sacred writing so that, as if seeking a rose among the thorns,
among the savage crimes of the impious, which were paid off at a price worthy
of the impiety, we may dig up something of reverence of the sacred law or of the
miracle of the divine destiny, which although to evil heirs were either a
pretext in unfavorable circumstances or a reason for honor in favorable ones; at
the same time, because it is proof of domestic wickedness, establishes for all
that they themselves were for themselves the authors of their own destruction,
first because they turned the Romans who desired something different against
themselves <B>[p. 4]</B> and attracted them to an examination of their kingdom,
for which it was preferable to be ignored, not about to keep faith they asked
for friendship, unequal in strength they violated the peace, finally they
brought on war, to whom all hope was in their walls not in their strength, since
to be shut in by a siege is a miserable thing for all, which even if it proceeds
well, is accustomed more frequently to increase rather than to decrease the
dangers. And lest anyone should think us to have undertaken a task empty of
faith and unnecessary, let us consider that all the tribe of Hebrews was so led
by their leaders, as is plainly evident, whether from the loins of Judas the
successors of his begetting nowhere were deficient, or in truth offended in the
chain of leaders, but continued in him in whom all things remained placed and
who was himself the hope of the nations. From here therefore we take up our
beginning.</P>

<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>I.</SPAN>&nbsp;In the Parthian war, which was long lasting and frequent and with varying
victory between the Macchabaean commanders and the people of the Medes, the
resentment of sacrilege gave an incentive, because king Antiochus who had the
name Illustrious, the son of the king of Antioch, when he had joined Egypt to
his empire, raised up to arrogance, because the uncertainties of the wars had
rewarded him, had ordered the rites of the Hebrews to be disregarded and their
mysteries to be profaned, daring to decide this with many Jews demanding it.
Which fact the priest Matthathias was unable to endure, and not only did he
refrain from the sacrilege and not comply with the royal edict, but truly even
having found one among his people sacrificing victims to images he transfixed
him with a sword. And a troop having been collected and the Asidaeans having
been associated <B>[p. 5] </B>in alliance he with his sons violating the
practice of the ancestors and justice of the law killed some, drove out many and
was the originator of undertaking war on the sabbath, lest by a similar trick
they should themselves also be duped, thus already many of them, while they
deprecated undertaking war on the sabbath, lay dead unavenged killed by an enemy
rushing in upon them. The actions gave the power of success, and the desire of
defense and the vigor of piety continued in the man to the end of life. But when
he understood the final day to be at hand for him, he urged the citizens who had
been called and his children standing by that they should protect the fatherland
and the religion of the temple, and he left Juda the Macchabaean as leader to
them and the successor of his office and responsibilities. Who strong in war,
good in counsel, in comparison with the rest manifest in faith, how frequently
he routed innumerable forces of the enemy with a small band, it is not the
present task to follow up. Because however it is granted to collect in a short
time, having experienced frequently advantageous successes he aroused against
himself a great multitude of enemies, surrounded by whom on all sides, since he
thinks it shameful to yield, his allies fleeing he rushes into battle. Those
having been killed whom he had advanced against, surrounded from the side but
however having avenged his own death he is killed. Ionatha succeeded him not
less equal in likeness of courage than in affinity of birth. Who after many
achievements in warfare, duties in religious matters, which concerning the
purification of the temple were seen and approved, good faith having been
pretended by the treachery of friendship besieged within a city of enemies after
a short interval he was killed. Iohannes a brother older by birth and Eleazar
younger than the rest did not refuse death for their religion. After them Simon
received the highest position, which he approached not untrained but already
proven by the triumphs of the fraternal alliance, would that he had been as
perspicacious in avoiding trickery as he was strong in hand and well tested in
the arts of waging war. <B>[p. 6]</B> For indeed when with the help of bravery
he had established by treaty friendship with the commanders of the Romans and
the kings of the peoples, invited by the treachery of Ptolomaeus his son in law
to a banquet between the tables and drinking cups he was surrounded with his two
sons who were present and without arms is given up to a wicked death. Truly
however Iohannes sprung from Simon who had the name Hyrcanus avoided the
treachery and hastened to the walls of a neighboring city, where he was received
by the people because of the excellent merits of his father, and also their
dislike of the enemy crime. Indeed scarcely had he entered the city, and already
Ptolomaeus was there. But when he wished to enter through another gate, driven
away he judged that it must be yielded to the multitude. Ionathes immediately
received the duties of his father's priesthood and having set out from the care
of divine matters immediately pursued the duties of piety and the task of saving
his relatives, desiring to remove his mother and brothers from danger. Made
stronger by the assembly he was overcome by his natural feeling for their
suffering, so that he did not gain control of the fortress in which they were
held confined. For Ptolomaeus when he saw himself to be hard pressed, placed his
mother and brothers on the walls to be thrown down immediately, if Ionathes did
not desist from the war which he was waging. The young man was overcome by his
feeling of tenderness, who conquered by the assumption of bravery, and called
back the anger aroused against his enemy by compassion for the suffering of his
kin. His mother however prepared for tortures extended her hands praying not for
the remedy of safety but for the solace of vengeance. For she feared that her
son was more afraid for his mother than devoted to vengeance for his father. For
herself that death would be in place of immortality, by which her husband would
be avenged and a wicked son in law would pay the price for his monstrous crime.
But the youth fought himself more within himself than against his enemy; for
whenever he thought upon his father, he was incensed, but again when he saw his
mother to be lashed and to be ready for death, he weakened. He called back the
attack, he gave back his position, because his passion dwindled. Idle between
the pauses of the siege from the law <B>[p. 7]</B> the year arrived which was
the seventh. Filial piety yielded to religion, the siege was lifted. But by that
the brutality of Ptolomaeus was aroused more, so that he ordered them to be
killed by whose putting into danger he had escaped destruction. Who immediately
removed himself from retribution fleeing to the king of Philadelfia, Zenon who
had the name Cotyla, that he might protect himself with his aid. Nor did
Antiochus remain calm who resented his army to have been an object of mockery to
Simon the father of Ionathas, and desiring to quench the beginnings of Ionathas
yet rising, coming with a great band, he besieged Jerusalem and Hyrcanus.
Hyrcanus fended him off with gold, which he was not able to do with weapons, and
the tomb of David having been opened, as Josephus is our source, he dug up three
thousand talents of gold, from which he counted out three hundred to Antiochus,
so that he should abandon the siege, bought off by this price he went away. And
that he should lighten the hatred of the deed, Hyrcanus first is said to have
established a caravansary with this money, in which he received the visit of
poor pilgrims. Furthermore having seen the difficult straits of Antiochus for he
was inflicting war on the Medes, he avenged the expense and annexed many cities
of Syria to himself. Also he surrounded Samaria, where afterwards Sebastia was
established, with fortifications, whose storming he entrusted to his sons
Aristobolus and Antigonus, whose slow siege forced those shut in all the way to
fearful hunger and the offensive sustenance of human bodies. Driven by which
necessity they thought that help must be sought from Antiochus, who had the name
Aspondius, they added him bringing aid to the trouble with an alliance. For
defeated by the brothers he saved himself from death by flight from the battle.
The Samaritans however <B>[p. 8]</B> the city having been captured and destroyed
by the sudden siege were given into slavery. Aroused by which progress of
favorable things Aristobolus and Antigonus did not shrink from the attack, but
thought to join to themselves forced by war the neighboring states not at all
hiding this: until jealousy having arisen a savage war blazed up the inhabitants
of the regions conspiring together and a strong band having been collected.
Which however having been defeated produced a profound tranquility for Johannes
and peace for themselves. Hyrcanus having experienced the benefits of a long
peace in his thirty first year of rule closed his life with five surviving
children, which is deemed a blessed condition by most. An excellent governor and
supremely sober, who left nothing ever to a chance outcome, in which his action
was obscured, he entrusted tasks of great importance to his wife, having
carefully judged her moderate in public affairs, holding with a certain
prescience of mind that his sons would not be long lasting.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>II.</SPAN>&nbsp;Nor was his opinion mistaken, inasmuch as Aristobolus, to whom among the
brothers his age was greater, his mind more hasty, turned the leadership of the
priesthood into rule over the kingdom and first presumed to place a crown upon
himself. After four hundred seventy five years and a span of three months, from
when returning from Babylon Israel having put off servitude took itself into its
own land. And so haughtily not pleased to put part upon the other brothers he
treated Antigonus alone with the appearance of esteem, because he seemed to love
him; his mother, because she complained herself to be without a share of power
and cheated of the judgment of her husband, he bound with chains and cruel in a
parricidal spirit he proceeded to the point that he detained both her and his
brothers chained a similar manner in close confinement, in which <B>[p. 9]</B>
they were driven by starvation almost to death, if Aristobolus fearing the
reward of the crime of parricide had not timely loosened them. And his savage
spirit was irritated first against Antigonus himself and was turned from love
into hatred, that he should kill him before all others, whom alone he had
promised would be a partner to him in the state. There were perverse
dispositions among the wicked to the extent that he is quickly influenced by
vile suggestions. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>III.</SPAN>&nbsp;It is proper therefore that we do not pass over the train of his
cruelty, by which the judgment of Iohannes even after his death is shown to be
sound, who considered that the supreme power of the state should by no means be
entrusted to his older son, whom he foresaw would sink down with great madness
from the law of piety and the standards of justice, I know not at all from
contemplation of his customs or from the innate gratitude to the leaders of the
priests, that to them some things which were about to be were revealed even to
the less deserving. It was a wretched crime that they existed who begrudged to
the brothers the love of nature. From this first arose the stain of evil, the
fabrications that followed the jealousy are of this type.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>IV.</SPAN>&nbsp;They fabricated first things, to which Aristobolus gave no credence, he
softened the disparagement from the influence of affection attributing to
jealousy the harshness of the denunciation. Therefore they mixed false with true
things, so that from those things which they had added for the appearance of
truth they tricked him resisting.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>V.</SPAN>&nbsp;The feast of the Tabernacles of the Jews was being celebrated in the lands
according to law, a day naturally festive and full of reverence, where solemn
sacrifice was being offered. On that day Antigonus famous for deeds of military
service returned home and it happened that coming to his brother not equal he
offended him. He goes immediately to the temple -- what indeed is placed ahead
of religion -- girdled with military dress and surrounded by a suitable retinue,
many there <B>[p. 10]</B> supplicating the lord for the safety of his brother,
and from there attentive he hastens to his brother. From this a false accusation
is constructed with bitter venom and prepared with a grievous outcome. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C6"></A>VI.</SPAN>&nbsp;Immediately wicked men approach the king and arouse ill will, that he
directed a more crowded retinue of armed men than was the custom for private
citizens, that it would be a show for the rabble, that no one dared to hinder
his efforts; that with such a great splendor nothing other was aimed at than the
murder of the king and the usurpation of the rule of the state. With no great
difficulty the infirm mind worn out by a sick body is persuaded, that he should
consider credible what was alleged as truth, especially since the day dedicated
to worship shut out any suspicion of falsehood, the ostentation aroused dislike,
his sickness added fear and the retinue of armed men completed the belief of a
crime being carried out. and so before any attempt of a parricidal crime was
proved to him, he ordered his bodyguards with arms to be stationed in a dark
underground passage, who should remove the armor of the arriving Antigonus, nor
should they await the order of the king but themselves should kill him, an order
truly having been sent ahead through messengers that he should come without
weapons. The bride to Aristobolus changed the character of his message into the
opposite, that she caused to be insinuated to Antigonus by those sworn to her,
that his brother was delighted by the appearance of the armor outfitted in which
he had recently arrived, but because of illness had not examined attentively, to
request now that he should wear to his brother all that richly adorned military
attire which he had collected, it would be pleasing to the king if he would
arrive armed. Antigonus did not foresee treachery, he obeyed the request the
more carefully because he desired equally to please his king and brother.
Aristobolus was lying in the fortress, which first had the name Baris,
afterwards Antonia, for by the triumvir Antonius the name was given with the
dignity of the city. There after Antigonus came near <B>[p. 11]</B> and
approached that dark passage, the body guards of the king seeing him to have
come armed suddenly attacked and carry out their orders and and kill the
unsuspecting youth. This place was called the tower of Strato, the common
opinion is that Judas who was an Essene by birth was deceived by this name, who
early history has handed down from the uprightness of his life or from mystic
observation often announced things which were about to happen. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C7"></A>VII.</SPAN>&nbsp;He, as we have received it, when he had seen Antigonus passing by to see
his brother, said to those who were joined in the number of his disciples:
"Father, now it good for me to die, when for me the truth is dead. Antigonus is
alive whom to be killed today is unavoidable, the place however ordained for his
death is the tower of Strato which is six hundred stadia from here. It is
already the fourth hour of the day. And therefore faith in the predestined death
is made impossible by the time." When he said this, he began to confer intently
within himself how his opinion had been mistaken. And not much later the
information is brought forth, Antigonus to have been killed in the underground
passage at the tower of Strato, which place is accustomed to be named by the
same word as that in the coastal region of Caesarea. Which crime having been
accomplished Aristobolus reflecting within himself what a crime he had permitted
fell into sickness. It was murder in his eyes, disturbance in his mind, nor was
any interval given to dissimulation. Grief was imbedded deep in his heart,
hatred was changed into suffering, because he killed an innocent man contrary to
the law of brotherhood; the barbarity of this great wickedness festered in his
mind, sleep was not given to his eyes, nor rest to his mind. <B>[p. 12]</B> The
wound crawled with blind anguish, anxieties stirred up his sick vitals and
concerns wounded his feeble limbs and exceedingly deep sighs with frequent
groans broke forth.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C8"></A>VIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;And consequently the force of sickness broke out from the immoderate
repentance to such a degree that his vitals having convulsed he threw out blood
in the vomit of his mouth. Which a court servant performing his duties in
accordance with court usages took outside and unaware of the fact, because it
was done by chance rather by diligence, arrived at that place, in which
Antigonus had been killed. There upon the spots of fraternal blood still wet he
poured out the blood of his killer. An outcry suddenly was made there and the
groans of those watching, because from a certain deep arrangement of the lord
the blood of the wicked murderer was seen poured out upon the one murdered.
Roused by the sound he inquired the cause; when no reply was forthcoming, he
drew it out with insistence of inquiring and gestures of anger. Information of
which having been obtained his eyes filled with tears and so great was the
feeling within him that groaning he said: "a vicissitude fitting for my merits
is weighed out. Nor was I the contriver of such a wicked crime able to get by
the eye of god. A speedy disgrace and retribution is at hand and I am now met a
price fitting my parricide. Goodbye, my body. How long will you detain a soul
convicted by my brother and my mother? In what region do I pour out my blood for
them? Against me all hands, if there is any goodness, brandish darts. Let all
sons and brothers as the avengers of piety transfix me with swords. Let the
parricidal victim be sacrificed and be offered to his violated relative. May his
guilty flesh vomit out all its blood at once. Let it not be sated by the
tortures of my flesh or the slow decay of evil spirits, which having dared
thrust me into the abominable acts of a savage crime." With these words he gave
an end to his rule and life having discharged the royal power for scarcely one
year, because of the parricide which he had not fled from. <B>[p. 13] </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C9"></A>IX.</SPAN>&nbsp;</B>His wife immediately released and set free from imprisonment the
brothers of the deceased, she appointed Alexander as king, whom it was
considered that greater age and self control favored. Who as soon as he had
secured royal power immediately killed a brother whom he had noticed too
desirous of the kingship. The one who remained of the brothers, intent upon life
and safety rather than royal power, he spared but devoid of responsibilities.
And at once, as troubles of behavior hold him, he changed peace for war and a
clash having taken place against Laturus Ptolomaeus he indeed killed very many
of the enemy, but the victory accrued to Laturus. From whom however his mother
Cleopatra took away the fruits of victory and forced him to retire into Egypt,
to escape his mother threatening him. Alexander having taken notice of his
absence, while he wishes to invade parts of his kingdom, turns even Theodorus
against himself, inasmuch as he had annexed the most important of his
possessions to himself. And so by a sudden attack Theodorus recovered the royal
wealth, he routed also ten thousand of the Jews in a battle, but recovering
above this blow Alexander added still more from the territory of the enemy to
his empire and he forced the peoples of the captured cities into slavery. A
civil uprising interrupted these successes, and strife having arisen from dinner
parties all the way to war proceeded by the plague of this type familiar to the
men of Jews, so that from the pastime of sumptuous feasting they arouse
themselves to arms. And unless foreign aid had been ready at hand for the king,
the rebellion would have prevailed, but even with the foreign troops it was
barely suppressed nevertheless eight thousand almost of the Jews had been
killed. Whence he directed his march into Arabia, and some of its cities were
subjugated, and tribute by the right of victory was assessed of Moab and Gilead.
<B>[p. 14] </B>From there he returned to Amathus, Theodorus having been
frightened by his [i.e., Alexander's] great successes, finding his [i.e.,
Theodorus'] fortress empty of defenders he [i.e., Alexander] captured it without
delay. Obodeas the king of Arabia was not however altogether idle, nor did he
long suffer the losses of his kingdom unavenged. For by ambushes advantageously
located he destroyed all his [i.e., Alexander's] army which was crowded together
at the bottom of a valley and squeezed together by a flock of camels. Alexander
however escaped. Fleeing from the battle he seeks the shelter of the city of
Jerusalem, hated by his own people, because they had broken out into hatred at
the opportunity of his hardships, who previously were suppressed by fear of his
power. Nor was the discord of minds hidden by silence or exercised by words
only: it was fought not in one battle but in many, in which almost fifty
thousand Jews were killed whom Alexander killed, as victor more destructive to
his own forces than to his enemies and a greater detriment, because he
diminished the strength of his kingdom by conquering. From which not even he was
now pleased with his victories and having turned away from battle he treated
those subordinate to himself with craft, so that now he pressed not with arms,
but urged with words and dissolved the types of displeasures with speech only.
He accomplished nothing however toward collecting favor for himself, because his
outrages outweighed his pretenses and the sudden conversion itself to repentence
and the cruel unevenness if his conduct was held suspect by those who had
suffered. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C10"></A>X.</SPAN>&nbsp;Finally when they considered themselves to be surrounded by his pretended
placidity, they aroused king Demetrius to be an aid to themselves in a war
against Alexander. The fighting at close quarters was not delayed, although it
had to be fought by one against two armies with inferior numbers. Accompanied by
a thousand horsemen and six thousand foot soldiers, whon he had joined to
himself by pay, also summoning to battle ten thousand Jews uniting with him near
the city Sicim he came upon <B>[p. 15]</B> the enemy, who had three thousand
horsemen and forty thousand foot soldiers. The troops were tested on both sides
when Demetrius did not see those hired for money defect from faith, nor did
Alexander see any of the Jews do so, to whom Demetrius had joined himself, he
recognized hatred to be disposed against himself, they considered that it had to
be fought with arms. Demetrius was made superior in the battle however with much
blood of his troops. For it was fought with determination by those who had come
hired for different pay, so that they fought with faith and valor all the way to
death. And so Alexander seeing himself without troops bands of his cut down fled
into the mountains. But beyond the expectation of either the appearance of
victory came to the other of them, the profit was brought forth to the other,
because Demetrius was left unprotected by the departure of the Hebrews, who had
asked him to the alliance and six thousand of them joined themselves to
Alexander in a certain fashion of human nature joining to pity in adverse
circumstances. And so Demetrius yielded to him whom he had conquered in battle,
seeing him with the Hebrews gradually drifting away already the gainer of the
battle and himself left with a few. Whose victory moved fear of despotism to
those accustomed to freedom. Savagery returned to Alexander with security and
the kingdom was restored to his hands and the practice of war was resumed. To
him inquiring from them doing what would reconcile the minds of the people to
him it was answered, if he would die; scarcely even perhaps with him dead having
endured such oppressive things would they be turned back to favor, that they
should put aside hatred against him dead. Aroused by whom and the repeated
practice of rebelling many having been killed he drove the rest into the city
which has the name Bemeselel. Whose storming brought in a destruction more harsh
than usual such a savage proceeding of cruelty, that from the number he
crucified eight hundred <B>[p. 16]</B> in the middle of the city in whose sight
he ordered their wives and children to be butchered. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C11"></A>XI.</SPAN>&nbsp;This he watched lying back in the midst of his concubines, happy in his
wine and cups but drunk more from blood than wine. He frightened the people by
this act alone more than by the war, so that on the next night eight thousand of
the Jews departed farther than Judea, to whom the end of their flight would be
the death of Alexander, the horror of such a great evil brought quiet to the
kingdom. But when it was at leisure from domestic battles there arose for him a
cause of disquietude an expedition of Antiochus against the Arabia, which he
considered terrible for himself and about to be a danger. This is the Antiochus
who was even called Dionisius, the brother of Demetrius, the last descendent of
Seleucus. Desiring to deny transit to whom Alexander between the city Antipatris
and the Joppan shore a great ditch having been led and a very tall wall, towers
also of wood having been established, mocked the work with the great labor of
his men, no hindrance of the enemy, indeed by an easy task the ditches were
filled and the towers burned. Also Alexander himself decided upon flight for
himself as safer for the reason that he was considered not at all so great that
the victor ought to pursue him in the first place. For it was reserved for a
second part that he should avenge the injury received of the obstructed route,
therefore he directed a route straight into Arabia. Whose king had placed
himself in a place advantageous for battle, then the cavalry having been turned
about suddenly with great force and in a sprawling multitude and without order
charging they attacked the troops of the enemy. It was fought fiercely as long
as Antiochus resisted; for he offered resistance, although his army was being
cut down in the manner of cattle. When truly he himself was slain <B>[p. 17]</B>
-- for he was accustomed to offer himself to dangers in front of the rest -- all
were routed, the greatest part of whom scattered in the uncertainty of flight is
destroyed, the rest having been forced into the village which has the name Ana
and consumed by the lack of food, a very few of them barely survived this great
slaughter.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C12"></A>XII.</SPAN>&nbsp;With this success Areta was asked by the people of Damascus to rule,
that he should govern at Coelesyria, from which they were shutting out
Ptolomaeus whom they especially attacked with a hostile dislike, nor did he
leave Judea exempt from attack, from which however, Alexander having been beaten
and an agreement favorable to each party concluded, he departed as the victor
and returned into his own kingdom. Alexander on the other hand overthrew Pella
and advanced toward Gerasa again preparing to add to himself some parts from the
possessions of Theodorus and he claimed that for himself in the war. From there
he proceeded into Syria and overwhelmed Gaulane and Seleucia and Gamela,
avenging the insult of the last battle, he demolished the fortifications
themselves of Antioch. From which places he turned his route into Judea and
beyond expectations was received with joy by the entire people for the
extraordinary success of the things done. Whereby the calm born of the warring
bestowed the beginning of sickness, affected to some degree by repeated bouts of
the quartan fever, the ailment relieved for a short time, when he returns to his
military undertakings and observes no limits, stronger in mind than body, he
shattered all the vigor of his health and consumed his strength and therefore
died. Thus for twenty and six years with various outcomes of events against
countless commotions of wars he held the kingdom and he departed life with five
children surviving. Judging whom unequal to the governing of the kingdom he
consigned the supreme power to the care of his own wife, inasmuch as he
recognized her to be more acceptable to the people and to have found favor among
all for this reason, that she always thought to make herself apart from the
brutality of her husband, <B>[p. 18]</B> so that she not only fled the
partnership of his shameful acts, but even by opposing his unfairnesses she
turned the goodwill of the entire people upon herself. Nor was the decision of
her husband thoughtless. For the woman exercised the right of ruling without
stumbling without any hindrance of her feminine sex and acquired the thanks of
governing by the observation of the sacred law. For more attentive care is
exercised concerning the templum and ministers are dismissed for fraud, and the
power of the state increased. Nor was her love of the kingdom lessened by
maternal affection, indeed from two children one was selected for the appearance
of ruling, not for the power, Hyrcanus by name, the elder by birth, the lesser
in ability, but she soothed Aristobolus the sharper in mind, lacking experience
of power with the humbleness of a private citizen. The Pharisees attached
themselves to the woman a class of men trained according to the teaching of the
law, clever according to the nature of disposition, eager for jobs, desirous of
money. Who captivating the exalted little woman acquired her power by extolling
her, so that she committed to them most of the tasks of the kingdom, they
employed whom they wished, they excluded whom they wished and deprived of court
work. What more? They so insinuated themselves, that the fruits of all good
things came to them; the costs and annoyances afflicted the woman alone. Nor was
there a mediocre spirit in the woman, so that she dared great things and set out
battles beyond the condition of the feminine sex, she even prepared an
outstanding troop of her own forces and hired great forces of a foreign army, so
that she would not only be safe at home for every contingency of ruling, but
would truly be even formidable to external powers. She however excelled all the
rest, but as if inferior she was submissive to the Pharisees. <B>[p. 19]</B>
There was Diogenes in her kingdom who from the most powerful friends of
Alexander had clung to her close friendship. Having attacked they killed him
remembering that by his advice those eight hundred had been fixed a cross in the
middle of the city by Alexander, against the other originators also of this
outrage it was ordered that she should proceed for vengeance. And so they were
killed whom the Pharisees ordered, not whom the state found guilty of crime.
Many terrified by which fear to whom dangers of this type were held out and
especially those oustanding in wealth or position beseeched intervention from
Aristobolus, that he should bend his mother from the carrying of the too severe
order to milder things. He wishing to obtain favor for himself did not refuse.
She, although grudgingly, however yielded to the beseeching of her son, that in
view of the honors which they had born, who were indicted on a charge of this
type, the sentence of the supreme penalty would be softened and she would only
order those whom she believed to have been the guilty inciters in preparing this
crime to depart from the city. Who the security of life having been grasped
dispersed into the countryside. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C13"></A>XIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;At the same time it happened that the youth was directed to Damascus
for the reason that Ptolomaeus was wearing down the inhabitants of this renowned
city by frequent raids, the difficulties of which undertaking required a strong
military force from the army of Alexandra. Also Tigranes who was ruling over
Armenia had shut up Cleopatra by blockade in the city which has the name
Ptolomais. Alexandra soothed him with bribes that he should turn away from
herself. Whom Lucullus an attack having been made forced to return into the
lands of the Armenians with his goals not accomplished considering it more
prudent to look after his own lands rather than to annex those of others. And so
strained by such great tasks Alexandra fell into sickness. Which opportunity
Aristobolus seized to his advantage and a band having been collected, those
conspiring with him whom <B>[p. 20]</B> the heat of nature for daring anything
abrupt had joined to him wishing the same, he seizes treasuries and with their
resources intices volunteers for military service, and for a price arranges that
they should keep faith in everything that he wishes and he puts on the regalia
of kingship. Hyrcanus thrown into confusion of mind comes to their mother with
tears. But she breathing ferocity shut up the sons and wife of Aristobolus in
the fortress to which was at first the name called Baris afterwards Antonia,
about which we made mention previously. The undertakings of Alexandra are given
up with her early death. Hyrcanus advanced into the entire inheritance, who his
mother still living had put on the office of the priesthood, Aristobolus
excelled (him) in valor and wisdom, things were brought all the way to
contention and conflict. When it was composed, most, Hyrcanus having been
abandoned, followed him the second as better in war. Hyrcanus those accompanying
him who were remaining in the conflict fled into Antonia and the sons and wife
of Aristobolus having been discovered he found safety through hostages, because
Aristobolus decided upon an agreement lest anything harsh should be done against
his family. The agreement of the brothers was of this nature, that Hyrcanus
should withdraw from the kingship and all right of ruling should transfer to
Aristobolus but he would not however leave Hyrcanus without honors, but without
share in the kingship he would allow him to be engaged in other honors, which he
himself had bestowed. The agreement of this nature held the voluntary assent of
both with the sacred reverence of the temple. And so him having departed with
favor, wishing each other well in turn, Aristobolus took himself into the royal
court, Hyrcanus with equanimity departed into the home of Aristobolus.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C14"></A>XIV.</SPAN>&nbsp;But there were those whom fear from this change of things assaulted, who
recalled to mind themselves to have busied themselves against Aristobolus, and
in front of the rest Antipater. He was of the Idumaean race, <B>[p. 21]
</B>famous among them for his ancestors, not lacking money and therefore
possessing great influence, made by remarkable craft for disdaining money for
the sake of acquiring favor. When he persuaded Hyrcanus who was very frightened
by his advice, that he had no safe expectation of his safety, who had retired
from rule, unless he took counsel for himself by desertion to the enemy, he
insinuates to king Areta that the man should be cultivated by aid, who had been
tricked that he should retire from the royal power, this would be fitting for
the king, if he should become the judge of restoring the command, and it would
be much better, if he should order the things taken away to be restored to him
defrauded by cunning, to whom the birthrights of the kingdom belonged. The
former was crafty and sly and mistrusted by his neighbors, the latter was gentle
and peaceful, who would receive as a great kindness, whatever was bestowed upon
him by a foreigner, whom his brother had actually deprived of his right of
ruling. And so announcing to Hyrcanus the favor of king Areta that had been
prepared he brought hope of fleeing and pointed out the way, that with him he
should seek Petra located within the boundaries of Arabia, in which place they
would visit the king. Who convinced by the persuasions and gifts of Antipater
added a large troop of fighters to Hyrcanus so that he should be restored to his
kingdom. There were almost fifty thousand foot
soldiers and cavalry, defeated by which in the first encounter Aristobolus took
refuge in Jerusalem, there also defenseless against such a great multitude of
enemies, which would have captured him shut up, if Scaurus, the commander of the
Roman army on the excuse of another war which was being waged against Tigranes,
had not ended the siege having been sent by Pompey, for whom the avenging of
Mithridates retaken had fired up the plan of a severe war undertaken against the
father-in-law, for which reason he ordered Syria to be overrun by Scaurus, while
he himself pressed against Tigranes and Armenia. And therefore to Scaurus
arriving at Damascus, which Metullus and Lollius had completely overthrown,
<B>[p. 22]</B> the legates of the brothers ran each beseeching for himself the
aid of the Roman help, and although Aristobolus was inferior in strength, he
prevailed however through the gift of money. The decision of the battle
engagement is sold for three hundred talents and the justice of request is
counterbalanced by the price, which money having counted out to him Scaurus
orders Hyrcanus and the king of Arabia to depart from the siege, and if they
should remain they should know it would have to be fought by them in a war
against Pompey and the Romans. With that fear the siege is raised, Aretas set
out for Philadelphia, Scaurus returned to Damascus. But Aristobolus not long
satisfied with the danger having been averted collected a band, followed the
enemy and near Papyron, that is the name for the place, killed six thousand of
the enemies in a battle and at the same time Fallion the brother of Antipater.
The hopes of Hyrcanus and Antipater were broken, for whom all reliance was on
the forces of Arabia. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C15"></A>XV.</SPAN>&nbsp;But when Pompey the Great began to meet Syria and arrived at Damascus,
from the Romans, broken by whose aiding forces they had lost the victory, they
ask for help and approach Pompey as if (he were) the arbiter of justice and not
at all avaricious for money. And so with accusations, not with gifts such as
they had begun to rely upon previously, inasmuch as his mind untouched against
the corruption of money was not captured by the noose of avarice and without pay
was able to dislike the affront to a brother's dignity. And thus having assailed
him with these grievances, in which even envy by Aristobolus took part, that
undeservedly he invaded foreign places, and favor was won over to Hyrcanus, to
whom either from the merit of his life or judgement of his age the right of
ruling was fitting the authority of his mother especially supporting, who had
judgement of choosing and the right of bestowing. Nor was Aristobolus long
absent. <B>[p. 23]</B> Although he saw nothing in the heart of the Great
<SUP><FONT color=#0000ff>1</FONT> </SUP> which favored his tricks, he
presupposed however from the bribery of Scaurus and boasted himself in his
society. He came therefore outfitted in regal dress and with a greater retinue
and surrounded with more ostentation than customary, as some one who lacks
confidence in justice, who shut out prejudgment of assenting, denied the
expectation of obeying. But he was unable to endure longer the loftiness of the
Roman consular official, whose habit it was without a kingdom to command kings.
And so when he arrived at the city which has the name Diapolis, having disdained
from pride of kingdom the arrogance of Roman authority he departed elsewhere. By
which departure of Aristobolus a cause of intolerable offense was given to the
aroused consul to such degree that immediately the Roman arms were turned
against Judaea with many even auxiliaries of Syria conjoined. When Aristobolus
learned him to be near the city of Scythopolis and from there to be approaching
Coreas, from which there was the beginning of the possessions of Judaea, he took
refuge in the fortress Alexandrium which was exceedingly well fortified and
located on a high mountain. Having learned which Pompey orders him to come down;
but he considering it shameful as it were to obey the order of a master,
immoderate of mind thought undergoing danger preferable to complying with the
command. But seeing from above the Roman camp crowded with people, and at the
same time warned by his own people that they into whose name and power almost
the entire world had yielded should not be provoked, he came down, using many
excuses, by which he sought to show the kingdom to have been bestowed upon him
by right, or owed by the obligation of birth, or by the decision of the army,
which followed the stronger, abandoned the cowardly, or by the outcome of the
battle or by the agreement of a bargain, he returned to his fortifications.
Again when Hyrcanus approached the consul, called to judgement Aristobolus
presented himself, but when he saw recognition to be still put off he returned
to his fortress. <B>[p. 24]</B> For in the middle between hope and fear he
thought that by obeying his commands he might influence Pompey to favor toward
himself, but again he was not compelled by force to yield to his command, he
took himself back to Alexandrium. Nor did the cunning of the king pass by the
Great <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>; he orders him to withdraw from the
fortifications and required him instructions having been given to each guard of
the fortification to be about to do that. Indeed he obeyed the orders which he
did not dare to disobey, however he immediately removed himself to the walls of
Jerusalem and began to prepare war against the Romans. Pompey not only followed
him fleeing, he pressed him shut in and did not give any time for preparing the
facilities of war. A report about Mitridates directed the attention of Pompey,
that he (i.e., Mitridates) had ended the war with his death; the city of Jericho
was holding Pompey in its vicinity, when information of this notable event came,
the place near the city in which balsam is produced and is born of the trees
which the children of the farmers cut with sharp stones, and through these
incisions a beautiful fluid trickles down with dripping sap. From that place the
man a veteran of military service his ranks having been drawn up moved his camp
toward evening and at first light took a position before Jerusalem's walls and
without warning poured in his armed soldiers. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C16"></A>XVI.</SPAN>&nbsp;Aristobolus astonished by the appearance of the arrangement, by the
strength of the men, by the enthusiasm of the soldiers, voluntarily ran up
beseeching pardon, offering money, the city, and himself. With words <B>[p.
25]</B> changed supplicatingly into more yielding he softened the anger of the
consul; but with the supplication in vain, because the execution of his promise
was lacking, the money not only having been denied but Gabinio having been
excluded from the city, who had come seeking the things offered, he brooded on
war. For Pompey, guards having been assigned to Aristobolus, began to examine
the walls of the city and to explore carefully, in which places he should
attempt a forcible entry, but when he had examined the strength of the walls,
that they were not able to be stormed, and saw the temple in the city surrounded
by fortifications not at all inferior so that there was a double danger to those
who had entered both from the defenders of the temple and from those who were
looking after the defence of the walls, he hesitated with a doubt in his mind
and an uncertainty of opinion for some length of time, since suddenly an
uprising had arisen within the city, the allies of Hyrcanus wishing to receive
Pompey within the city, the champions of Aristobolus resisting: the former
wishing to open the gates to Pompey, the latter to bar them and make war lest
they might take away the king. But the weaker yielded to the majority whom fear
of the Roman power had increased and took themselves into the temple the bridge
having been broken down, which at the passable crossing in the middle joined the
city and the temple. And so the Roman army was received into the city, and with
their own hands the Jews opened the gates not much after that prophecy of David
for the future was fulfilled by the conquerors of the city and temple: god, the
nations have come into your inheritance, they have defiled your sacred temple.
And so he voluntarily surrendered his royal trappings, yielded to the courtiers.
To Piso, a man famous among his own and skilled in military services, was
entrusted the task that with a strong band he should take care for the royal
court and watch over the rest of the city. Which was looked after carefully by
him, as if he led the Roman army to defend those things rather than to seize
them. <B>[p. 26]</B> At the assault on the temple however, since it was
stubbornly resisted, Pompey prepared the Jews, namely the supporters of
Hyrcanus, that, if it was possible to be done, the Romans should not profane the
foreign mysteries, at the same time that the Jews should fill the ditches with
their own hands. With impious service and disgraceful servility they served
their hands on a basket, their minds on robbery of sacred property. But filling
the ditches profited nothing, since the partisans of Aristobolus resisted from
the walls and caused hindrance from above, and Pompey's beginnings would have
been ineffective, if not for the days of sacred religious rites occurring, on
which the ancient observation was for the Jews to refrain from all work, he
ordered his troops to concentrate on building up the ramparts of earth. In fact only the adoption contrary to custom of hand to
hand fighting even on the sabbath having been changed, if however battle
is brought in and extreme danger of safety is aimed at, Jews think it may be
contested by them with weapons, remaining contests they consider to conscience.
Already the wall had grown, already the siege engines had been brought near, the
royal forces were fighting fiercely from the height of the walls, they were
dejected by the nearer approach of Pompey. Pompey was astounded at the fierce
minds of the men, at the appearance and magnitude of the wall and the never
relaxed duties of the priests in the middle of the fury of war as if there were
profound peace; nothing of the solemnity of the sacrifices was lacking, among
the javelins of the fighters the bodies of the slain was poured out the blood of
sacrificial victims, a victim was placed upon the altars; placed before the
altar they were killed. Already the third month held the still doubtful contest.
First was Sylla Faustus, descended from Cornelius, and two centurions, of whom
one had the name Furius, to the second was Fabius, a tower of the walls having
been knocked down they broke into the temple <B>[p. 27]</B> a crowd following
each one, and going around the interior of the temple everywhere they transfixed
with swords whomever they discovered. Those fleeing were killed, others fighting
back were cut down, but however the ceremonies of the priests were not hindered
by the savageries of those fighting. The enemy was threatening with bare swords,
they however followed the order of the usual service. No class of service was
interrupted. Whatever pertained to the ritual of purification, whatever to the
observance of he sacred worship it could be seen was carried out; so great was
the responsibility of the office, and if only it had been in behalf of devotion
and faith. For the greater dangers arose from their own people, which were
brought in by the Hebrews by turns upon themselves, and the fight within was
more violent and closer to mutinous and a two front danger. From the front a
foreign enemy threatened, from the back and sides a domestic. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C17"></A>XVII.</SPAN>&nbsp;And therefore shut in on all sides some threw themselves over the
precipice, others were burned up in the flames of their country. The priests
however persevered in their duty all the way to the end encouraging themselves
in turn, that they should not place the obligations of the religion as lower in
importance than the preservation of personal safety, it would be done with
themselves properly if they were expended to their sense of duty, which was owed
to necessity, if it was allowed to be buried in the bosom of their country. For
what would it serve to escape and to live a survivor to the religion? A
distinguished deed rather to die together for a conscientious duty. But if
anyone should desert from fear of danger, it is sacrilege, if anyone should
fulfill his duty, the sacrifice it is a victory of dutiful suffering. And so the
head-banded priests were killed among their sacrificial victims and clothed in
their priestly robes lay on the ground among the bodies of those slain.
Scattered there were twelve thousand Jews, a few of the Romans were killed, many
wounded. The Jews groaned over nothing more painfully in this misery than that
<B>[p. 28]</B> the mysteries previously hidden of the sanctuary were uncovered
by the Gentiles and revealed. Finally Pompey declining the balance of cares of
this type, while he attended to the triumph rather than the burning, many of his
following him, saw the second tabernacle, which in a solemn approach was open to
the foremost of the priests alone, and within he saw the lamp and table and
vessels for incense and the records of the covenant, and above these the
heavenly choir, a great number of spices scattered about, and two thousand
talents of sacred money. In which although there was much gold, untouched
however by any greed of it or indeed if any of the sacred vessels were found, he
ordered everything left untouched, and on the day following the introduction he
ordered the temple overseers to purify the interior of the temple and to carry
out the usual sacrifices. Also he gave Hyrcanus the leadership of the
priesthood, having made use of his ready assistance in the difficult straits of
the siege; for although faithless to his own people, he was faithful to he
Romans so that his own country should be conquered --- but I think that no one
can be called faithful who has been faithless to his own people --- because not
perfunctorily in his own battle he gave assistance to the enemies of his own
people and because he withdrew the multitude of people outside the walls
supporting Aristobolus from his alliance. In all matters however by which
Aristobolus was hindered or his authority taken away or the war was quickly
finished Pompey was an outstanding commander, he added this splendid feature
that he observed moderation in victory; in fact he joined those whom he had
conquered to himself more with kindness than with fear, the originators only of
the war he struck with the axe. He imposed tribute also on the conquered, he
appointed the leader of Judaea, he set its boundaries. Judaea was circumscribed
within its own territory. He restored <B>[p. 29</B>]<B> </B>even Gamara which
the Jews had destroyed having been asked by Demetrius, who of his country had
asked from his patron a favor of this nature, excelling with Pompey in this
cause and many others above the norm of freedmen to the point of arousing
jealousy. Aristobolus however with his sons and father in law he held as
captives to take to Rome with him, but one of the royal offspring having escaped
from his guards on the journey returned home; his name was Alexander, his age
greater than his brother and two sisters. And so Antigonus younger in age and
his siblings of the feminine sex were taken to Rome, Pompey went to Cilicia and
from thence to Rome. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C18"></A>XVIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;While in Syria Scaurus, to whom the office of commander had been
assigned, those cities which the Jews had invaded having been recovered, inland
Scythopolis, Ipponis, Pella, Samaria, Iamnia, Maresa, Azoto, Arethusa, on the
coast also Gaza, Iope, Dora and that which was once called Strato's tower,
afterwards however was named Caesarea under the of Herod, who both added
decorations and changed the name, he undertook war against Arabia. Confining by
decree Judaea between the Euphrates and Egypt, Syria also restored within its
own boundaries, from the desire of plundering, as I think, rather than carrying
forward the interests of the empire, wishing to take possession of the great
Petra of the kingdom of Arabia, hindered indeed by the difficulty of its
location, he was unable to break in, he laid waste however many either
neighboring to the city or located at a distance. In which places famine struck
his tarrying army. And a wretched disaster would almost have happened, if
Hyrcanus through Antipater had not furnished food to the suffering Romans, and
likewise he with the counsel of Scaurus advised Aretas to end the war with
money. Finally with three hundred talents the Arab freed himself from his enemy,
<B>[p. 30]</B> he bought off Scaurus; this was the price of his retreat. Which
thing established for Hyrcanus an alliance with the Romans and maintained the
security of a profound peace, for which reason in territory hostile to the Roman
army by his aid from a severe lack of grain a sufficiency was made and help was
at hand. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C19"></A>XIX.</SPAN>&nbsp;But when Alexander having escaped from imprisonment by Pompey at first
secretly and in a moderate of time collecting to himself a suitable band of
soldiers, began to harass Judaea openly, Hyrcanus was disturbed and distrusted
his situation, he pressed the Romans with his concern that the war might
increase in violence, so that he had decided to repair the wall of Jerusalem,
which Pompey had destroyed. And the task had nearly been undertaken, if Gabinius
who had succeeded Scaurus, the remaining matters having been handled vigorously,
by which he had strewn fear of his name, had not considered that resistance must
be offered to the attempts of Alexander. Nor did Alexander think that he must
flee but dared to contest it in a battle with ten thousand foot soldiers and one
thousand five hundred cavalry. He even repaired the fortresses, Alexandrium,
Hyrcanium, Macheruntis as places of refuge for himself, if circumstances should
demand it, or would be a hindrance to enemies, for indeed near by Arabia was not
sufficiently faithful to the Romans. Gabinius so that this might happen more
quickly sent Marcus Antonius ahead with part of the army, so that the march of
the enemy might be hindered, until he himself should arrive with the entire
army. Antipater arriving with select troops and Malichus and Pitholaus relying
upon diverse groups of Jews, joined their forces with Antonius. Whom when
Alexander saw them massed together -- for Gabinius was now present -- he changed
his plan so that he fell back. But since he was now not far from Jerusalem,
<B>[p. 31]</B> forced to join battle, beaten he fled. Almost three thousand of
his men having been killed, the rest captured or dispersed, scarcely a few were
left to Alexander to be companions in flight rather than for the daring of
rebelling. Finally seeking peace from Gabinius he surrendered even the
fortresses to the Romans lest they hold something suspect. In that battle the
valor of Antonius shone forth brightly, and everywhere gave very clear evidence
of his bravery. Gabinius divided Judaea into five districts, in order to
diminish its strength, from which arose haughtiness to one who had gained
control of things. To Hyrcanus for the mildness of his temperament remained the
public office of the priesthood, the responsibility however of an entire
district of this region was bestowed by Gabinius not upon one but in common upon
inhabitants of Jerusalem. Similarly the rest of the districts were assigned in
like manner, through Gadara and Amathuntis and Hiericho and Sephoritanians,
namely the more powerful cities, divided, by which nothing of the power of of
the individual cities was left and the performance of the districts did not sway
to and fro, which anticipated public concern. Which was received with gratitude
both by the Romans for relieving the fear of rebellion and by the Jews for
removing jealousy, since the race of Hebrews lived not under a king but beneath
an aristocracy in a resemblance of the Roman state, in which not one governs,
but all the best in turn, to whom selected by lot the magistrate yields, they
direct without share of the kingdom but the judges of kings. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C20"></A>XX.</SPAN>&nbsp;Provident forethought as opposed to the turbulence of the people is
esteemed. But the escape of Aristobolus and his return into Judaea aroused much
commotion, many flowing back to him, whom he had stirred up by the favors of
long established friendship or the latest events, to which a remedy from the
public discord was being sought <B>[p. 32]</B> by those desiring to mix the
lowest with the highest and there were other lapsed hopes. Therefore having
returned he built fortifications, he began to restore Alexandrium. Which having
been discovered Gabinius, Sisinius and Antonius and Servilius having been sent
with part of the army, prevented the work begun. Even with the fortifications
deserted Aristobolus prepared himself for war, and because he dragged an army
with a greater number than was useful he removed a multitude of unarmed people,
and he collected only eight thousand armed men Pitholaus also having been added,
who had come voluntarily from Jerusalem with a thousand men. Thereupon a battle
having arisen -- for the Romans overhung their necks -- indeed it was fought
vigorously for a considerable time, however Roman strength prevailed, five
thousand Jews were killed, Aristobolus with a thousand men broke through the
line and took himself back into the protection of the fortress Macheruntis, two
thousand were dispersed elsewhere. The Romans however having attacked the
fortress were delayed almost two days, for in the last extreme Aristobolus
fought with all his strength, but by no means was able to hold out longer;
captured with his son Antigonus whom fleeing from prison he had taken away with
himself, sent to Gabinius and by him they were sent to Rome. Aristobolus having
placed in custody of the senate, he sent his sons to Bithynia, because they
report Gabinius to have insinuated in letters to the wife of Aristobolus a
promise of rewarding her assiduity in thanks for the fortresses surrendered to
him. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C21"></A>XXI.</SPAN>&nbsp;These things having been done in Judaea Gabinius having believed that a
bold action must be taken prepared an expedition against the Parthians, but
suspicions of the faction of king Ptolomaeus recalled the army which had set
out. So Gabinius turned back his march from the Euphrates into Egypt, making use
<B>[p. 33]</B> of the necessities for everything from the services of Antipater
and Hyrcanus, but of Hyrcanus through Antipater, who aided the army also with
money grain arms auxiliaries; and especially at the encounters near Pelusium,
unless for the Jews familiar with the location and and the type of the entire
war they would have easily discouraged Gabinius. But the army delaying again
Alexander the son of Aristobolus undertook to plunge himself into a second Syria
as if into an empty province, unless Gabinius aroused by the news had hastened
his return and having sent Antipater ahead had called back most of the Jews from
their alliance to Alexander, relying upon a multitude of whom he was preparing
to give to destruction all in the region which had offended the Romans. In the
end, although most of the Jews had dispersed through an agreement with
Antipater, he had not however put aside his recklessness, having undertaken a
battle with thirty thousand men near the mountain Itabirium, ten thousand having
been lost he fled. The war was ended by the scattering of the rest. The task of
the Jerusalem state having been assigned to the judgment of Antipater having
departed from there he subjugated the Nabathaeans in a battle and sent back
Mitridates and Orsanis fleeing secretly from Persis, he publicly informed his
soldiers however that they had escaped by flight. Crassus succeeded Gabinius and
about to set out for the Parthian war he stole all the gold which was in the
temple at Jerusalem and besides he ordered the two thousand talents to be taken,
which Pompey had left untouched, nor did he long enjoy it when he crossed the
Euphrates, he lost the army and was himself killed. The elated Parthians
believed they must go over into Syria, <B>[p. 34]</B> whom Cassius followed
vigorously with ambushes and drove from the boundaries of the province committed
to him, not without severe damage to the enemy, marching freely, because they
thought no one about to dare to take a stand against him, he had seized those
outstripped in the narrower places. Finally many of their troops having been
routed they abandoned the war. Cassius the enemy having been driven back secure
in his province charged into Judaea and Tarichaeae having been destroyed he sold
thirty thousand Jews into slavery. He also ordered Pitholaus suspected of
treachery by which he was supporting the faction of Aristobolus to be executed.
Nor was Antipater without his advice, that he should as much as possible exclude
any rival for power. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C22"></A>XXII.</SPAN>&nbsp;He recognized a wife who had the name Cypris who sprang from a
glittering place among the women of Arabia and from her he received four
children of the male sex and one feminine. The names to the males of this
fashion, they were called, the first Phasaelus, the following Herodes, the third
Josephus, the fourth Feroras, and the daughter Salome. And for this reason a man
made eminent for obtaining the society of the powerful by gifts and friendship,
he won over beyond the rest for himself the favor of the king of Arabia, because
he held out the bond of a wife received from the region of Arabia. Finally
preparing to fight in battle against Aristobolus he sent his sons to the
aforementioned king of Arabia as pledges of mutual affection. Whom he received
as a sacrosanct trust in that care in which he held his children at home and
afterwards recalled he returned to their father. But when Aristobolus overcome
in war was being held in chains, Alexander his son when in accordance with the
conventions of peace, to which Cassius about to return to the Euphrates had
obligated him, left off from battle, <B>[P. 35]</B> the boundaries of Persis
were not at all molested by any incursion undertaken by the Parthians and the
appearance of pleasant tranquility lightened human concerns in the regions of
the East, Caesar from the transalpine regions of Gaul pouring himself into Italy
drove Pompey and the senate beyond the Ionian sea. Pompey shut out from Italy
sought Enathias and ordered the Roman columns from diverse places to follow him
there, because he was preparing for war there. Intent on doing which things he
left Aristobolus fettered at Rome. Caesar who was midway between the city of
Rome and Pompey, because he was following Pompey on the easy routes from the
Flaminia into Appia, so that he should either capture him or intercept his army,
directed him <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> freed from chains with a number
of military forces assigned into Syria, so that he should join Judaea to himself
and threaten Pompey from the rear. But in the beginning of his attempts, when he
came to the place, done away with by poison he left the task unfinished. The
opinion of his death was ascribed to the supporters of Pompey. And so the
arrangements of Caesar were mocked and the ambitions of Aristobolus abandoned by
a certain new variety of changes, so that the exile would have been safer among
the enemy, a captive in chains, than master in a chamber among his own citizens,
a king at a banquet. Which having been learned Pompey, because Aristobolus in
the falling back Judaea tried to renew the war for himself, indeed ordered his
son Alexander suspected of being too favorable to the Caesarian faction to be
executed. He ordered Scipio. He on behalf of the seat of judgment decided his
guilt, so that the appearance of a trial should be put forth accusers also
having been brought in and against him who had disturbed the Roman state with
arms the sentence was brought forth,<B> [p. 36]</B> that in accordance with the
authority of law rather by the execution of an order, in the manner in which the
leaders of enemies, convicted of rebellion he was sentenced to be struck with an
axe. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C23"></A>XXIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;The death of both having been learned Ptolomaeus, who had taken the
brothers of Aristobolus and the wife Alexandria, sent his son Philippion to the
city Ascalona, to fetch those mentioned. He arriving took Antigonus and his
sisters that he should escort them to his father; by the practice and custom of
love a little spark pardonable certainly crept into the youth, if monarchs know
to forgive, and he received the second of the sisters to himself in the bonds of
marriage. His father Ptolomaeus did not tolerate this and the excellent censor
of morals having killed his son united his own daughter-in-law to himself, who
condemned the unasked joining to his son, so that he might defile his own self
with parricide and incest. Pompey having been killed, who while he fled the arms
of Caesar offered his head to an Egyptian eunuch to be cut off, an upheaval of
things. He offered his head however with that patience with which he had so many
times graced victory over great peoples, so that seeing in that fate the
condition of a defeated exile, a mockery of the fluctuations of human fortunes,
he offered his neck to the sword, from him to whom he had given a kingdom about
to receive death as a favor. After whose death a change was made many from the
familiars of Pompey seeking the friendship of Caesar and especially Antipater
possessed in an incredible manner of the friendship of all whom he aimed at. For
to all a wealth of necessities and especially in the instruments of battle,
whereby from enemies and adversaries the most dear are repeatedly made. <B>[p.
37]</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C24"></A>XXIV.</SPAN>&nbsp;</B>And indeed because Ptolomaeus the king of Egypt had broken faith,
he was pressed hard by Caesar himself in very severe battles. Mithridates of
Pergamum with all the troops which he had brought with him, repulsed by the
obstacle of Pelusius, stayed in the city of Ascalon the passage having been
despaired of and the attempt ineffective, nor did he yet dare to commit himself
to battle in an unfavorable place and unequal in strength. To whom in aid
Antipater at first associated Arabia, then led with himself three thousand Jews
strong in numbers and armed with weapons. Now too he moved the powerful of Syria
to the support of himself, and the Ptolemy who lived in Libanus and Iamblicus
and a second Ptolemy, relying on whose alliance even other peoples were fired up
to the war. Relying on whom joined to his forces Mithridates approached Pelusius
and, when he was prevented from passage, started a siege. In which place
Antipater gave outstanding evidence of military prowess, in fact with the
townspeople resisting, when it was being fought with great force on both sides,
he was the first with his men a part of the walls having been shattered, in
which he himself was fighting, he rushed into the city and captured it. Nor was
this the end of his labor and assistance, for even when the army had proceeded
within, and around that which is named the region of Onia of Judaea the
Egyptians wished to resist, by which they blocked the way, Antipater not only
stopped the battle but even brought about for aiding the army that those things
which were essential for the enjoyment of human nature were furnished by the
very people who had prepared the weapons against them. Whence the people of
Memphis <B>[p. 38]</B> also recalled their minds from the battle and willingly
gave themselves to the alliance of Mithridates. Who having gone past the more
mistrusted, having judged that it must be fought hand to hand with the remaining
Egyptians, indeed in more unimpeded places but with the stronger men of the
region itself, whose non-resident Jews were called an army, he fought vigorously
to such a point that he gave himself to a sudden danger and was almost killed,
except that Antipater seeing the entire right wing in which Mithridates was to
be hard pressed by the enemy, and in another part to be shut in by a river, nor
was there any way of escape for the men, he rushed in from the left wing upon
those who were attacking the withdrawing Mithridates; he pursued those there
until all the people of the enemy were killed. In that battle Antipater lost
only eighty men of his forces, Mithridates above eight hundred, so that beyond
expectation he himself escaped. And this slaughter followed in a moment.
Antipater many wounds having been received by his body found excellent testimony
of his bravery before Caesar, Mithridates especially not only an espouser of his
perfection but even a proclaimer of his bravery. Exceptionally pleased by which
Caesar in honor, as was fitting, received Antipater among his friends. Then when
he arranged those things which were being set up in Egypt and proceeded into
Syria, he honors him with the esteem of the Roman state, he conferred also
freedom from taxes and other things as he bestowed pledges of his favor to a man
proven to him. Now too he confirmed willingly to Hyrcanus the high priesthood in
accordance with the desire of Antipater. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C25"></A>XXV.</SPAN>&nbsp;Antigonus also ran to meet Caesar in Syria, and who it was fitting
either to weep the calamity of his father, <B>[p. 39]</B> killed with poison by
the friends of Pompey, or the punishment of his brother, whom Scipio with great
cruelty as if guilty had executed with the axe, pursued the side of dislike
rather than of grief, so that he brooded over Hyrcanus and Antipater to
foreigners, the things which had been taken from himself and his brothers
through wickedness, he piled up with the bitterest complaint, himself made an
exile from his ancestral home, the land in which he was born to be denied to
him, however his own injuries to be seen as more tolerable, much worse those by
which the entire nation of the people of the Jews was afflicted by Hyrcanus and
Antipater. And them to claim thanks for the things done well in Egypt, when not
any care based on goodwill toward Caesar bestowed that service of aiding
Mithridates, since fear from the knowledge of their Pompeian alliance extorted
it, so that it was for disguising the offense. Against these things Antipater
offering not an exchange of words but a demonstration of facts cut his garments
to pieces and stripped of clothing, full of wounds with cloak torn open
pesenting to the eyes of those standing around the proofs of the observed
bravery: "look at this," he said, "their testimony refutes the charge of
ill-will toward Caesar, which glitter like lights of the soul. The scars I
present to you, Caesar, pledges of my inward good will, I put down these pledges
of my faith and I bear them written on the top of my heart. If it is not
believed by the citizens, let the enemy be questioned for whom I received these
wounds. What did they establish in me other than the faith which I am offering
to you? But he charges against me the good will to Pompey; I confess, Caesar, me
to have been friend not to the man but to the Roman name and to have desired
that eagerly, so that my duties <B>[p. 40]</B> threatened your state. And so I
fought not for one but for all; Pompey was dear to me, but he began to be a
friend to me before he was an enemy to Caesar. He was your son in law and you
his father in law. When he was in the regions of Judaea I supported him the
Roman commander, I did not however receive those wounds for him which I have
received for you. For you I have paid pledges of death and the blows of weapons
of the enemy. What is strange then, if a captive does not know the honor of
wounds and a fugitive does not know the faith which exists? What moreover may a
lasting enemy throw in my face except for your friendship? It truly seems
strange that Antigonus approaches someone blamed the Romans, whom he is
accustomed to attack, and before them complains that he has been deprived of
rule, whose use and practice he desired not for power for himself nor for
domestic honor but for provoking Roman arms and avenging the deaths if his
father and brother; ungrateful for safety, he does not fear the Roman tribunal
but dares to attack it further, although he knows in this affair his brother to
have paid the price for his rebellion." When Antipater made an end of speaking,
Caesar announces Hyrcanus seems more worthy of the high priesthood, however he
bestowed on Antipater his choice of office. Then he desiring that same choice of
public office and the governorship and placing a measure of esteen in him who is
bestowing the office, quite cunningly gave the distinction of modesty and the
increase in power. He was made the procurator of all Judaea. Reasonably he asked
that he might rebuild the walls of Judaea which had been destroyed in the war,
and secure in the loyalty given he asked and procured this great task. And these
things, as was the custom for Roman commanders, was inscribed in the Capitol,
which marks of honor Caesar judged should be conferred on Antipater, so that
proofs of his uprightness and merits should exist also for the examination of a
man of posterity. Moreover Antipater having followed Caesar <B>[p. 41] </B>out
of Syria changed his route into Judaea and first rebuilt to its former condition
the wall which Pompey had destroyed. Then he checked the commotion bringing
together all with affection of a parent, now with admonitions to the gentler,
now with threats that they should consider that those things must be followed
which were of peace rather than of war and not irritate the mind of the king,
who if he remained unoffended would be better for the citizen, if he were
aroused, would present a tyrant. Even if by nature Hyrcanus was mild, they
should however beware and not provoke him by insulting behavior; also his desire
to be that he should adopt a middle path in behalf of an affectionate concern,
not in behalf of power, but if they should try to make a new rebellion, the
spirit of punishing would not be lacking to him. They should experience the
friendship of the Romans rather than their domination. To whom if there should
be doubt that they were about to erupt from friends into arms, if they should
learn that him to whom they themselves had confirmed the kingdom was deprived of
rule? Because as soon as he had learned Hyrcanus to have been too slow from
mildness of temperament at executing the requirements of public office, he
thought the care of protecting the region must be divided among his sons,
because he was unequal to such a great burden and to ruling. And therefore he
appointed Phasaelus the older of his children the protector of Jerusalem and the
commander of the military forces. Herod also younger by birth and quite young he
put in charge of Galilaea with equal honor. Who when he attained power, more
sagacious by nature immediately found means from his natural capacity for
attending to the tasks.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C26"></A>XXVI.</SPAN>&nbsp;Syria was suffering from incursions of the brigand Ezechia, with which
he the leader of a predatory band harassed the entire province and was present
bitterly hostile in all places. Whom having seized he ordered to be executed and
<B>[p. 42]</B> killed many of the robbers. Which produced both great glory of
bravery and abundant gratitude among the Syrians. Whence he was celebrated in
the cities and villages by the voices of people singing, as one who had restored
peace and public tranquility after a long time. This talk with the favorable
gossip of the people aroused the affectionate rivalry of praise of his brother,
that Phasaelus equaled his junior by birth, whom he was not able to equal in
bravery, in benevolence of mind, the most outstanding having been attracted into
the rank of the foremost by benevolence, who tempered severity with kindness.
Whence the greatest honor was bestowed publicly upon Antipater as the parent, he
himself however changed nothing of his benevolence and faith, by which he was
accustomed to treat Hyrcanus. But it is difficult to be without jealousy in
triumphal circumstances. Finally the at first silent Hyrcanus criticized
carpingly the praises of the young men, more vehemently however those things
irritated him which were reported done famously in the campaigns of Herod, whom
he saw to have gone beyond the laws of the Jews and the manner of a private
citizen, that he had claimed all power for himself with his brother and father
and they were stripping the king of every public office, to whom nothing but the
name remained, because devoid of power he proffered a hollow appearance. Finally
without him being consulted many had been given to death and killed without
royal mandates, which the law of the fathers did not allow. From which many were
saying it was necessary that Herod be called into court, that he should give the
reason, by which favor, he had violated the law, which forbad that those unheard
be given to death; Hyrcanus ought to rise up and from this put to the test,
whether Herod was conducting himself as a king or a private citizen. Who called
into judgement if he were not present, it would be evident to what by his great
arrogance he had aspired. By these and <B>[p. 43]</B> words of this type of the
royal courtiers Hyrcanus was by degrees inflamed, who uttered the nearer shame
of faintheartedness, that he had retired from the duty of royal tasks, power to
have been transferred to Antipater and his children, whom the diminished power
to him of ruling had made masters. Aroused by which he decided that in his
judgement Herod had not been at fault, he would be cleared of the usurpations
against the law which were being charged. Herod nevertheless was resentful that
he had been called into judgement, however either from the admonitions of his
father or from calmer judgement he approached the fortifying of Galilaea
undertaken beforehand, but however it did not seem that with an invidious troop
war should be threatened or that he should bring forth safety for an unprotected
garrison. He was the support of Sextus Caesar wishing favor himself, who fearing
that something of treachery was being invited for the youth had ordered Hyrcanus
with strict orders that he should consider refraining from the danger of an
oppressive sentence. Whence he granted Sextus more an acquittal of the judgement
than to his wish, although Hyrcanus, although he had ceased from making charges
that he should call him into court, wishing however that he should acquit, since
he preferred to protect Herod rather than take vengeance on him. But the latter
with youthful passion grieving the offense, ungrateful for the absolution
proceeded to Sextus the desire having put forward, that if he should be called
again he would not obey, and he gave those disparaging him the opportunity of
making charges. Although Hyrcanus did not rise up for vengeance, when he saw him
superior, from the recollection however of injury, which is fed by the
retracting, Herod angered an army having been collected was making for
Jerusalem, that he should destroy every power of Hyrcanus, and he almost
accomplished it, except that checked by his brother and father his attack
weakened to them asking, so that he thought it enough to have risen up and he
placed a limit with his threat of vengeance, he abstained however from the
destruction of the commander, under whom <B>[p. 44]</B> he had achieved a not
inconsiderable influence, so that he had secured great power. Indeed he seemed
injured because he was called into judgement, but again he was treated with
favor because he was absolved. It would be too unfeeling if he should follow up
the injury and be ungrateful for his safety. The outcome of wars to be dubious
and doubtful, grave also the burden of spite, when he should make war on his
commander and on him, who had favored him with paternal affection, very
frequently assisted him, never injured him, except when using wicked advisers he
had aroused a shade of unfairness for him, by which he considered himself
injured. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C27"></A>XXVII.</SPAN>&nbsp;With these and other things he broke off the juvenile attack and the
civil war was removed from Judaea, but transferred to the slaughter of the
Romans, in fact Sextus Caesar was killed through treachery by Caecilius Bassus,
and afterwards Julius Caesar having discharged uninterrupted power for three
years and seven months, because he had gone beyond the condition of a private
citizen, paid the most severe penalty in the senate to Cassius and Brutus the
proposers. Whence men having been collected when the adoptive Julius determined
to go avenging the death of his father Antonius having been joined to him,
because aid having been sent Herod was judged to have aided the greatest faction
of the war, command over all of Syria was given to him ruling. Which thing for
Antipater was the cause of his fatal death.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C28"></A>XXVIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;For Malichus fearing the power of Antipater, which was heaped up by
the valor of Herod, one of the royal ministers having been suborned, prepared
poison for Antipater. Which having been drunk after a banquetAntipater
immediately died his innate quality energetic among the rest and especially
vigorous in seeking and establishing the rule of Hyrcanus. Herod felt the death
of his father deeply <B>[p. 45]</B> and with army aroused he promised an
avenger, but called back by the counsel of his brother, lest Judaea be disturbed
violently by a civil war between Herod and Malichus, Malichus prepared for
denial and especially dissembling that he was an accessory to the death of
Antipater, he was easily led into another form of vengeance, so that
satisfaction having accepted, that Antipater had died through no deceit of
Malichus, Herod called Hyrcanus and Malichus to a dinner. And from the sentence
of Cassius who had even ordered by his own direction that task for accomplishing
vengeance, prepared centurions and prepositioned Roman armies met Hyrcanus and
Malichus arriving together on the shore and with drawn swords surrounded each of
them; however they butchered only Malichus pierced with many wounds and torn
apart in a final death. Overcome with that terror Hyrcanus lost consciousness
and having lost all vigor of mind and body collapsed; after a bit however when
he recovered himself, Herod having been asked who had ordered Malichus to be
killed, when he learned from the prepositioned troops he had been killed by
order of Cassius the Roman commander, he responded immediately: "therefore
Cassius was the savior of both me and my country, who killed the ambusher of
both." But that Hyrcanus said this either from fear or that he he felt thus, is
not at all clearly evident nor is able to be defined in our judgement. Elichus
had risen up, who from fraternal kinship had desired the death of Malichus to be
avenged, but because he did not dare to provoke Herod, he thought to strike his
brother Phasaelus. Which having been learned Herod desiring to move himself was
held back by sickness of body. Elichus in the meantime had seized certain
fortresses and especially Masada a garrison having been placed there. But when
the vigor of health returned to Herod, he recovered all and sent Elichus himself
beseeching from the fortress Masada. Antigonus the son of Aristobolus,
Ptolomaeus his father in law supporting him, <B>[p. 46]</B> whom Herod put to
flight in battle, and Antigonus having been thrown out from Jerusalem, Herod
returned the victor.</P>
<P>Furthermore there was great happiness from the fresh victory and especially
from the new association. For at first Dosis his wife had adhered to him, from
whom he received a son Antipater; afterwards he joined physically to himself in
a second marriage Miriamme born to Alexander the son of Aristobolus, nearest to
Hyrcanus and on account of that provided with royal rank. He did not however
escape dislike, because he aspired to the kingdom seized to go to Hyrcanus. For
when in the Macedoniam war Caesar and Antonius crushed Cassius and the
supporters of Brutus and as victors the one hastened to return into Italy, the
other believed he must hurry into Syria, many embassies flocking together to
meet Antonius and those who were the more important of the Jews proceeded into
Bithynia accusing Herod and his brother Phasaelus, for the reason that they the
rule over all the state having been taken possession of by force had left the
name only to Hyrcanus for a show of honor. But the presence of Herod prevailed
and the gratitude, who with a not inconsiderable amount of money but with rich
gifts had bound the mind of Antonius to himself. Whence weakened by no speech he
removed from Antonius the dislike against himself of the simple mission. Again
almost a hundred men of the Jews went all the way to Antioch to accuse with no
less spirit, near Daphne they met Antonius now completely surrendered to his
infatuation with Cleopatra and serving his passion. There they began to charge
the intolerable power of the brothers. Messala countered in reply with Hyrcano
attending and he refuted the arrogance of the people, who having been stirred up
by a faction of a few, had disparaged their own people, who were asking
foreigners (for support) <B>[p. 47]</B> and contriving the injury of Hyrcanus,
although Hyrcanus had preferred what was best for the citizens. And so the
charges of the factions having been heard Antonius asked Hyrcanus whom he
considered to be most suitable. Whose affection for Herod and his brother being
consistent, the responses harmonized with his wish, greatly pleased, because he
was joined to the brothers by the bond of parternal hospitality, since Antipater
received him arriving in Judaea with Gabinius very graciously with hospitality
and took care of him with many kindnesses, he appointed Herod and Phasaelus
tetrarchs and ordered them to conduct the management of all of Judaea. From this
also the number of those making complaints was multiplied; for although he
received others of the legates with confinement, he treated others with abuse,
however afterwards a thousand delegates having been ordered to proceed to
Antonius spending time in the city of Tyre a rebellion having been raised in
Jerusalem, he did not neglect the will of the citizens. And since he was
violently enraged against those shouting in protest, the governor of the Tyrians
was sent to those daring to cry out, who seized those guilty of arrogance,
although as if himself even Herod and Hyrcanus were seeking, lest they should
beget the most severe punishments for themselves and disturbances of their
country and causes for wars. When nothing was accomplished and all began to be
embroiled in an irrational struggle, Antonius sent armed men, by whom some were
killed, many gravely wounded, from Hyrcanus however the dead received the favor
of burial or those who were able to escape of medical care, he gave an occasion
of twofold kindness, by which his benevolence toward the citizens was made
evident. The rest who had not only fled so angered Antonius by stirring up the
city, that even again those whom he was holding in chains he ordered the supreme
punishment. <B>[p. 48]</B> </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C29"></A>XXIX.</SPAN>&nbsp;Arrogance had yielded to harshness, but during almost two years the
army of the Parthians had poured itself into Syria Pacorus the son of the king
and Barzafranis a satrap of the Persians leading the barbarian army. Whom
Lysanias the son of Ptolomaeus approached as instigator. His father having died
who had the name Mennius, now deprived of rule, through the satrap mentioned he
incited Pacorus a thousand talents of silver and five hundred women having been
promised, that he should give the kingdom to Antigonus, he should take the
highpriesthood from Hyrcanus. Pacorus gave part of the cavalry to a royal
minister, inasmuch as he himself was detained by rebellions inside Syria, that
he should cross into Judaea and manage things for Antigonus, that he might help
his spirit. But this also had gone forward very little, unless the Jews fighting
against themselves, Herod and Phasaelus opposed to Antigonus, from a way of
thinking it had been proposed to Antigonus, that they should accept Pacorus as a
mediator of peace. Which Phasaelus from levity of character, Herod objecting,
approved in time, presently having experienced danger to himself, he recognized
the barbarians by their nature to be treacherous. For sent to Barzafranis (who
was) the mediator of peace and having set out with Hyrcanus he met the satrap
concealing quite cunningly an ambush with the appearance of friendliness. In the
end he gave gifts to those departing and he arranged in what way they were to be
surrounded by his dispositions. They followed them more for the sake of
confining them than as companions in dangers. Messages were delivered that
Parthia had been bought with a thousand talents for the destruction of those
mentioned. Ofellius also persuaded flight, because he had learned from Saramalla
the richest of the Syrians that a party had been prepared for them. But not even
thus was Phasaelus induced Hyrcanus having been abandoned to take counsel for
himself, in truth he assailed the satrap <B>[p. 49]</B> with the most biting
insults, that he betrayed a trust for money, that he considered money of greater
value than justice, that he himself would give more for his safety than
Antigonus would pay for the kingdom. But the Persian struggled to justify for
himself with a false oath the trust which he had betrayed and to avert suspicion
not much after he had completed the treachery. For that having been accomplished
they carried away with curses Phasaelus and Hyrcanus to Pacorus, to whom they
had given this task, when they were by now unable to accomplish the other,
desiring false oaths of the barbarians and the treachery of betrayal to achieve
vengeance. No small amount of wine had the accomplice sent into Judaea expended
with his treacheries that he might capture Herod, but great concern for taking
precautions had already exercised the latter suspecting for a long time the
treacheries of the barbarians, he held himself within the fortifications. Nor
did he think he should commit himself to go outside the walls and to talks with
the enemy, orders having been counterfeited by Pacorus, with which as from
Phasaelus he came with his arrogance to the brother. It having been learned that
his brother and Hyrcanus were being held, he sent his troops ahead by night into
Idumaea and he himself with servants routed the pursuing barbarians. Many having
been killed he took himself hastily into Masada, having been tested more
seriously than by the Parthians by the Jews, who had fallen upon him fleeing,
and indeed he placed his troops within the fortifications having avenged himself
upon those pursuing. He himself however a garrison having been left, which was a
protection for his mother and younger brothers, hastened into the Arabian Petra.
The Persians poured themselves into Jerusalem breaking into the homes of those
fleeing. Everything was rurned into plunder war disturbance. And there the
injustice went forward, the kingdom was awarded to Antigonus, Phasaelus and
Hyrcanus were placed in his power for undergoing <B>[p. 50] </B>whatever might
please him. He however was not able to restrain himself longer, but immediately
an attack having been made upon Hyrcanus cut off his ears with his own teeth,
lest at any time by a change of circumstances a return to the high priesthood
might stand open for him. For it is necessary that the high priest be physically
perfect, nor is it allowed through law to make a bid, that anyone with a
mutilated body should hold the highest office of the priesthood. Phasaelus with
swiftness avoided the disgrace of the death decreed for him, his head having
been dashed against the rocks which by chance they had come upon, disdaining to
be saved for mockery or to die by the order of a foreigner, who was able able
although with bound hands and a sword denied to find an exit from life. There
was nevertheless yet another report of this type, that Antigonus brought in a
doctor for the wound, by whom poisons were poured upon the wound as if
medications. Whichever of these his death had the defiant spirit of leaders. He
is reported to have said in addition in his last moments when he was already
breathing out his spirit, it having been learned that Herod was alive and had
escaped by flight the prepared treachery, he died with thanks, who left behind a
survivor, who would return vengeance for him. For Herod hastened in Arabia
expecting that he would receive money with which alone he believed he would be
able to influence the barbarian greed, that he would ransom the captivity of his
brother and if he found the Arab either unmindful of his father's goodwill or
holding fast against returning gifts, if he should demand money in return as the
price of the ransom, for which he would pledge the son of the man to be
ransomed, whom making use of the seven year old boy he had brought to them with
himself. But this effort of pious brotherhood was forestalled <B>[p. 51]</B> by
the death of Phasaelus and Herod was carefully pursuing his desire of a
brotherly gift. Before however he had learned about the death of his brother, he
met with Bocchus the foreign king of Arabia, whom he believed to be a friend.
But he had changed his loyalty with time and he forbad Herod already approaching
the boundaries of Arabia to enter, by prearrangement what had been insinuated to
him by the messengers of the Parthians, that he should not consider receiving
his fugitive into the kingdom of Arabia and beget for himself the cause of a
painful war. Offended by which Herod immediately turned back, which the
resentment of a justified agitation had brought forth, and from there he turned
into Egypt. Presently however it repented Bocchus of the violated friendship
those having been sent by whom he would be called back, Herod had outstripped
them. To whom having entered the territory, which the Rinocorians inhabit, and
(having learned) about the death of his brother and the captivity of Hyrcanus,
who under chains had been led into Parthia, a great source of grief and made
known by true evidence, such a great deposit of anxieties, that he prepared for
flight rather than for war. Finally he hastened to Alexandria with the utmost
zeal, and there was received with honor by Cleopatria, because she thought that
a man of such a great name should be sought as the leader of their military
forces by her party. From where the petitions of the queen having been put
behind him he sailed for Rome the disturbances in Italy having been learned of
and considering the storms of winter of lesser importance, than those more
serious waves he shuddered at with every shipwreck in the fleet of Cleopatria.
Finally having set out he fell into danger near Pamphilia from unexpected gusts
of wind, but he escaped however and his ship having been replaced he arrived at
Brundisium first and from there at Rome. There with the prerogative of paternal
friendship he approached Antonius and his own afflictions and those of family
relatives having been lamented, by which they had been placed under siege, he
came to Rome beseeching, <B>[p. 52]</B> he influenced Antonius by the miseries
received from such a great change of circumstances, because a powerful king for
a long time and who had very often borne the task of the Roman state, suddenly
as one shipwrecked and needing all things and destitute of help his people
having been placed in peril he implores suppliantly, who had exchanged his seat
for exile. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C30"></A>XXX.</SPAN>&nbsp;In which although Antonius was favorably influenced by the gratitude,
which had been in him with his father Antipater, and especially because likewise
making him tetrarch had left him predetermined for rule, Caesar however more
extravagant in natural benevolence held the military service of Antipater in
Egypt borne in all the battles of his father Caesar and the hospitable
fellowship as more valued with renewed pledges of favor. He mistrusted however
the character full of cunning of the king, perversely intent not on fairness and
goodness but on the advantages of his activities. The opportunity having been
given of addressing the senate, before which Messala and Atratinus detailing the
good deeds of the father, also the services of Herod himself for the Roman
state, it was resolved by the authority of the fathers that the rule of Herod
seemed advantageous for the Roman empire, that with Antonius joining in it was
advantageous that in the war being waged against the Parthians the alliance of
the celebrated king be joined to the Romans. The senate having been dismissed
Caesar and Antonius and Herod coming out from the senate house together are
escorted by the accompanying attendance of the magistrates, on the first day, on
which the kingdom had been bestowed upon Herod by the decree of the senate,
Antonius prepares a banquet and invites the king. At almost the same time Joseph
the brother of Herod from the lack of water had arranged a flight during the
night, but suddenly such a great force of rain poured upon the earth, that it
filled every reservoir of water. <B>[p. 53]</B> Therefore the flight having been
called off, which he was preparing to the Arab nation, he routed the forces of
the besieging Antigonus partly by ambushes partly by attack and open battle. But
generally with the departure of the enemy he kept himself in the fortress. And
now Herod unexpectedly arrived from Italy in the city of Ptolomais of Syria
having set out quickly by ship with a great troop of citizens and travelers he
was seeking Antigonus, Ventidius and Silon the commanders of the Roman military
forces meeting up with him, whom Antonius had ordered to be in attendance on the
arriving Herod. Dellius using them against the enemy as ordered by Antonius
although shuddering at the task, because Antigonus had turned each of them aside
for a price, with the appearance however of the nearest he had persuaded to come
together, accordingly Ventidius was delaying in the nearest cities for the
purpose of repressing the commotions of the Parthian war, Silon however
stationed inside Judaea in an open alliance with Antigonus was amassing money.
But however Herod did not lack assistance, to whom all had adhered except a few
of the Galilaeans, and because he had proposed that he should rescue his people
from the siege at Masada as soon as possible, he captured Joppa placed in the
middle by fighting, filled with a band of enemies, lest having progressed
further he should leave an enemy in his rear, and although Antigonus desired to
hinder his march, he took back Masada as an easy task and extracted his people
from danger. Next having set out for Jerusalem when he had accomplished
everything so that he had no necessity of fighting, asserting himself to be for
the citizens against the rebellion, to have undertaken the battle not against
his own people, harassed by the supporters of Antigonus with arrows and light
javelins from the wall he forced those shouting against him to flee. Nor would
there have been any delay of the victory, if <B>[p. 54]</B> Silon the commander
of the Roman troops had not suborned the soldiers, who from want had made
complaint and everything around the walls having been devastated they alleged in
excuse the difficulty of useful things and the meanness of provisions and
already the time was at hand when it was necessary for them to depart to winter
quarters, they threatened themselves about to break up the command, unless it
was assented to. And the rebellion would already have grown strong, if Herod
offering himself as mediator equally to the centurions and the soldiers had not
pleaded, that they should not forsake him, whom Caesar and Antonius and the
senate too had joined together in upholding, since especially it was promised
that nothing of advantage would be neglected. And the speech having been
completed having gone out into the region suddenly he caused an abundance of all
things to be made available to the army, so that no excuse was left for Silon.
And from that time the spirits of everyone having been raised with two thousand
foot soldiers and five hundred horsemen he recovered Iudumaea the army of the
Romans having been calmed already and stationed in winter quarters. The leader
of this achievement Joseph was chosen for a lighter task, lest he should think
something involving greater danger should be undertaken against Antigonus. He
himself however when he had stationed his family and supporters taken out of
Masada in Samaria, those fortifications and things which he believed would be of
advantage having been provided for, in the frozen winter and all places filled
with snow outstripping news of his approach having entered for refitting without
any battle into Sepphoris formerly called by this name, which was afterwards
called Diocaesaria, whom the winter frost and roads rough with ice had fatigued,
which he judged advantageous; for there were in that place great supplies of
foodstuffs. Where with his soldiers restored by food and their stationary
placement, he thought that battle must be undertaken against the brigands, who
overrunning the entire region <B>[p. 55]</B> ground down the inhabitants of the
places no less than a military incursion. Therefore at first he sent ahead a
certain part of the horsemen and foot soldiers against the village Arbela and he
himself with remainder of the troops was present forty days later. But however
the brigands were not frightened by the appearance of the army, but considering
that a charge must be made with arms, they displayed military discipline and the
recklessness of brigands. A clash having been held the left wing of Herod fell
back, but Herod quickly restored it and reinforcements having been added he
stationed his men, he overpowered them being overtaken and overcame their
attack. Who were unable to endure Herod fighting hand to hand, having pursued
those turning aside all the way to the Jordan he delivered them to death. All
the rest were scattered beyond the river, so that Galilaea was freed from all
fear of raids only those remaining, who hiding themselves in lairs and digging
in caves delayed the victory. There were however in the steep places of the
mountains, in the hollow dens of the rocks, presenting fearful appearances among
the sharp rocks impassable on all sides and impossible except by approach to the
inhabitants of the places, who by transverse paths and narrow stony tracks, by
which alone they were accustomed to be approached, they were safer by the
practice of danger being applied against danger. Blind within the recesses of
caves, in front of which a rock projecting as if from the ridge of the continent
all the way to the deep meeting of the waters removed hope of approaching the
position made hazardous on all sides, from the brow of the mountains by falling
waters and the ragged course of the rivers, so that the fall of the plunging
streams and the rock overhanging with deep gullies give more of terror. Finally
for a considerable time the king from uncertainty hesitated not discovering how
he should defeat nature, afterwards however having made use of a scheme of this
nature that a defence having been devised in the manner of boxes he shut in the
strongest whom <B>[p. 56]</B> armed he lowered with certain ropes to the very
mouths of the caves, who began easily to slaughter and to kill the unarmed and
with every relative and generation and if any dared to resist to burn them with
fire thrown in. There was no place for pity, moreover Herod wishing to rescue
many from death and to give trust in fleeing to himself turned them aside to a
greater extent, so that not one attached himself to Herod voluntarily and if any
were driven by force they preferred death to captivity. Finally one of the
elderly, whose seven sons and wife were present, for whose safety he was able to
take counsel, killed all of them in this manner, he himself stood in the
entrance ordering each one to come out and he killed the one of his sons
appearing. Herod catching sight of such a sad and miserable deed, weakened by
paternal bonds, held out his hand and asked with words, that he should spare his
children promising safety. But he was not at all influenced by these words and
having reviled the king killed his sons and wife above, the bodies of his sons
having been thrown down from on high at last he gave himself headlong to the
abyss. Terrified by these things Antigonus, because Herod had so easily overcome
the multitude of brigands and the difficulty of their locations, he indeed
refused his own presence, but turned himself against Ptolomaeus, whom Herod had
put in charge of a part of the army, and a man very suitable for the trick of
war through those, to whom it was the habit to disturb Galilaea, by a sudden
attack he forced Ptolomaeus to be killed. He killed also Joseph the brother of
Herod, his brother being occupied in other parts, actively fighting back with
Roman soldiers, who having been collected had advanced recklessly to his aid.
Not content with such a great triumph he added to the victory a painful insult
against the dead, that he was left with his head cut off, for which Ferora the
brother of the slain <B>[p. 57]</B> offered fifty talents but did not obtain it.
By which victory the enthusiasm of many inside Galilaea was again changed to
Antigonus, the tasks of war were renewed. Herod hastened to Antioch; there in a
sufficiently pleasant place which they name Daphnen he rested, when the news
having been received of the death of his brother lamenting for a brief while he
put aside the sorrow of his suffering, he prepared vengeance. Antigonus did not
receive his raging resentment, but hid himself within the fortifications. Herod
broke in, that he should take vengeance on the originators of such a heinous
crime, and easily routed the opposing army. There was a great slaughter of many,
the streets were obstructed by the bodies of the dead, so that he very roads
were filled with the corpses of the slain. The battle had been finished with all
routed by flight, if Herod had thought he should immediately direct his route to
Jerusalem. Antigonus threw away his spears, he feared the final punishment. All
were confused by fear so that, when Herod had been called from pursuing by the
severity of the winter and arms having put down he had entered the public baths
accompanied by one servant, three men ran to him with drawn swords, then many,
who had fled from the battle seeking hiding places. These alarmed by fear the
king having been seen crossed through and hastened to the exit of the baths, so
that they were able to escape, who were able to produce the death of the king
and end the war; finally there was no one who could seize those fleeing. From
which Herod concluding, how great a fear was in the enemy, devoted himself to
the battle and killed Pappus the leader of the opposing army and ordered his
head to be cut off, because his royal brother Joseph had been killed by him.
<B>[p. 58]</B> </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C31"></A>XXXI.</SPAN>&nbsp;Meanwhile Antigonus who had prepared for flight delayed; whom delaying
Herod besieged with the army poured around and gave attention to that part which
was before the temple, actually that part where Pompey had broken into the city.
However a great anticipation of victory was already upon the king. As with the
siege having been started he was distracted to receiving as wife the daughter of
Alexander and changing the trumpet call to a wedding celebration and mixing a
wedding with war; and having seized the opportunity of a union from the
occurrence of battle he turns back from the festival to war. Sossius came up
sent by Antonius for assistance to the king. And thus the men having been joined
since the Romans excelled in the practice of war and in military discipline and
were supported by the desire of pleasing the king, a forcible entry having been
made in barely the fifth month, the Herodians having dared to climb the wall,
moreover the centurions of the Romans rushing in. Then there were countless
slaughters, everything about the temple laid waste. Some fleeing to the temple,
others collecting in their homes were cut down, no compassion for old age, none
for infancy or feminine weakness. Antigonus presented himself and heedless of
the place threw himself at the feet of Sossius. But the latter, whom such a
great turning upside down of things ought to have prompted to compassion, having
jeered the prostrate Antigonus called him, he did not however spare him like a
woman, but thrust him bound into confinement. Herod was in doubt, how he should
rescue the homeland from the hands of the Romans, how he might save the temple
from being polluted by the gentiles. For the Romans were hurrying to look at the
more intimate mysteries, to desecrate the holy of holies. In truth the king now
by requests now by threats removed every one, having thought the victory worse
than flight, if anything of the sacraments should be revealed. The Romans
insisted upon booty, Herod resisted, <B>[p. 59]</B> lest they should leave an
empty city for him and the rule of a desert would be left to him. Sossius spoke
to the soldiers against the pillage of the captured city. But the king from his
own promised the soldiers he would give them money and thus he saved with money
the rest of his country which remained; he fulfilled what he had promised, he
supported the soldiers most kindly, he rewarded the leaders reasonably, Sossius
himself with royal generosity. No one departed ungrateful. Sossius offered the
crown to god and having set out took Antigonus with him to Antonius, whom he
struck as a man of degenerate mind with an axe. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C32"></A>XXXII.</SPAN>&nbsp;Herod moreover having given much even to his men, gave very much to
Antonius and his friends as a gift, he was not able however to buy from Antonius
security for himself. For already Antonius overwhelmed by love of Cleopatra was
serving her interests and enslaved was a servant to his lust, and was not able
to overcome her feminine appetites and especially of the practiced woman in the
slaughters of her relatives, who having been killed she had joined their
possessions to her own as if spoils. With the same avarice likewise and cruelty
if she had received anyone from Syria who according to rumor was rich she caused
them to be killed and Antonius having been enslaved already to her desires she
thought the kingdom also of Judaea and Arabia, the governing people of each
nation having been killed, could be added to her avarice. But although drunk
with lust in sleep Antonius serious in this matter came to his senses, so that
he declined to kill such men and powerful kings in accordance with the command
of that impudent woman. However lest he dismiss them unharmed, he struck down
their friends, he took away the greatest part of their possessions and
especially that region which produced balsam, all the cities located <B>[p.
60]</B> within the river Eleutherus, Tyre and Sidon however excepted, he awarded
to the cupidity of Cleopatra. Who cajoled by the man with such a bribe, followed
Antonius setting out against the Parthians all the way to the Euphrates, she
returned through Judaea, where Herod did not overlook to win over the mind of
the queen to himself with gifts and especially bribes. To whom favorable things
increased her arrogance, so that immoderate womanish behavior lifted her up
beyond bound, so that not much later the king of the Parthians Artabases the son
of the very powerful king Tigranes was given to her as a gift. Whom Antonius
holding as a captive with all the booty and Persian spoils destined for his
triumph awarded to the woman as a common slave, so that the more illustrious had
been his victory, the more disgraceful had been his bribery, which dishonored
kings with mockery. But not for long was she master of favorable things, who
knew not how to use them, with womanly haughtiness she aroused Augustus against
herself. And so with great efforts the Actiacus war was prepared on both sides.
Unhesitatingly the king with Antonius entered into the war, because Judaea was
empty of the hostile uproar and he had recovered Hyrcania long held by the
sister of Antigonus. But in this also Herod was most fortunate, to whom it was
inadvisable to mix himself in a foreign dangers. Therefore Cleopatra wishing to
alienate and divert his mind from the kings, persuaded the man, that Herod
should wage war against the Arabs, by which if he should be the winner, Arabia
would fall to the queen, if he should be the loser, the rule of Cleopatra would
be extended into Judaea. Whichever should conquer, the other would pay off.
Which action not according to plan but according to the outcome favored Herod.
Who as soon as he started the battle, stronger in cavalry he routed the enemy,
in the end he is overcome by the great number of the enemy and surrounded by
their number, the men of the adversaries having gathered in Canatha, against
whom wishing to strengthen his line, the minds of his men elated <B>[p. 61]</B>
by the outcome of the preceding and for that reason sallying against the enemy,
he was deserted by the treachery especially of Athenius, whom Cleopatra had
joined to the leader, not that he should aid Herod, but that he should desert
him in difficult in difficult straits. Finally the Arabs attacked his army
deserted in rocky and impassable terrain and scatter and rout it with great
slaughter and having pursued those put to flight to their refuge give them over
to destruction. Herod indeed arrived later than necessity demanded, buy however
having avenged the calamity in following battles he so afflicted the Arabs, that
they often lamented that one victory of theirs. Besides a great weakness of
minds is added by an upheaval of the earth, by which many cattle and almost
thirty thousand men also were swallowed up. Every military troop however there
which stayed in the open air survived unharmed. From this cause also the spirits
of the enemy were raised as they thought they might more easily invade a
deserted Judaea and and crush those struck by such prodigies. From which Herod
thought they should be roused to his defence, and especially because he had
learned that the envoys whom he had sent to Arabia had been treacherously
killed. With this speech therefore he addressed those trembling: "since the
state of the enemy has been broken by so many of our favorable battles to the
point of their confession, who stirred up by a frenzied resentment about to be
conquered have killed our envoys, it seems strange to me, that an irrational
fear has struck you so strongly, that you put fortuitous events of the elements
before the famous successes of our valor. There was no encounter, in which the
Arabs did not immediately fall back and turned back into flight think that they
must yield and, as they held themselves stolen things of war, that they had
captured remedies by trickery and ambush, not that they themselves had
conquered, but that they had delayed our victory. For whom since it is necessary
to be confident, <B>[p. 62]</B> a disturbance followed as if a terrifying event
of war, because the earth trembled, since they alone were innocent who are
waging war, or if we wish to consider whom it impedes, we consider rather the
Arabs, whom it it has led into war, that they have not taken themselves from the
braver by fleeing. For I see them relying not on arms and strength but to have
come back to the battle line because of the looses of our herds. For fragile is
the hope, which depends not from confidence of its own valor but upon the
distress of others, since on earth nothing is so changeable as either favorable
things or adverse things. In a few moments the conditions of human fortunes are
changed; neither long lasting prosperity nor adversity is persevering. And so
neither misery nor the contrary is everlasting, but there are frequently
successive and various changes of circumstances in the same. Finally from things
it is permitted to take an example; in the previous conflict we were superior,
but in the process of the battle our luck changed, so that we were conquered by
those whom we had beaten. And so it is for us to hope, that they may be
conquered by us, who had beaten us. For too great presumption and neglectful of
self is always incautious. Fear however warns to look into the future and
teaches care. In prosperity boldness creeps in and ill-advised rashness does not
know to await the plan of the commander. Finally you advancing against my
opinion the worthlessness of Athenio discovered an opportunity of doing harm.
Now your alarm hurries to me the expectation of victory. Arouse therefore your
spirits and raise the old brave spirit of the Jews; let not the agitations of
things not knowable by the senses frighten you, nor consider the motions of the
earth the signs of a second disaster. The sufferings of the elements have their
harm, but you should not fear anything other than what is offensive in itself.
For there are not signs of danger in the motion of the earth and the affliction
of animals but dangers themselves. There is nothing therefore that we should
fear as burdens to be borne <B>[p. 63]</B> who have borne more burdensome
things. He is able to be more well-disposed who has taken vengeance and more
merciful, than if he had not taken vengeance. What is preserved after an
earthquake and plague except sympathy, because we set free doubled sins. And
however we have untouched what is useful for war; for plague has taken away
those placed outside of the war, our victory moreover has taken from the enemy,
what they consider proper for war. Afterward for us there were dead cattle, for
them the decision who thought the envoys we sent must be killed against justice
and divine law. They transgressed against the law of all men, indeed of
themselves barbarians, among themselves also, who are ignorant of civilization,
envoys are considered untouchable. While heavenly vengeance is to be feared and
god is feared as the avenger of such a heinous crime. This therefore our
adversaries have let in, which neither human nor divine laws leave unpunished.
Let us march out therefore not for territory or spoils but about to do battle
for injury to the gods. Not love of wife or children urges us to battle but the
protection of god obtained. We are carrying out not our own decisions but the
sacred orders of divine law, that for them we claim vengeance, whom religion
orders must be untouchable. Between hostile arms an embassy alone is a mediator
of peace, he puts aside his enemy who is engaged in an embassy. Whose blood now
cries out to god and demands vengeance. Let us therefore hasten to battle while
we have god the revenger and avenger of those murdered. They are fighting better
for us and surrounded by hosts of angels spread before in the battle line."
Having exhorted his troops with such words he charged against the enemy seeking
every opportunity of fighting. The Arabs were superior in numbers but inferior
in spirit, whence an attack having been made almost five thousand of them were
slain. The rest taking themselves into the fortifications were overcome by a
lack of water, so an embassy having been sent <B>[p. 64]</B> they asked peace
for a price. But when they saw themselves to be put off and their thirst was
being inflamed further by the failing water, many coming out voluntarily offered
themselves up to their enemies, preferring to die by the sword rather than from
thirst, whom Herod guarded in fetters lest there should be treachery. And so in
five days almost four thousand were taken in, others coming forth to fight again
were killed to the number of seven thousand men. Humbled by which disaster the
Arabs, as much inferior in courage as they were outstanding in good sense,
sought from the king, whom they held an enemy, that he himself should be a
defender and protector for them. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C33"></A>XXXIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;But a greater concern struck him the victor, as some one who had
brought something upon himself, he trembled at not now the danger overhanging
him of territory but of the entire kingdom. Antonius having been conquered whom
he had joined to himself in faithful friendship. In fact Augustus Caesar the
winner of the battle of Actiacus considered Antonius not yet overcome, since
Herod had survived the victory. In anxiety therefore the king since he had
discovered from a true source that Caesar had gone to Rhodes, sailed to him lest
rumor should arrive before his earthly journey, and arriving his crown having
been put aside he presented himself in private dress but with the mental
attitude of a king. In fact leaving out nothing of the truth he kept his
loyalty, he held on to his authority. "I," he said, "Augustus, confess not to
have been a true ally of Antonius, rather someone who received the kingdom from
him, to whom I do not deny myself a debtor up to now; I would have demonstrated
that with arms, if Cleopatra had not been jealous and the Arabs had not
prevented it. From that necessity I did not bear arms against you, not as the
deserter of a friend or as one afraid of battle, but as occupied at home with
managing affairs. Antonius did not perceive me as ungrateful to him, to whom I
not present sent the assistance of the army and countless supplies of grain.
<B>[p. 65]</B> And also you, Caesar, would not have judged me unmindful of his
kindnesses, if I had been at the Actiacus battle. See that I leave out nothing.
Before you I fear more to be seen ungrateful to your enemy than to be seen an
enemy to you. Your judgement to me is more serious that the war, before whom not
the merits of valor but crimes are tried. And I before you prefer to be tried
for faithfulness rather than for unfaithfulness. See, Caesar, that I did not
abandon the uninjured Antonius, I did not run away from him beaten. You
conquered, Caesar, Antonius with your great legions, you conquered with your
intelligence, you conquered with the strength of the Roman empire, which he
abandoned, and which he refused, and truly he was beaten by your power but more
by his behavior. His wife Cleopatra conquered him, his Egyptian love conquered
him, his Conopeian extravagances conquered him, it conquered him, because he
preferred to be conquered with Cleopatra rather than to conquer without her. A
woman more dangerous to her own people than to her enemies conquered him. I had
urged the death of the woman, if he wished to take counsel for himself, I had
promised aid with which I would repair damage, I had promised forces with I
would protect him fleeing, I offered myself as a companion in war, but the
desires of Cleopatra blocked up his mind. He was conquered because he did not
wish to hear me, I too was conquered with Antonius with less shame however,
because Cleopatra conquered him, Antonius conquered me. He left behind a foreign
woman, I did not abandon a friend. I laid aside the crown with him, but I have
come to you retaining the favor of a faithful friend; I have given up the
emblems of royal power, but I have not cast away the consciousness of worth.
Judge as you wish, I however, of whatever kind your judgement, I return thanks
with myself, that it will be thought that I was a friend of this sort."</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C34"></A>XXXIV.</SPAN>&nbsp;Caesar responded to these things: "Be in good health," he said, "and
now enjoy your reign more, because we do not dislike good character but we
delight in it. For you are worthy to rule many, who thus protect <B>[p. 66]</B>
friendship, so that you do not reject him placed in adversity and you do not
blush to confess him a friend to you. But you have
sufficiently proved to honor the more fortunate to cling to and to keep faith in
good circumstances as in adverse circumstances. Antonius conquered you,
but I will not consider you conquered, whom friendship has made equal to the
victors. Therefore you may make requests fom us, because no outcome of the war
has changed you, seeing that you did not abandon Antonius but Antonius earlier
abandoned you, who entrusted himself more to Cleopatra than to you. The
foolishness of that man gained you for us, because he picked the worst for
himself, he rejected faith. It is no wonder that Antonius conquered should
adhere to Cleopatra, by whom a victor he was captured. Why should you wonder, if
Cleopatra made Antonius defect from you, since he separated from me and from a
wife made an enemy of the empire? And so you were rejected with us and therefore
the kingdoms with us. Nor indeed is this empty of benefit because, while we are
occupied with civil war, you made the untamed people of Arabia subject, because
we consider the enemies of the Jews as our enemies. For they carry arms against
us who attack you. Therefore you fought for us, when you conquered for yourself,
and thus we reward you, so that your kingdom is confirmed as our gift. Meanwhile
your favor is not at all reduced, we undertake in the future that you do not
need Antonius. Nor indeed is it fitting, that we do not conquer with benevolence
whom we have conquered by war." When he had said this, he placed the crown on
his head, adding painstaking attention to the gift. Encouraged by this esteem of
Caesar wishing to reduce his displeasure against Alexan, one of the friends of
Antonius, a man against whom Caesar was greatly angered, <B>[p. 67]</B> he
pleaded with much prayer, but very great anger left no place for pardon. Having
followed the march of Caesar setting forth into Egypt and having supplied all
things, which were of use to him or to the army, he acquired the greatest
goodwill and enthusiasm of the commander for himself, especially because in the
very dry places all the way to Pelusium an abundant supply of water was supplied
with royal foresight. With which services he infused a great love for himself
into everyone, so that it was thought he deserved more than he had received and
that the rule of a kingdom was less than the liberality of his kindness
deserved. Therefore Caesar from this opinion, things having been accomplished in
Egypt, Antonius and Cleopatra having died, returned to Herod not only what had
been taken away, truly even beyond those things which Cleopatra had stolen, he
granted to him Gadara, Ipponen, Samaria. He bestowed also at the same time the
maritime cities, Gaza, Anthedon, Joppa, and Strato's Tower; also four hundred
bodyguards from Gaul, surrounded by whom Cleopatra traveled, he granted many
other things for the protection of the body of the king. But from all these
things the king considered most important that above all he was loved, by Caesar
below Agrippa only, by Agrippa below Caesar only. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C35"></A>XXXV.</SPAN>&nbsp;And so in the fifteenth year of his reign, that he should respond to
his blessed condition and favor, having been lifted up by such a great success
of favorable things, he strained for goodness and so that he might demonstrate
himself grateful to the heavenly gods for the favors flowing to him without
limit, he adorned the temple, and he surrounded with a wall all that circuit of
space about the temple and the space having been doubled he enclosed it at great
expense of building and with exquisite beauty. For evidence there were great
covered walks about the sanctuary, which he raised up from the foundations. Nor
was his purpose less of guarding than of beautifying, <B>[p. 68]</B> accordingly
he strengthened the fortress lying to the north, which he named Antonia in honor
of Antonius, not at all inferior to the higher palaces. He added even in the
citadel of the royal home twin residences of great extent of wonderful beauty,
to whose grace you would think nothing should be added. One of them was named
Caesarium, the other Agrippium, so that in his dwellings the lasting memory of
such great friends would be celebrated. He also not only completed the building
of the city Sebaste but even filled it with inhabitants, But I will not follow
up every one, not at all easily was any place of long established cities
neglected, which declining he did not renew or adorn with the buildings added
which were seen to be lacking. Pouring his gifts to the five years contests he
enriched that common class of men with his poured out riches. He even founded a
temple of white marble to Caesar near the sources of the Jordan having been made
unmindful of religious scruples, so that he consecrated a temple to the man and
introduced a practice of the gentiles into Judaea. The name of the place is
Panium, where a mountain of lofty height with a high peak extends high into the
air, in whose side a gloomy cave is found, through which an oppressive abyss of
a smelly precipice breathes out a harsh noxious exhalation. Within there was a
meeting of the waters and without any motion much force, so that no estimation
of the boundless depth could be made; without however around the base of the
mountain itself springs gush out. Whence many have thought the source of the
Jordan to be in that place, still it seems to us to us what the truth holds must
be discovered in the future. There was <B>[p. 69]</B> in the coastal regions a
city, which was called the Tower of Strato, already exhausted by frequent wars
and decayed by old age itself into ruin, but prominent however by the the
suitableness and loveliness of the place, which he renewed with white stone and
buildings of the imperial court, and in it he expressed the character of his
greatness of soul and the elegance of the work. For located in the middle
between two coastal cities Dora and Iopen it is bound up in both directions by a
harborless seashore, so that all whoever they may be who desire to travel from
Egypt to Phoenicia, are rocked in the ocean, because in that place the sea is
frequently stirred up by the winds and especially by the gusts of the southwest
wind, by whose even more moderate blowing a disorder is raised, and likewise
struck by the jutting rocks and thrown back by the broken attack it irritates
the savage sea by yielding. And so the king setting no limit of expense
conquered nature by greatness of soul and established a port greater than
Piraeus and in it the devastation of the rocks having been penetrated he
established safe stations. Also having measured the distance, to the size the
port would come to, he put huge rocks into the sea, to which the depth was fifty
feet and to others even greater. He divided the port itself with great towers,
one of which he named Drusium, so that the name of Drusus, which was from the
ancestors of Caesar, should weave into his conspicuous works. He even placed
shorter steps at more frequent places, through which without severe labor ships
could be hauled; he even beautified the entire loveliness of that port with
three gigantic statues. Again he established a temple to Caesar in an elevated
place and in the middle of the temple he placed a large statue with the name of
Augustus as a likeness of the man himself, which was of not less magnitude
<B>[p. 70]</B> than the likeness of Jupiter of Olympus or of Juno of Argos. You
would not know the beauty in such great difficulties or the strength of the work
and you might think the protection in such great beauty to be outstanding, since
the work remains indestructible to the sea or age. And so many advantages accrue
in one work; for a great city is added to the province and a port to sailors and
honor to Caesar, from whose name Caesarea was named in this time. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C36"></A>XXXVI.</SPAN>&nbsp;The society sought of one woman lowered and weakened with sad pain
this political power of the king flowing to his triumphal successes, from which
against justice and divine law he thought a wife should be measured by the rank
of her birth rather than by love, a certain royal practice. For he had in
association a woman of Jerusalem Dosis by name, joined to himself a commoner
previously, who ought to have been more pleasing to him, who had been good for
her husband, with whom he had arrived at the royal peak. But unmindful of this
goodness he cast aside Dosis, he marries Mariamme the granddaughter of
Aristobolus, the daughter of Alexander. And so while he pursued noble birth, he
met with turmoil, which his own home did not find fitting for him, to which the
many peoples of the different provinces were submissive. And lest the eyes of
the new bride with a stepmother's dislike should be offended by him placed at
home whom Dosis had given birth to, Antipater, for that was the name of the
youth, was ejected not only from his father's dwelling but also from the entire
city, he made a situation with the inauspicious wedding, which he was
celebrating with the banishment of his only son, and he was hardly summoned for
the solemnities of the festal days. The woman seeing her husband to be compliant
to her was even turned by the jeers of piety into haughtiness; for the reason
was added, by which her mind was rightly inflamed, that she discovered that
Hyrcanus her grandfather had been killed through the treachery of her husband,
falsely accused because of a desire for royal power. [p. 71]<B> </B>He is the
person about whom we made mention before, whom Barzafranes who was ruling the
Persians, when he had seized Syria, took away captive, and held at first in
Parthia, afterwards having pitied his worsened fate, relinquished to the Jews
demanding him, who were living beyond the Euphrates. And would that he had
conceded to those entreating him, even that he had believed those warning him,
that the political power of his relatives should not in the manner of human
nature arouse him, so that he would make the passage to Herod; she would be a
danger to him, because desirous of saving his royal power he stirred up none
more than those closest to him, and he should beware his relatives. But he from
the tedium of living abroad and the desires of his people crossed the Euphrates,
he returned into Judaea. Because he descended deeper into the breast of Herod
than anyone had thought, not that he aspired to the royal power, but because a
man of the royal stock and with the privilege of power long exercised him to be
able to abstain from it was thought uncertain. The noose of death for Hyrcanus
was therefore the husband of his granddaughter, with whose influence he had
hurried to Herod, not knowing that captives lived more safely among the enemy
than relatives near the king. And so with not even a slight expectation of
ruling he was killed for this alone, that the kingdom was seen to be properly
his. Meanwhile he loved Miriamme with an immoderate love and did not want her
offended. Numerous offspring had piled favor upon the woman. For she had borne
him five children, but of the three sons the youngest had died at Rome, while he
was receiving a gentlemanly education. The remaining two were honored beyond the
mode of commoners in royal style. The reason for the youths was the nobility of
their mother and his rise in the kingdom, because they had been born with their
father already ruling, but <B>[p. 72]</B> especially the love of Miriamme, by
which the king was daily more and more inflamed, so that although no change of
love was returned to him by his wife, he took care however that he should not
sadden the mind of his wife in anything. With equal weight the hatred of his
wife and the love of the man fought against him. More justly however Miriamme
hated the man loving her, which Miriamme not loving him Herod loved, the hatred
of the woman arose from the outrage, from the reliance on love, because first,
by the grief of a granddaughter, she was turned away, second she was lifted up
by the servility of a lover. And thus not even by the reprimands of the things
thrown forth did he temper the crime, that he had through wickedness snatched
away from her her grandfather Hyrcanus and her brother Jonathan, although one
was his wife's grandfather, the other a relative by marriage, the former ought
to have been saved because feeble of old age, the latter at least because of his
adolescent age. A shameful crime, to whom a youth of seventeen years he had
committed the high priesthood, to whom immediately he had conferred the office
he inflicted death for no other cause, as we grasp it, unless that having put on
the priestly garments, when he first approached the high altar on the sacred and
honored day, suddenly the people broke into tears. Because he was thus suspect
to Herod, as he believed the people to have cried for joy and for that reason to
have forsaken his affection for the boy, those tears to be indications of a
wish, the enthusiasm of the people to be dangerous for himself, who showed with
their inmost organs that they had enthusiasm for devotion to the young man, a
noble descendent of kings, the son of a powerless woman, the brother of a
shameless queen, who disdained her husband the king, who was about to rush forth
to rule, if he were not timely taken from their midst, for whom beauty, for whom
loveliness of appearance <B>[p. 73]</B> sufficed, by law it was thought that he
should be preferred above all others. <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A><sup> </sup>And so
he proposed to kill the young man. The mother of the youth attacked him, who was
very keen for investigating and more vehement for avenging, nothing was endured
hidden and nothing unpunished, and for this reason he decided to recall and
restrain himself: Again the love heaped up as the days passed of everyone for
the youth and the danger to his rule alarmed him. Whence aroused by a sudden
rage he decided to take counsel for himself on some method.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C37"></A>XXXVII.</SPAN>&nbsp;The young man is sent at night to the city Jericho and there
accustomed to take pleasure in his enthusiasm for swimming very many going
together with him as if in a game, he is held submerged without limit, he is
killed in the swimming pool. His sister did not tolerate this in silence, but
from feelings of sisterhood announced it at a banquet and charged her husband
that her brother had been taken from her by his order. Herself to have been
abandoned by all, the home of her consort to be calamitous for her, who first
took her grandfather from her, afterwards killed her brother, herself miserable
to have been a cause of ruin for her relatives. Dire things to be called down
upon her husband, father-in-law, and sister of the king; the common outrage of
all, to ask god the avenger, that such a heinous crime should not be left
unpunished. Herod received that as if captured by love and obedient to her
commands, but the women raged and were not able to bear the insults of her
cursing and her presumption expressing resentment, especially because overcome
by his miracle Herod was not able to rise up against his beloved. And thus what
the lover could to be more enraged with, a pretence of adultery is woven and a
crime of this nature is constructed against the woman, that she had sent her
likeness to Antonius in Egypt. That to have been a great lewdness, that to a man
physically elsewhere and quick to passion, powerful besides, who made use of
power in place of law, she offered her beauty for sale, that he might bid on her
beauty. The woman <B>[p. 74]</B> had dishonored herself by the trafficking of an
unusual auction from either the force of love or from hatred of her husband,
danger for whom she had sought for the pay of adultery. With this fabrication of
the women in the house of Herod Miriamme was loved the more the more she was
seriously assailed, nor however was the accusation itself although made by
resentful women completely contrary to the truth. For the mother Alexandria
raging, because another was placed before her son Aristobolus in the priesthood
-- for by this name her son Ionathan, by which he brought back into memory his
grandfather to have been king, preferred to be called -- had sought from
Antonius through a certain (trustee of documents?) the priesthood for her son
trust was nearer the truth. Afterward the friend Gallicus of Antonius arriving
in Judaea recognized the young man to have been wondrous because of the
loveliness of his most outstanding beauty, not less even Miriamme, whose rank
was higher, by the amount her fame was more illustrious, and perhaps was found
so by a certain fashion of human nature, by which men dear to their intimate
friends also want to declare themselves, if they are granting the society of
their hospitable table also to their near kin. There also the opportunity was
given to Alexandra of speaking with Sossius, granted that to an unimpeded widow
another opportunity of becoming acquainted with her host would not be able to be
lacking, since especially she would be seeking occasions and persons of that
kind. Then a plan having been discussed on both sides it settled on this
opinion, that pictures of both would be sent to Antonius. He was bound up by the
magnificence of the pictures and especially by the testimony of Sossius, who
declared himself to have seen nothing like it ever on earth and the beauty in
them to be not of men but divine, meretriciously that it would arouse the
greatest lusts of a man, he wrote Herod that he should send Aristobolus to him
without delay, about Miriamme <B>[p. 75]</B> because she was married to him he
let pass, not for the reason that he was accustomed in the presence of their
husbands to conceal his lusts for those who were married, to whom without danger
he would use, outrage without shame, but for the reason that he was taking
precautions against the anger of Cleopatra, who indeed was offended by a rival
of either sex, but more if she discovered a woman joined to her husband, because
she thought herself to excel all women in beauty. And so the letter having been
read Herod made the excuse that without a rebellion of the people and the
disturbance of the entire nation he could not tear away the noble youth from his
people and so that he might satisfy Alexandra, he promised the priesthood to
Aristobolus, but since she thought herself to be mocked by a trick and a delay
to be made to the promises, Alexandra prepared a ship and in the apparatus of
flight itself the plan having been learned through Sabiones she was called back
with her son. Alarmed by this Herod dissembled the offense for a time and
quickened the conferring of the priesthood upon Aristobolus, so that by the
appearance of honor he might conceal the hatred of the prepared murder, which
having been accomplished, as we said, as if struck by lightning, at the same
time he was stirred up by the crime of feigned adultery forged by his kin,
because he knew Antonius to be quick to carnal desires, and unveiled lusts, from
the fact that he was powerful, and burning for every amatory mode; also
especially the inexpiable resentment and frightfulness of the rivalry of
Cleopatra killed many of the men whom she had discovered too slow about
restraining the licentious behavior of their wives. He recoiled in terror from
the danger overhanging him not only of losing his wife but even of undergoing
death. And so he himself proposed to hasten into Egypt so that he might prevail
on Antonius or Cleopatra whom he chiefly feared. Others report that summoned by
the letter of Antonius he exerted himself for the purpose <B>[p. 76]</B> that he
might set forth the reasons of the young man having been killed. However about
to depart, he reveals secretly to Joseph his relation by marriage, to whom
Salome the sister of the king had come in marriage, that death had been
suspected for himself because of a desire for the beauty of his wife, which it
was disclosed a picture of her good looks having been sent the woman had made
known. This he committed as a task to his relation, that if he himself should be
killed by Antonius, he should kill Miriamme, so that a reward for her crime
should not remain. Joseph, not at all, as I think, from a desire of betrayal but
that he should put to rest the complaints of the woman against her husband, by
which she said herself afflicted to burn with hatred of her husband, he reveals
the order and interprets it as due to the affection of a lover, that not even
dead could Herod allow himself to be separated from the companionship of his
wife. But the woman quite otherwise than Joseph had judged this dragged to the
argument of the still entangled cruelty against herself, after whose death still
being exercised he had also ordered her execution to his own relation. He was
disturbed by the injury to himself, he examined his own suspicions not with some
proof of truth but urged the outcome of sudden death, there would be no end to
the hatreds which were being stretched out beyond the end itself of life and
health. But Joseph unmindful of the domestic evil, since he was trying to
reconcile a hostile wife to her husband, inflamed the suspicions of his own wife
against himself, which she considered the conversations of her own husband with
Miriamme, the stops made not at all perfunctorily in the court of the king.
Finally when her brother returned, she did not put aside the accusation, adding
her own injury to the affronts to the king, because also from her Miriamme had
taken away a husband. But Herod, although stricken, was not at all very
seriously alarmed at first, nor did he present himself enraged to his wife, but
overcome even by the force of love <B>[p. 77]</B> he began one day to swear to
his wife, that he loved her with such great affection, that he had never blazed
with desire for another woman, thus he threw all from his mind, that he kept
trust in his wife. But she: "you declared your love for me adequately in the
orders which you gave to Joseph, commanding that he should kill me. How is he
able to love who is able to kill?" The king frantic immediately when he heard
his secret to have been betrayed, from that began to think that Joseph was never
about to betray him, unless captured by love of the woman he had sought the the
reward of the betrayal in sexual intercourse. It revealed what lay hidden a long
time, a crime in the open, an indubitable corruption, not in vain he aroused his
sister who placed personal injury before all else. And so wild with too much
anger and not in control of his mind he sprang forth from his bed fleeing the
contagion of disgraceful misconduct, nor did the court seize him raging. His
sister heard him shouting and immediately seizing the opportunity of alleging an
argument, an opportunity of doing harm she confirmed the suspicions of the
indignant person. And therefore driven by the pain of the offense, by the
accusation of his sister he ordered both to be killed. Not much afterwards
regret of the things done followed, and when anger abated, love followed, and
and passion was reawakened and such a great heat of desire blazed up, that he
did not believe her dead and in a departure of his mind he spoke to her as if
living. And as if to her who was living he directed the boys, asking that
rivalries having been put down she should come to him and restore him to marital
pleasures, scarcely finally taught by a great interval of time did he believe
her to have died, whom because of love as a woman of imperishable beauty he
believed not to be able to die. So great was his passion for the dead woman.
Finally afterward he became savage and <B>[p. 78]</B> is reported irritated by
hatred into the murder of many present, nor did he suffer only from sickness of
mind but even from a severe illness of the body, which they said had been
contracted from plague and also from the air. For the more corrupt parts of the
air drawn in gives rise to plague in many. Whence those experienced in medicine
having been consulted he hid himself in the remote places of the forest and
vigor have been gradually poured back from hunts he recovered good health of
body and sobriety of mind. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C38"></A>XXXVIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;This also added to his marvels, by which he admired the grace of the
deceased, himself to have suffered punishment for the unjust outrage and from
the affliction of the elements had atoned the death of such a great beauty, by
the ruin of the world, the death of one by the affliction of the people,
vindicated however by an unequal fate, since the earth denied produce, famine
increased the pestilence. A pure but immoderate knowledge of beauty brought to
her husband in full possession of his senses this death of Miriamme. To whom
magnanimity was superfluous, painstaking attention was lacking, so that she
disdained the compliments of her husband, untroubled because she was able to
endure nothing of ruin from him who loved her beyond measure. Not only did she
discover vengeance for the present, but she transmitted inherited hatreds into
the future. To whom followed her sons avengers of their mother's resentment with
pious love for their mother but with irreverent feeling for their father,
although the law of nature should be shared to each of the parents with equal
service. Nor did grief find them unpracticed. For having long been instructed at
Rome in Latin alongside Greek literature, they had adopted a not ordinary
astuteness and absent the death of their mother having been learned they were
made violent into hatred of their father by many instigators. Also respect not
even of the sight of their father<B> [p. 79]</B> had poured care into them
having returned, their ill-will increased with age. The presumption arose even
from the society of his wife because to one the daughter of Salome the
granddaughter of Herod, to the other a daughter born to Archelaus, who held the
kingdom of Cappadocia, had come in marriage, that the noble class of the union
had given authority. Therefore Herod was offended by his sons' silent nature
more stirred up than the paternal tenderness could endure. Besides which he is
frequently offended from his expression. And goads were added by those who as if
worried frequently announced he should beware the treachery of his sons,
asserting that vengeful of their mother's death they were arming bands.
Terrified by which Herod began to prefer Antipater the son of Doris to his
brothers and began to excite favor to him by more plentiful affection, the royal
court burned with greater hatreds and was struck by the conflict of the
brothers, while they were indignant that the son of a woman who was a commoner
was preferred to them born in royal power. He full of flattery the more he
discerned himself inferior on his mother's side, the more studiously he
commended himself to his father, he did not cease to attack his brothers with
fabricated accusations, until he himself through himself through others whom he
had joined to himself excluded them from the paternal affections. Finally he
took all expectation of ruling from them, so that by a will publicly established
he was designated the sole successor of the supreme power. And sent to Rome to
Caesar except for the emblem of the crown he was supported by every ornament and
royal dress. Thence having returned into Judaea, the favor toward him of Caesar
and many distinguished men having been increased, in an interval of almost no
time he prevailed to such an extent, that he even restored his mother to the
marriage of his father, and with the twin arms, the art of flattery and cunning
in making accusations, he began to so attack his brothers before their father,
that the father prepared death for his sons. Finally raging of mind he sought
Rome Alexander dragged with him, <B>[p. 80]</B> whom he set before Caesar
charged with the crime of magic against himself. He the opportunity having been
given of responding to the charge and every complaint, when he saw to be at hand
for himself the authority of such a great judge, who could neither be converted
by Herod through influence, nor tricked by Antipater, having decided that
nothing should be passed by he blunted the shameful acts of his father with a
certain restraint, so that he seemed to neither urge them as an accuser nor to
allow them to be hidden, since it would help his cause greatly if he
demonstrated himself on account of the pain of his mother's death to be attacked
by the hatreds of his father. For in such trials nothing burdens children more,
than the loyalty of nature and the influence of loyalty. Which if they are
exhibited by some crime, prejudgment is reduced and its verdict hindered. Truly
when it was come to the complaints of the father, rebutting with strong defenses
he first showed his brother innocent of any crime, who was the sharer of their
dangers, whom innocent he groaned to be called into judgment, the force of
delivery and skill in speaking supported a clear conscience. He lamented most
bitterly that nothing of honor had been left to him or his brother, that all had
been taken away through the wickedness of his half-brother and the readiness of
his father. Death for himself to be asked for, which his father hopes for to the
point that he adds accusation, he attaches shameful things. With these words he
forced everyone into tears and drew out the response of the court, that the
accusation was not proven to Caesar, the father embraced reconciliation. It was
very acceptable and most excellent to the Roman leader not only to have given a
kingdom to the famous king but even to have restored his children. And so it was
settled by a just balance, that respect for paternal rights remained unviolated
and the innocence of the sons was protected, as was becoming for the father,
that the children should be obedient, that he should exhibit the uninterrupted
affection of nature for his sons, he might leave the kingdom however to whom he
wished. Alexander returned with his father from the city of Rome freed more from
judgment than from mistrust. For Antipater did not allow the mind of Herod to be
free from hatred of his sons. And indeed he himself was <B>[p. 81]</B> the
occasion of hatreds, he pressed still his pursuit with the appearance of a
restorer so that he should not betray the public view of longed for brotherhood,
he made plain his treachery. When it was come into Cilicia and sailing they
landed at Eliusa, Archelaus received them with a rich banquet expressing thanks
for the trial of his son in law Alexander, that freed from danger he had even
been considered worthy of reconciliation. Furthermore he had asked friends in
letters sent through his people, that they should be of assistance to the
defence of his son in law, he presented him departing thirty talents a gift of
hospitality and escorted him all the way to Zephyrium. Having returned home the
king immediately summons the people, before whom he speaks in this manner.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C39"></A>XXXIX.</SPAN>&nbsp;"The reason for me, Hebrew citizens, of seeking Rome was both
profitable and productive that Caesar should judge about my sons, so that I
alone who was angry should not make inquiry. I proceeded to Caesar so that he
who had given me the kingdom should make pronouncement about my successor. He
added to his kindnesses that which was difficult he presented to the father his
almost lost sons, to the brothers he restored amity which is above the kingdom.
I return therefore richer than when I set out, I have learned to be a better
father, because my sons have learned to be better children, by the kindness of
Caesar. In fact he decided that the succession of my sons should depend upon my
judgment; that the right of succession should not give birth to haughtiness,
that I should give as successor to me whom I choose, him who had deserved it,
him who had most honored his father. I will imitate Caesar, for he in absolving
my younger sons made them equal to the oldest son. And so today at the same time
I designate my three sons kings, age supports the one, birth the others. let not
the number cause alarm, the size of the kingdom suffices for many. God is first
the judge of my decision, afterwards you are added besides, whom Caesar joined,
<B>[p. 82]</B> the father arranged, you follow with suitable honor, so that the
honor may be neither immoderate nor too little. The one makes arrogant, the
other makes angry. What is imparted to each as his share is sufficient for his
merits. For something does not delight him so much whom it honors beyond
measure, as it harms him to whom it denies what is owed. And generally each of
them is hurt when there is a fawning of preference. I am certainly the father to
all, the honor of my sons is certainly a pleasure of the father. If however
anyone honors my children beyond measure, he is actually liable to me in behalf
of my children, for whom he is the source of the fault. For the cultivation of
effrontery is taken as too great. Should I be jealous of my children? May god
forbid, but I prefer them to have less power with favor than more with
rebellion. But it is a fact of haughtiness and plunder that it is quickly
slipped into, which of pleasure is long held. Whence it will be a concern to me,
that I will join the the sponsors of concord to my children as parents and
friends, by whose encouragement they put on the affection of mutual love. But
when every evil word poisons the mind of the hearer, then incessant
conversations chiefly and lasting practice are accustomed to pour pestilence
into the mind, which by a certain contagion quickly crosses into the habits of
those dwelling together. Although there may be tranquility of behavior, however
as a lake although placid, can rise into rage from disturbing winds, thus a good
nature may be agitated by wicked counselors. And so I think that each one ought
to put his greatest expectations in me, not indeed that he destroys me because
he approaches my children. Each of the tribunes or soldiers ought to honor the
father of the commanders more. I exist, I am he who will weigh out the reward to
all for those things which you have bestowed even upon my sons. If I notice
proper spirits I will reward the acts, an evil disposition will return its
price, so that he is deprived of profit also whom he has believed to be
flattering. You however, my good sons, consider first reverence for nature,
whose favor <B>[p. 83]</B> binds wild beasts, which even forces savage animals
into love of their relatives --- there remains mutual love among untamed animals
and wild creatures rescue their own kind from their own dangers --- furthermore
respect Caesar, who has made you from enemies into friends; third respect me
myself, who prefer to ask when I am able to command: remain brothers, do not
cast aside what you have been born to. I give you the imperial robes and
training, but it is of more value that I persuade the pure mark of your love: if
sense of duty remains, if royal power delights, but if gratitude is lacking, the
supreme power is worthless and mostly harmful. Therefore while I am putting you
to the test, you have meanwhile not the royal power but the honors of royal
power. If you shall have valued your father, the duty will follow. Demonstrate
however love of me in yourselves: as leaders you will get possession of all the
things with which royal power is accustomed to delight, the burdens of rule and
the troubles of work will remain mine alone, although I do not wish it. And so
it is advantageous for you to prefer my things, because I both will and judge
what things are yours and mine." These things having been said he kissed his
sons, so that he should bind them in turn to himself with one kiss of love.
Which having been done he dismissed the convention.</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C40"></A>XL.</SPAN>&nbsp;The majority departed happy, whom the concord of brotherhood pleased, but
when dissension returned to the brothers, and more seriously by that amount, by
which their position was superior who were more envied and to whom there was a
greater power of doing harm. The sons of Mariamme grieved the son of a woman who
was a commoner, who did not know the lineage of royal power, to have been made
equal to themselves. On the other hand Antipater disdained the separate
expectation of royal power of himself and his brothers and was jealous of his
brothers, for whom the following were scarcely reserved before the chiefs. But
he covered and veiled himself, pretending affection in place of dislike, they
not even seeking any hostile meaning in their speech, with a tongue quick and
lavish of secrets. Whatever they had said, <B>[p. 84]</B> was at once before
Antipater, much even which they had not said was fabricated. The intermediary
added much material with an increment. The author of everything by which the
brothers were attacked was Antipater, whose life was nothing but a meeting of
slyness, a theater of wickedness, the plotting of crimes, the service of
scandals. He brought forward tale bearers, he suborned witnesses, he pretended a
defense as if carrying around in a theater the personality of a brother, so that
he would cast out the lighter charges, grant the more serious, by which he
deceived their father more and aroused him more stongly against his brothers, he
especially piled up with cunning hatred of a father's murder made ready so that
the kingdom might be seized, which from fear of danger was more suspected by
kings. But lest these things might appear to the king less likely if no one
objected, he himself first tried to refute them, then he wished himself to be
seen to be constrained by the obvious proofs of the charges, so that the case
having been delivered from both sides, as if nothing were lacking to a verdict,
the father would be more aroused as if against convicted sons. For nothing gave
more faith in the assertions than that Antipater was considered the defender of
his brothers. By this trickery he captured the favor of most, he inclined the
mind of his father to himself. Whatever was diminished daily from the brothers
of paternal affection was transferred to himself. He enticed away the king's
friends and parents and he especially made Feroras the brother of the king and
Salome his sister alienated from the prodigals, so that not only did they not
defend them, but they even attacked and hated them. Glafyra the wife of
Alexander added material of hatreds, who in woman's fashion, quite overbearing
of those present, <B>[p. 85]</B> had begun to extol herself with arrogant pride,
for the reason that she excelled all the others in the fame of her lineage. And
so she put herself forward as if she were the mistress of all who were in the
royal court, and was accustomed to boast that the father and grandfather to her
were kings and especially Darius the son of Hydaspes the highest honor of her
mother's line and to afflict Salome the sister of the king or Dosis his wife
with insults of their low birth, which was a source of anger for them and of
hatred against herself. She irritated the other women in similar fashion, who
were joined to the king more because of their beauty than because of the
nobleness of their birth. For Herod beyond the custom of kings even was
delighted by the practice of the Jews as if by a certain freedom of error, who
considered the fashions of their ancestors a cloaking of their own faults.
Therefore Alexander bore with reluctance the haughtiness of his wife.
Aristobolus also reproached his wife with the same words as Glaphyra, her of low
status not matching the royal descendants, unequal to Glaphyra, it to be a shame
to him that his brother had gained a wife of royal family, he had lowered
himself by union to a commoner as wife: who raging dismayed his own relatives by
his reproaches. Struck with which abuses the wife of Aristobolus carried them to
her mother with tears. Salome however announced the things learned through her
daughter to king Herod. But he believing it better to warn his sons rather than
destroy them, summoned and partly terrified them imperially, partly with
paternal affection exhorted them that they should love their brother and not be
separated like enemies, offering pardon for prior offenses, threatening
punishment for future offenses. But they lamenting themselves to be attacked by
many charges that had been settled, beseeched and at the same time promised with
their actions in the future that they would be given belief in their own
defense, only their father should look at their acts and not rashly believe
things heard. For indeed they would not lack <B>[p. 86]</B> dishonest accusers
in the future, so long as he a credulous hearer was at hand. The father having
been softened by these and such, although they pushed aside for a time the
overhanging fear, they piled up sadness, because they saw themselves to be
attacked by Feroras and Salome, one of them their paternal uncle, the other the
sister of their father by whom who should have been a defence they were
ambushed. A great fear was added, because they had great influence with their
brother. For with the crown excepted, Herod shared almost the entire rule of the
kingdom with his brother. He had bestowed not ordinary wealth upon both and
especially upon Feroras. In fact he put away a yearly payment of one hundred
talents besides that region, which located beyond the Euphrates increased the
amount of his income. He had also been appointed a tetrarch by Caesar at the
request of Herod. And besides he had been presented with a relative of the royal
consort, because he had received the sister of the royal consort in the function
of his marriage partner. After whose death the oldest daughter of the king
having been betrothed to him he advanced in the gratitude of his son in law,
except that captured by the love for a slave girl he rejected the bond of the
royal maiden. Enraged by which insult Herod handed over his daughter to him who
later was slain in the Parthian war. Feroras however was accused before him that
he had sought the life of his brother with poison, which suspicion he had not
lacked not even when his wife was still living, at first the questioning of many
and finally of his friends having been enforced, he willingly acquitted him
found free of his crime which was alleged, giving even pardon for the flight the
arrangement entered into, that the slave girl whom he loved having been seized,
he should flee to the Parthians, he was exposed by the confessions of his
household members. Alexander had enjoyed to some extent a respite, while Feroras
is attacked and he himself attacks Salome because she had pledged her marriage
to Sylleus the son of Obaedas, who was the <B>[p. 87]</B> deputy of the king of
Arabia and very unfriendly to Herod. But the accusation having been relaxed for
each, the storm of the household fell upon Alexander and enveloped him with
great danger. For Antipater raged with the savageness of a plague and the storm
of the entire court, attacking his brother in every way and with the support of
his relatives, so that his father with the state of his sober mind disturbed
protested with a loud voice that Alexander stood over him with a sword. A scene
of this type had come into view, that Alexander had enticed three eunuchs, one
of whom was accustomed to tend the cups of the king, another to bring in the
food tray of dinner, the third to watch the royal couch and never to leave when
Herod had settled himself in bed, with rich gifts to his favor and participation
in shameful acts. Which having been brought forth forced by tortures the eunuchs
revealed the wantonness of obscene lust. For unable to hide the love potions
promised they related with what words they had been solicited and with what
price of shame, so that parricide wrapped in disgraceful conduct was believed.
There was in him the grace of youth the charm of beauty, the strength of age,
contrasted to a feeble Herod already oppressed by old age, who dyed his hair,
lest it betray his age, from which since he wished the right of ruling should be
transferred to himself, it was necessary that great rewards be promised and thus
for them to establish their hope in a youth, not in a decrepit old man, for whom
nature itself was hastening an end. Which things indeed seriously disturbed
Herod, but he considered it more important than the rest that it was discovered
from the information of the eunuchs that the military troops and the leaders of
the army and the centurions were conspiring against him. Indeed he was so
aroused, that he thought that no type of savagery should be omitted, that he
should believe no one, that he should consider everyone suspect. Punishments
were swifter than investigations of the crimes, and the death of the culprits<B>
[p. 88]</B> preceded judgment. They were seized everywhere for punishment whom
any suspicion attacked. False accusations abounded, many wishing to please the
king lodged information against the guilty, but immediately even those who
reported others were denounced and were led with their guilty parties to the
place of punishment. And so Herod brutalized everyone, so that if anyone
remained who was suspected, the king not otherwise thinking himself to be safe
unless the human race should become extinct, with irreconcilable accusations,
disbelieving his friends, arrogant to his familiars, unmerciful to the guilty,
terrified of everything so that he changed his residence frequently, spent his
nights without sleep. Who exasperated by all suddenly surrounded Alexander bound
in chains with guards and summoned his friends for investigations. Those who
refused died during tortures, those who were silent, because they revealed
nothing in support of suspicions, were tortured to death. However some overcome
by the harshness of the tortures and punishments, asserted that it had been
proposed by the youths, that they should kill their father while he was intent
upon hunting and proceed to the city of Rome without delay, so that they should
foil punishment by flight. Although it was supported by no evidence, the father
however derived support of his fierce pursuit wishing to have just reasons for
the chains of his son. And so therefore Alexander considering the ears of his
father to be blocked against any defense of himself and that in no way was the
thing able to be diverted, so that he would presuppose him innocent, who was
assailed by such a mass of false accusations, he thought that the wicked
accusers must be met by similar craft, that he should surround with snares the
deceitful contrivers of false accusations and call those guilty into calumny, by
whose calumnies he believed himself to be threatened. He wrote therefore four
small books, in which he confessed the invention of a crime by which <B>[p.
89]</B> he threatened the safety of his father, and he exposed those accomplices
of this type of treacheries many of them those by whom he himself had been
attacked. And in these same booklets he especially wrote of Feroras and Salome,
that also in the dead of night the sleeping chamber of the youth having been
broken into in which he lived she enticed him unwilling and extorted from him
resisting that he should commit incest. He sent the booklets to the king as
informers of his shameful acts, with which he involved the very powerful who
were companions and friends of the king. Archelaus came quickly at the right
time into Judaea, so that he should bring what he could of help and aid to his
son in law and daughter. But foreseeing the chances of a genuine defense before
the hostile father to blocked to him, he skillfully repressed his agitation. For
as soon as he entered the royal court, in a loud voice although he was already
heard and seen by Herod as if furious of mind he began to shout: "Does that
poisonous son in law of mine still live and despoil this light? I ask where he
is, where may I find that parricidal head, that I may rend it with my own hands?
By parricide he ought to perish, who wished to commit parricide. What will he do
with a father in law who has not spared his father? Who will point him out? I
will disembowel the scoundrel first, may I give my daughter to a good
bridegroom; although she was not conscious of his wickedness, she is not however
removed from contagion, who is in the power of a parricide. I do not acknowledge
a daughter who does not recognize the tricks of her husband, who has not shown
herself such a daughter in law to her father in law that she returned the son
made subject to his father. I gave her in marriage not for the service of crime
but for participation in matrimony, that she should show herself the joint heir
of favor not an assistant in crime. I wonder at you, Herod, that Alexander still
lives that schemer against his father. I thought him to have already paid the
just penalty, <B>[p. 90]</B> which it was not necessary to be put off. Why
indeed should the confessor of a parricidal outrage be saved? But perhaps also
this was divine foresight, that he who in you injured the piety of each should
be condemned by the judgment of the parents of both. I will not deny myself to
be an avenger, who prepared myself a preacher of exact retribution, but I do not
make my daughter an exception, whom I myself betrothed to this unfortunate
marriage following you as its sponsor. But I did not surrender her to the moods
of a husband but to your trust. Let her deliver the reason that she has ignored
her surety, she loved her husband. About both now judgment is for us. If you are
a firm avenger of such a great grief, gird yourself; father follow your duty.
Duty is not wished for by fathers, but must not be ignored. If piety softens
you, nature bends you, let us change places, so that we are the executors of
mutual service I in the case of your son and you in the case of my child."
Moving about with speech of this nature he converted Herod and from his fury of
mind he little by little softened his intention, so that he believed himself a
fellow sufferer and sharing the same purpose and gave him the the small booklets
which Alexander had composed. But he giving attention to each when he realized
them to be more crowded with pain than depending on faith, with a deep purpose
gradually lessened the hatred of the parricidal attempt and the causes of the
objections against them which they had described and began to transfer it
especially against Feroras. And so when he noticed the king not to shrink from
his opinion: "It must be considered," he said, "if perhaps the young man was
attacked more by the treacheries of disloyal persons than you were by the young
man. What cause was there, that he should seek your life, to whom you had
conceded the honors of kingship, to whom you had reserved the right of ruling
and the hope of the succession? Why should he seek what he had, or how would he
ungrateful consider these great gifts? How other would he behave <B>[p. 91]
</B>upon your death unless it would affect his danger, which with you alive he
could not fear, with you dead he would certainly fear from them, from whom even
positioned beneath his father he feared the destruction of his safety. That age
is open to trickery, it is easily deceived and gotten round by the treacheries
of tricksters. Old age scarcely withstands trickery, generally still the good
sense of the aged is entangled by the cunning of those circumscribing them.
Therefore if mature experience is often affected, what wonder if immature age
was not able to be at hand for itself, when it was threatened by crowds of those
lying in ambush? These therefore are disturbers of the royal home, they are
inciters of the young, the sowers of discord who have led the young man into
despair of his safety, who has given way more to ill-temper and revenge than he
has strained for perfection, he has imparted something even to the commotion.
Gradually influenced by which Herod had begun indeed to soften his anger about
Alexander, but truly to be moved more strongly against Feroras, because he was
put forth by those four little books as the accomplice of all the crimes and the
deviser of the entire scene. Who seeing the king to have inclined his mind to
Archelaus and to extend to him beyond the rest the favor of his close
friendship, took himself to him beseeching that he should render the mind of the
king conciliated to himself. Truly that one had not doubted that he was tied in
by many chains of crimes, by which he was convinced that he had prepared
treacheries against the king and had assailed the youth, he said him to have no
chance of pardon, unless, the cunning of denying what had been advanced against
him having been put aside, to confess to his loving brother and to ask from him
<B>[p. 92]</B> leniency for himself. Himself would not fail to assist an action
of this sort in any way he could. And so his garments having been changed
suffused with tears, with a pitiable appearance clinging to the feet of his
brother he beseeched pardon, confessed his wickedness, did not deny but
acknowledged everything with which he was charged, madness to have been the
reason to himself of such a great misstep, that a too great frenzy of love of
the wife selected for him had boiled up. And so Feroras having been established
as an accuser of his own crimes and equally as a witness besides as if in
recompense of the prepared argument which he was submitting against his own
advantage, Archelaus interceded with Herod, that with nature taken into
consideration he should soften his anger and forgive his brother placing the law
of nature above punishment. Nor is it a wonder if in great kingdoms like in fat
bodies often some part should become inflamed, which must not be cut away but
healed by more gentle medicines. Against himself likewise much more serious
treacheries had been prepared by his own brother, but he had lessened to his
relative what was owed for the offense, as the more he raised the punishment
upon the ungrateful man the more he would aggravate its cause. When he wove
together these thing and other things like them, he indeed soothed Herod so that
he pardoned his brother, but he himself remained relentless against his son in
law. Finally he threatened that he would divorce his daughter from him and he
bellowed with such a great commotion of his anger, that Herod himself considered
the crime against himself of his son sufficiently atoned for and asked to be the
avenger of his own injuries and himself intervened with the father in law in
behalf of his guilty culprit, by which he restored the marriage anew. Archelaus
persevered, Herod should join his daughter in law to anyone he wished except
Alexander, from whose cause even his wife was taken, and by this craft he urged
Herod much more, <B>[p. 93]</B> that he should think his son restored to him, if
he should not set free his consort, because he loved his wife very much, from
whom he had received sons dear to their grandfather, beloved by their parents.
This would be the gift of his son restored to him, because a good wife in no
small part would check the errors of her husband or would offset with her
kindnesses the dislike of his offenses, who if she should be separated from him,
there would be no remedy for her husband so that he should not rush headlong
into every wrong act. For presumptions of evil deeds were accustomed to be made
softer which were called back by domestic affections. Scarcely finally was
Archelaus prevailed upon that he reconciles to his son in law and reconciles the
father to the same. With this scheme he snatched his son in law from death, that
for recompense he should receive his absolution, while he pretends to condemn
rather than to intervene, for which if he had thought he must intervene, without
doubt he would have accomplished nothing. He added that it was necessary that he
go to Rome that cleared which his father had suspected in him, inasmuch as he
himself had written everything to Caesar, which was likewise planned I think,
that when Alexander had cleared himself by this method he would be recommended
to Caesar and the treacheries to the brothers prepared by Antipater made known.
</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C41"></A>XLI.</SPAN>&nbsp;By this plan the partisanship was loosened, a conversion made to
happiness, living together restored, evidence that reconciliation was begun,
upon whose originator Archelaus seventy talents and a golden throne decorated
with precious stones also selected royal eunuchs are bestowed with generosity,
and a concubine, whose name was Pannychis, was given as a gift and accepted.
Likewise by order of the king his relatives presented Archelaus with magnificent
gifts, nor was any member of his household without gifts, to all of whom of his
Herod bestowed great gifts according to the merits of each. With his important
people he followed him returning to his own kingdom all the way <B>[p. 94]</B>
to the most splendid city of Syria Antioch by name. Alexander had escaped except
that a man much more practiced in the tricks of Archelaus plunged himself into
Judaea, Eurycles by name of the Spartan race, excessively greedy for wealth and
a despiser of those things connected with work, when a greater hope of attaining
it glittered. Finally not satisfied with the Spartan opportunities he turned his
mind to royal extravagances and a master of hunting having attacked Herod with
rich gifts he prepared the place for a most ample remuneration, and having
gained what was richer by far than he had presented he was however not
satisfied, unless insatiably cruel and with impious partisanship he had won over
the favor of the king to himself. And so in this manner and enjoying the
friendship of the Greeks by praising the king to his household and by his
proclaiming to all, not only what was unworthy of praise but was even involved
with crimes, he came in a short time into his intimate friendship, so that he
was chosen among the principal overseers of secrets, the foremost of the country
even offering support, because the Jews held the Spartans by race kindred to
themselves closely associated as brothers. He when he learned the faults of the
royal home, the mind of the father mistrusted and the hatreds of the brothers
for each other, with new tricks pretending himself dear to everyone so that he
was considered loyal to each, but he shaped his devotion according to the
character of the king and the reward of his services, so that he was more
closely bound to Antipater, he beset Alexander with tricks and snares, arousing
each with the appearance of a friend, that one destined for royal power by the
prerogative of age, this one gifted by his mother's noble birth superior by
right of noble birth, nor a consort equal to him with a child of a worthless
seduction. Captured by which Alexander as <B>[p. 95]</B> the younger, who took
delight in the things which were being said to him, did not weigh those things
carefully, which again were being fabricated about him before Antipater, he
poured himself out to the hired worker to Antipater and he opened his mind to
his betrayer with his easily moved nature and incautious affection, lamenting
his father the originator of misfortunes for him, who snatched away his mother,
brought shame on the kingdom, because he wished to turn away to himself from his
grandfather and the marks of distinction of his ancient lineage the things owed.
The legitimate to be defrauded of the right of succession, a bastard to be
preferred at the price of shame, but not long would the judgements of god be
quiet, that he who had killed an innocent wife that he should not be quickly
deprived of the rule gained through his wife. Which without delay the Spartan
took to Antipater, and also Aristobolus having been tricked that he would be
tied by the nooses of the same complaint, and for a price he insinuated the
piled up things to the king saying himself to have been unable to keep such a
great crime in silence and for the service of hospitality himself to display his
gratitude to the light, that the sons were proceeding to seize him, unless he
had called them back by the pretense of faithful advice, that the father would
have long since been killed by the sword of Alexander and the kingship made
vacant for unworthy heirs. Nor to Alexander was this a parricidal atrocity to
religion, who considered in the place of the greatest crime, that as yet they
had not avenged the death of their mother. Them to be agreed and to be pressed
by the grievance of those killed, that they should avenge that atrocious crime.
Offerings to the dead of those killed were owed, blood was to be exacted, and
their succession should not be contaminated, that the kingdom should be taken
from him who had killed their ancestors. He would be restored by the judgement
of Caesar not like as before from respect, but because Caesar would learn all
the secrets of the king, <B>[p. 96]</B> the wealth obtained by blood, the
province undermined. Themselves would recall from below their grandfather and
would demonstrate the harsh death of their mother, that a foreigner might be
elected as successor to the kingdom. Eurycles aroused the king, Antipater
however considering a hint from just one to be of small account instigated many
other accusers of the brothers also, who said talks to have been undertaken with
the one time leaders of the cavalry of the army Jucundus and Tyrannus, ambushes
to have been prepared for the king from the resentment of dismissal, danger upon
his neck unless he should quickly take precautions. Indeed Herod did not delay
and questions them seized immediately severely, but nothing is learned they
having admitted what was being alleged. And because such terrible things were
being fabricated with impunity before him, who was declaring himself the
punisher of crimes, and unconcerned with false accusations, they were not
lacking who devised plots of this kind, which they believed would be more
acceptable to the father. For indeed a letter was brought forth as if it had
been given to the commander of a fortress by Alexander and Aristobolus, that the
king having been killed he should provide them a place of taking refuge, while
they protected themselves with arms against hostile pursuers and were preparing
a defense with their remaining forces. The commander of the fortress is tortured
and confesses nothing. Nevertheless however not at all affected by any existing
proofs of crime as if guilty Alexander and Aristobolus are given into custody.
Eurycles having been given fifty talents is considered the source of safety and
life. Nor is it fit that Coos be silent, the most faithful of the friends of
Alexander, who had crossed into Judaea at the time of Eurycles, whom the king
thought should be interrogated as knowledgeable about the attempts of that one,
whether in truth they agreed with what the Spartan had had told about the young
men. Truly he <B>[p. 97]</B> gave an oath a sacrament having been interposed
that he had learned nothing from them whatever of this type, but it was of no
benefit to the youths. He put aside the question from himself, lest he should
reduce his dislike of the accusation and purge the dishonesty of Eurycles, if
having been questioned very severely he should make denial. As if not worthy
therefore to whom belief should be given he is excluded by Herod. For the good
father willingly heard his sons to be accused, he did not allow them to be
defended, he was delighted when they were accused, he was offended when they
were cleared. Finally the Spartan made rich by royal gifts when however he
reached Achaia he paid the price of his calumnies. Salome since she was unable
to clear herself of the charge that she had agreed upon marriage to Syllaeus the
Arab, when she betrayed the secret of her son in law warning her, that she
should take heed for herself that she might evade the anger of her brother,
because it was suspected from the hope of a future marriage she had announced
the plans of the king to the Arabs, she might be summoned, she earned the
requital of the transgression and twisted round all the storm of royal savagery
against the youths, submerged by which latest and unavoidable shipwreck they
paid the penalty. And so they are bound and because it was crueler than chains
the brothers are separated from each other, and Voluntius the tribune of the
military and Olympus a man from the friends of the king having been sent they
disclose the matter before Caesar. But he although offended, because the father
was asking punishment of his sons, not thinking however that the power should be
denied to the father gave him license against his children, but added the advice
that it would be better to consult, if a council should be convened of those
nearest the king and of those who were preeminent in the provinces and the
inquiry should proceed by the common verdict, whether or not any treacheries had
been prepared by the sons against the father; if they should be found guilty of
having threatened parricide let them be executed, but if in fact they should be
convicted of flight or some lesser crime, <B>[p. 98]</B> the punishment should
be more moderate. This having been permitted to him Herod with permission of
parricide but with the stipulation of a trial, admonished besides of moderation
hastens immediately to the city Beryton, which Caesar had prescribed for holding
the trial. The leading men come together according to the instructions given to
them by the Roman emperor Caesar. Saturninus and the legates hold sessions among
whom is the procurator Volumnius, then the relatives and friends of the king,
even Salome and Feroras and the first men of Syria. Archelaus alone the king of
Cappadocia is excepted accused of suspected of favor toward his son in law,
although the accusers of the youths and the ambushers of the judges were
present. But what is the appearance of a trial, when for the accused to be
present was not permitted to them and absent they were accused? For Herod had
noticed that if they were only seen, they would be absolved the attitude of the
men leaning toward sympathy, especially when there was a sign of natural favor,
then if any opportunity of defense was allowed to Alexander, he would easily
refute what was charged. And so they having been banished to the village of the
Sidonians the accusation was directed against them as if present. Plots prepared
against him were presented by the father, no proof was brought out, no evidence
of the attempts. The accuser adhered to what none refuted; deserted on all sides
he assembled classes of insults into hatred, which were thought harder to bear
than death by those who were sitting in judgement; but no one disputed, no one
dared to examine what was alleged by the father, what was commanded by the king.
The appearance of piety prejudged, the law of power terrified. Confident of a
sentence of victory he asked, ignorant that in a judgement of this sort he who
won would be more distressed, than they who were sentenced so harshly.
Saturninus finds the youths guilty because anything else was not permitted, but
<B>[p. 99]</B> he moderates the sentence asserting that it must be avoided that
two of he three brothers having been killed the death of the two might be
ascribed to the third brother. Indeed apprehensively but he spoke the reason,
that he was a supporter of peril for the brothers. Few of the many followed him.
Volumnius moreover spoke out for death and after him everyone, weighing with the
proposer what would be pleasing to such a king, they utter the sentence of death
indeed with diverse feelings but with like fate, whom this or fawning had
influenced or hatred had poured into, so that either the favor of the king was
aimed at or the barbarity of parricide was afflicted with a greater punishment,
who in his victory had reported nevertheless a bitter triumph about himself. No
one however spoke as if he shuddered at the deed and as if disturbed. And indeed
the appearance was of a stage, not the method of a court to condemn those not
present, to condemn without a witness, with only the law of nature, which is
accustomed to be derived for safety rather than for risk. All Syria was
astounded and all Judaea and the end of such a great tragedy was awaited with
astonished minds. For although the cruelty of Herod was well known, no one
however was able to believe, that he would persevere all the way to parricide.
But in him the savage force of mind was restrained neither by the sea or by
land. And so as if by the practice of those celebrating a triumph, that he
should drag his sons through hostiles, he made for the famous city of Tyre, from
that place he crossed by ship to Caesarea, carrying around the distressing
spectacle parricide, as long as any outward appearance of a bitter death was
found in his sons. All the army was stirred up, but they suppressed anger from
fear. There was in the royal army a man Tiro by name of the old military
service, having a son very close to Alexander, a very kind father and for that
reason dear to his child, inasmuch as the lure of
love especially for his own is a certain obligation of popular piety: <B>[p. 100]</B> favorably disposed with enthusiasm about young men and
also the sons of the king, because his son was loved by them. Who anger
conceived beyond measure, disturbed of mind, began to shout justice to be
crushed, truth to be shut out, reverence to be destroyed, the rights of
relatives to overturned, injustices to overflow the kindnesses of nature.
Finally advancing into the face of the king himself he threw in he was a
miserable wretch, who thought the most wicked should be believed against his own
sons. Feroras and Salome to be chosen as judges of a council: what faith could
be placed in them, who knew themselves to have been so very frequently convicted
by the king of capital offenses, or what else would they do except take account
of vengeance, so that destitute of suitable successors he would incline toward
one from the rest who was too weak who was easily led astray, because the royal
army itself would follow with hatred him, for whom the death of the two brothers
would be a release. There was no one whom pity of their harmless age did not
touch. Moreover many of the commanders do not now restrain their anger but
announce it. Having spoken their names he made an end of talking. Who having
been immediately seized with Tiro Tryfon from the servants of the royal court,
to whom the art and practice of barbering was at hand, suddenly by a certain
foolishness of mind makes evidence of himself, asserting it have been organized
and persuaded to him by Tiro that when according to custom he was shaving the
beard of Herod, he should press the razor to his throat until he had
accomplished his death, that would be for him a very great benefit which was
being promised from the gifts of Alexander. Tiro is questioned with his son,
also an examination of the informer is made. The former making denials, the
latter revealing nothing further, since clear confidence in things was lacking,
no proof was at hand, no evidence from documents, Tiro is ordered to be tortured
with more violent tortures. Then the son viewing with compassion the torments of
his father promises that he would reveal everything, <B>[p. 101]</B> if the
safety of his father were granted him, and pardon having been promised by the
king he suggests that his father persuaded by Alexander had prepared death for
the king. Most thought this made up for the occasion, that it should be
considered evidence of such a child to Tiro, others said it was spoken for
truth. But Herod judged doubtful things as reliable as if fearing that the
charge of parricide for himself might be ruined. And so the people having been
called together and the leaders collected concerning the treacheries discovered
he brings out into view his complaint and arouses the people to their death, and
thereupon Tiro together with his son and the barber are killed with stones and
clubs. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C42"></A>XLII.</SPAN>&nbsp;Alexander and Aristobolus sent to the city Sebaste which was not far
from the city Caesarea were strangled by order of the king. The sons of Miriamme
had this end. Whose deaths not having enjoyed long, the sons having been removed
Antipater without doubt coaxed the succession to himself, but soon a great
hatred of the entire people blazed up against him, because among all it was well
known that the brothers lay dead from his partisanship. besides there followed a
not moderate fear in him considering how large the family of the killed was
growing with time, since Alexander had left sons Tigranes and Alexander born to
him from Glafyra, to Aristobolus from Berenice, the daughter of Salome, Herod
and Agrippa and Aristobolus remained as survivors, and daughters Herodias and
Miriamme also, whom their sex did not hinder and desire of royal power stirred
up. Terrified by which things Antipater <B>[p. 102]</B> placed his hope in
trickery and cunning and more and more pledged each one with gifts and presents,
even friends and servants of Caesar he tried to entice to gratitude toward
himself with pay. But on the contrary those even who were of the household fell
back into opposition. For the king gradually with the process of time softened
toward his descendants born to Alexander and Aristobolus and put forth
repentance of the deed, since he felt compassion for those whose parents he had
killed. Finally his friends and those closest to him having been collected on a
certain day his face suffused with tears he said to them: "I see age to proceed
for me and without tears I am not able to look at these little ones, the
offspring of unhappy fathers, to whom I am a source of pain. I do not leave them
in a worse condition than that I took away their parents. But a certain calamity
took them from me, nature and compassion more and more commend them to me, the
one because they are my descendants, the other because they are destitute of
parents. The sons erred against their father, what have these descendants done
for their grandfather. I was a quite wretched father, I ought to be a more
concerned grandfather. I will try to look out for my decendants after me, would
that I had looked out for my sons. Truly the trickery of a joint enemy and foe
crept in them. It must be guarded against that the perils of the former do not
involve the latter also and from one wound I lost at the same time my sons, I
imperiled my descendants. Let us provide them the defenders which I took away.
And so I will betroth to the elder of the sons of Alexander your, Feroras,
daughter and I will constitute you a father to him, and moreover to your son,
Antipater, the daughter of Aristobolus, so that in this manner you become the
father of an orphan girl. My Herod received from Miriamme the daughter of
Hyrcanus will accept her sister. This," he said, "is my decision, that the
successors of my posterity may be united in turn to themselves by marriage
entered into, by which no one may be suspect to another and I may see my
descendants with more tranquil eyes than I saw <B>[p. 103]</B> their parents."
Which things having been said he joined the right hands of those mentioned and
having kissed each he wept. Which Antipater the others rejoicing received so
reluctantly, that he bound by a not all moderate concern immediately betrayed
his resentment even by his facial expression, because he discerned the applause
offered for the sons of Alexander, of king Archelaus and of Feroras, who held a
tetrarchy, to be stronger than for the others. He noticed hatred for himself to
increase, sympathy moreover to favor the grandchildren. Nor was he able to
receive the daughter of Aristobolus at home, lest, a sign of evil, she should be
offended by his lasting glances. He did not dare to approach his father, lest he
might rouse him easily swayed to every suspicion, if he should propose the
contracts of agreed on marriages should be dissolved. But nevertheless he
delicately presumed to plead that his father should give consideration to him,
that he should not be exposed to the power of two powerful men a king and a
tetrarch powerless with the bare name of royal power, he might cherish the honor
certainly, which he had declared would be conferred on his son, but the
appearance of royal power should not arrive to him, the actuality to them. And
truly he did not hold only the sons of Alexander and Aristobolus suspect, but he
considered all to stand in his way, whoever from the many wives of Herod even
though silent were seen as competent for the succession of the kingdom, whose
number was very great. And indeed nine wives had the status of royal consort,
from these only two were without children, to the others offspring were at hand.
Antipater exalted Dosides as parent, Herod Miriamme, Antipas and Archelaus were
the sons of Malthaces a Samaritan and Olympias a daughter, who by right of
marriage was joined to Joseph. Also Cleopatra a girl from Jerusalem had borne
Herod and Philip to Herod, Pallas had borne Phasael. There also <B>[p. 104]
</B>other daughters of the king Roxane and Salome, of whom Phedra was mother of
the first, Elpis of the second. There were also the two full sisters of
Alexander and Aristobolus whom Miriamme had borne from Herod, as we mentioned
previously. And so Antipater fearing the many descendants of Herod, although
with difficulty and the king having been much angered in his first attempts,
because the descendants having been deprived of paternal aid he disliked the
alliances arranged of close relations, in the end he brought about that the
daughter of Aristobolus was married to himself and a son born to himself was
married to a daughter of his uncle Feroras. He prevailed so much with flattery,
that he stopped the marriages that had been agreed upon. But on the other hand
when Salome wished to marry Syllaeus, not even with the aid of Livia who was the
wife of Caesar was she able to gain permission from her brother, but against her
will came together in marriage to a certain Alexander from the friends of the
king. And so the arrangements of the king having been overturned Antipater, as
if he taken heed of him as he had wished, exulted in mind and overcame all with
his cunning. However he was not able in any way to suppress the hatred for
himself, but inflamed it, inasmuch as he aspired to prepare protection for
himself with terror. Also he had joined to himself as a fellow worker of his
faction Feroras the brother of his father, whom not much later refusing to be
divorced from his own wife, to whom on account of injuries which that woman had
inflicted on his wife Dosidis he was considered very hostile, Herod banished
from his household. Feroras however having embraced the insult departed into his
own region, which he presided over as tetrarch, truly with the intention of mind
that he would never return to a living Herod; finally not even then, when he had
learned him <B>[p. 105]</B> to be affected with a severe illness and frequently
beseeching that he should come to him, he <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> thought he should be called upon because being about to die he thought certain
things should be imparted to him [to him, i.e., to Feroras]. Although struck by
the insult the king when beyond expectation he thrust aside his illness, however
from brotherly affection went to him, when he learned him sick, and carefully
looked after him and took him dead to Jerusalem and with great lamenting and
much pomp arranged his burial. But he did not however with these evidences of
attentive love exclude the conceived opinion, that he had eagerly assailed with
poison. He was even that cruel against his own family. Nor was the belief
difficult that he was able to kill his brother who had killed his sons. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C43"></A>XLIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;And so one of the killers of Alexander and Aristobolus found this end
of his evil doing, taking a beginning from which retribution crossed to
Antipater the originator of the wickedness. For insomuch as Herod, urged by the
complaints of freedmen, who asserted their patron to have been killed by poison,
while he inquires with anxious care, it having been learned that Feroras had
received from his wife a cup of a potion of Arabia, which was thought to be a
love potion, and that to have been poison, which had been given at the urging of
Syllaeus and immediately converted into destruction, it resulted in the
questioning of many. From which one of the slave girls under torture cried out,
that omnipotent god should transfer all suffering to the mother of Antipater the
mistress of the shameful acts of all. Through her the hidden meetings of
Antipater and Feroras carried out day and night, drinking to the point of
drunkenness, since them returning from dinner parties of the king there would be
drinking during entire nights. Which were <B>[p. 106]</B> not idle or free of
attempts of intrigue, the servants and attendants especially having been
removed, it was rightfully suspected, a long chain of meetings and evidence of a
conspiracy of long delay, which are more suspect to kings in the privacy of
solitude and the silence of night. It was arranged that Antipater would go to
Rome and Feroras to Peraea. That they were accustomed to confer frequently among
themselves was revealed, for the reason that after Alexander and Aristobolus
Herod would turn himself to their death. They were wretched who had thought that
Herod had disliked parricidal thoughts in them; he pursued heirs of the kingdom,
not rivals of power to have been destroyed but sharers of wretchedness, against
themselves every danger and hatreds to have crossed over. Not about to spare a
woman because of her sex, who had not spared Miriamme beloved of him and those
born from her. There was no other remedy for them except that they withdraw to
some place far away, where they would be freed by flight from the fury of such a
great beast. Frequent laments of Antipater deploring before his mother himself
to burn from hatred of the royal succession, since the cruel aspects of the
kingdom had especially settled upon him, that he is already not able to bear; he
was given up to final rites and extreme dangers. Not only the right of ruling
had died for him but of living also with the track rolled out of time. Age for
him was very mature, his head was already gray, on the contrary however his
father was growing younger, in vain to hope for his inheritance who perhaps even
now surviving was spared such a long time. What however would be the value to
him an aged heir of the succession, to whom the many children of Alexander and
Aristobolus like a certain hydra with heads renewed sprouted forth what had been
cut off. And by the testament of his father <B>[p. 107]</B> the common right
even was taken away, that the appearance of ruling having been given, whose
substitute he would be for a time, he could not place some one from his own sons
in his rule, but he had the necessity to pour back the kingdom to Miriamme's son
Herod. And so the appearance of rule was given to him not for enjoyment but for
peril, as he was an object of suspicion to the king retiring, would be a burden
to the king succeeding. Finally the king himself vigorous during a long old age
and intent upon the slaughter of his people would be the executor of his own
will, as no one would remain who could succeed. To act with great hatred against
his sons and with no less against his brother, who had given himself one hundred
talents so that he would not have converse with his uncle. And Feroras
responding: "In what way have we harmed him? Am I the successor?" Antipater
replied him to have no reasons for offense, but to make himself that, to be a
wild beast, who was not satiated even by deaths, and was not able to tolerate
any affection among his relatives to remain. "And would that everything having
been lost it might be permitted that naked merely living we should escape him,
but it is impossible" and so for the time their necessary meetings were hidden.
There would be a time when they would use mature vigor of mind and energetic
deliberation, and also the services of a protector at their right hand. These
things were answered by slaves placed under torture, and Herod believed,
especially since he had spoken to Antipater alone about the one hundred talents,
nor had any interpreter of his speech been present. And so set on fire with
anger he seized many for torture including innocent people, lest any of the
guilty should be missed. The Samaritan Antipater is brought in for torture, for
the reason that he was a manager for Antipater, and is tortured <B>[p. 108]</B>
in diverse manners. The investigation brings forth that poison had been sent
from Egypt through Antifilus a certain companion and it had been given by him to
Theudion a friend of Antipater, through him delivered to Feroras, to whom
Antipater the son of the king had assigned the carrying out, that while he
himself was living in the city of Rome his father Herod should be extinguished,
at which time there would be no suspicion of the absent person for the death
accomplished: but Feroras at the time had entrusted the poison received to his
own wife. Now too a dislike of the poison occurred in the wife of Feroras. The
king immediately ordered the wife of Feroras to come, to bring the poison. The
woman comes out as if about to bring what was being sought and throws herself
from the roof of the building by which she might avoid the punishment of the
double crime and by dying prevent evidence of guilt and the hardship of
questioning. But because a fatal retribution of the parricide was hastening to
Antipater, she did not fall upon the top of her head, in which event she would
easily have been killed, but she fell on another part of her body and death was
beaten back. The woman was stupefied however and astonished, because she had
fallen from a high place. Herod orders her to be revived for a brief while,
until she returned to herself, he promises pardon if she frankly revealed the
series of things done. It was not for nothing that she had thrown herself down,
but conscious of her great crime she had sought the avoidance of torture. All
crimes would be unpunished for her confessing, or tortures would be piled upon
her not confessing, burial itself would also be denied. But when she had
recovered a little: "And for whom" she said "will I still preserve the silence
of secrets with Feroras dead? I owed him the faith of being silent, for whom I
would not refuse tortures, if they were necessary. But he is now free from
sufferings and if there correction of pardonable error, he is free from blame.
What therefore <B>[p. 109]</B> compels to wrap truth in lies? Or that I do the
will of Antipater? I should spare him, not spare myself? Indeed we owe a great
recompense to the man who pulled us all into these sufferings with his crimes.
Hear o king, with god our protector who alone is the judge of truth for me, for
I proposed to conceal nothing, hear, I say, but first recall how you set weeping
with your brother at risk, that you might fulfill every duty of affectionate
brotherhood about Feroras. To which he having changed, when you departed, he at
once called me back to him and said: not a little I, wife, went astray from the
zeal and affection of my brother, who thus hated him loving me and wished to
kill him who was not tolerating the pain in my suffering. He was not able to
bear the chance that I pressed a debt not owed. I was fooled, I confess, by the
tricks of Antipater, but I bear the price of his thinking. You bring quickly to
me the poison which you have that was left by him and pour it out beneath my
eyes, that I may not carry a parricidal soul to hell. May it be absolution to
have repented what is shameful to have prepared. Quickly, I say, wife, that I
may outstrip death, since I cannot blame. Then I brought the poison and in his
sight poured it out, a little from it however I saved for myself who am in fear
of you, so that it would be a remedy, if it should be betrayed, that poison had
been prepared for this use." These things having been said she brought forward
the small box with that which remained of the poison. The mother of Antifilus
and his brother are subjected to questioning. They confess Antifilus to have
brought the box full of poison from Egypt, which he had received from <B>[p.
110] </B>a brother, who was abiding at Alexandria under the profession of
medicine. Now too Miriamme is seized as aware of the plots which are being
prepared by her husband, and that is made evident by the brothers confessing
under torture. Whence the junior Herod paid the price of his mother's daring,
whom substituted for Antipater in the succession of the kingdom the father who
had substituted the same thought must be deleted from his will. And this indeed
not trivial error of the senior Herod, that the crime of one being discovered
another is punished, but actually the punishment of the junior Herod was not
unjust. For it is seen as a precaution from heaven, as granted that his deeds
are not yet done rightly however as the price of future wickedness he should be
disinherited of the kingdom. For who would be able to tolerate him as king, who
as a tetrarch was so arrogant that he was unable to be tolerated? There is added
even another type of poisoning, that Bathyllus a freedman of Antipater delivered
to Feroras and his wife a compound of the secretions of serpents and the poison
of asps, so that if the first had not been strong enough for the death of Herod
they would use the second. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C44"></A>XLIV.</SPAN>&nbsp;There are discovered even letters composed against the brothers
Archelaus and Philippus. These were sons of the king who were established at
Rome, whom Antipater was attacking especially for this reason, that he saw them
gifted with not ordinary wisdom, upon whom the king bent a father's pride;
finally he had summoned them with letters that they should return home speedily.
And so Antipater thought to oppose them with his advantages and to attack with
his tricks, so that the expectation of the youths having been copied they might
be overshadowed by all the zeal of his own party. And so he made up letters in
the name of powerful men, whom while located in Rome <B>[p. 111]</B> he had
enticed into his friendship, he twisted others with a reward that they should
write, that the young men were attacking their father with hostile hatreds and
with too much complaint were lamenting the death of Alexander and Aristobolus.
And with secret tricks he forced upon his father through the household servants
of his wickedness letters of this type, with the same cunning with which he
formerly pretended to be a mediator in behalf of his brothers, with the pretense
of piety the protection of impiety he concealed the parricide. All of these
things having been brought into the open with the questionings that the life of
the father, the death of the brothers had been sought was spread out very
clearly by the letters, the decision is defined about their author that
punishment must be exacted, who had next put out with a false accusation that he
had attacked his brothers not as parricides but as rivals of a legitimate
succession, not that he should defend his father but that he should not have a
partner in the royal power. Meanwhile although the passages of seven months were
concluded between the documents of the crimes and the return of Antipater, no
information of the things done became known to Antipater, such great hatreds of
all boiled around him. Uncertain therefore of everything he writes from the city
of Rome he would be present without delay and he had been dismissed by Caesar
with the greatest honor. To which letters Herod quickly wrote back in reply that
he should hasten secure in the affections of his father, for whom not only had
nothing been diminished by his absence, but in truth even so much favor had
accrued, that by looking upon him the offense of his mother would be diminished.
For again he had sent her from the household, stripped of the gifts of royal
generosity, her partnership of complicity in the tricks of her son having been
discovered: to whom [<B>p. 112]</B> he made evident from the appearance of the
things written that he was about to relax his anger, from fear lest the
expulsion of his mother having been learned Antipater should stir up his
suspicions to taking precautions. And so arriving at Tarentum he first learned
about the death of Feroras and exhibited great sorrow there, which by certain
ones was attributed to the passion of piety, that he suffered unbearably the
death of his uncle. He however was bemoaning that the agent of the attempted
parricide was taken from him, not only that the preparation of the crime had not
gone forward but truly even the poison to have remained was a source of fright,
lest in some fashion it should come to the knowledge of the king and he should
make the existence of the crime public knowledge. He crossed therefore to the
port of Caesarea by no means devoid of serious worry and concern, since his
expelled mother gave her children a not insignificant example of condemnation.
But with his friends urging, who thought that everything which pertained to
Antipater should be considered secondary to the desires of his father, then his
nature having been considered, by which he was accustomed to easily bend with
his counsel even an averse father from his own feelings, exhorting that he
should promptly present himself to his father and the kingdom predestined for
him, which no one would dare with him present to oppose, but the occasion alone
of his absence might give rise to derision, that the mind of the king might be
considered to be able to be turned from him, and thus it must be quickly
prevented, lest by delaying more he should offend one desiring him or irritate
one suspecting him, he would put out distrust of himself, and so he trusted in
those persuading willingness more than necessities. Truly when he entered the
port looking around he saw not anyone in his way and he felt his presence to be
avoided like a plague, in the most crowded of places the greatest solitude,
since no one dared to run to meet him, <B>[p. 113]</B> some fearing, others
turning away --- and indeed at that time they had received authority so that
they did not conceal hatreds --- he began to think over his crimes within
himself and to be disturbed by pricks of conscience, there was no possibility of
flight or opportunity of escaping left to him, surrounded as if with nets and
held captive. He placed all hope in impudence, so that everything having been
dissembled he presented himself unforeseen to his father, he rushed into an
embrace, he depended on the obligations of piety. However the latter with hands
extended pushing back the one thrusting himself forward and turning away his
head, lest he should be touched by the kiss of the parricide, exclaimed this was
the madness of a parricide, "that you seek an embrace who know yourself hated,
you afflict your father with dread of yourself, you wrench out the sweetness of
living with the touch of your guilty body. You will therefore not touch lest you
will contaminate him whom you have attacked with wickedness. Cleanse yourself
certainly first, if you are able, wash off the things charged. I will not flee
from a trial nor will I allow a hearing to be denied you, I will not take to
myself an examination of you, lest I will leave you a pretext of arguing.
Conveniently Varus is at hand, before whom prepare your defense. Nor is there
reason for delay, tomorrow although rich with trickery and deceits you have the
opportunity of clearing yourself." But he struck dumb with fear of such a great
commotion did not dare to reply anything nor was he able, but having gone out he
wavered in mind, because he had learned nothing at all of those things which had
been done and brought forth before the king. However his mother and wife coming
to him later revealed everything. which things having been learned he began to
collect and prepare himself in mind, in what fashion he should meet the
accusation, diminish the offenses. On the following day all the relatives are
assembled together, <B>[p. 114]</B> and the friends of Antipater were present
for the judgement. All who had testified different things about Antipater were
ordered to be brought in. And also the letters of the mother of Antipater are
read, in which she had written to her son, that he should be aware of the
picture of his crimes that had been presented to his father, he ought by no
means to be present, unless somehow his hand should be summoned by Caesar, with
whose protection he should wall himself round nor should he commit to judicial
investigation who was assailed by the confessions of so many but should defend
himself with arms. The having been added to the previous items Antipater having
entered and throwing himself to the feet of his father beseeches, that he should
not hold him precondemned, himself to be confident, if a hearing were granted,
he would be free of crime if his father were willing. The father orders him to
be silent and comes before him with speech of this sort: "that by no just person
is a pardonable wickedness of Antipater able to be seen, I am quite certain, but
from that me to be more burdened before you, Varus, I think. For I fear you will
dislike me who have fathered parricides as sons, whom not even a father was able
to spare, although from this also I am more to be pitied because I loved even
such. But I am silent about them whom I myself irritated and I rejected their
just charges against this man. They had no cause of anger against me, except
that Antipater who had not been born into royal power was placed before them and
had received the prerogative of a royal consort. I thought however that I would
admit the elder by birth to guardianship over the younger, but I introduced an
enemy, who was jealous of the more noble, aroused the little boys, assailed the
weak, betrayed the unprotected. I do not deny the mistakes but it should be
excused rather than attacked. Indeed Antipater took them from me, he compelled
them to become plotters against me. I confess I grieved that those to whom I had
given the expectation of royal power, for whom I had reserved the succession,
plotted wicked actions against me, <B>[p. 115]</B> but in me they hated not the
father but Antipater. And so they perished to the grief of their father, to the
joy of Antipater. You ask, Varus, who killed them? Know whom their death
profited. The household was emptied of the son of a stepmother, the royal court,
which had many possible successors, opened to one for the succession. Nor was
his bloodthirsty spirit and impious mind satisfied with the death of the
brothers. After he did not have the brothers whom he had hated, he attacked his
father. I reflect within myself: I who prepared this protection of inheritance
for him, I am indeed seen to live too long for one disdaining him who is
retiring. I have learned what he wished, I took away the competitors of his
succession, he did not tolerate me delaying. He did not expect the kingship,
unless he attained it by parricide. He gave me this return, because I collected
the project and had given preference to him over those more noble. From whom
indeed had I taken as much as I had given to him? To whom I living had yielded
power, whom I had publicly by testament designated my heir, which is accustomed
to be dangerous for kings, as he will know he will succeed in some way. I gave
him fifty talents for enjoyment, I gave him departing for Rome three hundred
talents. I commended him to Caesar as if an only son, I reserved nothing for
myself, from which I should have feared parricide. But this armed him more for
parricide, because he saw himself as superior. What so great of evil did his
brothers commit, whom he forced to death? What evidence of this character
against them was uncovered, what kind of this sort was discovered? But he dares
to interrupt and roar with parricide and tries to roll up truth with trickery.
You beware, Varus, I give warning, beware his simulated tears and groans
composed by craft and not expressed from any grief. He is who took the feeling
of tenderness from me, when with pretended fear he warned me to beware of
Alexander, <B>[p. 116]</B> alleging the minds of many to agree with him, my
presence must not be rashly committed to all. He pretended himself to be looking
about at everything, to lead to the choice, to pick out and examine each one. He
was the guardian of my sleep, my agent of safety, in whom I placed confidence,
and with his services I lightened the pain from those killed. I thought that he
would return them to me, that he would take away the grief, that he would spread
goodness. He was my protector, whom I believed the guardian of my aged body. I
know not how I am alive, how I escaped such a great plotter, with which
blandishments he surrounded me, with which tricks he held me bound, so that I
would entrust myself to him alone, whom alone it behooved me to beware. It is
incredible to me that I escaped, nor do I seem to me to live but I think I
dream. Who indeed would believe either that he would be so ungrateful, to whom I
entrusted all power over me, or that I would be able to escape if Antipater did
not wish it? I think however me to have been made safer from grace. But what
thing. evil. my misfortune, makes them rise against me whom I most loved! I
lament the trouble of my household, Varus, I mourn the loneliness, I groan over
the force of such great pain. But however so great is the bitterness if the
parricidal wickedness, that I allow no one to escape me, whosoever thirsts for
my blood, not even if evidence of attempted parricide is brought forth against
every son of mine." When he was saying these things, the voice of the speaker
was broken equally by anger and pain. Immediately Antipater raising his head ---
for as if struck and wounded by a severe wound he lay before the feet of his
father --- no thinking to stand up he said: "You indeed, father, angrily accuse,
but there is no greater defense for me than the evidence of your accusation,
that I was always the guard of your safety. <B>[p. 117]</B> You have furnished a
defense for me in the solemn testimony of the person accusing. For how am I a
parricide whom you yourself admit to be your protector, or how circumspect and
astute whom you argue to be the contriver of parricide, since to have planned
that is extreme foolishness and execrable among men and before god cannot be
unpunished? Indeed from the example of my brothers I was able to learn that
there is no way of escape from such a great crime, because a crime of this type
neither finds a hiding place nor escapes punishment, seeing that they paid the
penalty for such great malevolence against you. But, as you say, a certain
jealousy drove them to parricide, because they saw me to be preferred by you,
whom the nobility of their mother's birth gave pride, so that they claimed that
the kingdom was owed to them as if by maternal succession and they demanded it
back as if it had been snatched away by you. Why would I do such who knew not to
hope for a kingdom unless from you, to seek your verdict, to please you alone?
What indeed was there that would impel me to dare anything against your safety?
The hope of a kingdom? But I was a king; suspicion of your hatred? But I was
loved; the pain of injury? But I was given preference. If fear alone of my
preference armed them to parricide, I am absolved, because those preferred do
not know how to plan parricide but hate it. Unless perhaps some fear from you
compelled, but truly I, as your voice is a witness for me, knew nothing except
to fear in behalf of you, for why would I fear who was the agent of your safety
and the guardian of quiet? Or did a lack of money and poverty drive me, which is
accustomed to persuade those in want to robbery? But you had given what not only
was more than sufficient for the present but even for all time, and you had sent
me rich to Rome, so that the kings of kings might proclaim about you that there
was the beginning of rule, not of wealth. Finally I grasped Fabatus that
governor of the Roman state and intimate of Caesar for you and so changed him,
who had been bribed by Sylleus with a great amount of money that he should
attack you, that he became your <B>[p. 118]</B> defender and a betrayer of his
inciter. Through whom else, father, have plotters against your safety been
detected? How therefore I a parricide who seized Corinthus the guard of your
body hiding, I removed him lying in ambush, I brought him denying to confession?
I was able not to consider parricide and to have the profit of parricide if I
had been silent. But if I had the brutality of beasts, if the savagery of fierce
wild animals were in me, however I was able to tame this with your great
kindnesses, so that I placed no help except in assistance of your safety, in
front of all I reported only love for you, I protected you with my body, I would
contain you in my inmost organs if it were possible to be done. You displayed
before more noble sons one less noble from his mother's stock, his mother also
an exile from the kingdom you summoned into the kingdom, you held me not already
as the successor of rule but as if a partner. Oh wretched me to to whom so much
of good things poured itself, that it kindled envy. Oh stupid me, who left you,
father, if place was given for hatred and power to plotters, for while I delayed
long for your safety, I gave up mine, I still have nothing which I may add for
myself. You, father, ordered me to go away, I went abroad for you, father, lest
Sylleus should confound your old age, lest he should deprive you living of the
kingdom, lest he should attack your well being before Caesar. Rome is a witness
for me of piety, Caesar also the ruler of the world and the censor of all and
the judge of my breast was accustomed to call me "a lover of his father."
Testify, Caesar, before whom alone I would be able to do harm, what I spoke
before you about my father, testify, I say, for me, you who have spoken about
others, you thought I was not concealing parricide but investigating it. Oh if
your presence breathed upon me! But you are absent and located far away, and
<B>[p. 119]</B> and without you I am being judged by my father. You are absent
but however are present in your letters. I offer your writings, which parricides
are accustomed to fear, I carry your letter which they are accustomed to bring
out who desire parricide not to lie hidden. Accept, father, the letter of
Caesar, he may teach you who has long punished; accept the writings of Caesar
stronger than all arguments. What you have long used for retribution, use now
for redemption. I offer them as the chief witnesses of my innocence, that right
hand has never failed you, that right hand of Caesar placed a crown upon you not
took it away, that mind of Caesar presented again to you that kingdom which you
had cast away. Caesar was able earlier to dislike me, if he had found me the
like of my brothers, but he recognized and pronounced me the interpreter of
goodness. Unless I had been at Rome, Sylleus would have won. For that I am being
judged today, for that I wretched pay out a penalty. Be mindful, father, that I
did not sail away voluntarily. I saw a pit of plotters already to be prepared
for me, I preferred however, father, me rather than you to be put at risk. I do
not however tremble at the risk to safety, but before you, father, I grieve me
to be at risk as if your enemy. I am put in peril however, if before you the
depositions of Caesar are challenged: I make use therefore of these evidences of
my defense. I call upon Caesar not as if I must be heard but I invoke him as if
I have been absolved. But if you think a judgement must be enforced, behold me,
father: I came to you after Caesar, I hastened to you from Caesar, would that I
had never been absent from you! But you, father, not knowing the dangers cast me
out ordering me to go. I am at hand, father, I think for your safety the truth
must be investigated not carelessly about worthless witnesses. They do not
prejudge who <B>[p. 120]</B> are able to fear tortures, nor who are able to
disdain them, every man is deceitful, says Scripture. I offer the incorruptible
testimony of the elements. I come to you through the seas and the lands never
suffering anything. As a parricide I ought not to have escaped if I were guilty.
The sky acquits me before you, father, which did not strike me with lightning,
the sea which did not submerge me, the land which did not swallow me. Through
these I come to you safe, father, which they are not accustomed to escape even
who are not parricides. The land devoured Dathan and Abyron with its wide open
jaws, but they had not grasped after the fruitful father. The earth suspended
Abessalon fleeing in the branches of its tree, lest he should reach to his
father, if he had arrived to whom, he would have escaped. I came to you and as
yet I am in peril. David punished his parricide, because he was not able to save
him, I do not desire to be vindicated about my enemies and false accusers, that
I might call them to tortures. Let them gain the punishment of false
accusations. I ask one thing, father, that you not put trust in another's
tortures, seek against me from me myself. Hang up your guilty party, let the
investigation of truth proceed into my internal organs, let the instruments of
torture penetrate into my body and innermost parts, let the blood flow forth
which is accustomed to proclaim parricide, let the fires be brought to the
guilty limbs, why do you hesitate, father? If you forbear, you pronounce me
innocent, if you refrain from torture, you acquit me of crime. It is not
parricide, which is thought worthy of a simple death. Or if you are lenient as
to a son, have compassion for the members born from you, they are not your
members which are the attendants of cruelty." When he said this, he made an end
of speaking with great weeping and doleful groans and with great wailing bent
Varus and all to pity. Herod alone was moved to no tears and himself <B>[p.
121]</B> intractable to pardon refrained from weeping, intent upon questioning,
seeking vengeance. </P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C45"></A>XLV.</SPAN>&nbsp;Nicolaus by order of the king followed the speech of Antipater, who
astutely responded to his cleverness and led away from pity those influenced by
renewing against Antipater the hatred of the murder of the brothers, urging that
if pity moved any one, those ought to be pitied, who killed by his trickery were
seeking vengeance, if they absolved someone, all the household of the king would
be brought into peril, brothers, relations, parents, the king himself, whose
safety he had not spared. And so turned about to the cleverness of the speakers
as if in conclusion he were rousing up from the lower regions the souls of those
killed, who would fill the low seats with miserable complaint, themselves
innocent to have died burdened by bribed witnesses, by contrived letters, by
dishonest words. The father tricked to have believed his son, whom he did not
think to be able to lie about his brothers. Him to offer now his punishments,
who had not put faith in the tortures of his brothers, who bound them laden with
chains, lest they be present for examination. A verdict to have been brought
against them while they were absent, while they were located far away, to have
been killed, lest their father should show compassion for them. And so there
would be nothing left, if this one should escape who was trained to pour
parricidal poisons into the entrails of his people, to change the minds of men,
who even stirred up Feroras always the most loving of his brother Herod into his
murder by a deadly parricide. When Nicolaus had added many other things to this
for the purpose of arousing commotion, when he brought his speech to an end,
Antipater was asked by Varus, if he wished to respond. He returned nothing
other, except: "God is my witness that I have harmed nothing." Then Varus
ordered the poison to be brought forward and it to be given to one of those who
had already been sentenced to the penalty of death, which having been drunk he
immediately died. It was reported about this <B>[p. 122]</B> to Caesar and
Antipater is led into chains by the command of his father. He as not yet free of
snares. For besides he tried an attempt against Salome letters having been sent,
which Antipater had composed in the name of Salome, full of abuse against the
king and had ordered to be carried to Acme a maidservant of Julia, who was wife
to Caesar, by a manservant of Antifilus, which delivered to her Acme transmitted
to the king. And the fraud almost resulted in the destruction of the woman, if a
letter had not been discovered of Acme to Antipater, which revealed the trick,
written in this fashion: "as you wished, I wrote to your father and and I sent
those letters, and I do not doubt the king will rise up into danger of his
sister. You having gotten the affect wished for make good the payment." These
letters having been discovered the king was led into the suspicion, that
Alexander with a like method had been attacked by a letter composed by his
brother, and exasperated by by too great agitation he entered into severe
illness. Seeing himself to be pressed by which danger he wrote in his will
Antipas one of his sons to be the heir of the state preferred to Archelaus and
Philippus his oldest children, because Antipater had made them also mistrusted
by their father with his tricks and stratagems. To Caesar he bequeathed one
thousand talents presents and gifts having been added, upon Caesar's wife and
sons, freedmen and friends he bestowed five hundred. And he did not leave his
sister Salome without his gifts. The illness proceeded to worsen and with the
passage of time became extreme, which his feeble old age with its
disadvantageous circumstances aggravated daily, in fact his body was burdened
with not less than seventy years, he bore the affliction with frequent sorrow of
mind, having been wounded by so many parricides, which either to have discovered
in his sons <B>[p. 123]</B> or to have borne was a great distress. The fury of
his illness was incurable however, because the surviving Antipater was feared.
The disregard also was worse each day, the statues of Caesar and the likenesses
of animals adjacent to the temple contrary to law were dragged down, the
originators especially being Iudas and Mathias instructors of the youth, who
said the time to have come to them for conspiring, by which the injury of the
violated law would be avenged. The wretch would give punishment, who thought to
be right anything that was permitted to power, not influenced by reverence but
lifted up by arrogance to have exercised as lawful in the interior of the temple
the desire of doing what he wished. And although the divine power would hasten
retribution, it would be seen as noble if besides they demonstrated for the holy
temple their freedom in defending the observation of the paternal rite. Nor
should anyone be restrained by fear of danger, since to die for the ancestral
law was worthy of immortality. And the first attacking tore down the golden
eagle affixed above the roof of the gate, arrested and taken to the king when
they were questioned, desiring to obey what they had committed such a great
crime, they responded: "the ancestral law." And again to one asking on what they
were so happily relying, since they summoned for the penalty of death, they
replied, for the rewards of piety and devotion, the remuneration of which would
pay those seeking death in behalf of the ancestral rite. He was no longer able
to bear the consistency of the response, but made above his illness by anger, so
that he overcame his weakness, he proceeded to an assembly of the people. And
there reporting them to the people as if guilty of sacrilege he began to accuse,
that more serious things than such as had been done were suspected. Which even
if <B>[p. 124]</B> they should not be proved, however all suffering punishment
every man fearing for himself of the originators who were seized entreated, that
it not be proceeded against the rest, lest the investigation trouble many both
outsiders and the innocent. And so having been asked against those present he
spoke the sentence that they should be burned alive. From then his misfortune
increased and the force of severe sickness consumed his entire body with diverse
sufferings. His fever was severe, his itching was intolerable, the pains of his
internal organs were continuous and without intermission, the middle of the
large intestine was troubled, his feet were bothered by dropsy, the hidden parts
of the body swarmed with maggots, spasms of the entire body, painful gasping and
sighs were evidence of some trouble, which demanded the punishments of unjust
parricide and sacrilegious condemnation. He did not however concede in mind and
from desire of living struggled with his disease. The warm waters of Callirrhoe
sought across the Jordan profited nothing. The Dead Sea bringing cures to many
held the sick man without any progress. When while he was being kept warm with
much oil relaxed with slackened body he turned up his eyes with the appearance
of those dying, and his voice failed and feeling did not remain, but aroused by
the noise of those shouting he recovers, And desiring to return to his own
territory when he came to the neighborhood of the place which was called
Jericho, he was bothered continually by black bile and being threatened in a
certain way by death itself he thought up an atrocious crime, by which the
people would be cast out as if into the lower region itself. For long since
ordering those who were the most noble from all Judaea to be assembled, so that
from each village they should come together into one place, when the order had
been complied with, he ordered them to be confined inside <B>[p. 125]</B> the
racecourse and Salome and her husband Alexa having been summoned he ordered a
legacy of blood, asserting that his death would be a joy to the peoples of the
nation of Judaea and therefore himself to have thought up, a reason why his
funeral would be magnificently celebrated; to demand from them, that when he had
exhaled his last breath, they should immediately order them all to be killed who
were being held confined. Thus there would be no one in all Judaea and all his
household, to whom his death would be unlamented, since he had left grief the
inheritance to all of his house, who while they lamented their own deaths would
seem to pay respects to the funeral rites of the king, and so the happiness of
the public religious celebrations would be prevented by domestic anguish. And
lest perhaps by a wicked command ordered the execution should be abandoned, he
ordered fifty drachmas each to be given to the soldiers, so that with the bribe
of so great a crime given the soldiers would not refuse this deadly work, the
horror of the execution would be compensated by the benefit of the remuneration.
Already it came near the punishments of the great misfortune, but he desired the
responses of the sad legation, which reported about Acme that punishment had
been exacted for the grievance of Herod, Antipater also had been convicted of
parricide and sentenced to death, however if to him driven from his native land
the father might wish to grant the power of flight from the kingdom, Caesar
giving consideration to the crime would would order the sentence, leaving the
decision to piety. Nature had cancelled the necessity of parricide. For restored
for a short time the power having been permitted him of acting as he wished,
while he considers the mode of his death, distracted by pains he had desired to
anticipate the day of his own death. And so he asked for an apple and also a
knife, so that accustomed to slice the apple with it he might receive some
refreshment, and lifting himself briefly supporting himself on the couch he
lifted up his right hand desiring to stab himself, but <B>[p. 126]</B> Achiabus
ran up and prevented the blow, and the entire house resounded with lamentation,
so that it was thought outside that Herod had died. Antipater rejoiced at the
sound of wailing and demanded from his guards that he be released from chains.
But the guard placed for this duty not only refused what was asked, but even
announced it to the king. He shouting the still living assassins to have behaved
insultingly toward him directed that they should kill Antipater, and ordered him
killed to be buried in Hyrcania. And again he changed his will and made
Archelaus the older of the brothers king, he left Antipas a tetrarch. And so
outliving Antipater by five days he died, having ruled the kingdom for thirty
seven years, from when he was ordered to rule by the Romans, from the time when
however he destroyed Antigonus his competitor for the kingdom, he spent thirty
four years in in supreme power, would that he was as happy in his domestic
experience as in his public successes. For so outside thus favorable things blew
upon him, so that as a commoner he was admitted into royal power, and there
having experienced very many courses of years, which was difficult, his practice
of rule safe he died leaving to his children the succession of rule, which he
himself had not received from his parents, but in his household the most
unfortunate of men, which he filled with sorrow and the bitter blood of his
relatives. But however he did not achieve the execution of his greatest cruelty,
in this alone Salome disregarding the previous mockery of their crimes, because
she sent away all those whom the king had ordered to be killed, saying the king
to have later repented of his deadly order and the previous orders having been
recalled to have ordered that all should be sent away to their own territories.
</P>
<P><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C46"></A>XLVI.</SPAN>&nbsp;Then afterwards an assembly having been made in the amphitheater of the
soldiers and the rest of the people an announcement <B>[p. 127]</B> was made
about the death of the king. Ptolomaeus came forward, who was among the most
faithful of the friends of the king, whom he had clung to to the end, and
carrying his ring, which he took from the finger of the dead person, he extolled
the king and warned the people to be tranquil. He opens a letter in which having
beseeched the most faithful he exhorted the soldiers, that they should show
benevolence and gratitude to his successor. The records of his will having been
opened it is read aloud that Philippus was named heir of the region of
Trachonitidis and the neighboring places, Antipas was named a tetrarch, and
Archelaus the king, thus however that his ring was to be carried to Caesar and
to him was reserved the approval and executions of all his arrangements, and
then finally his will would be established if Caesar had approved it. The
remaining things he ordered to be observed according to his previous wills.
Immediately the acclamation of the soldiers arose applauding Archelaus, he was
at once surrounded by a crowd of attendants, they promise good will, they pledge
loyalty. After this his funeral rites were suitably and magnificently arranged
all the display of the royal riches was sent ahead and all the multitude of the
funeral procession, his funeral couch was entirely of gold and distinguished
with jewels, the coverlet glittering with purple, the body overspread with a
purple robe, which a buckle shining with precious stones bound up, a diadem
rested on his head and above that was a golden crown, a scepter in his right
hand, so you would have thought him living. A column of Thracians preceded and
the German and Gallic bodyguards of the king preserved military rank. In the
same manner girded with arms as if they were going forth to battle, but sad of
face similar troops followed. The remaining troops preceded <B>[p. 128]</B> with
the customary decorations and with the usual grooming the leaders and centurions
together accompanying. Furthermore fifty slaves and freedmen of the royal
household sprinkled aromatic spices so that the entire way was redolent with an
agreeable odor. The sons of the king and a great force of relatives surrounded
the bier. He was buried in Herodium as he himself ordered. Which was two hundred
stadia from that place, in which he found the end of life, escorted through such
a great distance with the great subservience of all but not with the equal
affection of all. For fear had not extorted devoted service, the grief within
himself at least had free expression. Herod had this end. </P>
