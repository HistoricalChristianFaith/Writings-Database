<p align="left">I<SPAN class="small">NTRODUCTORY NOTE</SPAN>.</p>
<p align="left">In a recent Hugoye (<a href="http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol9No2/HV9N2Depuydt.html">http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol9No2/HV9N2Depuydt.html</a>)
there was a list of Syriac Mss at Yale. I noticed this item in it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maruta of Maiperqat, On the Council of Nicaea&nbsp;<br>
  Rn/M36. &#8212; A paper booklet consisting of two quires (Clemons,
  &quot;Checklist,&quot; No. 241). The hand is the same as No. 12. Contents:
  Maruta of Maiperqat, On the Council of Nicaea. Baumstark, Geschichte,
  53,27-54,10. One quire contains the text, the other a handwritten English
  translation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Now unpublished English translations are something which I think
should appear online, where they can promote interest among the general public.<br>
<br>
So I wrote to Yale and found that this was just a modern booklet of some 14
pages. I did ask them if they could just run a digital camera over it -- it
wouldn't take long to press a shutter 28 times, after all -- but they've been
saddled with a rogue supplier of reproductions and wanted $216 (!) to do this.
However they did kindly supply me with a rather terrible printoff from a
microfilm, albeit very slowly.</p>
<p align="left">This contained the Syriac text, in the East Syriac hand,
followed by the following translation.&nbsp; The microfilm contained a
book-plate indicating that the booklet was given by a certain A.H.Wright to the
American Oriental Society.&nbsp; There were also two footnotes in a different
hand, marked with an asterisk and a cross, rather than a number.&nbsp; These
were signed AHW, and I would infer from this that he did not make the
translation but acquired it from elsewhere.</p>
<p align="left">A google search revealed <a href="http://bahai-library.com/books/tn/">this
reference</a> to a book, <i>B&acirc;b und seine Secte in Persien</i>, written by a
Dr. A. H. Wright of the American Mission at Ur&uacute;miyya, Persia, which was
contributed by J. Perkins, also of the aforesaid Mission, to the German Oriental
Society, and published in Vol. v of the <i>Z. D. M. G.</i> (Leipzig, 1851, pp.
384-385).&nbsp; This would appear to be our A.H.Wright: Austin H. Wright, who in
1852 assisted Justin Perkins to publish an edition of the OT Peshitta at Urmiah.</p>
<p align="left">David G.K. Taylor added in the Hugoye list that there is also an
extensive German translation of the whole of this text by Oscar Braun, <i>De Sancta Nicaena Synodo. Syrische Texte des Maruta von
Maipherkat nach einer Handschrift der Propaganda zu Rom &Uuml;bersetzte</i>, (Muenster 1898), iv, 128pp. (What we have in the newly available English
translation is only a part of the whole work.) There are some illuminating notes regarding the problematic Syriac manuscript base of Braun's
translation in Robert Murray's indispensable 'Symbols of Church and Kingdom' (p.34 and esp. n.2).&nbsp;</p>

<p>
A brief account of the council (of Nice),
as given by Marutha of Meparkat by direction
of the Patriarch Isaac.
<p>
The blessed Apostles, when they went forth
to proclaim the glad tidings of the glorious
Gospel of Christ, did not establish 
creeds and confessions, but their main
care was to turn men from the worship
of idols to the worship of the holy
cross <a href="#*">*</a>; and that those, who were discipled should
keep themselves from fornication, from the
uncleanness of things offered to idols, from
strangled and from blood.  But when their 
message went forth into all the world and
their words into all the earth, and the faith
of Christ was spread abroad in every country
through their instrumentality and Jews [21]
and Gentiles received and became subject 
unto it, Satan showed his wickedness and his
servants became manifest and clothed themselves
with disgrace and shame; and since the evil
one gained nothing in his first war but
reproach, he set his forces in battle array
again with more bitterness than ever, and 
spread wide dissentions, controversies, and 
confusion among those who were invited to
Heaven, and introduced numerous heresies into
the church.  So that the number of heresies equalled the number of bishops and right
was oppressed and the truth was persecuted.
True believers diminished and heretics increased.
Then, like the rays of the Sun 
in the midst of dark clouds, was seen the
faithful crown of the pure kingdom of
the blessed Constantine, the holy emperor and [20]
worthy of immortal honor, who, being
stimulated by zeal from the true faith, wrote to
the most excellent and orthodox Bishop of Jerusalem,
Alexander, to wit, "I have learned from
the Holy Scriptures that out of Zion shall go
forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
You will then immediately upon
the reception of this my royal epistle, come to
my presence, for it is necessary to the Holy
Church, that the true faith of Christ should
issue from those sacred temples (of Jerusalem).
I have two Bishops who give me trouble daily, and
by their controversies produce confusion and irregularity.
It has not been practicable for me
hitherto to give attention to this subject in
consequence of the many wars which we have 
been prosecuting against our enemies, and
especially against Jews and Heathens who are without [(unnumbered)<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>]
the Christian fold.  But now that we are at
peace with all around, and both friends and
enemies are subject to our authority, I have
no other care than to settle the disputes
which have arisen in the church.  We now
wait for your arrival in order that we
may learn from you the truth and then proceed
to action.  You will of course do as
we have directed, and we desire your prayers
in behalf of our kingdom.
<p>
When the blessed Alexander received the letter,
ordering hum to proceed to the Capital, he
immediately made preparations for his journey and
fearing to go by land on account of the heretics
that he would meet with, he selected a ship
to go by sea.  The very day that he went on 
board, a man appeared unto him in a dream
and said to him, "You will not see the face of [(unnumbered)]
the earthly king, for you will be taken speedily
to behold the face of the heavenly king."  He then
wrote a letter in relation to the true faith of
Christ, that the emperor desired to learn, which
he sealed and committed to Priest Makaris to
carry by land to the Capital.  Alexander then
proceeded by sea and arrived at an island called
Pataia.  There he was seized by the heretics,
who made him large promises if he
would join himself to their party.  But as
he did not listen to their alluring words, they
sent his soul to the presence of the Lord, with
excruciating torture.  He was thus honored
with the crown of martyrdom for the sake of
the words of Christ, and departed from this
world of sorrow.    When the Emperor Constantine
received the news of his death, he was
overwhelmed with grief, and when the letter of
Alexander [19]
which was brought by Priest Makaris
reached hum, he burned with divine zeal
and wrote the following order to all the
Bishops in the world; viz. Constantine Augustus
Caesar, Constantine Autocrat and king, to every church
under heaven, obedient and not obedient to Christ
our king, be peace.  Give heed all of you to
this order, and delay not to assemble in General
Council at the city of Nice in the province
of Bithynia for the investigation of the true
Christian faith.  Let not any delay to come either
of those who agree in sentiment or of those
who disagree, and let no man prevent another's
coming that he may declare his faith in the council
in the presence of all the Bishops, in order
that there may be one mind and one bond of
faith and perfect unity, and that the whole church may
stand in one body with an undivided faith [18]
with one perfect will, and that no man may
transgress or despise the command of the church
or state.  We will allow one year and two months
which will be sufficient time for all to assemble
from every quarter.  In the month of
October let all the Bishops be found in Nice,
a city of Bithynia, which is in the neighborhood
of our Christian Capital.  May you all be
prospered in the Lord."
<p>
As the presence of all Bishops whether in the dominions
of Constantine or not of them was
desired, Mar Shimeon, Bar Sabae, Patriarch
of Seleucia and Ctesiphon was desired to be
present, but on account of the disturbed state
of the surrounding countries he was prevented
from going.  He wrote a letter, which he 
forwarded by the hand of Priest Shahdost, of
the following purport: "If it were not that [17]
the heathen are thirsting for my blood, I
should by all means attend and be blessed 
by the ecclesiastical council and by the pure
state of Constantine.  But whatever the
Bishops in council assembled who have been
persecuted for the sake of the true faith may
do, I shall gladly agree to."
<p>
When the Bishops had assembled according to the
royal command, the king read the declaration
of faith, which Alexander, Bishop of Jerusalem
had written and forwarded by the hand of Priest
Makaris.  It was read in the presence of
2048 Bishops, but only 318 of these assented to 
it.  The king then took his ring, sceptre and
sword and gave them into their hands, saying,
Here is given to you authority over the
whole church, over ecclesiastical and civil affairs,
and over all the orders in church and state. [16]
Do whatever you please, and God will require at
your hands an account of the sons of the church.
The General Council having thus received
authority from the king, the fathers directed that
there should be gradations in the assembly and
that each Bishop should sit in his place according
to his rank.  Chairs were there made for
all and the king entered and sat with them.  He
kissed the spots which were the marks of Christ
in their bodies.  Of the 318 fathers, only 11 were
free from such marks, whose name were Absalom, 
Bishop of Edessa, and son of Mar Ephrem's sister,
Jonah of Raikson, Mara of Dora, George of
Shegar, Jacob of Nisibis, Marouta of Mepairkat, 
John of Goostia, Shimon of Diarbekir, 
Adai of Agal, Eusebius of Caesarea and 
Joseph of Nicomedia.  But all the others
were more or less maimed in their persecutions [15]
from heretics.  Some had their eyes taken
out; some had their ears cut off.  Some had
their teeth dug out by the roots.  Some had the 
nails of their fingers and toes torn out; some were
otherwise mutilated; in a word there was no
one without marks of violence; save the above-named
persons.  But Thomas, Bishop of Marash
was an object almost frightful to look upon; he
had been mutilated by the removal of his eyes, 
nose and lips; his teeth had been dug out and both 
his legs and arms had been cut off.  He had
been kept in prison 22 years by the Armanites [Armenians]
who used to cut off a member of his body or mutilate him in some way every year, to
induce him to consent to their blasphemy,
but he conquered in this fearful contest to
the glory of believers and to the manifestation of the
unmercifulness of the heretics.  The fathers took
him with them to the Council and when [14]
the king saw him, he fell down upon the 
ground and worshipped <a href="#+"> +</a> him saying, "I worship
thee, O thou martyr of Christ, who art
adorned with many crowns."
<p>
To describe the doings of the Council from
the beginning to the end is a great task,
for the fathers were in sessions three years engaged in discussions about every kind of 
heresy.  Protracted controversies took place
between the fathers and the heretics, once party
giving their views in writing and the other
answering them in the same manner.
<p>
The following Confession of Faith was agreed upon
by the 318 holy fathers, who assembled in Nice
a city of Bithynia in the time of the Emperor
Constantine, on account of the blasphemous
doctrines of the accursed Arius.     We believe [13]
in one God, Father Almighty, maker of things
visible and invisible; and in one Lord, Jesus Christ,
the Son of God, only Begotten and first born of all
creatures; who was born of the Father before all
worlds and was not created; true God, of the true God,
of the nature of the Father, and by whom the
worlds were made and all things created, and 
who for our sakes and for our salvation descended
from Heaven, took a bodily form by the
power of the Holy Ghost, and became man; was
conceived and born of the Virgin Mary, suffered
and was crucified in the days of Pontius Pilate,
was buried and rose again the third day as
it is written, ascended to Heaven and sat down
at the right hand of the Father, and will come
again to judge the dead and the living; and
in the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of truth that
proceedeth from the Father, a life giving [12]
Spirit and in one holy Apostolic Catholic
church; and in one Baptism for the
remission of sins; and in the resurrection of the body,
and in life everlasting.
