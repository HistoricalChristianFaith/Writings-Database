<P>1. Here, if any means could be found, I should wish to converse thus with all those who hate the name of Christ, turning aside for a little from the defence primarily set up:-If you think it no dishonour to answer when asked a question, explain to us and say what is the cause, what the reason, that you pursue Christ with so bitter hostility? or what offences you remember which He did, that at the mention of His name you are roused to bursts of mad and savage fury?<SUP><A HREF="#P6649_2081845">2</A></SUP> Did He ever, in claiming for Himself power as king, fill the whole world with bands of the fiercest soldiers; and of nations at peace from the beginning, did He destroy and put an end to some, <I>and</I> compel others to submit to His yoke and serve Him? Did He ever, excited by grasping<SUP><A HREF="#P6650_2082182">3</A></SUP> avarice, claim as His own by right all that wealth to have abundance of which men strive eagerly? Did He ever, transported with lustful passions, break down by force the barriers of purity, or stealthily lie in wait for other men's wives? Did He ever, puffed up with haughty arrogance, inflict at random injuries and insults, without any distinction of persons? (B) And He was not worthy that you should listen to and believe <I>Him, yet</I> He should not have been despised by you even on this account, that He showed to you things concerning your salvation, that He prepared for you a path<SUP><A HREF="#P6651_2082795">4</A></SUP> to heaven, and the immortality for which you long; although<SUP><A HREF="#P6652_2083230">5</A></SUP> He neither extended the light of life to all, nor delivered all from the danger which threatens them through their ignorance.<SUP><A HREF="#P6653_2083703">6</A></SUP> </P>

<P>2. But indeed, <I>some one will say</I>, He deserved our hatred because He has driven religion<SUP><A HREF="#P6655_2083912">7</A></SUP> from the world, because He has kept men back from seeking to honour the gods.<SUP><A HREF="#P6656_2083997">8</A></SUP> Is He then denounced as the destroyer of religion and promoter of impiety, who brought true religion into the world, who opened the gates of piety to men blind and verily living in impiety, and pointed out to whom they should bow themselves? Or is there any truer religion-<I>one</I> more serviceable,<SUP><A HREF="#P6657_2085071">9</A></SUP> powerful, and <I>right</I>-than to have learned to know the supreme God, to know <I>how</I> to pray to God Supreme, who alone is the source and fountain of all good, the creator,<SUP><A HREF="#P6658_2085383">10</A></SUP> founder, and framer of all that endures, by whom all things on earth and all in heaven are quickened, and filled with the stir of life, and without whom there would assuredly be nothing to bear any name, and <I>have any</I> substance? But perhaps you doubt whether there is that ruler of whom we speak, and rather <I>incline to</I> believe in the existence of Apollo, Diana, Mercury, Mars, Give a true judgment;<SUP><A HREF="#P6659_2086316">11</A></SUP> and, looking round on all these things which we see, <I>any one</I> will rather doubt whether all the other gods exist, than hesitate with regard to the God whom we <I>all</I> know by nature, whether when we cry out, O God, or when we make God the witness of wicked <I>deeds</I>,<SUP><A HREF="#P6660_2087012">12</A></SUP> and raise our face to heaven as though He saw us.</P>

<P>3. But He did not permit men to make supplication to the lesser gods. Do you, then, know who are, or where are the lesser gods? Has mistrust of them, or the way in which they were mentioned, ever touched you, so that you are justly indignant that their worship has been done away with and deprived of all honour?<SUP><A HREF="#P6662_2087618">13</A></SUP> But if haughtiness of mind and arrogance,<SUP><A HREF="#P6663_2087816">14</A></SUP> as it is called by the Greeks, did not stand in your way and hinder you, you might long ago have been able to understand what He forbade to be done, or wherefore; within what limits He would have true religion lie;<SUP><A HREF="#P6664_2088051">15</A></SUP> what danger arose to you from that which you thought obedience? or from what evils you would escape if you broke away from your dangerous delusion.</P>

<P>4. But all these things will be more clearly and distinctly noticed when we have proceeded further. For we shall show that Christ did not teach the nations impiety, but delivered
