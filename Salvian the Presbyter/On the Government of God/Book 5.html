<h3 align="center">THE FIFTH BOOK</h3>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>1.</SPAN>&nbsp;I know that there are
men, utterly lacking in faith and void of the divine truth, who think they have
an easy answer to my arguments. They say that if the guilt of unfaithful
Christians is so great that they sin more in disregarding the commands of the
Lord which they know, than do the heathen tribes in their ignorance, then
ignorance has proved of more benefit to the pagans than knowledge, and knowledge
of the truth is only an obstacle to the Christians.</p>
<p>My answer must be this: it is not the truth that stands in our way, but our
own vices; not the law that does us injury, but our evil ways. In brief, give us
good ways of living and the decrees of the law are in our favor; take away our
vices and the law helps us. &quot;For we know,&quot; the apostle said,
&quot;that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; knowing this, that the law
is not made for a righteous man.&quot; Therefore, begin to be just, and you
shall be free from the law, because the law cannot act against the holy life, in
which it consists. &quot;For we know,&quot; he said, &quot;that the law is good,
if a man use it lawfully; knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous
man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the unholy, for the ungodly and
for sinners, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound
doctrine.&quot; <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> So the law is not so much fighting
against you, my friend, as you against the law, nor does it by its good precepts
take action against you, but you against it by your evil life. In fact, it is on
your side, but you are against it. It gives you good counsel with holy words,
while you fight against it with evil deeds, and yet not so much against it as
against yourself. To oppose it is to oppose yourself, since in it lie your life
and <A NAME="p134"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|134</SPAN></A> safety. When you desert the
divine law, you abandon your own salvation. Thus our complaints of the Lord's
law are like those of an impatient invalid against an excellent doctor. When his
own fault has increased his illness, he accuses his physician of incompetence.
As if, indeed, prescriptions could cure any illness if the patient did not obey
them, or the regimen ordered by the physician work a cure if the patient did not
follow it. What good can bitter draughts do the stomach if sweet ones are taken
immediately after? What good can the silence of those about him do the delirious
patient whose own ravings are killing him? Of what avail will the antidote be if
the poison is poured over it?</p>
<p>Now in our case the law is the antidote, the poison our wickedness. The
antidote of the law cannot cure us who are being killed by the poison of our own
vice. But of these matters I have said enough before, and if occasion arises
shall speak again later with God's help.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>2.</SPAN>&nbsp;Meanwhile, since I
mentioned above that there are two classes or sects of barbarians, namely,
pagans and heretics, and I have already, I think, said enough of the pagans, let
me now add what is necessary about the heretics. For my opponent may say:
&quot;Even if the divine law does not exact of the pagans that they keep
commandments they do not know, it certainly does exact this of the heretics who
know them; for they read the same books we do; they have the same prophets, the
same apostles, the same evangelists, and therefore they are no less guilty than
we are of neglect of the law. Eeally their neglect is much worse than ours, for
although their Scriptures are the same, their actions are much worse.''</p>
<p>Let us consider both points. You say that they read the same books we do. How
can their books be the same, being badly interpolated and falsified by
unscrupulous men? They are not the same at all, for they cannot be said to keep
their identity unchanged if they are corrupted in any part. Having lost their
full <A NAME="p135"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|135</SPAN></A> completeness they are not
unharmed, and being robbed of the power of the sacraments they do not keep their
true value. We alone, therefore, have the Sacred Scriptures in full, unviolated
and complete, who either drink them at their fount, or at least drawn from the
purest source by the agency of an incorrupt translation; we alone read them
well. I wish we might fulfil them as well as we read them! But I fear that we
who fail to keep them do not read them correctly either. For there is less guilt
in not reading the holy words than in reading and violating them. The other
nations either do not possess the law of God or have it in a changed and
weakened form, and, as I said, to have it in such a condition is the same thing
as not to have it at all.</p>
<p>If there are any among the barbarians who seem in their books to possess the
Sacred Scriptures less interpolated and torn to pieces than the rest, still the
corruptions in their texts are due to the tradition of their first teachers,
whose disciples hold rather to their tradition than to the Scripture itself. For
they do not abide by the instructions of the true law, but by the interpolations
of an evil and distorted interpretation.</p>
<p>The barbarians, indeed, lacking the Roman training or any other sort of
civilized education, knowing nothing whatever unless they have heard it from
their teachers, follow blindly what they hear. Such men, completely ignorant of
literature and wisdom, are sure to learn the mysteries of the divine law through
instruction rather than reading, and to retain their masters' doctrines rather
than the law itself. Thus the interpretation and doctrine of their teachers have
usurped the authority of the law among them, since they know only what they are
taught. So they are heretics, but unwittingly. <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
Indeed it is only among us that they are heretics, <A NAME="p136"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|136</SPAN></A>
and not among themselves, for they are so sure of their own orthodoxy that they
libel us in turn by the accusation of heresy. As they are to us, so are we to
them. We are convinced that they injure the holy incarnation in calling the Son
inferior to the Father: they think that we do injury to the Father in believing
the two equal. The truth is on our side, but they claim it for theirs. We truly
honor God but they think their belief honors his divinity the more. They fall
short in their Christian duty, but through what they think its fullest
performance; their lack of reverence seems to them true piety. So they err, but
with the best intentions, not through hatred, but through love of God, believing
that they honor and love him. Although they have not the true faith, yet they
think they possess the perfect love of God. How they shall be punished for the
error of their false opinion on the day of judgment, none can know but the
Judge. In the meantime, God bears with them patiently, I think, for he sees that
though they have not the true faith, yet their error is due to the love of what
appears to be the truth, especially since he knows that their wrongdoing is due
to ignorance, while among us men neglect what they believe. So their sin is the
fault of their teachers, while ours is our own; theirs is committed in
ignorance, ours in full knowledge; they do what they think right, but we what we
know to be perverse. Therefore with just judgment the patience of God bears with
them but punishes us, because ignorance may be pardoned for a time, but contempt
deserves no lenience. For it is written: ''The servant who knows not his lord's
will and does it not, shall be beaten with few stripes, but he who knows it and
does it not, shall be beaten with many.'' <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>3.</SPAN>&nbsp;Let us not wonder
that we are beaten with many stripes, since we err not through ignorance but
through rebellion. For knowing <A NAME="p137"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|137</SPAN></A> the
good we do not perform it, and knowing the distinction between right and wrong
we pursue the wrong. We read the law and trample underfoot what is lawful; we
learn the decrees of the sacred ordinances only to increase the gravity of our
sins after their prohibition; we say that we worship God, but give our service
to the devil. After all this, we wish to receive good gifts from God, while we
heap wrong upon wrong continually; we wish to have God do our will, though we
are unwilling to do his. We treat with him as his superiors; we wish him to
accede to our wishes constantly, though we constantly fight against his.</p>
<p>But he is just, however unjust we may be; for he punishes those he thinks
deserve punishment, and bears with those he thinks deserve his patience. In each
case his end is the same, that his chastisement of the orthodox may restrain
their lust for sinning, and his forbearance at length bring the heretics to
recognize the full truth of the faith, especially since he knows that those men
are not apt to be unworthy of the catholic faith whom he sees superior to the
orthodox in their way of living. All those of whom I speak are either Vandals or
Goths,<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> for I say nothing of the multitude of Roman
heretics, and shall not compare them with either Romans or barbarians, since
their lack of faith makes them worse than the Romans, and their disgraceful
lives than the barbarians. That the men of whom I speak are Romans, far from
helping us, <A NAME="p138"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|138</SPAN></A> makes our case even
worse. It is easy to estimate what the whole Roman state deserves, when part of
the Romans offend God by their way of life, part by their lack of faith and
their way of living also. Add that the very heresies of the barbarians spring
originally from the false teaching they received from the Romans, and the
inception of heresy among them becomes another heavy charge against us. <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>4.</SPAN>&nbsp;But as for the way of
life among the Goths and Vandals, in what single respect can we consider
ourselves superior to them, or even worthy of comparison? Let me speak first of
their affection and charity, which the Lord teaches us are the chief of virtues,
and which he commends not only through the Sacred Scriptures but also in his own
words, when he says: &quot;By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples,
if ye love one another.&quot; <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> Now almost all
barbarians, at least those who belong to one tribe, under one king's rule, love
one another, whereas almost all the Romans are at strife with one another. What
citizen is there who does not envy his fellows? Who shows complete charity to
his neighbors? All are indeed far from their neighbors in affection, however
near in place; though living side by side, they are far apart in spirit. While
this is a most grievous wrong, I wish it were true only of citizens and
neighbors. But the situation is still more serious, for not even relations
preserve the bonds of kinship. Who renders a brotherly service for his next of
kin? Who pays to family affection the debt he knows is due to the name he bears?
Who is as closely related by his affections as by blood? Who is not fired with a
dark passion of ill will? Whose emotions are not the prey of envy? Who does not
look on another's good fortune as his own punishment? Who does not reckon
another's good as his own evil? Who finds his own good <A NAME="p139"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|139</SPAN></A>
fortune so ample that he is willing that another should be fortunate also? Most
men are now suffering a strange and incalculable evil, in that it is not enough
for any man to be happy himself unless another is thereby made wretched. What a
situation is this, how savage, how rooted in the same impiety we deplore, how
alien to barbarians and familiar to Romans, that they proscribe one another by
mutual exactions. My last words, perhaps, give a wrong impression, for it would
be much more tolerable if each man endured what he himself had inflicted on
others. The present situation is harder to bear, for the many are proscribed by
the few, who use the public levies for their individual gain, and convert the
bills of indebtedness to the public treasury to their private profit. <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
Nor is it only the highest officials who do this, but the least too in almost
equal measure; not only the judges, but their obedient underlings as well. <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A></p>
<p>For what cities are there, or even what municipalities and villages, in which
there are not as many tyrants as curials? <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> Still
perhaps they preen themselves on their title, since it seems to be one of power
and honor. Brigands usually rejoice and exult at being considered somewhat more
ruthless than they really are. What place is there, as I said before, where the
very lifeblood of widows and orphans is not drained by the leading men of their
states, and with them that of all godly men? For these last are classed with
widows and orphans, since they are either unwilling to <A NAME="p140"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|140</SPAN></A>
protect themselves, out of devotion to their vows, or unable because of their
simplicity and humility. Therefore not one of them is safe, indeed scarcely any
are safe, except the very greatest, from the plunder and ruin of this universal
brigandage, other than those who are a match for the brigands themselves.
Matters have come to such an evil pass, to such a criminal condition, that only
the wicked man may count himself secure. <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>5.</SPAN>&nbsp;But certainly, you
object, even though there are so many who persecute good men, there must be some
who come to the rescue of those in distress, and, as it is written,
&quot;deliver the poor and needy out of the hand of the wicked.&quot; <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
&quot;There is none that doeth good, no, not one:&quot; <A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
as the prophet showed by these words, good men are so rare that scarcely one
seems to remain among us. Who offers help to those who are distressed and
suffering, when even the priests of the Lord make no resistance to the violence
of the unscrupulous? The majority of the clergy either say nothing, or, if they
do speak, their words are no more effective than silence. &quot;With <A NAME="p141"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|141</SPAN></A>
many of them it is not lack of resolution, but what they consider a prudent
discretion that commends this course.<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> They are
not willing to declare the truth openly, for this the sensitive ears of the
wicked cannot bear. Not content with shunning the truth, our oppressors hate and
curse it, they fail to evince any reverence or respect when they do hear the
truth, and show utter scorn for it, in their stubborn and rebellious conceit.
Therefore, even those who have occasion to speak remain silent and refrain from
immediate attacks on those whom they know to be guilty. They dare not publish
the whole truth openly for fear of increasing oppression by a too emphatic
insistence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the poor are being robbed, widows groan, orphans are trodden down,
so that many, even persons of good birth, who have enjoyed a liberal education,
seek refuge with the enemy <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A><i> </i>to escape
death under the trials of the general persecution. They seek among the
barbarians the Roman mercy, since they cannot endure the barbarous mercilessness
they find among the Romans.<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> <A NAME="p142"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|142</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although these men differ in customs and language from those with whom they
have taken refuge, and are unaccustomed too, if I may say so, to the nauseous
odor of the bodies and clothing of the barbarians,<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
yet they prefer the strange life they find there to the injustice rife among the
Romans. So you find men passing over everywhere, now to the Goths, now to the
Bagaudae, or whatever other barbarians have established their power anywhere,<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
and they do not repent of their expatriation, for they would rather live as free
men, though in seeming captivity, than as captives in seeming liberty. Hence the
name of Roman citizen, once not only much valued but dearly bought,<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
is now voluntarily repudiated and shunned, and is thought not merely valueless,
but even almost abhorrent. What can be a greater proof of Roman injustice than
that many worthy noblemen to whom their Roman status should have been the
greatest source of fame and honor, have nevertheless been driven so far by the
cruelty of Roman injustice that they no longer wish to be Romans?</p>
<p>The result is that even those who do not take refuge with the barbarians are
yet compelled to be barbarians themselves; for this is the case with the greater
part of the Spaniards, no small proportion of the Gauls, and, in fine, all those
throughout the Roman world whose Roman citizenship has been brought to nothing
by Roman extortion.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C6"></A>6.</SPAN>&nbsp;I must now speak of
the Bagaudae,<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> who, despoiled, afflicted, <A NAME="p143"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|143</SPAN></A>
and murdered by wicked and bloodthirsty magistrates, after they had lost the
rights of Roman, citizens, forfeited also the honor of the Roman name. We
transform their misfortunes into crime, we brand them with a name that recalls
their losses, with a name that we ourselves have contrived for their shame! We
call those men rebels and utterly abandoned, whom we ourselves have forced into
crime.<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> For by what other causes were they made
Bagaudae <A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A><sup> </sup>save by our unjust acts, the
wicked decisions of the magistrates, the proscription and extortion of those who
have turned the public exactions to the increase of their private fortunes and
made the tax indictions their opportunity for plunder? <A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A></p>
<p>Like wild beasts, instead of governing those put under their power, the
officials have devoured them, feeding not only on their <A NAME="p144"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|144</SPAN></A>
belongings as ordinary brigands would do, but even on their torn flesh and their
blood. Thus it has come to pass that men who were strangled and half killed by
brutal exactions began to be really barbarians, since they were not permitted to
be Romans. They were satisfied to become what they were not, since they were no
longer allowed to be what they had been; and they were compelled to defend their
lives as best they could, since they saw that they had already completely lost
their liberty.</p>
<p>How does our present situation differ from theirs? Those who have not before
joined the Bagaudae are now being compelled to join them. The overwhelming
injuries poor men suffer compel them to wish to become Bagaudae, but their
weakness prevents them. So they are like captives oppressed by the yoke of an
enemy, enduring their torture of necessity, not of their own choice; in their
hearts they long for freedom, while they suffer the extremes of slavery.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C7"></A>7.</SPAN>&nbsp;Such is the case
among almost all the lower classes, for the same circumstances force them to two
very different alternatives. They are most strongly compelled to wish for
freedom, but the compulsion they suffer deprives them of power to carry out
their wish. Perhaps it may be asserted that the very men who have these desires
would wish for nothing better than to be free of any occasion to feel them, for
what they wish is the greatest misfortune. They would be much better off if they
had no need for such ambitions. But what other wish can these poor wretches
have? They must endure the frequent, even continuous, ruin of state
requisitions, always menaced by severe and unremitting proscription; they desert
their homes to avoid being tortured in them, and go into voluntary exile to
escape heavy punishment. To such men the enemy are kinder than the tax
collectors. This is proved by their actions, for they flee to the enemy to avoid
the oppression of the levies.<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A> <A NAME="p145"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|145</SPAN></A>
Such taxation in itself, however harsh and brutal, would still be less severe
and painful if all shared equally in the common lot. But the situation is made
more shameful and disastrous by the fact that all do not bear the burden
together; the tributes due from the rich are extorted from the poor, and the
weaker bear the burdens of the stronger. The only reason why they do not bear
the whole burden is that the exactions are greater than their resources. They
are suffering the most diverse and dissimilar misfortunes, envy and need. For
envy is involved in the payment, and need in the means by which it is made. If
you consider the amount they pay, you will think them wealthy; but if you
consider what they have, you will find them in dire need. Who can square the
accounts of such injustice? They make the payments due from the rich while they
suffer the poverty of beggars.</p>
<p>My next point is still more serious. The rich themselves from time to time
make additions to the amount of taxation demanded from the poor. You may ask how
it is, when their assessment has already reached a maximum figure, and the
payments due from them are very large, that the rich can possibly wish to
increase the total. But I did not say that they increase their own payments, for
they permit the increase simply because it does not cost them anything
additional.</p>
<p>Let me explain. Frequently there come from the highest imperial officials new
envoys, new bearers of dispatches, sent under recommendation to a few men of
note, for the ruin of the many. In their honor new contributions and tax levies
are decreed. The mighty determine what sums the poor shall pay; the favor of the
rich decrees what the masses of the lowly shall lose; for they themselves are
not at all involved in these exactions.<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> Do you
say that <A NAME="p146"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|146</SPAN></A> it is impossible not to
give due honor and entertainment to the envoys sent by our superiors? Then be
the first to contribute, you men of wealth, who are first to pass such decrees;
be first to lavish your property who are first in largess of mere words. You who
give, give of mine and thine alike; though absolute justice would require that
any one who wishes sole claim on the resulting favor should also bear the
expense alone. However, we poor men accede to the wish of the rich. What you few
order let us all pay. What is so just and humane as this? Your decree burdens us
with new debts; at least let this indebtedness be shared between us. What can be
more unjust or unworthy than that you alone should be free from debt, who are
making us all debtors?</p>
<p>The poor, indeed, in the extremes of their misery, pay all the exactions of
which I have spoken, in utter ignorance of the object or reason of the payments.
For who is allowed to discuss the payments, or inquire into the reasons for the
amounts due? The sum is openly published only when the rich fall out with one
another, and some of them feel slighted because they learn that assessments have
been passed without their advice and management. Then you will hear some among
them say: &quot;What an unconscionable crime! Two or three decide the ruin of
the many; a few powerful men determine what is to be paid for by many poor
wretches!&quot; For each individual rich man thinks it due to his honor to
object to any decree passed in his absence, but he does not consider it due to
justice to object to any wrong being enacted in his presence.</p>
<p>Finally, what they have criticized in others they themselves afterward
establish in law, either in requital for the earlier contempt, or as proof of
their power. As a result the most unhappy poor are like men far out at sea,
buffeted by conflicting winds; they are overwhelmed by the billows that break
over them now from one side, now from the other.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C8"></A>8.</SPAN>&nbsp;But surely, you say,
those who are unjust in this respect are known to be moderate and just in
another, and atone for their <A NAME="p147"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|147</SPAN></A>
wickedness in the one matter by their generosity in the other. For in proportion
as they burden the poor with the weight of new indictions they sustain them by
proffering new alleviations; in proportion as the lesser men are weighed down by
new tributes, they are relieved by new remedies.</p>
<p>But this is not the case, for the injustice is alike in both the exactions
and the remedies. As the poor are the first to receive the burden, they are the
last to obtain relief. For whenever, as happened lately,<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
the ruling powers have thought best to take measures to help the bankrupt cities
to lessen their taxes in some measure, at once we see the rich alone dividing
with one another the remedy granted to all alike. Who then remembers the poor?
Who summons the needy and humble to share in the common benefit? Who allows the
man who is always first in bearing the burden to have even the last place in
receiving relief? What more can I say? Only that the poor are not reckoned as
taxpayers at all, except when the weight of taxation is being imposed on them;
they are outside the number when remedies are being distributed.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances can we think ourselves undeserving of God's severe
punishment when we ourselves continually so punish the poor? Can we believe that
God ought not to exercise his judgment against us all, when we are constantly
unjust? For where, or among what people, do these evils exist save only among
the Romans? Who commit such grave acts of injustice as ours? Take the Franks,
they are ignorant of this wrong; the Huns are immune to it; there is nothing of
the sort among the Vandals, nothing among the Goths. For in the Gothic country
the barbarians are so far from tolerating this sort of oppression that not even <A NAME="p148"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|148</SPAN></A>
Romans who live among them have to bear it. Hence all the Romans in that region
have but one desire, that they may never have to return to the Roman
jurisdiction. It is the unanimous prayer of the Roman people in that district
that they may be permitted to continue to lead their present life among the
barbarians.</p>
<p>Yet we are surprised that the Goths are not conquered by our resistance, when
the Romans would rather live among them than at home. Not only have our kinsmen
no desire at all to escape from them to us, but they even leave us to take
refuge with them. I could find occasion to wonder why all the poor and needy
taxpayers <A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> do not follow their example, except
for the one factor that hinders them, namely, that they cannot transfer their
poor possessions and homes and their households. For, since many of them leave
their tiny fields and shops to escape the enforced payment of taxes, how could
they help wishing to take off with them, if it were at all possible, the
property they are compelled to abandon? They are not capable of doing what they
would probably prefer, hence they do the one thing they can. They put themselves
under the care and protection of the powerful, make themselves the surrendered
captives of the rich and so pass under their jurisdiction.<A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
Still I should not consider this a serious or unfitting procedure; on the
contrary, I should laud the public spirit of the powerful to whom the poor
entrust themselves, if they did not sell their patronage, if the defence they
claim to give the poor were <A NAME="p149"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|149</SPAN></A> due to
their humanity and not to their greed. It is a serious and grievous situation,
that the rich make a show of protecting the poor only in order to rob them, that
they defend the wretched only on condition of making them more wretched still by
this defence. For all those who seem to be enjoying protection assign to their
patrons the bulk of their property before they receive any help, and thus the
sons' inheritance is destroyed that the fathers may be secure.<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
Protection for the parents is assured by the beggary of the children. See then
the aid and patronage afforded by the great: they do nothing for the benefit of
those who come under their care, but only for their own. Some aid is granted the
parents for the time being, but only on condition that in the future the
children shall lose everything. It is a mere process of sale, and certain of the
great are sure to demand a very dear price for everything they offer. I said it
was a process of sale ---- I wish they would sell in the ordinary sense of the
term, for in that case perhaps they would leave something to the purchaser! But
this is a new sort of buying and selling; the seller gives nothing and receives
everything, while the buyer receives nothing and loses all that he had. Now
practically every sales agreement has this characteristic, that the element of
desire is on the side of the buyer, and that of need on that of the seller,
inasmuch as the buyer wishes to increase his substance and the seller to
diminish his. This, however, is an unheard-of sort of trading, in which the
property of the sellers increases while nothing remains to the buyers but sheer
beggary.</p>
<p>What an intolerable and monstrous thing it is, one that human hearts can
hardly endure, that one can hardly bear to hear spoken of, that many of the
wretched poor, despoiled of their tiny holdings, after they have completely lost
their property, must still pay taxes for what they have lost! Though possession
has been forfeited, the <A NAME="p150"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|150</SPAN></A> assessment
is not cancelled: <A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> they are without property but
are overwhelmed with taxes. Who can fairly estimate this evil? The poor wretches
pay taxes for the invaders who have swooped down on their estates. After the
father's death, the sons have no claim on the little farms that should rightly
be theirs, but are forced to pay ruinous taxes for them. As a result, what else
is accomplished by this great wrongdoing except that men stripped naked by
private robbery, die under the public exactions, and taxation ends the lives of
those whose property has been carried off by plunderers? <A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A></p>
<p>Therefore some of those of whom I speak, who are either shrewder than the
rest or have been sharpened by necessity, have lost their homes and farms by
such encroachments, or have fled before the taxgatherers, because they cannot
hold their property, and seek out the farms of the rich and great, to become
their <i>coloni</i>. <A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A></p>
<p>Those who are driven by the terror of the enemy flee to the forts,<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
and those who have lost their immunity as free men take refuge in some asylum <A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
out of sheer desperation. So also these men, who are no longer able to guard the
home and condition of their birth, subject themselves to the lowly yoke of
serfdom. They have been reduced to such a necessitous state that they are cut
off not only from their former possessions, but also from their rank. They are
exiled not alone from their property but from their very selves; losing all that
was theirs along with their freedom, they <A NAME="p151"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|151</SPAN></A>
lack any title to their holdings and forfeit the very rights of liberty. <A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C9"></A>9.</SPAN>&nbsp;Even this might
through sheer necessity seem somehow tolerable, if there were not further
misfortune to follow. Their lot is made more bitter by a worse injustice still.
For they are received as strangers; they become natives only on the terms of
their present condition. Recalling the example of that evil sorceress of old who
is said to have changed men into beasts, we might say that all who are received
on the farms of the rich are transformed as if by Circe's potions. For the
owners begin to count those whom they have received as outsiders and aliens, as
their own property; they turn into slaves men known to be free-born. Do we
wonder that the barbarians are able to capture us, when we take our brothers
captive? It is not at all strange that our states are being devastated and
destroyed. We have long been providing by the oppression of the multitude for
our own eventual capture, falling into captivity by our enslavement of others.
Much later than we deserve, do we now at length suffer the treatment that we
have meted out to others, and in the words of the Holy Scripture, eat the labor
of our own hands.<A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A> Under the judgment of a just
God we are paying what we owe. We showed no mercy to exiles; behold, we
ourselves are in exile: we deceived wanderers; behold, we ourselves, now
wanderers, are deceived in turn: we took advantage of circumstances to ruin
free-born men; behold, we ourselves are beginning to live on alien soil, and
fear the same ruin.</p>
<p>How great is the deceptive blindness of sinful minds! We are suffering from
the condemnation of God's judgment and still do not acknowledge that we are
being judged. Some of the saints wonder that the others who have thus far not
endured any such <A NAME="p152"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|152</SPAN></A> fate are not
reformed by our example! Not even those of us who are already smitten by God are
being corrected by the torments justly due to our wickedness. What intolerable
pride is ours! However many are enduring the punishment that their sins require,
no one deigns to acknowledge the cause of his trouble. The reasons for our pride
are perfectly obvious: even though we are at last suffering a little, we do not
yet suffer as we deserve. So great is the mercy of God that he does not wish us
to endure the full penalties for our misdeeds, but only a part of what is due;
he chastens the wicked, but not to the full measure of their sin. He wishes us
to acknowledge our misdoings rather than to endure their penalties, to the end
that by his loving and salutary correction he may show us what we deserve to
suffer, but not inflict on us the stripes we deserve. In this he follows the
words of the blessed apostle, who said: &quot;Dost thou not know that the
goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? But after thy hardness and
impenitent heart thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of
wrath.&quot; <A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A></p>
<p>In truth our actions suit the words of the apostle, for God calls us to
repentance, but we treasure up wrath; he invites us to receive pardon, but we
daily heap up our offences. We bring force to bear on him by our iniquities; we
ourselves arm the divine wrath against us. We compel God against his will to
take vengeance on our monstrous crimes; we give him scarcely any opportunity to
spare us. For although no token of injustice can ever light on him or appear in
him, our actions are such that if he did not take vengeance on our sins he would
seem to be unjust.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C10"></A>10.</SPAN>&nbsp;Surely, you say, a
man who has once been a sinner may have ceased to do wrong. Is there any end to
wrongdoing? Do not men give up life sooner than iniquity? What man does not die
in his evil pursuits, to be buried with his sins and crimes? Truly, one might
apply to such men the words of the prophet: &quot;Their <A NAME="p153"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|153</SPAN></A>
graves are their homes forever, and they are compared to foolish cattle, and are
become like them.&quot; <A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A> If only they were like
cattle! It would at least have been something gained, to have gone astray
through mere brute folly. To have sinned, not through ignorance, but in despite
of God, is worse and deserves a heavier penalty. Do you claim that this is the
case with the laity only, and not with even a few among the clergy? With worldly
men only, and not with many of the religious also, or rather men given over to
worldly vices under the empty show of religion? These, to be sure, after the
shameful guilt of their past misdeeds, have gained themselves the honorary name
of sanctity. They have altered in their profession but not in their actual way
of life, and, thinking that the service of God depends on costume more than on
action, have changed their garments but not their hearts. Why should men think
their guilt less hateful, who, though they are said to have performed a sort of
penance, do not put off their old habits when they lay aside their former style
of dress? Their actions as a whole are such that there is less reason to suppose
that they have already done penance for their misdeeds than that they afterwards
repented of their penitence. There is less ground to think that they have
repented their evil life than that they have since regretted their promise of a
good one.</p>
<p>Many men know that I am speaking the truth, and can even bear witness to my
words in their own conscience. Chief among these are the religious who have
gained some reputation by a general repentance and now seek after new honors,
and buy powers they formerly lacked. They are so anxious to be not merely men of
the world, but more than worldly, that what they were before their repentance
does not now suffice them unless they may become greater than they were in the
past. Do they not repent of their conversion?</p>
<p>So also do those men repent of their conversion and their brief <A NAME="p154"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|154</SPAN></A>
thought of God, who, abstaining from intercourse with their wives, do not
refrain from invasion of other men's property; who, professing physical
continence, run riot in incontinence of spirit. A strange sort of conversion,
truly! They do not do what is permissible, but commit forbidden sins. They
refrain from lawful wedded life but not from rapine.</p>
<p>What vain delusion is this? Sins were forbidden us by God, not marriage. Your
deeds do not suit your convictions; you who call yourselves adherents of virtue
should not consort with crime. What you are doing is utterly absurd; this is not
conversion to God but aversion from him. If, as is rumored, you have left off
long since the functions even of lawful wedlock, now at last give up your sin.
It is indeed just that you should refrain from crime of all sorts, but if you
think this impossibly difficult, at least give up your greatest and most
monstrous sins. Grant, whoever you are, that the neighbors whose land adjoins
yours cannot remain prosperous; grant that the poor cannot support life near
you; grant that you persecute the indigent and plunder the wretched; grant that
you cause affliction to all men, provided that they are outside your own circle:
still, I beg, at least spare your own family. And if you think it too hard and
burdensome to spare all who are yours, then spare those who have preferred you
not only to their other relatives and kinsmen, but even to those most closely
bound to them and their dearly loved children. Yet why should I speak of their
loved ones and their children, when they have preferred you almost to their very
life and hope? There is nothing praiseworthy in this, as everyone who has
committed the error now recognizes. But what has that to do with you, whom even
their mistakes have advantaged? Your debt to such men is the greater because
they have erred from too great trust in you. They were indeed blinded by
devotion, and consequently are branded and censured by all; but even so you are
under greater obligations to them because they have incurred the blame of all
for love of you. <A NAME="p155"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|155</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C11"></A>11.</SPAN>&nbsp;What is there to
compare with this among the barbarous Goths? Who among them injures those who
love him, attacks his friends, and cuts the throats of his dear ones with his
own dagger? You attack those who love you, you cut off the hands of those who
offer gifts, you kill your closest friends, and do you not fear and tremble?
What would you do if you had not felt the present judgment of God in the
scourging you have just received? You increase the count and constantly add new
crimes to your former misdeeds. Think what punishment awaits your worse deeds,
when even lesser faults are regularly punished by demons. Be content now, I
pray, with robbing your friends and companions. Let it be enough that the poor
have been harried and beggars despoiled by you, that hardly any one can keep
from trembling in your presence, no one can feel secure. Torrents rushing down
from Alpine crags, or flames driven by the wind, are more easily borne. No such
death as this ---- to use a well known figure ---- do sailors die, devoured by
the engulfing whirlpool or by Scylla's proverbial dogs. You evict your neighbors
from their little farms, those nearest you from their houses and property. Would
you &quot;be placed alone in the midst of the earth,&quot; <A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
as it is written? This is the one end you cannot gain. Seize all that you can,
occupy by force all that you can, still you shall always find a neighbor.
Consider, please, other men, whom even you, willingly or not, regard with honor;
consider others, whom even you, willingly or not, admire. They are above others
in honor, but on a level with them in their own estimation; they are greater in
their power and less in their humility. You yourself, to whom I am now speaking,
surely know whom I mean, and you of whom I now complain ought to recognize whom
I honor by this praise. I only wish that there were many who deserve such
praise; the nobility of a great number might work healing for all.</p>
<p>But suppose that you do not wish to win praise; tell me, why do you wish to
be worthy of condemnation? Why is nothing dearer <A NAME="p156"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|156</SPAN></A>
to you than injustice, nothing more delightful than avarice, nothing more
cherished than the seizure of other men's goods? Why do you judge nothing more
precious than wickedness, nothing more excellent than rapine? Learn the true
good from a pagan, who says: &quot;One should be fenced about by charity and
goodwill, not by arms.&quot; <A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A></p>
<p>So your delusions lead you astray; the wickedness of your blind and evil
heart deceives you. If you wish to be upright, to be powerful, to be great, you
ought to surpass other men not in ill will but in honor. I once read somewhere:
&quot;No one is wicked but a fool; for if he were wise, he would prefer to be
good.&quot; Do you, therefore, if you can at last return to sanity, put off your
wickedness, if you wish wisdom. For if you hope to be at all wise or sane, you
must discard all that you have been and change completely. Deny yourself that
you may not be denied by Christ; cast yourself off that you may be received by
him; lose yourself, that you may not perish. For the Savior says: &quot;
Whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.&quot; <A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A><i>
</i>Wherefore love this profitable loss, that you may gain true safety. For God
will never set you free, unless you have first condemned yourself.</p>

<p><A NAME="1"></A>1.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> 1 Timothy 1. 8-10.</p>
<p><A NAME="2"></A>2.&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> The rest of this chapter is quoted in an
abridged translation by Voltaire in his <i>Dictionnaire philosophique, s.v. </i>&quot;H&eacute;r&eacute;sie,&quot;
with the prefatory remark that it is the most sensible attack on the spirit of
intolerance that can be found. Voltaire had apparently forgotten or not read
Augustine's treatise <i>Contra epistolam Manichaei </i>(Migne, PL, XLII, col.
173), in which (c. 1) he prays for &quot;a mind calm and tranquil, thinking
rather of your correction than your subversion. For although the Lord through
his servants overturns the realms of error, yet he bids the men themselves, in
so far as they are men, be amended rather than destroyed.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><A NAME="3"></A>3.&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> See Luke 12. 47-48.</p>
<p><A NAME="4"></A>4.&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> Orosius' account of the conversion of
the Goths, while agreeing with Salvian's on the responsibility of the Romans for
the heresy of the Goths, illuminates by contrast the comprehension and sympathy
with which Salvian states the absence of moral responsibility on the part of the
barbarians for a heresy that appeared to them orthodox. Salvian's attitude is
the more remarkable in one whose devotion to Christ is so strong that at times
he has Christ overshadow the other Persons of the Trinity. Orosius says (VII.
33. 19) : &quot;Before this the Goths sent ambassadors to ask that bishops be
sent from whom they might learn the precepts of the Christian faith. Valens the
emperor, with damnable perversity, sent teachers of the Arian creed. The Goths
have held to the instructions of the first faith that they received. So by a
just judgment of God they burned alive the man through whose fault they, when
they die, are doomed to burn for their vicious error.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="5"></A>5.&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> See IV. 2 <i>supra. </i>As Zschimmer (<i>op.
cit., </i>58 n.l.) points out, this is a very notable statement. Salvian clearly
understands the historical connection of Roman Arianism with that of the
Germans; either he actually knew that Ulfilas in his translation of the Bible
made alterations to suit the Arian doctrines, or he is merely repeating some of
the usual charges brought against Ulfilas and other Arian missionaries by
contemporaries of the orthodox faith.</p>
<p><A NAME="6"></A>6.&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> John 13. 35.</p>
<p><A NAME="7"></A>7.&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> For the efforts of the state to prevent
such injustice, cf. especially Cod. Theod. XI. 1. 20, 26.</p>
<p><A NAME="8"></A>8.&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> See Cod. Theod. XI. 7. 16, 20; 11.1, for
the penalties for undue aggression by minor officials.</p>
<p><A NAME="9"></A>9.&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> See III. 5 <i>supra. </i>For the reverse
of the picture, note the text of the contemporary decree of Theodosius and
Valentinian issued a.d. 443 (Cod. Just. V. 27. 2) beginning: &quot;If any man
whether free or bound in the toils of the curia ...&quot; In his own eyes the
curial had become a slave rather than a tyrant, and in those of the government
as well, but the necessity of tyranny toward the taxpayers was thereby
increased. For the obligations of the office and the difficulty of filling it at
this time, see Cod. Theod. XII. 1, <i>De decurionibus.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="10"></A>10.&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;That similar conditions
prevailed also in the eastern portion of the empire at this time is shown by the
account of the Roman regime given by the Greek whom Priscus found at Attila's
court (Priscus, &quot;Historia Gothica,&quot; in De Boor, <i>Excerpta
Constantiniana I, </i>135-138; see also Bury, <i>History of the Later Roman
Empire, </i>I, 213-223): &quot;Their oppressions in time of peace are much more
bitter than the calamities due to war, both on account of the harsh tributes and
on account of the oppression of the wicked, since the laws are not enforced for
all alike. If a rich or powerful man transgresses them, he does not pay the
penalty for his misdeed; but if a needy man, who does not know how to conduct
his affairs, transgresses, he must expect the penalty ordained by law; unless
perhaps, before the sentence is decided, when much time has been spent in
continual litigation and great amounts of money expended beside, his life ends.
But the worst injustice of all is that law and justice are to be obtained only
by bargaining and bribery. For no one will open the courts to any injured man
before he turns over his money to the use of the judge and his assistants.&quot;
Priseus countered with a description of the general justice of the Roman law and
government, to which the exile replied that the laws of the Roman state were
indeed good and the empire gloriously constituted, but the magistrates, less
public-spirited than of old, were weakening and perverting it.</p>
<p><A NAME="11"></A>11.&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Psalms 82. 4.</p>
<p><A NAME="12"></A>12.&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;<i>Ibid. </i>14. 3.</p>
<p><A NAME="13"></A>13.&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> Elsewhere Salvian speaks in the same
vein (<i>Ad ecclesiam </i>IV. 8) : &quot;In such a situation what do those men
do whom Christ has appointed to speak? They displease God, if they are silent;
men, if they speak. But, as the apostle said in answer to the Jews, it is more
expedient to obey God than men.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="14"></A>14.&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> An important bit of contemporary
evidence for a fundamental step in the transition from the Roman regime in the
country districts to feudalism.</p>
<p><A NAME="15"></A>15.&nbsp;<sup>15 </sup>Orosius' similar statement in the
case of Spain has already been cited; cf. IV. 4 <i>supra. </i>Sidonius <i>(Ep. </i>V.
7) speaks of the officials whose oppression of Gaul stands out in marked
contrast to the clemency of the surrounding barbarians. The account given by
Paulinus of Pella of Roman life among the Gothic invaders corroborates Salvian's
statements, in a situation in which the victory of the Goths and the plundering
before their departure made, his favorable account the more remarkable. He
lamented (<i>Eucharisticos </i>285-290) the disadvantage of having had no Goths
quartered in his house to protect him from the ravages when their tribe
withdrew: &quot;for we know that certain of the Goths worked with the greatest
humanity to benefit their hosts by their protection.&quot; Later his prayer (<i>Ibid.
</i>424-425) that &quot;some share of my ancestral fortune might remain from the
barbarian plundering by right of war, and from the Roman crime, which has at
various seasons fattened freely on my losses, against all justice&quot; was
answered by a Goth's payment to him for a part of his old estate, which had
fallen to the honest barbarian as part of his booty.</p>
<p><A NAME="16"></A>16.&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> A similar distaste is expressed by
Sidonius (<i>Carmen </i>XII) in his description of the difficulties of composing
six-foot verses when seven-foot barbarians breathe onions and garlic into your
face at daybreak.</p>
<p><A NAME="17"></A>17.&nbsp;<sup>17</sup> Strictly speaking the Bagaudae were
not barbarians, but revolted peasants from among the Roman citizenry, whose
long-continued revolts had invested them in Roman eyes with a quasi-barbarian
character; for the other barbarians note that in VII. 15 the Franks are
described as especially hospitable.</p>
<p><A NAME="18"></A>18.&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> So the tribune of the soldiers at
Jerusalem said to Paul: &quot;With a great price obtained I this freedom,&quot;
i.e., Roman citizenship. (Acts 22.28.)</p>
<p><A NAME="19"></A>19.&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> The revolt of the Bagaudae, analogous
in many respects to that of the Jacquerie in the 14th century, broke out in Gaul
in A.D. 283-4 because of oppression in that province, due especially to
overheavy taxation. The empire was engaged in war against usurpers, and the
revolt spread rapidly. Maximian won great praise for suppressing it, but the
Bagaudae continued to plunder the country districts and towns, and spread
through Gaul and Spain, adding seriously to the difficulty of guarding the
frontiers. In the 5th century their revolt again assumed serious proportions;
their troops were now regular armies and their local units closely equivalent to
the individual German states in menace to the unity of the empire, breeding
increasing discontent with the official oppression. The last mention of the
Bagaudae in the Chronicle of Idatius is in the year A.D. 449, and the movement
seems to have come to an end not long after this. For the contemporary
references, of which Salvian's account is the most detailed, cf. Seeck, <i>s.v. </i>&quot;Bagaudae,&quot;
in Pauly-Wissowa, <i>Real-Encyclop&auml;die.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="20"></A>20.&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp; That a man should not be held
responsible for a crime committed under compulsion is recognized by a decree of
Honorius and Theodosius in a.d. 416 (Cod. Theod. XV. 14. 14) prohibiting suits
for crimes committed during the barbarian raids, &quot;either through flight or
through the herding together of refugees . . . for an act done to escape death
is not considered a crime.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="21"></A>21.&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Salvian uses the term <i>Bagaudae,
</i>apparently a word of Celtic origin, for which Seeck suggests the meaning
&quot;warlike,&quot; as equivalent to &quot;outlawed rebels.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="22"></A>22.&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp; The ten chief men of each town
were responsible for handing over to the agents of the central government all
that was due from their district in payment of the <i>indiction, </i>the term
used from the time of Diocletian for the general provincial taxation on the
basis of the amount of arable land, cattle and laborers in each locality. The
periodical revisions of the taxable property also depended largely on the town
officers, and usually caused much oppression of the poorer taxpayers, as Salvian
here says. In this case, also, as in so many others, the rich could more easily
gain substantial relief by bribery than the poor could do.</p>
<p><A NAME="23"></A>23.&nbsp;<sup>23</sup> See Cod. Theod. XI. 1. 7 for the
decree of Constantius and Constans in A.D. 361 relieving of payments <i>pro his
qui aufugerint </i>any senators who could prove that they possessed none of the
property of fugitive holders; and XI. 1. 31 for the similar decree of Honorius
and Theodosius in a.d. 412. Salvian's description is closely paralleled by the
passage from Priscus quoted in note 10.</p>
<p><A NAME="24"></A>24.&nbsp;<sup>24</sup> The contrast between these practices
and the imperial theory is shown by the five decrees in Cod. Theod. VIII. 11:
&quot;That the heralds of public good fortune are to receive no gifts from
public levies or from forced payments.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="25"></A>25.&nbsp;<sup>25</sup> See IV. 6 <i>supra. </i>No writer
gives further details on these measures, and they are not mentioned in the
Codex. Salvian's description of the profit made by the rich out of attempts at
relief is confirmed by phrases in Cod. Theod. XII. 1.173, of A.D. 410: &quot;For
relieving the fortunes of the poorer curials and restraining the oppression of
the powerful. . . . Let them fear the knowledge of your power and dare make no
attempt at relieving the rich and destroying the needy.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="26"></A>26.&nbsp;<sup>26</sup> That is, free farmers, not <i>coloni,
</i>for the latter would not be liable to direct taxation. The constant use of
diminutives in reference to their property ---- <i>agelli, resculae,
habitatiunculae </i>---- shows the type of small farmer meant. The passage is an
important one as an indication of the existence of independent small landholders
in Gaul in Salvian's time.</p>
<p><A NAME="27"></A>27.&nbsp;<sup>27</sup> See Cod. Theod. XII. 1. 146 of a.d.
395: &quot;We have noted that many hide under the shadow of the powerful to
defraud their country of the payments due&quot;; and, in general, Cod. Theod.
XI. 24; <i>De patrociniis vicorum</i>. A<i> </i>decree of a.d. 319 (<i>ibid. </i>XI.
3. 1) recognized as the cause of many arrears in the taxes that &quot;some men,
taking advantage of the temporary needs of others, get possession of the best
farms on condition of holding them tax free without making up their arrears to
the fiscus.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="28"></A>28.&nbsp;<sup>28</sup> In Cod. Just. XI. 54. 1, a.d. 468, an
attempt is made to prevent patronage by making testaments in such eases invalid;
in Cod. Theod. XI. 24. 4 such patronage is made subject to very heavy fines.</p>
<p><A NAME="29"></A>29.&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Salvian uses the word <i>capitatio,
</i>winch, as Haemmerle (<i>op. cit. </i>II. 11) points out, must be here
equivalent to <i>iugatio, </i>not to the poll tax.</p>
<p><A NAME="30"></A>30.&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;For attempts to remedy this
wrong, ef. Cod. Theod. XI. 3. 1-5, providing for proper registration and payment
of arrears on land acquired &quot; in any way whatsoever.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="31"></A>31.&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;That is, they give up their full
citizen status, and become bound to the soil, being no longer subject to direct
taxation. This would seem a harsher alternative than the preceding, yet actual
conditions lead Salvian to reckon it as the wiser course.</p>
