<h3 align="center">INTRODUCTION&nbsp;</h3>
<p align="center"><b>I. A Fifth Century Tract for the Times</b></p>
<p>&quot;Be ashamed, ye Roman people everywhere, be ashamed of the lives you
lead! ... It is neither the strength of their bodies that makes the barbarians
conquer, nor the weakness of our nature that makes us subject to defeat. Let no
one think or persuade himself otherwise ---- it is our vicious lives alone that
have conquered us.'' <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></p>
<p>These are the words which Salvian would have made echo throughout the Roman
world, had his human frailty permitted, the words which have earned him the
title of the ''Jeremiah of his times.&quot; The problem of the decline of the
Roman power was not relegated to the historians at that time, but was the chief
concern of all thinking men, and many solutions were proposed. Successive
invasions and settlements of barbarian tribes had ended Rome's claim to rule the
world, while at the same time the fiscal difficulties of the central
administration had increased taxation beyond endurance. The world seemed to be
dying of old age, and the Empire with it. The natural tendency to glorify the
past was intensified by the poignant wretchedness of the present, and grave
doubts arose in the minds even of faithful Christians. &quot;The very people
who, as pagans, conquered and ruled the world, are being conquered and enslaved
now that they have become Christians. Is not this clear evidence of God's
neglect of human affairs?&quot; <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> The question did
not of itself imply disbelief in God, but its implicit doubt of God's constant
government and judgment of mankind endangered the foundations of the Christian
faith. Salvian's answer was clear and uncompromising. &quot;These words are
harsh and austere,&quot; <A NAME="p4"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|4</SPAN></A> he wrote
elsewhere, &quot;but what are we to do? We may not change the nature of things,
and the truth cannot be pronounced otherwise than as the very essence of truth
demands. Men think my words harsh. I know that well enough. But what are we to
do? Except by hardship we do not make our way into the Kingdom.&quot;<sup> <A HREF="#3">3</A>
</sup>The treatise <i>On the Government of God, </i>which is Salvian's best
known work, is essentially an exposition of this thesis: that the decline of the
Roman power actually demonstrated God's government and judgment of human
actions, since the sins of the Romans were such as had always, since the fall of
Adam, been visited with instant punishment. Consequently the first two books of
Salvian's discussion are chiefly devoted to demonstrations of God's judgment by
examples drawn from the authority of the Old Testament. The third book builds on
this foundation a clear exposition of the Christian obligation of an upright
life in God's service. On this basis Salvian then proceeded to contrast the
disgraceful actions of the Christian Romans of his time with their duty toward
God, and with the virtues of the victorious barbarians. Yet the latter, being
either heretics or pagans, were under less obligation to a godly life than the
orthodox Romans. To the author himself, and to his fellow clergy, the first
three books may well have seemed the essential portion of the argument: to us
the great interest of the work lies in the picture of the times given in the
last five. For here we have detailed accounts of the effects of the burden of
taxation on the poor, whom it ruined; on the rich, who managed to shift their
burden to weaker shoulders; and on the curials, who were forced into tyranny by
their responsibility to the agents of the central government for the sums due.
In this case as in others, reference to the imperial decrees collected in the <i>Codices
</i>proves the essential truth of Salvian's account. Sidonius Apollinaris has
given us in his letters charming descriptions of the life of the <A NAME="p5"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|5</SPAN></A>
wealthy nobles of southern Gaul: Salvian showed the other side of the picture
when he described the means by which some of these same nobles had acquired
their neighbors' land, and when he inveighed against the corruption of domestic
life in their villas. He has shown clearly the development of serfdom under
pressure of taxation and patronage, and the other alternatives from which the
poor might choose ---- flight to barbarian territory, or armed revolt against
the Roman system. And he has described in graphic terms, in part as an
eyewitness, the horrors that attended the capture and sack of wealthy Roman
cities, even at the hands of barbarians whom he believed to be far less brutal
and depraved than many Romans. He has pictured the triumphant progress of the
Vandals, reckoned as the weakest of Rome's enemies, through the richest
provinces of the West.</p>
<p>He showed, to be sure, only one side of life. The miseries of the time
prompted the doubts that he undertook to resolve; with these alone he was
directly concerned. He rarely admitted that there were exceptions to the
prevailing corruption of his fellow Romans. It was hardly consistent with his
thesis that he should do so, for his book was essentially a polemic. It is
important, however, to note in this connection that his statements are very
rarely in conflict with other contemporary evidence. Passages in the letters of
Sidonius, in the sermons and letters of his friends at L&eacute;rins, and of other
leaders of the church, as well as in the writings of pagans and in the laws of
the empire, regularly corroborate his account of the times. And he, in turn,
occasionally confirms their accounts of the beauty that still remained in life,
by his glimpses of Provence, with its pleasant country life and rich harvests
---- &quot; the one corner where the Roman power still lives.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><b>II. The Life of Salvian</b></p>
<p>As we have seen, Salvian wrote &quot;as one having authority.&quot; That he
had earned the right to speak is fully proved by the chief <A NAME="p6"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|6</SPAN></A>
contemporary reference to his life and work. Gennadius wrote of him, in his
biographical dictionary of illustrious men:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Salvian, presbyter of Marseilles, learned in human and divine letters, and,
  if I may apply the title to him, master of bishops, wrote many books in a
  clear and scholarly style. Of these I have read the following: four books
  addressed to Marcellus the presbyter, <i>On the Value of Virginity, </i>and
  four <i>Against Avarice; </i>five books <i>On the Present Judgment, </i>and
  one book <i>For the Satisfaction of These </i>[<i>Sins</i>],<i> </i>addressed
  to Salonius the bishop; one book in exposition of the last part of
  Ecclesiastes, addressed to Claudius, bishop of Vienne; one book of letters;
  one book composed in verse as a <i>Hexameron </i>after the Greek fashion, from
  the beginning of Genesis to the creation of man; many homilies written for
  bishops; and on the sacraments, books whose number I do not recall. He still
  lives today in a goodly old age.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Salvian's other names we do not know, due chiefly to the fact that fifth
century etiquette forbade the use of more than one name in friendly
correspondence,<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> but the title &quot;master of
bishops&quot; which Gennadius bestowed on him has more than atoned for the loss.
The modest office of presbyter at Marseilles would seem sufficient to refute the
early editors' claim of a bishop's mitre for him, even, without the negative
evidence of the omission of his name from the episcopal lists.<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
But the title &quot;master of bishops,&quot; <i>magister episcoporum, </i>is his
by manifold right, and is inseparably connected with his personality in the
minds of all who have studied his work. He lived and worked for some time at the
very nursery of bishops, L&eacute;rins, where he was chosen to teach the two sons of
Eucherius, both of whom were to become bishops later. At Marseilles he continued
his teaching, composing many homilies for bishops, as Gennadius said. Although
in his books <i>To the Church against Avarice </i>he spoke of himself as
&quot;least of the servants of God,&quot; he spoke with <A NAME="p7"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|7</SPAN></A>
the voice of authority, and his words were chiefly addressed to the great lords
of the church.</p>
<p>Many have called him by another title, which in its present meaning we cannot
claim for him, but which he rightfully enjoyed in its fifth century use. <i>Sanctus
</i>to him, as to all other Christians, before it seemed necessary to determine
fixed categories for the communion of saints, meant a devout Christian. The word
was applied to him by contemporaries, and recurs so often in his books that it
is small wonder that many of his editors have informally canonized him, others
have become involved in learned arguments to deprive him of sainthood,<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
and one university, at least, continues the good tradition in his honor.<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
Without doubt, as Baluze concludes, after disproving his claims to canonization,
&quot;there are many saints in heaven who are not so held by us in our
catalogues.&quot;</p>
<p>Of his personal life we know little, though he contributes so much to our
knowledge of the general circumstances of his time. Gennadius described him in
the last decade of the fifth century as still living <i>bona senectute. </i>It
is not possible for us to fix the exact date of his birth, but the wide
experience and ripe wisdom shown in his treatise <i>On the Government of God </i>indicate
at least that he had reached maturity some time before it was written. As this
book was evidently composed between A.D. 439 and 450, it is natural to assume
that he was born late in the fourth century or early in the fifth.<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
What we know of the events of his life belongs entirely to the period before the
publication of his chief work. The forty years or more that followed must be
filled in by the writing of some of those lost works of which Gennadius spoke,
and the many activities of a priest and &quot;master of bishops&quot; in one of
the chief centers of the Gallic church. Several years before Salvian settled in <A NAME="p8"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|8</SPAN></A>
Marseilles, a poet beggared by the Gothic raids sought refuge there, and found
&quot;many saints my dear friends.&quot; <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> Such a
haven from the storms that beset the rest of Gaul was sure to provide ample
activity for its priests.</p>
<p>The place of Salvian's birth has been much disputed. Some early editors
assumed that he was born in Africa ---- an assumption not unnatural in view of
his graphic description of the sins and the ruin of that province.<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
The account of the capture of Treves in his sixth book, however, makes it clear
that his native district was near the Rhine frontier. The claims of both Treves
and Cologne have been supported by various authorities. Whether he lived in one
of these cities, or on an estate in the countryside near by, his familiarity
with the whole district is unmistakable.</p>
<p>Treves was the place of all others in the western world where he could best
have studied the fatal magnificence of the higher Roman officials in the face of
the barbarian attacks. The praetorian prefect of the Gallic and Spanish
provinces kept his official residence there in such state as Constantius the
emperor had scarcely equalled when he fixed his capital in that city a century
earlier. There Salvian must have watched with growing anxiety the increasing
power of the Franks. The author of the twelfth century <i>Gesta Treverorum </i>tells
us that they had conceived a special hostility for this most splendid of Gallic
cities from the time of their first contact with it. This district also afforded
excellent opportunities to observe the increasing ravages of Goths, Vandals and
Burgundians. The great amphitheater of Treves was the scene of many of those
public spectacles against which Salvian inveighed so bitterly, and <A NAME="p9"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|9</SPAN></A>
when the Vandal Crocus captured the city in A.D. 406, the people were saved only
by taking refuge within its strong walls.<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> Years
later, Salvian wrote from Marseilles to the monks at L&eacute;rins, commending to
their kindly offices a young kinsman, a refugee from the captured city of
Cologne. He wrote to the brothers that the boy was &quot;of a family not
obscure, of which I might say something more, were he not related to me.&quot; <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
These words confirm the conclusions as to Salvian's family and position that we
should naturally draw from his writings. His parents were clearly of the
Gallo-Roman aristocracy: Salvian knew intimately the way of life of a man of
position and substance, however much he disapproved of it. His examples indicate
a considerable knowledge of life on the great estates, the masters' problems
with slaves and tenants, the results of patronage, the various forms of
cultivation employed, and at the same time a very real appreciation of the
natural beauties of the country. For slaves and poor men, and all who suffered
oppression, he had great sympathy. This, however, did not blind him to the
probability that they would be as bad as their oppressors if the tables were
turned. We do not need Gennadius' statement to prove that he had the full
rhetorical education of his time. Despite the arguments of some scholars to the
contrary, his works seem to indicate that he had continued to read widely in
&quot;human and divine letters.&quot; Greek he apparently did not read, and the
works of philosophers he quoted only at second hand. He was fond of examples
drawn from medical practice, but these are all of a sort with which any
intelligent man would be familiar.</p>
<p>His knowledge of law was far more detailed, and his writings furnish a
valuable commentary on the Roman <i>Codices, </i>which in their turn serve as a
check on his statements. Rittershausen concluded that he had had regular legal
training; certainly he had a legal mind, and legal phraseology recurs constantly
in his <A NAME="p10"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|10</SPAN></A> discussions. But it seems
equally probable, especially if his father held an imperial position, that his
juristic knowledge merely represents the attainment of a Roman citizen concerned
both in the complex management of a considerable estate and in affairs of
government administration. That he belonged to an imperial official family is
suggested by his attitude toward lesser officials. For the downtrodden poor his
sympathy is great, but for clerks, soldiers and tax collectors, and for the
curials who formed the miserable remnant of the local aristocracies, he seems to
have felt only scorn and distaste. His aristocratic prejudices were tempered by
Christian charity in other cases, but not in his attitude toward these men<sup>.<A HREF="#14">14</A>
</sup>It seems probable that he himself was brought up in the orthodox faith; at
least he shows little of that bitterness toward pagans and heretics that recent
converts are wont to feel. For those who called themselves Christians but
continued heathen practices, however, his antipathy was very strong. His wife,
Palladia, had been brought up in paganism, but her parents, Hypatius and Quieta,
seem to have made no objection to the marriage. Later, however, they were
alienated by the decision of Salvian and Palladia to follow a course which was
being adopted by many other Christian couples. Unable either to endure Roman
society as they found it, or to reform it from within, they determined to give
their property to the church, and live no longer as man and wife, but as brother
and sister in Christian fellowship. Paulinus of Nola, the one contemporary to
whose example Salvian clearly alludes,<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> is the
best known of those who sought that peace in Christian poverty which Roman
wealth had failed to give. The anger of Ausonius at his friend's course reflects
a situation that must have been many times repeated. In this case, however, it
culminated in one of the most poignant expressions of friendship that man has
ever written.<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> <A NAME="p11"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|11</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After an estrangement from their parents that lasted nearly seven years,
Salvian, Palladia and the little daughter Auspiciola tried once more to effect a
reconciliation. Their letter,<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> which has
fortunately been preserved, seems far too mannered and artificial to be
convincing, but this formality was a set convention in the letter-writing of the
time. Their pleas are sincere and loving, though yielding not one jot as to the
essential rightness of their course. The immediate occasion of the letter seems
to have been the news of the parents' conversion to Christianity, which would
seem indeed to work in favor of their case. Palladia followed her husband's
arguments by memories of the days when they had called her &quot;little
starling, little mistress, little mother, birdling:&quot; she pleaded tenderly,
too, for little Auspiciola, who deserved her grandparents' love.</p>
<p>Of the issue of their suit we know nothing. They had withdrawn from the
vicinity of Treves, probably shortly after that destruction of the city which
Salvian saw with his own eyes, and so graphically described.<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
About A.D. 418 the praetorian prefect of Gaul seems to have changed his seat
from Treves to Aries; perhaps Salvian's was one of the Roman families that
withdrew soon after, either for official or private reasons.<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
We do not know whether it was before or after this move that their ascetic
resolution was taken; in any case, they went soon to the islands of the L&eacute;rins,
which offered monasteries, separate but not remote from each other, for families
in such case as theirs. Nothing is known thereafter of Palladia and Auspiciola;
Salvian's life apparently lay apart from theirs.</p>
<p>L&eacute;rins was that &quot;earthly paradise&quot; <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
which furnished a haven for many religious of the day, and was so powerful a
stimulant to their faith that from it went forth a seemingly endless stream of <A NAME="p12"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|12</SPAN></A>
saintly men. Honoratus and Hilary, Caesarius and Virgilius went from L&eacute;rins to
the archbishopric of Aries; Maximus and Faustus to the see of Riez; Lupus to
Troyes. Eucherius came to L&eacute;rins with his wife Galla and his two sons. He
himself left to become bishop of Lyons<i>; </i>his sons, Salonius and Veranus,
were put under the successive tutelage of Honoratus, Hilary, Salvian. and
Vincent,<sup><A HREF="#21">21</A> </sup>and became bishops of Geneva and Vence.
Three bishops went from L&eacute;rins to Avignon, and many others might be named.<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A></p>
<p>Honoratus was abbot at L&eacute;rins in Salvian's time and was called by Eucherius
&quot;master of bishops, doctor of the churches,&quot; being thus the prototype
of Salvian. Shortly after A.D. 429, Hilarius of Aries preached at Marseilles a
sermon on the life of Honoratus, in which he quoted from the writings of &quot;a
man of not unmerited distinction, and most blessed in Christ, Salvian the
presbyter, one of Honoratus' dear associates.&quot; <A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
Thus he gives us not only a glimpse of the esteem in which Salvian was already
held, but a <i>terminus ante quem </i>for his ordination. Just when Salvian
moved to Marseilles we do not know, nor why. Certainly it was through no
antagonism at L&eacute;rins, for his first letter, already mentioned, expresses the
utmost affection for the brothers there. The initial paragraph, on the
bitter-sweetness of love, which at times compels one to ask of beloved friends a
favor that without love would be <A NAME="p13"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|13</SPAN></A>
irksome, bears witness to the depth of his feeling for the monks. Its concluding
words testify to his; high esteem for them: &quot;Surely, if there is any good
character in this young man, his hope and salvation will not prove to be of
great difficulty to you; even if he receives no actual teaching, it is enough
for him to be with you.&quot;</p>
<p>The years at L&eacute;rins must have exerted great influence on the development of
Salvian's thought and style. The close fellowship between the monks of the
island is constantly demonstrated by likenesses of ideas and phrasing in the
writings of the many great men who there received their early training. Parts of
the homilies of Caesarius of Aries, of Valerius and Hilarius bear striking
resemblances to passages in Salvian's work. Vincent's <i>Commonitorium </i>has
been appropriately included in many editions of Salvian, thus continuing their
ancient fellowship. The book <i>On the Government of God, </i>as well as a lost
work, was dedicated to Salonius, whom Salvian addressed in his ninth letter as
&quot;master and most blessed pupil, father, and son, pupil by instruction, son
by affection, and father by rank and honor.&quot;</p>
<p>The life of Caesarius of Aries throws some light on the statement that
Salvian composed many homilies for bishops. We read of Caesarius that:</p>
<p>He composed also appropriate sermons for feast days and other occasions, and
sermons against the evils of drunkenness and lust, against discord and hatred,
against anger and pride, against sacrilegious men and soothsayers, against pagan
rites, against augurs, the worshippers of woods and of springs, and against the
vices of divers men. He so prepared these homilies that if any visitors asked,
far from refusing to loan them, he offered them for copying at the slightest
suggestion of a request, and himself corrected them. He sent copies by priests
to men far distant in the Frankish land, in Gaul, Italy and Spain and divers
provinces, to be preached in their churches, that, casting aside frivolous and
transitory interests, they might, as the apostle preached, become followers of
good works.<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> <A NAME="p14"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|14</SPAN></A>
Gennadius' emphasis on the homilies of Salvian suggests that their composition
may have been one of the major preoccupations of his life in Marseilles, and a
chief ground for his title of &quot;master of bishops.&quot; That many of his
sermons took the form of invectives against the vices of his day may be assumed
from the extant books <i>Against Avarice </i>and <i>On the Government of God. </i>Both
of these, indeed, have the air of having been compiled from actual sermons. The
congregation is clearly visualized, which may account for the frequent use of
the second person, and of a vivid colloquial tone.</p>
<p>That his attacks on the weaknesses of his contemporaries caused him serious
difficulties is indicated by his constant reiteration that his words are sure to
give offence to many, but even so they must be said. Larinus Amatius said in his
eulogy of Salvian: &quot;For if wrath engenders hatred among all men, and begets
it especially among the wicked, who was ever more hated for the truth than
Salvian, since no one ever set forth more truths than he?&quot; <A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A></p>
<p>From the time of his removal to Marseilles, all that we know of Salvian's
life is summed up in Gennadius' account. The few extant letters are chiefly of
value for the glimpses they afford of his regard for the deference due to those
of higher rank in the church, and their evidence of his continuing association
with his former friends and pupils at L&eacute;rins. An example is his letter to
Eucherius, thanking him for a copy of his <i>Instructions on the More Difficult
Questions of the Old and New Testament</i>,<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> which
the bishop had written for his sons, now themselves &quot; masters of
churches.&quot; Lacking any further evidence for the closing years of Salvian's
life than the goodly old age with which Gennadius credited him, we can only hope
that he gained fulfilment of the wish with which his letter to Eucherius ended:
&quot;May God in his mercy grant me throughout the days of my life, or at least
when they are ended, that those who have been my pupils may daily pray for
me.&quot; <A NAME="p15"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|15</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>III. Salvian's Literary Work</b></p>
<p>Gennadius' list shows that, while much of Salvian's work has been lost, the
books that remain are probably the most individual and the most interesting to
us. The writings of several other early Christians present such titles as <i>On
the Value of Virginity, A Book in Exposition of the Last Part of Ecclesiastes, </i>and
books <i>On the Sacraments. </i>One title is obscure, the book to Salonius <i>Pro
eorum merito satisfactionis, </i>or <i>Pro eorum praemio satisfaciendo. </i>The
variants in the text of Gennadius indicate that the obscurity is of long
standing in the manuscript tradition. In my translation I have followed Ebert's
conjecture of <i>peccatorum </i>for <i>eorum, </i>which at least makes possible
a conjectural translation of the title ---- <i>For the Satisfaction of These
Sins,</i><A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> a book that might conceivably have been
a companion volume to that <i>On the Government of God.</i></p>
<p>Of the homilies written for bishops, and the influence of sermon writing on
Salvian's general style, I have already spoken. It is possible, as Peter Allix
suggested, that the anonymous poem on Genesis formerly ascribed to Tertullian
may be part of the lost <i>Hexameron </i>of Salvian; the poem is, however, of
slight importance, and its identification as the work of our author would be
chiefly valuable as an indication of his wisdom in not publishing other verses.<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
Only nine of the letters are preserved; of these I have already spoken. The
ninth, addressed to Salonius, is of special interest, since it explains both
Salvian's purpose in writing his four books <i>Against Avarice, </i>and his
reasons for publishing them anonymously. Salonius feared that since the work was
issued as the <A NAME="p16"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|16</SPAN></A> <i>Address of
Timotheus to the Church against Avarice, </i>it might be mistaken for an
apocryphal work of the &quot;Apostle&quot; Timothy.</p>
<p>Like the <i>Government of God, </i>the invective <i>Against Avarice </i>was
written because of Salvian's deep conviction of the dangers inherent in the
persistent vices of men who called themselves Christians. Avarice was a
besetting sin of many Romans, and had infected not only members of the church,
but its clergy, even to the bishops themselves. The resultant neglect of the
true service of God, and of the spiritual and material welfare of the church,
led Salvian to &quot;burst forth into words of lamentation&quot; addressed to
the church to which the offenders belonged. His failure to attach his own name
to the book he explained not only by his desire to avoid vain glory in a service
to God, but also by his conviction that the obscurity of his name might detract
from the influence of his words. The pseudonym Timotheus (&quot;Honoring
God&quot;) was chosen to indicate the motive of the work: &quot; Indeed, the
writer thought it fitting that, writing his books for the honor of God, he
should consecrate the title to his divine honor.&quot; <A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A></p>
<p>In spite of this letter, and of Gennadius' ascription of the work to Salvian,
its anonymity was preserved in modern times, for it was published by Sichardus
at Fol near Basel in 1528 as. the work of Bishop Timotheus, in a collection
entitled <i>An Antidote against the Heresies of All Ages.</i></p>
<p>While no one who reads the treatise <i>Against Avarice </i>can doubt the
sincerity and depth of feeling with which it was written, the work is a curious
document of the times. Avarice was considered one of the deadly sins. But it is
hard now to avoid seeing some self-interest on the part of the church in the
constant exhortations to the rich to give all their goods to the church in order
to win remission of their sins. In its simplest form, this is the admonition of
Christ to the rich young man: as it is elaborated to produce a surer conviction
in the minds of fifth century Midases it is <A NAME="p17"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|17</SPAN></A>
perilously close to the purchase of absolution. Some modern writers have thought
the book more likely to encourage the avarice of the church than to discourage
that of churchmen; others have seen in it an anticipation of the later satires
against the greed of the clergy.<sup><A HREF="#30">30</A> </sup>The irony that
is never far from Salvian's writing is even more marked than usual in this
indictment, but the unprejudiced reader is not likely to see in it an intention
of actual satire. Nor is it sufficient to dismiss it, as Teuffel does, simply as
a <i>ballon d'essai.</i><sup><A HREF="#31">31</A> </sup>It was clearly written
in all seriousness, albeit in bitterness of heart, with the earnest hope of
exerting a salutary influence against a chief evil of the times. The author
employed the arguments that experience had taught him were most likely to be
effective.</p>
<p>That this work was written before the completion of the treatise <i>On the
Government of God </i>is shown by the quotation from it in the latter; it may
with some probability be assigned to the years 435-439.<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
The words of Timothy to the church must have aroused much anger among
ecclesiastical leaders, and apparently this antagonism made Salvian rather
sensitive to criticism, though none the less determined to attack the vices of
his day. That his later books would not be less fearless because of any
hostility thus aroused, he showed in his concluding paragraphs, in which there
is not a little of his own spiritual biography:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>All human work is unworthy in comparison with the future glory. So nothing
  ought to seem hard and austere to Christians, because whatever they offer to
  Christ is in return for eternal blessings; what is given is vile when that
  which is received is so great. Nothing great is paid to God by men on earth,
  in comparison with the supreme gift of heaven. It is hard for misers to lavish
  their wealth. What is strange in this? Everything is hard that is demanded of
  the unwilling. Almost every divine word arouses animosity ---- there are as
  many hostile schools as there are teachers. <A NAME="p18"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|18</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If the Lord orders men to be generous, the miser is angry; if he exacts
  parsimony, the prodigal curses. The wicked consider the sacred speeches their
  enemies; robbers shudder at what is written about justice, the proud at
  precepts of humility; the drunken oppose the request for sobriety and the
  shameless the command of chastity. So we must either say nothing, or expect
  that whatever is said will displease one man or another. Any wicked man would
  rather execrate the law than amend his character; he would rather hate
  precepts than vices.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, what do those men do who have been given by Christ the duty of
  speaking? They displease God if they are silent, men if they speak. But, as
  the apostles said to the Jews, it is better to obey God than man. This is the
  advice I offer to all to whom the law of God seems heavy and onerous, even if
  they do not entirely refuse to receive it, in order that those things may
  please them, which God ordains. All who hate the sacred commandments have the
  cause of their hatred within themselves. Every man's dislike of the law is due
  not to its precepts, but to his own life; the law indeed is good, but his
  habits are bad. So men should change their attitude and their point of view.
  If they make their habits worthy of approbation, nothing that the good law
  enjoins will displease them. For when a man has begun to be good, he cannot
  fail to love the law of God, which has within it that which holy men have in
  their lives.<A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><b>IV. On The Government of God</b></p>
<p>The work on which for us the real interest of Salvian's life and thought
depends, is that which Gennadius cited as five books <i>On the Present Judgment,
</i>but which the manuscripts offer us as eight books <i>On the Government of
God. </i>In this treatise Salvian discusses the defeat of Litorius in a.d. 439,
but fails to mention the Vandal sack of Rome in 455, which must have profoundly
impressed him. In view of the description he gives of the Vandal capture of
Carthage, he would scarcely have omitted their raid on Rome. So we may
reasonably suppose that the book was published between a.d. 439 and 455. We may
probably limit the period somewhat more by the assumption that the great battle
between the Romans and the Huns would have been mentioned if the treatise had
been finished after 451. The argument from silence is less <A NAME="p19"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|19</SPAN></A>
dangerous in this instance, because of the general inclusiveness of Salvian's
allusions to contemporary matters germane to his purpose, as these great events
certainly would have been. Whatever the date of publication, the book is the
mature product of some years of preaching.</p>
<p>It is evident that only the third and fifth books mark distinct developments
in the argument. Some claim that elsewhere the division into books is purely
arbitrary and does not betray any set intention on the part of the author. Since
Gennadius speaks of <i>five, </i>and not <i>eight </i>books it has been assumed
that a new division was made, perhaps as a matter of scribal convenience, after
Gennadius wrote. Brakman, however, suggested with some plausibility that
Gennadius may actually have written VIII, and a scribe mis-copied the letters as
IIIII, which would be a natural error, if the <i>V </i>were imperfect. And the
length of the individual books varies too much for a purely arbitrary division,
whereas some case can be made out for the logic of the present arrangement.<A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A></p>
<p>For the modern reader the chief interest of Salvian's work lies in the
description of the life of the times in his later books. The careful building up
of the evidence of the sacred authorities for God's judgment of the world seems
tedious and repetitious. We are inclined to rebel at the constant reference to
authority in the first three books. It is not unnatural to prefer the Old
Testament itself to Salvian's reworking of the same themes with abundance of
quotation. The cento is no longer a favored literary form, and overabundant
quotation, at least when openly acknowledged, is out of favor. Few of us are
likely to be in the position of the men of the fifth century who found it
difficult to choose among various poor renderings of the Old Testament, since
Jerome's version was just beginning to make its way into Gaul, or to procure a
complete copy even if the initial obstacle of choice were overcome. The <A NAME="p20"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|20</SPAN></A>
reader who wishes his interest readily aroused, who would read the past in the
light of his own experience, had best begin with the fourth book. A generation
ago it would have been natural to remark that in Salvian's tract for his own
times in these later books there is much that might be applied with little
change to our own day. Such a statement would be no less true now, were it the
present custom of historians to study past records as a source of moral examples
for the current age.</p>
<p>But to avoid the risk of tedium by omitting the first three books is to lose
much of the essence of the work, and of the fifth-century manner of thought.
Salvian wrote not for us, but for his contemporaries. Historically, therefore,
it is of value to note how he built up his demonstration of a fundamental
principle ---- God's constant government and immediate judgment of his people.
Not only pagans, but men who called themselves Christians, were led by a faulty
reading of their times to question this tenet of the Christian faith. The
Christians must be made to realize that such doubts were directly contradictory
to the testimony of the Bible on which their faith rested. Hence the full
evidence of the Scriptures was brought into court before the witness of
contemporary life was summoned. It is futile to say that Salvian was merely
attempting to prove God's judgment by reiterating his statement that God
constantly sees and judges his people, or, as some put it, that he cites the
authority of the Scriptures in support of that authority. There is no indication
that his opponents had questioned the authority of the Biblical narrative. They
had, indeed, questioned a fundamental doctrine of Christianity, having what
would appear to be good reason for such doubts in the distress into which they,
though a Christian people, had fallen. The validity of their estimate of God's
injustice to themselves was a secondary matter to Salvian. The first necessity
was to remind them that their doubts as to God's complete and immediate justice
in the governance of the world were constantly disproved by the scriptural
authority. <A NAME="p21"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|21</SPAN></A> Since they had shown
themselves either ignorant or forgetful of the evidence of the Bible on this
subject, it must be recapitulated for them. The foundation thus laid, they would
be in a fit frame of mind to consider how the apparent injustice of their
present misfortunes might be squared with the unvarying justice of the God they
worshipped. We are too apt to forget that his words were addressed not to pagans
or heretics but to orthodox Christians, For these the first essential was
fulness of understanding of their own faith: its application to their transitory
circumstances was secondary. To many of its first readers the latter part of the
work may have seemed an irrelevant anticlimax to the real argument, since it
depended less closely on scriptural authority for its substance and Lactantius
for its structure, and dealt with matters of ephemeral interest.</p>
<p>Like Augustine, Salvian was distressed by the &quot;false opinion held by
many&quot; in his time, that the contrast between the poverty and captivity of
the Christian Roman Empire and the prosperous domination of pagan Rome proved
that God neither cared for the world he had created nor governed and judged it,
except by a judgment too far in the future to afford any present satisfaction to
the just or fear to the wicked. Such attacks on Christianity Augustine had
answered by his contrast, a generation earlier, between the ephemeral city of
this world and the eternal City of God. Another portion of his answer had been
assigned to Orosius, who undertook in his <i>History against the Pagans </i>to
prove that the evils into which the Christian Roman Empire had fallen were less
than those of past and pagan generations. He even dared to remind his readers
that the most glorious conquests of Rome had afforded far greater misery,
disgrace and suffering to her defeated enemies than the Romans themselves now
suffered, and to prophesy that those who now seemed barbarous destroyers of a
mighty empire would some day be honored as heroes of the nations they were
founding. Orosius' minimizing of Rome's dangers was possible, though <A NAME="p22"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|22</SPAN></A>
somewhat fantastic, even after the Gothic sack of the city in A.D. 410. When
Salvian wrote such an attitude was no longer reasonable. Orosius had prophesied
that new nations would take the place of Rome; Salvian, while he conceived the
Empire as still the great cohesive force in the western world, saw the Teutonic
nations settled within its former borders. Goths, Vandals, Burgundians and
Franks had established their own kingdoms, and if any of them lost ground, it
was not because of the superiority of the Romans, but of the other barbarians.
Rome had long tried to suppress the peasants' revolt of the Bagaudae, but
without lasting success, and this situation was rendered the more serious by the
fact that the cause of the rebellion was oppressive taxation for which no
workable remedy was found. Britain was cut off from Rome by Saxon raids and by
her own dissensions. The Vandals were in possession of the former province of
Africa, the granary of Rome and the great center of Christian teaching.
Salvian's debt to Tertullian, Cyprian, Lactantius and Augustine was so great
that he recalled with difficulty that many of his readers thought the home of
these Fathers remote from them, and were little concerned in its ruin.<sup><A HREF="#35">35</A>
</sup>Salvian's own home in the Rhineland had been several times ravaged by the
Franks. The success of Aetius in checking disintegration during the years of his
leadership seemed due in no small part to his shrewdness in alliances and his
discretion in granting favorable terms to the Goths and Vandals for security
against an aggression with which he might not be able to cope directly. His
success was more than once endangered by the lack of prudence and cooperation
among his subordinates.<A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A></p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rome herself opened her gates to fur-clad satellites,&nbsp;<br>
    And was captive ere her capture.<A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Everywhere the growing disproportion between the expenses and the income of
the Empire led to taxation that would have been <A NAME="p23"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|23</SPAN></A>
heavy under the most favorable circumstances. With the opportunities for
privilege and graft that the nobles in the imperial hierarchy could always find,
against which the more lowly could only struggle impotently, this became
unendurable. Salvian's picture of the times does not stand alone : it is gloomy
in comparison with that of Sidonius Apollinaris in his letters, and yet Sidonius
gives ample evidence to confirm much of Salvian's detail. It is more gloomy than
that of Ausonius in his verses, but a man who had resigned all that he had to
seek God's peace, could hardly be expected to find the continuance of the
elegant pleasures of society in southern Gaul a cause for light-heartedness. It
must be remembered also that matters had improved somewhat, though temporarily,
in the generation between Salvian's book and the letters of Sidonius.<sup><A HREF="#38">38</A>
</sup>Salvian's sympathies for the poor and oppressed were very great, the
greater because he had himself become poor, though oppression could not touch
him personally in any respect for which he now cared. From his new point of
view, the good men in the upper orders at Rome were too few to count. The best
of those who still lived in the world were very far from following the teachings
of Christ. That poor men and slaves might be quite as wicked as the rich, if a
sudden access of fortune made it possible, did not alter the reality of the
oppression they suffered. That lack of a sturdy middle class, the importance of
which during the period of decline of the Roman power Rostovtzeff has so vividly
emphasized, is abundantly illustrated in Salvian's curious picture of the
society of his time.</p>
<p>He undertook, at a time when the task was as difficult as at any period of
the world's history, to justify the ways of God to man, to prove his constant
government of the world and his immediate judgment. This involved the proof not
only that the orthodox Romans deserved their misfortunes, but that the pagan and
heretic <A NAME="p24"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|24</SPAN></A> barbarians merited their
successes. It required also a satisfactory answer to the question why God had
treated the Romans better when they were pagans than he did now that they were
Christians. The latter question is never actually taken up, though Salvian
promised at the beginning of the seventh book to answer it at the end of his
work, if God should permit. But the end is missing.</p>
<p>It is inappropriate to judge the proofs that Salvian gives of the just
judgment of God in the light of rational argument or historical criticism. He
himself carefully denned his audience; his words were addressed to Christian
Romans, not to pagans, heretics or barbarians. &quot;For if I am addressing
Christians, I do not doubt that I shall prove my case. But if I speak to pagans,
I should scorn the attempt, not for any shortage of proofs, but because I
despair of any profit in my discourse. Surely it is fruitless and lost labor,
when a perverted listener is not open to conviction.&quot;<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A></p>
<p>Christianity and rationalism were to him inconsistent and mutually exclusive
terms: &quot;I am a man, I do not understand the secrets of God.&quot; <A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
If his arguments seem at times to form a vicious circle, it is because he
inevitably assumed as his basis the very points he was attempting to
demonstrate. The great fact of the world, recognized by pagan philosophers and
Christian theologians alike, was that God constantly governed and judged it;
Lactantius had worked out philosophical and theological proofs of this in his <i>Divine
Institutions. </i>Salvian deliberately adopted the groundwork furnished by his
predecessor and made his indebtedness evident after the classical manner by
direct though unacknowledged quotations. He was undertaking to reassure the
Christian, not to instruct and convert the heathen or heretic; to enable the
Christian to adjust his views of himself and of God to the dispensation under
which he lived, and to effect such personal reformation as would take away the
necessity of future punishment.<A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A> <A NAME="p25"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|25</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first two books formed the foundation for the whole, following Lactantius
closely in form and drawing most of their non-Biblical citations from him. This
preliminary portion of the work is largely homiletic in character, demonstrating
the government and judgment of God by examples drawn from the earlier books of
the Old Testament, and by &quot;testimonies&quot; from the Bible as a whole. In
the third book Salvian definitely undertook to answer the question &quot;why we
Christians, who believe in God, are more wretched than all other men.&quot; The
answer in various forms occupied the rest of his work, which became more and
more a study of contemporary society and events as he proceeded. For he saw the
calamities and disasters of the world as God's judgments on the gross immorality
of the Roman people. Not only were the triumphant barbarians less wicked than
the Romans, but, being either pagans or heretics, they deserved indulgence for
sins committed in ignorance, not in full knowledge of the Christian law. As
Matter ably pointed out, Salvian's indictment of the Christians furnished
plentiful material to the pagans for attacks on Christianity,<A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
but Salvian might have countered that it was not the accusation but the crime
that made such attacks possible. His ideal was that of ascetic Christianity, of
poverty in this life for the sake of eternal salvation, but he was not one of
those who looked for a speedy ending of the world, and the coming of the last
judgment. He saw a <A NAME="p26"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|26</SPAN></A> continuing world,
which God's immediate and constant judgment no longer suffered to continue as it
had when the Empire was intact, in which a new and potentially better regime was
gradually being formed. Among the ancient Romans to whom &quot;everything
unknown seemed glorious&quot; it was an old tradition that barbarians were freer
of vice than civilized men. If Salvian at times seems to exaggerate this view,
he had some support not only in the readiness with which men in conquered
territory adapted themselves to a regime less oppressive than the old, but also
in the actual flight of many Romans to barbarian protection from the demands of
Roman fiscal agents. He was not alone in feeling that there were compensations
in the partial breakdown of the old system. Paulinus of Pella had been one of
the luxurious, self-centered Aquitanians of the type that Salvian accused; his
lapses from virtue were considerable, though not such as to occasion censure
among his peers. When his great estates were lost and he was living in
comparative poverty and full repentance, he wrote his autobiography in verse as
a thanksgiving for God's mercies to him.<A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A> A like
attitude is found in the poem of a husband to his wife, and also in a song on
the divine providence, both formerly attributed to Prosper of Aquitaine.<A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
Salvian was trying to bring others to a similar frame of mind.</p>
<p>Augustine had employed the same argument in his <i>Sermo de tempore barbarico,
</i>a brief homily very closely akin to Salvian's book, and with the same
conclusion: the calamities of the world were due to the wrath of God, warning us
that we should not neglect atonement for our sins. The theme is not infrequent
elsewhere.</p>
<p>In his books <i>Against Avarice </i>Salvian dwelt constantly on the need of
repentance and charity because of the imminent danger <A NAME="p27"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|27</SPAN></A>
of death: in his treatise <i>On the Government of God </i>he was concerned
instead with the amendment and reformation necessary for continued life. Of one
thing he is sure, that the true Christian cannot be wretched, and therefore a
fuller Christianity is the only real solution of the problem. His arguments are
by no means free from inconsistencies of detail. On one occasion, for example,
slaves are described as generally better than their masters, while on another we
learn that the best masters usually have bad slaves. But there is no
inconsistency in the fundamental thesis.</p>
<p>The violence of his feeling made him no respecter of persons; in spite of his
avowed desire to consider the priests of God as above reproach, he is so bitter
in his denunciations of wickedness within the church that Bellarmine said of
him: &quot;His exaggeration of the vices of Christians and especially of the
clergy of his time would seem excessive, did his words not proceed from true
zeal for the glory of God and the salvation of souls.&quot; <A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
And Guillon found the indictment of the church in the ninth chapter of the third
book so violent that he could scarcely bring himself to transcribe it, and
finally effected a compromise between loyalty to his church and his scholarly
conscience by copying the translation of P&egrave;re Bonnet, and so gaining his pious
sanction for the overbold words.<A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A></p>
<p>Salvian's irony is very marked, especially in the treatise <i>Against
Avarice. </i>The abb&eacute; de la Rue, in one of his Lenten sermons, followed a
quotation from Saivian by the words: &quot;<i>Voil&agrave; l'ironie de Salvien, mais
discr&egrave;te et charitable</i>.&quot; <A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A> Salvian's
friends, however, probably feared that it lacked discretion, and those against
whom it was turned very likely felt it weak in charity; but it was seldom
bitter. It is not inappropriate that the last sentence of the treatise <i>On the
Government of God </i>that has come down to us displays an irony so <A NAME="p28"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|28</SPAN></A>
pronounced that recent editors have destroyed it by inserting a negative.<A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A></p>
<p align="center"><b>V. Style and Latinity</b></p>
<p>Salvian's style justifies the praise of Gennadius. While it is not altogether
free from the faults of the rhetorical taste of his time, it is never obscure
and rarely overburdened. In his preface he stressed the importance of subject
matter as compared with style, and declared that his work was meant to be
salutary rather than eloquent. This emphasis on content rather than form did not
produce crudeness but served in general as a controlling element against the
excesses of the rhetorician. He is fond of antithesis, of figures of speech and
series of balanced phrases; he has a marked predilection for alliteration,
assonance and rhyme, fostered by his love of plays on words.<A HREF="#49"><SUP>49</SUP></A>
His great fault is a wearisome repetition, a failing, however, that arises not
so much from carelessness in style as from anxiety to hammer a point home. He
runs out of words for his reiteration of a theme, and uses the same one till
they are worn threadbare, yet this is a relief from the artificially varied
phrases which the letter writers of his time would substitute. Indeed, his own
letters are far more artificial than his other works. He was conscious of his
wordiness, which may have been partly due to his preaching, and he speaks more
than once of his fear that the prolixity of his style may arouse distaste in his
readers.<A HREF="#50"><SUP>50</SUP></A> It is at least, as Gregoire remarked,
sufficient to terrify the most intrepid of translators, yet Joseph Scaliger
could rightly exclaim of Salvian's work: &quot;Le beau livre que c'est, et une
belle simplicity!&quot; <A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A></p>
<p>Salvian's vocabulary was the source of much discussion among <A NAME="p29"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|29</SPAN></A>
the earlier editors. Having in their introduction lauded him as a second
Demosthenes or Cicero, and explored the history of rhetoric for phrases in his
honor, they found themselves compelled, when they turned from the general to the
particular, to account for his use of words which Cicero had never employed.
Eventually they explained the considerable number of late Latin words by the
influence of his subject and of his many Biblical quotations. Most of the late
Latin and ecclesiastical words in his vocabulary are found also in Tertullian,
Lactantius, Hilarius, Cyprian and Sidonius Apollinaris; others reflect the
language of the jurists. In common with the other writers of his day, he shows a
noticeable but not excessive fluidity of word formation, a fondness for negative
adjectives and for diminutives, the latter usually to give a sense of humility
or of sympathy and pity. A few of them are rather sesquipedalian formations, as
the <i>excusatiuncula </i>and <i>deprecatiuncula </i>of the second chapter of
the third book <i>Against Avarice.</i></p>
<p>A recent thorough study of his use of moods and tenses resulted in the
conclusion that, in spite of frequent departures from the pure classical norm,
Salvian cannot be accused of negligence or lack of skill; that he followed fixed
rules, though not always those of the best classical Latinity.<A HREF="#52"><SUP>52</SUP></A></p>
<p>A very large proportion of his material is drawn from the Bible or from his
own and contemporary experience. Aside from his direct and purposed use of
Lactantius in the first two books <A HREF="#53"><SUP>53</SUP></A> and from
natural reminiscences of both Lactantius and Tertullian when writing of a
subject which they had considered from the same point of view as his (e.g., on
the games), he seems deliberately to avoid obvious citations and quotations
other than those from the Bible. Yet there is ample evidence that his memory was
well stocked with pagan and earlier patristic literature. His reticence in
quotation from secular authors is distinctly at variance with the <A NAME="p30"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|30</SPAN></A>
habit of his times, and corresponds to his general strictures on the rhetorical
ideal of literary composition. He cites Vergil and Cicero as the authors of
quotations only when the latter are drawn from Lactantius, although elsewhere
there are clear reminiscences of both. His acquaintance with the works of Seneca
is indicated by several passages in which the resemblance between the thought
and ideas of the two authors is unusually striking. Rittershausen cites
parallels from Minucius Felix almost as often as from Seneca, but for most of
these equally close parallels may be found in Lactantius, so that no other
source need be considered. The obvious extent of Salvian's education makes it an
unnecessary strain on one's credulity to believe with some commentators that all
the similarities to known passages in the works of pagan authors are due to
chance, and none to his personal knowledge of the books concerned.</p>
<p>The result of his method of allusion is very satisfactory; classical
reminiscences are readily apparent to the reader with a well stocked mind, but
do not intrude themselves on the less informed, to distract his attention from
the argument. Nor was there any risk of seeming to set pagan writers on a level
with biblical authority. The frequent biblical quotations are drawn most
commonly from the old <i>Itala </i>versions, but Salvian also used the
translation of Jerome occasionally; indeed, with his friend Eucherius he was
among the first of the Christian writers in Gaul to employ the new text.<A HREF="#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>
His citations are rather loose, and where the same passage is quoted more than
once, there are sometimes variations in the wording. The translation of his
numerous biblical quotations presents some difficulty. It is, of course, natural
and almost inevitable to use the familiar and beautiful text of the King James
Version, and in general I have done this, even in some cases where Salvian's
wording might suggest a slightly different rendering. In several <A NAME="p31"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|31</SPAN></A>
passages, however, either marked differences between Salvian's text of the Bible
and that on which the King James Version is based, or his rather free
adaptations of the text to its setting in his argument, have required
corresponding changes in the English rendering.</p>
<p align="center"><b>VI. The Editions of Salvian's Works</b></p>
<p>Schoenemann distinguished three ages in the editions of Salvian;<A HREF="#55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>
the first, from 1528 to 1580, is that in which the two major works were
published. The treatise <i>Against Avarice </i>was issued by Sichardus at Fol
near Basle in 1528: two years later Brassicanus published in the same city his <i>editio
princeps </i>of the books <i>On the Government of God, </i>based apparently on
the extant Vienna manuscript of the fifteenth century (MS Vindobonensis 826).
The next period, from 1580 to 1663, was dominated by the editions of Pierre
Pithou, the first of which, published at Paris in 1580, was so much in demand
that it soon came, as Baluze said, to have almost the rarity of a manuscript.
This was the more unfortunate, as the several reprints were inferior.<A HREF="#56"><SUP>56</SUP></A>
In 1611 Conrad Rittershausen published an edition at Altdorf, with far more
copious notes than those of previous editors. He seems to have been the first to
find much space for commentary on other points than the establishment of the
text, and included literary and juristic references of considerable interest and
value. His edition, however, was little used outside of Germany.</p>
<p>In the third period, as Schoenemann says, <i>solus regnat Baluzius. </i>Stephen
Baluze published his first edition of Salvian's works together with the <i>Commonitorium
</i>of Vincent of L&eacute;rins in 1663, and this rapidly superseded the earlier
editions. Using the tenth century manuscript of Corbie (Paris, Bibl. Nat. MS
Lat. 13385), by <A NAME="p32"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|32</SPAN></A> far the best of
existing manuscripts, he was able to construct a text superior to any previously
published. The commentary of Baluze has formed the basis, often unacknowledged,
of many notes on Salvian since, a source of information which one could not
afford to overlook. His work is chiefly cited now in the fourth edition,
published in 1742 at Stadtamhof.</p>
<p>Here end Schoenemann's three ages; but as far as the text is concerned,
Baluze has been dethroned in our present age, first by Halm in 1877 and then by
Pauly in 1883.<A HREF="#57"><SUP>57</SUP></A> Since notes in these modern
editions are limited to the <i>apparatus criticus, </i>Baluze still reigns in
the field of commentary. Meanwhile, from the sixteenth century to the early
nineteenth, there have been numerous lesser editions, frequently pirated from
those more famous.<A HREF="#58"><SUP>58</SUP></A></p>
<p align="center"><b>VII. Estimates of Salvian 's Work</b></p>
<p>When Brassicanus published his first edition of Salvian's treatise <i>On the
Government of God, </i>he found ready applause for his achievement in rescuing
so great a work from the dust and spider webs of a thousand years; the occasion
was a fitting one for those <A NAME="p33"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|33</SPAN></A> odes
which his contemporaries so loved to write. Perhaps his romantic tale of the
manuscripts he had found at Buda in the libraiy of his friend Matthew Corvinus,
king of Bohemia, just before its destruction by the Turks, absorbed his friends'
interest so far that they forgot the scribes who had made this edition possible
by their earlier copies of the book. While we have no other evidence for the
reading of Salvian's books between the date of Gennadius' account, which seems
to be the source of the scanty later mentions, and Sichardus' publication of <i>Against
Avarice </i>in 1528, the manuscripts lend their testimony that copies were made,
corrected, and presumably read, in the tenth century, and in the twelfth,
thirteenth and fifteenth as well. The scholars of the sixteenth century were not
unlike some of our own days in considering those ages dark of which they knew
little.</p>
<p>Once printed, however, Salvian's works enjoyed great popularity. Jurists,
including Sirmond, Cujas, Godefroi and Rittershausen, whose notes on Salvian are
packed with legal references, consulted his books and cited them extensively in
their studies of the Roman codes. The French clergy during four centuries found
that he furnished material so appropriate to the personal vices and social
disorders of their own times that they emulated the earlier bishops of Gaul in
preaching Salvian's sermons instead of writing their own.<A HREF="#59"><SUP>59</SUP></A>
When Bossuet called him &quot;<i>le saint et &eacute;loquent pr&ecirc;tre de Marseille</i>&quot;
his clerical readers must have assented with due gratitude. A German translator
also praises his usefulness for the <i>clergy </i>in furnishing them so rich a
source of <i>Sch&ouml;nheiten </i>and practical suggestions, that they should never
let his works leave their hands.<A HREF="#60"><SUP>60</SUP></A> Historians found
his work of great value, <A NAME="p34"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|34</SPAN></A> especially
when the current interpretation of history was most sympathetic to his constant
reiteration: &quot;It is only our vicious lives that have conquered us.&quot; So
Johannes Jovianus Pontanus pointed out Salvian's special distinction in that,
while writing of Christ and Christian topics, he had yet joined with these
&quot;very many histories and events of his own age, and commented sagely on
them in the course of his account.&quot; <A HREF="#61"><SUP>61</SUP></A>
Zschimmer cites a long list of historians who have made extensive use of him; of
these Guizot and Gibbon are the best known to us now, but many not named by
Zschimmer would need to be added to bring the list up-to-date.<sup><A HREF="#62">62</A>
</sup>Indeed of late years Salvian seems to have been cited more than read. It
is difficult to find a history of the period that does not refer to him, or a
source book of ancient or medieval history that does not quote at least one of
half-a-dozen famous passages, but the text itself is little read.</p>
<p>That this neglect has been a distinct loss to students of the later days of
the Roman power in the west, will, I trust, be apparent even to those who make
their acquaintance with Salvian through the medium of a translation. Since,
however, a study of his works inevitably engenders the habit of reference to
&quot;authority,&quot; I shall not leave our author without this support. Know,
then, that Pierre Pithou called Salvian &quot;a most excellent author,&quot;
Joseph Scaliger named him &quot;the most Christian writer.&quot; Rittershausen,
one of the most enthusiastic of editors, considered his opinions not only
wholesome and holy,<A HREF="#63"><SUP>63</SUP></A> but fully apostolic, and
judged, therefore, that Salvian should be deemed master not only of bishops, but
of the whole Christian world as well.</p>

arguments are concerned, there is nothing to add to Gibbon's criticism (ch.
xxxv, note 12) that 'Salvian has attempted to explain the moral government of
the Deity; a task which may be readily performed by supposing that the
calamities of the wicked are <i>judgments, </i>and those of the righteous <i>trials</i>.'
&quot; I cannot feel that this is a true summary of the case. Granted that
Salvian wrote in complete acceptance of the Christian faith and of scriptural
authority, he has accomplished his purpose very definitely<i>; </i>that we may
not be convinced by the same means may be our loss or our gain, according to the
point of view, but can hardly affect his success; it would seem likely that his
discussion had a favorable effect in encouraging those for whom it was written.
