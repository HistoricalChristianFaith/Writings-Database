<h3 align="center">THE SECOND BOOK</h3>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>1.</SPAN>&nbsp;The examples given
above are sufficient proof, therefore, that our God acts constantly as a most
anxious watcher, a most tender ruler, and a most just judge. But perhaps one of
my less enlightened readers is thinking: &quot;If all things are now conducted
by God as they were in those days, why is it that the evil prevail while the
good are afflicted; and whereas in the past the evil felt God's wrath, and the
good his mercy, now by some strange reversal the good appear to experience his
wrath and the evil his favor?&quot; These questions I shall answer presently,
but now since I have promised to prove three points, namely, God's presence, his
government and his judgment, by three methods, that is, by reason, by examples
and by authority and since I have already given sufficient proof of them by
reason and examples, it remains for me to verify them by authority. Yet the
examples I have given should rank as authority, since that term is rightly
applied to the means by which the truth of matters under discussion is
established.</p>
<p>Which then of the above-mentioned points should first be proved by sacred
authority ---- his presence, his government, or his judgment? His presence, I
think, because he who is to rule or judge must surely be present, in order to be
able to rule or judge anything whatever.</p>
<p>Speaking through the Sacred Books, the Divine Word says.: &quot;The eyes of
the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.&quot; <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A><i>
</i>Here you find God present, looking upon us, his eyes watching us wherever we
may be. If the Divine Word assures us that God observes the good and the wicked,
it is expressly to prove that nothing escapes his watchful scrutiny. For your
fuller comprehension, hear the testimony of the Holy Spirit in another part <A NAME="p67"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|67</SPAN></A>
of the Scriptures, when it says: &quot;Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them
that fear him, to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
famine.&quot; <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> This is why God is said to watch
over the just, that he may preserve and protect them. For the propitious
oversight of his divinity is the safeguard, of our mortal life. <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
Elsewhere the Holy Spirit speaks in the same fashion: &quot;The eyes of the Lord
are upon the righteous, and his ears, are open unto their cry.&quot;<i> </i><A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></p>
<p>See with what gentle kindness the Scripture says the Lord treats his people.
For when it says the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, his watchful love is
shown; when it says that his ears are always open to their prayers, his
readiness to hear is indicated. That his ears are always open to the prayers of
the righteous proves not merely God's attention, but one might almost say his
obedience. For how are the ears of the Lord open to the prayers of the
righteous? How, save that he always hears, always hears clearly, always grants
readily the pleas he has heard, bestows on men at once what he has clearly heard
them ask? So the ears of our Lord are always ready to listen to the prayers of
his saints, always attentive. How happy should we all be if we ourselves were as
ready to hearken to God as he is to hear us!</p>
<p>But perhaps you say that the proof of God's guardianship of the just is
useless to our argument, since this is not a general watchfulness of the divine
power but merely a special favor granted to the righteous. Note, however, that
the Sacred Word testified above that the eyes of the Lord watch over both good
and evil. If you still wish to argue the point, consider this, for it follows in
the text: &quot;Moreover the face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to
cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.&quot; <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
<A NAME="p68"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|68</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see that you have no ground for complaint that God does not look upon the
unjust also, since you know that he watches all men, but with different effect
because of the inequality of their merits. The good indeed are watched by him
that they may be preserved, the evil that they may be destroyed. You yourself,
who deny that God watches men, have your place with these last; know then that
you are not only clearly seen by God, but are without doubt in imminent peril.
For since the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil, to cut off remembrance
of them from the earth, you, who wickedly say that the eyes of the Lord do not
see you, must learn by your destruction the wrath of an all-seeing God. These
arguments, then, are sufficient to prove the presence and watchfulness of God.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>2.</SPAN>&nbsp;Let us now see
whether he who watches us also rules us, although, forsooth, his watchfulness in
itself implies governance as its motive, unless he looks upon us in order to
neglect us thereafter. Surely the fact that he deigns to look upon us is itself
an indication of his care for us, especially since the Sacred Word has borne
witness, as I have shown above, that the wicked are observed by God to their
destruction, the good to their salvation. Certainly this very fact shows the
divine guidance, for this is actually ruling by just government and dealing with
men individually according to their several merits.</p>
<p>Listen, however, to fuller testimony on this point. The Holy Spirit spoke
thus to God the Father in a psalm: &quot;Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel.&quot; <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
Israel means &quot;Seeing God,&quot; since indeed Christians who believe
faithfully see him with faith in their hearts:. Though God is the governor of
all things, still his governance is spoken of as being chiefly assigned to those
who especially deserve divine guidance. Therefore you also, whoever you are, if
you are a Christian, must of necessity believe in God's government. If, however,
you refuse utterly to believe that you, together with other <A NAME="p69"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|69</SPAN></A>
Christians, are ruled by God, you must recognize that you belong outside the
whole body of Christians.</p>
<p>But if, as we suggested earlier, you are more interested in the case of men
in general, than of Christians alone, see how clearly the Holy Book says that
all things are daily ruled by the divine will and the whole world incessantly
guided by God, for it says: &quot;He himself loves counsel and discipline.&quot;
<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> &quot;For neither is there any other God beside
thee that careth for all, bat being righteous thou rulest all things righteously
and with great reverence dost dispose us.&quot; <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A></p>
<p>Here you have God constantly arranging, constantly governing; yet in the
passage cited not only his divine governance but also the high honor of man is
declared. For the words, &quot;thou dost dispose us,&quot; show the power of his
divine government, but the words, &quot;with great reverence,&quot; show the
culmination of human honor. Elsewhere also we read in the words of the prophet:
&quot;Do I not fill heaven and earth!&quot; <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> And he
himself tells us why he fills all things: &quot;Because I am with you to save
you.&quot; <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> Obviously then God shows us not
merely his rule and the fulness of his power but also the might and benefits
that result from its plenitude. For the fulness of divinity bears within it this
fruit, that it saves all things that it fills. Thus in the Acts of the Apostles
the most blessed Paul said: &quot;In him we live and move and have our
being.&quot; <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A><sup> </sup>Doubtless he is more
than the controller of our lives, in whom is the very source of life. For Paul
did not say that we are moved by God but in him, teaching us, to be sure, that
our real substance is rooted within his sacred attributes, since we truly live
in him from whom we receive our being. <A NAME="p70"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|70</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Savior himself said also in the Gospel: &quot;Lo, I am with you alway,
even unto the end of the world.&quot; <A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> He not
only said that he is with us, but that he is with us all our days. Do you then,
most thankless of men, say that he who is constantly with us has no care or
thought for us? What then does he do in our company? Can you possibly think that
he is with us in order to neglect and overlook us? And how can he consistently
grant his presence to our virtue and neglect our vice? &quot;For lo,&quot; he
says, &quot;I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.&quot; Truly we
have a marvelous comprehension of God's love if we say falsely that he is
constantly neglectful of us while he says that he is constantly with us. Through
this he wishes to show that his love and protection are constantly with us,
since his very presence does not leave us. But we turn the divine charity into
contempt; we change the indications of his love into proofs of hatred. For we
try to see evidence of hatred rather than of love in his saying that he is with
us. If the Lord had said that he would remain apart from us, we might perhaps
have less occasion to gossip about his lack of care, in his absence. Constant
neglect is a proof of greater contempt and scorn from one who never leaves us.
There is the more odium in staying with us always if, while never depriving us
of his presence, he continually shuts us out from his loving care.</p>
<p>But far be it from us to believe that our most loving and merciful God would
have wished to be always near us for the sake of increasing by his presence the
apparent contempt of his neglect: far be it from us even to say such a, wicked
thing. For I think there is no one in the whole human race who is so evil that
he wishes to be with any man on account of his dislike of him, or wishes to
employ his presence solely to achieve greater satisfaction of his hatred by
scorning him face to face. Let human nature itself teach and convince us that we
wish to be with one man or another because we love the one whose company we
desire. And just because we <A NAME="p71"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|71</SPAN></A> love a
man, we wish our presence to be of benefit to him whom we love. So what we
cannot deny even to a criminal, we deny to God, and make him seem worse than the
worst of men, if we think that he promised to be with us in order to show
greater contempt for us by his subsequent neglect. But enough of this.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>3.</SPAN>&nbsp;We have already
proved by sacred testimony that all things are both watched and ruled by God; it
remains now to show that the greater part are also judged by his divine power in
this world.</p>
<p>When the blessed David had suffered the insulting scorn of Nabal the
Carmelite, since he himself postponed vengeance, he received his revenge at once
at the hand of God. So when, shortly after, his enemy had been overwhelmed and
killed by the hand of the Lord, he spoke thus: &quot;Blessed be the Lord, that
hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal.&quot; <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
Likewise when his rebellious son had driven him from his kingdom the Lord as his
judge in a brief space requited him, and more abundantly than he himself
desired.</p>
<p>God wished to show that the affliction of those who suffered injustice was
greater in his eyes than in their own. For when a man takes vengeance beyond the
wish of the injured person, what else can he mean than that he is acting on his
own behalf also? So when, for his attempted parricide, David's son was being
hung on a cross not made with hands, the Divine Word tells us that the
punishment divinely brought upon him was thus reported: &quot;I bring thee good
tidings, my lord king; for the Lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that
rose up against thee.&quot; <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>4.</SPAN>&nbsp;You see how the
sacred books prove through divine witnesses that God judges not only by deeds,
as we said above, and by examples, but by the very name and terms of judgment,
even in our present age. Perhaps you think that it was as a special favor
granted by God to a holy man, that he wrought judgment forthwith on David's
enemies. The day will not suffice if I would tell of <A NAME="p72"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|72</SPAN></A>
his immediate sentences and judgments in this world. Yet, that you may clearly
understand that it is not so much in consideration of the persons concerned as
of their actions that he exercises his sacred censure, hear how God our judge,
who constantly gave his unmistakable verdict on behalf of his servant David,
many times passed judgment on David himself. And indeed this occurred not in a
matter affecting many men, nor ---- which would perhaps naturally have aroused
God the more ---- affecting holy men, but in the case of a single individual, a
barbarian,<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> a case in which it was not the person
concerned that demanded vengeance, but the action. For when David had killed
Uriah the Hittite, a man belonging to an impious people and a hostile nation, he
was at once charged thus by the divine voice: &quot;Thou hast killed Uriah the
Hittite with the sword and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain
him with the sword of the children of Ammon. Now therefore the sword shall never
depart from thine house. Therefore thus saith the Lord, 'Behold, I will raise up
evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine
eyes and give them unto thy neighbor. For thou didst it secretly; but I will do
this thing before all Israel and before the sun.' &quot; <A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A></p>
<p>What answer have you to this, you who believe that God not only fails to
judge our every action but does not regard us at all? Do you see that the eyes
of the Lord were in no wise withdrawn from the single secret sin which David
once committed? Wherefore do you also, who ---- as a consolation I suppose for
your sins ---- think that our acts are not observed by God, learn from this same
instance that you are always seen by Christ, and know that you must receive
punishment, perhaps very shortly. For you see that even the blessed David was
unable to hide his own misdeed in the secret places of his innermost chambers,
and to claim exemption from instant punishment by the undoubted merit of his
great deeds. For what did the Lord say to him? &quot;I will take thy wives
before <A NAME="p73"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|73</SPAN></A> thine eyes, and the sword
shall never depart from thine house.&quot; You see what immediate judgment so
great a man suffered at once for one sin. Condemnation followed close on the
heels of the fault, a condemnation punishing immediately without reservations
and arresting the wrongdoer on the spot, not putting off the charge to a later
time.</p>
<p>Therefore he did not say: &quot;Because you have done this, know that the
judgment of the Lord shall come and you shall be tortured hereafter by the
flames of Gehenna.&quot; No; he said: &quot;You shall suffer torture at once,
and shall feel the sword of divine justice already at your throat.&quot;</p>
<p>And what followed? The guilty man acknowledged his fault, was humbled, stung
by remorse, confessed and mourned his sin. He repented and implored pardon, gave
up his royal jewels, laid aside his gold-wrought robes, put off the purple,
resigned the glory of his crown, changed his whole bodily habit, cast off every
aspect of kingship with its trappings, and put on the guise of a penitent
fugitive, eagerly assuming a squalor that should plead in his defence; he was
wasted by fasting, withered by thirst, exhausted by weeping, self-imprisoned in
loneliness. And yet this king of so great repute, greater in holiness than in
mere temporal power, surpassing all men in the favors earned by his former
merits, although he sought pardon so earnestly, did not escape punishment. The
fruit of such great penitence was indeed sufficient to win remission from
eternal expiation, but not to earn pardon at the moment. Finally, what did the
prophet say to the penitent? &quot;Because thou hast made the enemies of the
Lord blaspheme, the son that is born to thee shall die.&quot; <A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
In addition to the bitter loss of his son, God wished the loving father to
suffer also the knowledge of the full extent of his punishment, that he himself
had caused the death of the clearly loved son for whom he mourned, when the boy
born of his father's crime was slain for the very crime that had begotten him. <A NAME="p74"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|74</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>5.</SPAN>&nbsp;This is the first
instance of the divine punishment; the first, to be sure, but not the only one,
for a long series of great griefs followed and an almost unending succession of
misfortunes haunted his household. Thamar was seduced by the mad act of Amnon,
and Amnon slain by Absalom. A great crime indeed was committed by the first
brother, but its retribution by the other was worse. In these actions David the
father was punished alike by both sons' crimes. Two children sinned, but three
were ruined by the sin of two; for Thamar suffered the loss of her virginity,
while in Amnon also the destruction of Absalom was mourned. And verily you
cannot tell for which of the two sons so loving a father mourned the more
grievously, the one slain in this world by his brother's hand, or the other who
by his own hand was doomed forever.<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> From this
time indeed ills were piled up beyond reckoning, according to the word of God.
The father long endured the treachery of his son, was driven from his kingdom,
and sought in exile an escape from murder. Which was worse, the vice or the
bloodthirstiness of his son? By incest he disgraced his father when his
attempted parricide failed, and by his diligent heaping up of crime achieved an
incest passing the bounds of incest, committing in public, to his father's
greater shame, a crime abominable even in secret. It was a mortal sin that he
performed against his exiled father, but worse still was the injury wrought by
his public incest before the eyes of the whole world.</p>
<p>Must we add to this the spectacle of David's actual flight? Picture this
mighty king, so greatly renowned, higher in honor than all others, greater than
the world itself, fleeing his whole people with a tiny band of slaves. In
comparison with his former state he was needy indeed; in comparison with his
wonted train<i> </i><A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A><i> </i>he went <A NAME="p75"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|75</SPAN></A>
alone. He fled in fear, disgrace and sorrow ---- &quot;walking,&quot; the
Scripture says, &quot;with covered head, and barefoot.&quot; <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A><i>
</i>He had outlived his former state, exiled from himself, almost, one might
say, surviving his own death. He sank so low as to merit the scorn of his own
servants, or ---- which is harder yet to bear ---- their pity. So Ziba was fain
to feed him, and Shimei did not fear to curse him publicly. God's judgment so
changed him from his former self that he endured the open insults of a single
enemy ---- he who had made the world to tremble!</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C6"></A>6.</SPAN>&nbsp;Who now denies that
God watches over human actions? Behold how often the Scriptures have shown in
the case of one man that God not only observed, but also judged his acts! And
why? Why indeed, except that we should understand that the Lord's verdict and
coercion are always to be exercised in this world as they were then? So we read
that even holy men were punished aforetime by God's judgment, to teach us that
we too must always be judged in our present life by God. For as God always is,
so is his justice eternal. As God's omnipotence is never-failing, so is his
verdict unchangeable. As long as his law endures, so long also shall his justice
remain. Therefore all his saints in their sacred books, amid the imminent fear
of martyrdom and the swords of the persecutors, demand that the immediate
judgment of God be established. For thus said the just man in a psalm:
&quot;Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation.&quot; And
that this might not be construed as a reference to some future judgment of God,
he added at once: &quot;Deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.&quot; <A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>Certainly it is the immediate judgment of God that he demands who begs to
be freed from the hands of the persecutor. In his consciousness of a just cause
the psalmist did well to pray for God's justice rather than for his favor, for
the best verdict is always given to the righteous cause if the case is conducted
with justice. <A NAME="p76"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|76</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elsewhere also the psalmist spoke most clearly, saying: &quot;Judge, O Lord,
them that injure me; fight against them that fight against me; seize arms and
shield and stand up for mine help.&quot; <A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> You see
in this case that he does not demand the severity of a future trial, but the
verdict of immediate justice.</p>
<p>For what are his words? &quot;Take up the shield and seize the sword&quot;
---- the shield, of course, for protection and the sword for vengeance ---- not
that God's judgment needs such weapons, but because in this world the names of
dreaded arms are the instruments of dread judgments. Speaking to human
intelligence in figures drawn from human life, since he was praying for judgment
and for vengeance on his adversaries, he expressed the power of God's punishment
in terms of the instruments of earthly vengeance.</p>
<p>Lastly, the same prophet showed elsewhere the great difference between the
present and the future judgments of God. For what did he say to the Lord about
his verdict in the present trial? &quot;Thou sittest on the throne and
judgest.&quot; And what about the future and everlasting judgment of God?
&quot;He shall judge the world in righteousness;&quot; and again: &quot;He shall
minister judgment to the people in uprightness.&quot; <A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
By these words surely he made a clear distinction in time between the present
and the future judgments of God. For to indicate the present he wrote,
&quot;thou judgest,&quot; and to distinguish the future from the present he
added, &quot;he shall judge.&quot;</p>
<p>Sufficient proof of God's care for us and of his government and judgment has
now been given by reason, by examples and by authority,<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
especially since the books to follow are all to be concerned with the same
proof. Now if we receive from God, whose work we are performing, strength to
complete our task, we shall attempt to bring to light and to refute the
customary arguments opposed by our adversaries to these essential doctrines.</p>
