<h3 align="center">THE SIXTH BOOK</h3>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>1.</SPAN>&nbsp;I have been dealing
with personalities for a long time now, and seem to have exceeded the rules of
argument. For undoubtedly the reader (if anyone for Christ's sake does read
these words written from love of Christ) is thinking or saying of me:
&quot;Since the subject he is pursuing is a general one, of what use is it to
heap up so many accusations against a single person? Suppose ---- for it is
credible ---- that the man of whom he speaks is as he describes him; still how
can one man's goodness be blocked by another's guilt, or ---- a point of much
greater importance ---- how is the general cause injured by one individual's
crime?&quot;</p>
<p>The injury indeed I can prove by clear examples. For instance, Achar <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
once stole a part of an accursed thing, and the trespass of one man was the ruin
of all. David ordered the children of Israel to be numbered, and the Lord
punished his fault by the destruction of the whole people.<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
Rapsaces spoke scornfully of God, and God smote a hundred and eighty-five
thousand men because the froward tongue of one profane man spoke evil of him.<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
Hence it was not without justice that the blessed apostle Paul ordered a noxious
sinner cast out of the church and showed why he gave this order, saying: &quot;A
little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.&quot; <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> From
this we clearly see that even one evil man very often works the destruction of
many. Nor is this without justice. The reader should recognize that what I said
above concerning one wicked man is not beside the point, since we read in the
Scriptures that the wrath of the Divine Majesty has very frequently been kindled
on account of <A NAME="p158"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|158</SPAN></A> one man's guilt. But
my argument is not limited by this consideration, for we do not need to assume
that one man blocks the way of all, since all are blocking each other; it is not
fitting to consider that all are imperilled by one, since they are all
imperilled by their own actions. For all men are rushing headlong into
destruction, or at least, to put it somewhat more mildly, almost all. Where can
the Christian people find such good fortune that the number of evildoers may be
less than the number of the good, or failing that, be merely equivalent to it?
How lamentable and grievous is our present wretchedness! How changed is the
Christian people now from its former character! Of old, Peter, the chief of the
apostles, punished with death the falsehood of Ananias and Sapphira.<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
The most blessed Paul also expelled one wicked man from the church, that he
might not infect a great number by his presence.<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
But we are content to have an equal number of good and evil men. Why should I
say we are content? We ought rather to exult and dance for joy, if we could
achieve such an equal balance. See to what depths we have fallen, to what state
we have been reduced after that glorious purity of the Christian people which
kept them all unspotted, for now we think that the church would be happy if it
contained even as much good as evil. How could we fail to consider it blessed if
half its members were guiltless, since now we lament that they are almost all
guilty?</p>
<p>Since this is the case, it was useless, useless indeed, to speak so long of
one evil man, useless to weep for one man's crimes, since all or almost all
require our tears and lamentations. There are many who are of this sort or who
wish to be so, which is no less incriminating, and who strive by their zeal for
evil to seem guilty of the charge. On this account, even if their lesser
capacity accomplishes less evil, they are themselves as wicked as the rest, for
it is <A NAME="p159"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|159</SPAN></A> their lack of ability and
not their will that prevents them. Their hopes alone are within their own
control, and in these they are criminals; they yield to none in their desire for
wrongdoing, and in this, as far as their means permit, they strive to excel.
Different though the two cases are, their rivalry is like that of good men, for
as the good desire to outdo all others in honorable aims, so the evil yearn to
surpass in depravity. As the glory of good men is to grow daily better, even so
the glory of the wicked is to become worse; and as the best wish to reach the
height of all virtues, so the worst hope to claim the palm in all vices. To our
misfortune this is particularly characteristic of us, the Christians, since, as
I have already said, we think wickedness is wisdom. Of these God spoke
particularly: &quot;I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to
nothing the understanding of the prudent.&quot; <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
When the apostle cried, &quot;if any man seemeth to be wise, let him become a
fool, that he may be wise,&quot; <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> he meant that if
a man wishes to be wise, he should be good, for no one is truly wise unless he
is truly good. We, on the contrary, through the viciousness of our perverse
spirits and our &quot;reprobate minds&quot; ---- to use the scriptural phrase <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
----reject goodness in favor of folly. Loving corruption more than wisdom, we
think we become daily wiser in proportion as our depravity increases.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>2.</SPAN>&nbsp;Yet what hope of
betterment is there in us, I ask, who are not led into evil by mistaken opinion,
but strive with all the eagerness of our perverted natures to appear constantly
worse and worse? This is the reason why I have long lamented that we are much
worse than the barbarians, for ignorance of the law excuses them, whereas our
knowledge of it accuses us. They prefer the evil to the good through
inexperience of the truth, because they do not know what things are good; we, by
our knowledge of the truth, know very <A NAME="p160"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|160</SPAN></A>
well what things are good, [but consider them inferior to the evil in many] <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
ways.</p>
<p>In the first place, there is almost no crime or vice that does not accompany
the games.<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> In these the greatest pleasure is to
have men die, or, what is worse and more cruel than death, to have them torn in
pieces, to have the bellies of wild beasts gorged with human flesh; to have men
eaten, to the great joy of the bystanders and the delight of onlookers, so that
the victims seem devoured almost as much by the eyes of the audience as by the
teeth of beasts.<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> That such things may take place
the whole world is ransacked; great is the care with which the search is carried
on and perfected. Hidden retreats are entered, pathless ravines are searched,
impenetrable forests traversed, the cloud-bearing Alps are climbed, the depths
of valleys plumbed, and in order that the flesh of men may be devoured by wild
beasts, the last secrets of the world of nature are revealed.</p>
<p>My opponents object that this is not done all the time. True, <A NAME="p161"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|161</SPAN></A>
and a glorious excuse it is for wrongdoing, that it is not constantly carried on
---- as if any time were appropriate for actions that injure God! Are evil deeds
well done because they are not done incessantly? Even murderers are not always
employed in murder, but they are still murderers when they are not actually
killing, for their hands are at all times stained with bloodshed. Bobbers do not
steal all the time, but they do not cease to be robbers, for when they are not
engaged in theft, their minds are occupied with it. Certainly men who take
pleasure in the animal fights of the arena are by no means free from the guilt
involved in such spectacles, even when they are not actually looking at them.
Would they not enjoy watching them always if they could?</p>
<p>Nor is this the only possible example of our sins, but there are still
greater ones. For instance, do not the consuls even now have hens fed after the
custom of the sacrilegious pagans? Are not auguries still sought from the flight
of birds, and almost all those superstitions kept up which even pagan writers of
old thought laughable? <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> Now when the very men who
give their names to the years and with whose office the years themselves begin
do such things, are we to believe that years begun under these auspices can
continue their course propitiously? <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> I wish that
these actions might pollute only the consuls who are responsible for them. But
the situation is the more desperate because while such things are done with the
public consent, the honor of a very limited number becomes the guilt of all, and
so, although only two men are inaugurated in any given year, scarcely any one in
the whole world escapes infection. <A NAME="p162"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|162</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>3.</SPAN>&nbsp;Let this much suffice
about the games, seeing that they are, as you say, not performed all the time.
We shall speak, instead, of everyday obscenities. These the hosts of demons have
contrived of such a sort and so innumerable that even honest and upright hearts,
though they can scorn and tread down some among them, yet can scarcely find a
way to overcome them all completely. Armies about to engage in battle are said
either to intersect with pitfalls the places through which they expect the
troops of the enemy to march, or plant them with stakes, or fill them with
caltrops, so that even if some of their snares fail to entrap a victim, none of
the enemy can fail to be caught. In like manner the demons have prepared so many
treacherous lures in this life for the human race that even though one escapes
many of them, he is finally caught by one or another.</p>
<p>And since indeed it would take too long to tell of all these snares, that is,
the amphitheaters, the concert halls, games, parades, athletes, rope dancers,
pantomimes and other monstrosities of which one is ashamed to speak, since it is
shameful even to know of such wickedness, I shall describe only the vices of the
circuses and theaters. For the evils that are performed in these are such that
no one can mention them, or even think of them without being polluted.<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
Other vices as a rule claim only some one portion of our being; for instance,
base thoughts affect the mind only, immodest glances the eyes, shameful sounds
the ears, so that when any one of these has gone astray, the rest can still be
free from wrongdoing. But in the theaters no part of our bodies is free from
guilt, for our minds are polluted by evil desires, our ears by hearing and our
eyes by what they see, and all these are so disgraceful that a man cannot even
describe them without loss of decency.</p>
<p>Who without injuring his modesty can tell of those representations of base
acts, those obscenities of words and voice, those <A NAME="p163"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|163</SPAN></A>
disgraceful motions and foul gestures? The very fact that they forbid
description shows what great sin there is in all these. Some of the very
greatest crimes can be named and discussed without injury to the character of
the speaker, as homicide, robbery, adultery, sacrilege and so forth; it is only
the vice of the theaters that cannot even be attacked without loss of modesty.
So in arraigning these vile and disgraceful abuses the prosecutor has a strange
experience, in that, although the honesty of the would-be accuser is
unquestioned, he cannot without prejudice to his honor relate or attack them.
All other evils pollute those who perform them, not those who merely see or hear
them. You may, for instance, hear a man blaspheme, but since your mind
disapproves of his sacrilege you are not polluted by it. Or if you happen to be
present during a robbery, you are not denied by the act, inasmuch as it is
abhorrent to your principles. The indecencies of the spectacles alone involve
actors and audience in substantially the same guilt. For all those who approve
such performances and take pleasure in seeing them perform them through the
medium of their sight and approval. To such men the words of the apostle apply
with a peculiar force, since not only &quot;they which commit such things are
worthy of death&quot; but also &quot;those who have pleasure in them that do
them.&quot; <A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A></p>
<p>Therefore in these pictures of vice the whole people commits fornication
mentally, and any who happen to come to the spectacle chaste go home from it
adulterers. They are guilty of this fornication not only when they go home, but
also when they come to the theater, for the very desire of the obscene makes a
man unchaste who is hurrying toward an impure spectacle.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>4.</SPAN>&nbsp;You see then in what
actions all or the majority of Romans participate. None the less, we who do such
things say we are forsaken by God, though we ourselves are forsaking him. Let us
suppose that our Lord would like to watch us even though we do not deserve it:
can he do so? See countless thousands of Christians daily <A NAME="p164"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|164</SPAN></A>
spending their time at shows representing shameful acts. Can God look at them at
such a time? Can God watch over men who are revelling in the circuses and
wantoning in the theaters? Or do we perhaps think it fitting and desirable that
when God sees us in the circuses and theaters, he should see with us what we
ourselves see there, and look with us at the disgraceful sights at which we
gaze? One of two things must happen; either, if he deigns to look on us, he must
also see our surroundings, or if he averts his eyes from them, which he surely
does, then he must avert them equally from us, who are among them.</p>
<p>In spite of this, without interruption we continue to do those thing's of
which I speak. Do we perhaps suppose that, like the ancient pagans, we have a
god of theaters and circuses? For they built the theaters and circuses long ago
because they believed that such vanities were a delight to their idols. <A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
How can we imitate them in this, who surely know that our God hates such things?
Of course, if we know that these vile shows please God, there can be no
objection to our performing them incessantly. But if in our hearts we know that
God abhors and abominates them, that as they are the devil's food so are they
also a cause of offence to God, then how can we say that we worship God in the
church, we who always serve the devil in the obscene games with full knowledge
and understanding and with deliberate intention? What hope, I ask, shall we have
before God, who injure him not by chance or by ignorance, but after the manner
of those old giants of whom we read that they attempted to scale the heavens in
their mad ambition and climbed, as it were, into the clouds? So we, by the
injuries that we constantly inflict on God throughout the world, as if by common
consent, are making war on heaven.</p>
<p>Therefore we offer up to Christ ---- O monstrous folly! ---- to Christ we
offer up circuses and mimes, and we do this chiefly when we receive some benefit
from him, when some mark of prosperity is <A NAME="p165"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|165</SPAN></A>
granted us by him, or a victory over the enemy is bestowed on us by his divine
favor! How do we seem in this to differ from a man who injures a generous
benefactor, or responds to endearments with cutting abuse, or pierces with his
dagger the lips that seek to kiss him? I ask all the rich and powerful men of
this world, what punishment they think fitting for a slave who plots evil
against a good and loving master, who quarrels with a master who deserves only
good of him, and returns only foul words for the liberty that he has received.
Undoubtedly he is guilty of the greatest wrongdoing who returns evil for good,
when he should not even feel free to return evil for evil. But this is what we
do who are called Christians: we arouse a merciful God against us by our
licentious acts, we insult him by our filthy deeds when he is propitious, we
lash him with abusive words when he speaks gently to us.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>5.</SPAN>&nbsp;To Christ then ---- O
monstrous folly ! ---- we offer circuses and mimes, to Christ in return for his
benefits, we offer the obscenities of the theaters, to Christ we dedicate the
vilest shows as sacrificial offerings. Was this the teaching given us by the
Savior, incarnate for our sake? Was this his preaching, or that of his apostles?
For this did he endure the humiliation of human nativity and take upon himself a
shameful origin in his mortal birth? For this he lay in a manger, whom angels
served as he lay there. For this he willed to be wrapped in swaddling clothes,
and wearing them ruled heaven; for this he hung upon the cross, whom the world
feared as he hung there. &quot;Who though he was rich,&quot; the apostle said,
&quot;yet for your sakes became poor, that ye through his poverty might become
rich.&quot; <A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> &quot;And being in the form of
God,&quot; I quote farther, &quot;he humbled himself unto death, even the death
of the cross.&quot; <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> These then are
the precepts that Christ gave us at the time of his passion. A glorious return
we are making for his suffering, who, having received redemption by his death,
offer him in return <A NAME="p166"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|166</SPAN></A>&nbsp;most disgraceful lives! The blessed Paul said: &quot;For the grace of our
Lord Jesus Christ hath appeared, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and
worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present
world; looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of the great God and
our Savior Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from
all iniquity and purify unto himself a people worthy of acceptance, zealous of
good works. <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A></p>
<p>Where are men who do those things for which the apostle says Christ came?
Where are those who flee from worldly lusts? Where are those who live righteous
and godly lives, who show in their good works that they hold the blessed hope,
and by living immaculate lives prove that they await the kingdom of God, since
they deserve to receive it? &quot;The Lord Jesus Christ,&quot; Paul said,
&quot;came to purify unto himself a people worthy of acceptance, zealous of good
works.&quot; Where is that pure people, that acceptable people, that people of
good works, that people of righteousness? &quot;Christ,&quot; the Scripture
says, &quot;suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow his
steps.&quot; <A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A> So we follow the Savior's steps in the circuses; we
follow the Savior's steps in the theaters. Is this the example Christ left for
us? We read that he wept, not that he laughed. In both he gave us an example,
for weeping is the remorse of the heart, laughter the corruption of uprightness.
For this reason he said: &quot;Woe unto you that laugh now; for ye shall
weep;&quot; and again: &quot;Blessed are ye that weep now, for ye shall
laugh.&quot; <A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> But we do not think it enough to laugh and rejoice,
unless we rejoice in sin and madness, unless our laughter is mixed with impure
and disgraceful actions.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C6"></A>6.</SPAN>&nbsp;Who can describe this delusion of ours, this folly? Are we really unable
to enjoy ourselves day by day, and to laugh, without turning our laughter and
joy into crime? or do we perhaps <A NAME="p167"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|167</SPAN></A>
consider wholesome enjoyment profitless and find no pleasure in innocent
laughter? What wickedness is this, I ask, and what insanity? Let us laugh
indeed, let us rejoice unstintedly, and as constantly as you please, if only we
do so innocently. What folly and madness it is for us to think laughter and joy
worthless unless they involve injury to God! Injury indeed, and a very great
one. The spectacles involve a sort of apostasy from the faith, a fatal violation
of the creed itself and of the divine sacraments. For what is the first
confession of faith made by Christians in baptism for their salvation? What else
than their vow to renounce the devil and his pomps and spectacles and his works?
So in the very words of our profession of faith spectacles and pomps are the
works of the devil<sup>.<A HREF="#23">23</A> </sup>How then, O Christian, shall you after baptism
seek the spectacles, which you confess are the work of the devil? You have once
renounced the devil and his spectacles, and therefore as a rational and
intelligent being must recognize that in resorting again to them, you are
returning to the devil. For you have renounced them both at the same time and
declared them to be one and the same. If you return to one, you return to them
both. For your words were: &quot;I renounce the devil, his pomps and spectacles
and his works.&quot;<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> What follows in your baptismal vows? &quot;I
believe in <A NAME="p168"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|168</SPAN></A> God the Father Almighty and in Jesus Christ his Son.&quot; First then, you
renounced the devil that you might believe in God, for he who does not renounce
the devil does not believe in God and therefore he who returns to the devil
forsakes God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the devil is present in his spectacles and pomps, and therefore
when we return to the devil's spectacles, we abandon our Christian faith. Thus
all the sacraments of our belief are broken, and all that follows in the creed
is shaken and totters<i>; </i>for nothing that follows remains intact if the
chief clause has fallen. Tell me then, you who are a Christian, how you think
you are keeping the latter portions of the creed, whose first clauses you have
abandoned? The limbs without the head are worth nothing, and everything depends
on its own first principles; these surely, if they perish, will drag all the
rest down with them to destruction. If the main stock is removed, the other
parts either cease to exist or if they continue are useless, for without its
head nothing can subsist.</p>
<p>If any one thinks the wickedness of the spectacles a trivial matter, let him
consider well all that I have said, and he will see that in them is not pleasure
but death. For what else is it but death, to have lost the source of life?<i> </i>When
the foundations of our creed are overthrown, life itself is strangled.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C7"></A>7.</SPAN>&nbsp;I must return again to my oft-repeated contention, what have the
barbarians like this? Where in their lands are circuses, where are theaters,
where those other wicked vices that are the ruin of our hope and salvation? Even
if they had such things, being pagans, their error would involve less offence to
what is sacred, and less guilt, for though such sights as these are impure,
still they would not involve violation of a sacrament.</p>
<p>But as for us, how can we answer in our own behalf? We hold the creed and
overthrow it. We are equally ready to confess the <A NAME="p169"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|169</SPAN></A>
gift of salvation and to deny it. Where then is our Christianity, when we
only receive the sacrament of salvation <A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A> to the end that falling
from grace we may thereafter sin more grievously than before? We prefer vain
shows to God's churches, we scorn his altars and honor the theaters. To
conclude, we love and honor everything else; only God, in contrast with worldly
pleasures, is vile in our sight.</p>
<p>One case in itself proves the truth of my contention, disregarding all the
rest. Whenever it happens, as it does only too often, that on the same day we
are celebrating a feast of the church and the public games,<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> I ask
it of everyone's conscience, which is it that collects greater crowds of
Christians, the rows of seats at the public games or the court of God? Do all
men throng to the temple in preference to the theater, love the words of the
Gospel more than those of the stage ---- the words of life or of death, the
words of Christ or of a mime? Without doubt; we love more that which we place
first. For on every day when the fatal games are given, whatever festival of the
church it may be, not only do men who claim to be Christians fail to come to the
services, but any who do happen to have come unwittingly, if they chance to
hear, while in the church, that games are being given, leave the building at
once. The temple of God is scorned for a rush to the theater; the church is
emptied and the circus filled; we leave Christ alone on the altar and feast our
adulterous eyes on the foulest sights of the vile games. So it is with the
greatest justice that the Lord God says to us: <A NAME="p170"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|170</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;For your filthiness you have been driven out in banishment.&quot; And
again he says: &quot;The altars of this laughter shall be brought to
nothing.&quot; <A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C8"></A>8.</SPAN>&nbsp;At least, you say, this answer can be made, that such things are not done
in all the cities of the Romans. True, and I shall even go so far as to say that
they are not now being done in all places where they have been hitherto. For
instance, no shows are given now in Mayence, but this is because the city has
been destroyed and blotted out;<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A> nor at Cologne, for it is overrun
by the enemy. They are not being performed in the most noble city of Treves,
which has been laid low by a destruction four times repeated,<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> nor
finally in many other cities of Gaul and Spain. Then woe to us and our
iniquities, woe to us and our impurities! What hope have Christian congregations
in the sight of God when these evils cease to exist in the Roman cities only
from the time when the cities themselves <A NAME="p171"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|171</SPAN></A>
have come into subjection to barbarian jurisdiction? This mark of vice and
impurity seems to be a native characteristic of the Romans, an inborn trait, for
wherever there are Romans, these evils prevail. Do you think that this is a
serious and unjust accusation? Serious indeed, if it is without foundation. But
how can it fail to be false, since the activities of which I spoke are now
carried on in only a few Roman cities? Most of our cities, you claim, are not
now polluted by the taint of these vices; even though they are the same places
which were the homes of our old wickedness, still their former indulgences have
ceased.</p>
<p>So we must now consider the question, why those cities still seem to be the
haunts of the games, whereas the games have ceased. They are still the homes and
abiding places of disgraceful vice because all sorts of vile deeds have hitherto
been enacted in them. Moreover, the only reason for the cessation of the games
themselves is that they cannot be given at the present time because of the
misery and poverty in which we live. That they were presented before was due to
our depravity; that they are not given now, to our necessity. For the collapse
of the imperial fiscus and the beggary of the Roman treasury do not permit money
to be lavished on trifling matters that make no return. Let men squander as much
as they please, casting their money into the mire; they cannot lose as much as
they could formerly, for they have not as much to lose. In respect of our
lustful desires and our base pleasures we should certainly like to have more
abundance, if only that we might be able to transmute our wealth into
disgraceful filth. The amounts squandered in our beggary are an indication of
what we should like to spend if we were rich and magnificent. The bane and ruin
of our present depraved condition is that though our poverty has nothing left to
lose, our sinful souls yearn for more wealth to cast away.</p>
<p>We cannot therefore console ourselves at all on these grounds, that is, by
saying that the former extravagances are not now being <A NAME="p172"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|172</SPAN></A>
committed in all our cities. For the only reason for their abandonment is that
cities where they were carried on in the past are no longer in existence, or
that in the places where such things used to be</p>
<p>done, [means are lacking] <A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> to perform them. Thus the spectacles
are no longer possible in the cities where they were formerly performed; as God
himself said to sinners through his prophet: &quot;The Lord remembered these
things and it came into his mind, and the Lord could no longer bear, because of
the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which ye have committed;
therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment and a curse.&quot; <A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
So it has come to pass that the greater part of the Roman world is become a
desolation and an astonishment and a curse.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C9"></A>9.</SPAN>&nbsp;Would that these abominations had only been committed of old and that
Roman depravity would at length cease such performances! Then perhaps, as it is
written, God would be merciful to our sins. But we do not so act as to
propitiate him. We constantly add evils to evils and pile sins upon sins, and
though many of us have already perished we seek to complete our own destruction.
Who, tell me, seeing another man killed beside him is not in terror for himself?
Who can see his neighbor's house burn and not try by every means in his power to
keep his own from being set on fire? But we not only see our neighbors burning <A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
but know that the flames have already spread over the greater part of our own
bodies. What unspeakable evil is this that we are suffering? We are on fire, on
fire, I say, and yet we do not fear the flames that burn us. That the evils
committed formerly are at last diminishing is the result of our miseries, not
the fruit of a true repentance.</p>
<p>This is easily proved; only give back our former prosperity and <A NAME="p173"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|173</SPAN></A>
you shall see at once the old interests everywhere restored. Note this also:
as far as men's wishes are concerned, even if the games are no longer actually
being given in many places, yet they still exist as of old, for the Roman people
everywhere wish them given. When nothing but sheer necessity hinders a man from
an evil deed, the mere desire for a base act is as much to be condemned as the
action. For if, as I said, according to the words of our Lord: &quot;Whosoever
looketh on a woman to lust after her is guilty of the adultery conceived in his
heart,&quot; <A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> we can understand that while of necessity we do not
commit disgraceful acts worthy of condemnation, we are nevertheless guilty if we
only desire forbidden things.</p>
<p>Why should I mention desire? Most men actually do these things whenever they
can. When the inhabitants of other cities come to Ravenna or Rome they join the
Roman plebs in the circus, and the people of Ravenna in the theater. Therefore
let no one consider himself acquitted on the ground of his distance from the
spectacles. All are united in the turpitude of their actions who join one
another in their desire for disgraceful deeds.</p>
<p>Yet we flatter ourselves on the uprightness of our ways, the rarity of our
vices. So I shall carry my charges farther: not only do men still yield as of
old to the pollution of those infamous games but their guilt in this is much
greater than before. For in the past the various members of the Roman world
flourished unimpaired; the public wealth had made the storehouses inadequate;
the citizens of all the towns had abundance of riches and delights, and amid
such overflowing prosperity the authority of religion could hardly exercise due
censorship of conduct. Then indeed those who exploited base desires found rich
grazing on all sides, but there was no lack of wealth to satisfy their greed; no
one worried about the public disbursements and expenses, for the cost was not
felt. The state indeed seemed in a way to seek an opportunity to squander <A NAME="p174"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|174</SPAN></A>
what it could scarcely continue to hold. Thus the heaped-up wealth that had
already begun to exceed just bounds furnished abundance for lavishness even in
trivial matters.</p>
<p>But of the present situation what can we say? Our old abundance has deserted
us; the resources of former times are gone, and we are in a wretched state, but
do not cease our frivolities. Although even orphan wastrels are usually
benefited by poverty, leaving off the error of their ways as soon as they have
squandered their wealth, we seem to be a new class of profligates, in whom
opulence has ceased to dwell, but dissipation persists. The causes of our
corruption lie not as with other men in outside enticements, but in our hearts,
and our minds are the source of our depravity, so that [we] are not [moved] to
amend our ways by the loss of our wealth, but [go on] <A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
sinning
through love of wickedness.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C10"></A>10.</SPAN>&nbsp;Although I may have shown sufficiently what serious vices the Romans
have, from which the barbarian tribes are free, still 1 shall add many points
that I have omitted. But before I continue, let me remind you that a fault of
any sort which dishonors God should in no sense seem a trivial matter to anyone.
It is never permissible to dishonor an illustrious and powerful man, and anyone
who dishonors such a one is held guilty in the eyes of the law and is condemned
in due course as responsible for the injurious action. How much more difficult
of atonement is the accusation of injury to God! The fault of the wrongdoer
always increases in proportion to the position of the person injured, since
necesssarily the greater the person of the man who suffers abusive action, the
greater is the guilt of the man who commits such action. Wherefore we read in
the law that even those who seem to have committed only slight offence against
the sacred ordinances have nevertheless been most severely punished; to the end
that we might know that nothing pertaining to God should be considered
unimportant. Even <A NAME="p175"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|175</SPAN></A> what seemed to be a petty fault became a grave one, inasmuch as it was an
injury to the divine power.</p>
<p>What did Oza, the Levite of God, do against the divine commandment, when he
tried to steady the ark of the Lord? There was no law laid down regarding this.
Yet immediately he took hold of it, he was struck down, apparently not because
he did anything in an impudent fashion or with an undutiful intention, but his
very service was undutiful because he exceeded his orders.<A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A></p>
<p>When a man of the Israelites had gathered wood on the Sabbath, he was struck
down and killed by the judgment and command of God, who is truly a most gentle
and merciful judge, who would doubtless have preferred to spare rather than to
kill, if the consideration of severity had not outweighed consideration of
mercy. For one incautious man perished to save many from perishing thereafter
through lack of caution.<A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A></p>
<p>But why do I speak of single individuals? The children of Israel in their
journey through the desert, because they longed for their accustomed meat, lost
a part of their number. The desire for meat had not yet been forbidden them, but
God, I think, wished to further the observance of the law by the suppression of
rebellious desires. He intended the whole people to learn the more easily how
earnestly one should avoid what God forbade in his divine writings, since even
those acts injured him which he had not yet forbidden by law.<A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A></p>
<p>The same people also murmured at the hardships they underwent, and for this
reason were punished by the Lord's rods, not because it is forbidden a man to
groan at hardships, but because their murmurs were displeasing to God, inasmuch
as they seemed to accuse him of causing them too much labor. From this we should
learn how much a man enjoying the blessings of good fortune ought <A NAME="p176"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|176</SPAN></A>
to seek to please God, since it is not even permitted to complain of those
ills that seem painful.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C11"></A>11.</SPAN>&nbsp;What is the purpose of these examples? What else than that nothing should
seem trivial that causes injury to God? For we were talking of the public games,
which are truly mockeries of our hopes, mockeries of our life. While we sport in
the theaters and circuses, we perish, according to the Sacred Word which says:
&quot;It is as sport to a fool to do mischief.&quot; <A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
So we too,
when we laugh amidst disgraceful and shameful sights, are committing crimes, and
crimes of no slight extent. Our wrongdoing is the more worthy of punishment for
this very reason, that though it seems to be of a most trivial nature, it is
really pestilential and deadly in its outcome. There are two chief evils, for a
man to destroy himself and for him to injure God; both of these are committed in
the public games, where through criminal and shameful sights the eternal
salvation of the Christian people is utterly destroyed, and through a
sacrilegious superstition the divine majesty is violated. There can be no doubt
that the games injure God, consecrated as they are to idols. For Minerva is
worshipped and honored in the gymnasia, Venus in the theaters, Neptune in the
circuses, Mars in the arena, Mercury in the palaestra, and thus the
superstitious worship varies according to the character of its sponsors.<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
Impure actions of all sorts are performed in the theaters; there is wanton
luxury in the palaestras, immoderate vice in the circuses, madness in the
arenas. In one of these is wantonness, in another lasciviousness, in another
intemperance, in another insanity, in them all the devil; nay, in each
individual place where shows are held, not merely one devil, but devils of all
varieties, for they preside over the places dedicated to their worship.
Therefore in spectacles of this sort neither allurements nor vices are found
alone. It is sacrilege for a Christian to mingle with this superstition, sharing
in the worship of those in <A NAME="p177"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|177</SPAN></A> whose festivals he takes delight. While such a thing is always serious
enough, it becomes more intolerable when either our adversity or our prosperity,
exceeding the ordinary measure of our life, makes our acts more blameworthy. In
adversity there is double need to appease God, and in prosperity to avoid
grieving him. Surely he must be appeased when he is angry, and must not be
alienated when he is propitious; for our adversities come to us through his
wrath, our prosperity through his favor. But we do everything by contraries.</p>
<p>How, do you ask? Listen. First, if won over by his own mercy ----for we never
so live that we deserve his favor ---- if, as I say, at any time won over by his
own mercy God gives us peaceful seasons, plentiful crops, tranquillity rich in
all good things and abundance increasing beyond our hopes, we let ourselves be
so corrupted by great prosperity and fortune, we let ourselves be so depraved by
insolent manners that we altogether forget God and ourselves. Although the
apostle says that every benefit of the peace given by God depends on this:
&quot;That we lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and
honesty,&quot; <A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A> the only use we make of the quiet he gives is to
live in drunkenness and luxury, in wantonness and rapine, in all manner of crime
and wickedness. We look on his goodly gift of peace as an opportunity for
licentiousness, and take the quiet given by his truce as a chance to sin more
freely and safely.</p>
<p>Therefore we are unworthy of heavenly gifts, who make no good use of God's
kindness, and see in the means of good works only material for vice. Hence it
comes that the peace which we so abuse itself works against us, and is actually
harmful to us, since we use it to our detriment. Is this worthy of belief? We
change nature itself by our wickedness, and the good things that God has made as
his loving gift to us are turned to evil by our wanton lives.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C12"></A>12.</SPAN>&nbsp;We who are corrupted by prosperity, you say, are corrected
<A NAME="p178"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|178</SPAN></A> through adversity. Long peace had made us unruly, but we are brought back by
strife to moderation. In what cases have the dwellers in our cities, who were
licentious in prosperity, begun to be chaste in adversity? When has drunkenness,
which increased in the time of our peace and prosperity, ceased under the
ravages of the enemy?</p>
<p>Italy has already been devastated by many disasters: have the vices of the
Italians therefore ended? The city of Rome has been besieged and taken by storm:<A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>
have the Romans therefore ceased their mad blasphemy? Barbarous nations have
overrun the states of Gaul: have the crimes of the Gauls therefore changed in
character, as far as their evil habits are concerned? Tribes of Vandals have crossed over into the Spanish countryside: the fortune of the Spaniards
has indeed changed, but not their corruption. Lastly, that no part of the world
might be immune from fatal destruction, wars have begun to cross the seas, they
have devastated and overthrown cities shut off by the waves, in Sardinia and
Sicily, the imperial granaries. Having, as it were, cut off the vital channels
of the empire, they captured Africa, which may be called its heart. What then?
As barbarians entered that land, did its vices cease, even through fear? Or, as
even the most worthless slaves are usually reformed for the time being, did
terror drive them to modesty and self-restraint? Who can rightly estimate this
evil? The barbarians' arms clashed about the walls of Cirta and Carthage <A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
while the Christian congregation of the city raved in the circuses and wantoned
in the theaters. Some had their throats cut <A NAME="p179"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|179</SPAN></A>
without the walls, while others still committed fornication within; part of
the people were captive to the enemy without, while part within the city were
captive to their own vices. It is hard to decide which suffered the worse
misfortune. The former indeed were captive externally in the flesh, the latter
inwardly in the soul. Of the two deadly evils, it is less, I think, for a
Christian to endure captivity of the body than of the soul, according to the
teachings of the Savior himself in the Gospel, that the death of the soul is
much more fatal than that of the body.<A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A></p>
<p>Or do we perhaps believe that those men were not captive in soul, who then
rejoiced in the time of their people's captivity? Was he not captive in mind and
heart, who laughed amid the punishments of his people, who did not know that his
throat was being cut along with theirs, that in their deaths he also died?
Outside the walls, as I have said, and inside them too, was heard the din of
battle and of the games; the voices of dying men mingled with the voices of
revellers; the outcry of the people slain in the war could scarcely be
distinguished from the clamor of those who shouted in the circus. What was
accomplished by this but the hastening of the destruction of the people who
chose such a course, though God perhaps did not yet wish to destroy them?</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C13"></A>13.</SPAN>&nbsp;These places, however, are far away, almost removed to another world, and
seem irrelevant to the discussion when I consider that even in my own country,<A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
in the Gallic states, almost all men of high degree have been made worse by
their misfortunes. I myself have seen men of lofty birth and honor, though
already despoiled and plundered,<A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A> still less ruined in fortunes than
in morality; for, ravaged and stripped though they were, something still
remained to them of their property, but nothing of their character. They were so
much more hostile to themselves than to alien <A NAME="p180"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|180</SPAN></A>
enemies that, though they had already been ruined by the barbarians, they now
completed their own destruction. It is sad to tell what we saw there; honored
old men, feeble Christians, when the ruin of their state was already imminent,
making themselves slaves to appetite and lust. What are the first grounds of
accusation? That they were honored, old, Christians, or in danger? Who would
deem it possible that such things should be done by old men even in utter
security, or by boys in a crisis, or at any time whatever by Christians? They
reclined at feasts, forgetful of their honor, forgetting justice, forgetting
their faith and the name they bore. There were the leaders of the state, gorged
with food, dissolute from winebibbing, wild with shouting, giddy with revelry,
completely out of their senses, or rather, since this was their usual condition,
precisely in their senses. In spite of all this, what I have next to say is
still worse: not even the destruction of their towns put an end to their
excesses. The wealthiest city of Gaul was taken by storm no less than four
times.<A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A> It is easy to recognize the city of which I speak. The first
captivity should surely have sufficed to mend the ways of the citizens, so that
the renewal of their sins would not have renewed the destruction. But what
followed? The tale is incredible. The constant repetition of misfortunes in that
city increased its crimes. Like that fabulous monster whose heads multiplied as
they were cut off,<A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A> so also in the most excellent city of
<A NAME="p181"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|181</SPAN></A> Gaul, wickedness gathered strength from the very blows that punished it. You
would have thought that the punishment intended to end the crimes of its people
acted instead as the begetter of vice. What then? By the daily multiplication of
swarming evils it has come to such a pass that the city could more easily exist
without inhabitants than any of its citizens could do without crime.</p>
<p>So much then for this city. What of another not far distant but of almost
equal magnificence? <A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A> Has it not suffered the same ruin of fortunes
and of morals? For aside from all else, when it was utterly demoralized by the
two chief evils common to all, avarice and drunkenness, it finally reached such
a state of rabid greed for wine that the very rulers of the city did not rise
from their feasts when the enemy were actually entering the gates. God wished to
make clear to them why they perished, since at the moment of their final
disaster they were leading the very life through which they had come to ruin. I
myself saw lamentable sights there, with no distinction between boys and old
men. The scurrility and levity of all were alike; all vices reigned at once ----
extravagance, drinking bouts, wantonness ---- all the people revelled together.
They drank, gamed, committed adultery. Old and honored men waxed wanton at their
feasts; men already almost too feeble to live proved mighty in their cups; men
too weak to walk were strong in drinking; those whose steps tottered were nimble
dancers. What more can be said? Through all that I have recounted they became so
degraded that the words of the Sacred Scripture were fulfilled in them:
&quot;Wine and women make men of understanding to fall away from God.&quot; <A HREF="#49"><SUP>49</SUP></A>
For while they drink, dice, rape and play the <A NAME="p182"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|182</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb>
</SPAN>madman, men begin to deny Christ. After all this do we wonder that men who have
long since undergone moral ruin suffer the ruin of their fortunes? Let no one
think that such a city perished only at the time of its physical destruction,
for the deeds of its people had brought its ruin long before their death.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C14"></A>14.</SPAN>&nbsp;I have told the fate of the most famous cities. What of the many others
in various parts of Gaul? Have they not fallen, too, because of like vices on
the part of their citizens? All were so completely possessed by their crimes
that they did not fear any danger they had foreknowledge of captivity and did
not dread it. Fear indeed was taken away from these sinful men to prevent them
from the exercise of caution. Therefore, though the barbarians were settled
almost within their sight, men felt no fear, the cities remained unguarded. Such
was the blindness of their hearts, or rather of their sins, that although
doubtless no one wished to die, no one did anything to ward off death.
Everything was in the grip of carelessness and sloth, negligence and gluttony,
drunkenness and sleep, as has been written of such men: &quot;Because a deep
sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them.&quot; <A HREF="#50"><SUP>50</SUP></A> A deep sleep
indeed fell upon them that destruction might follow closely. For when, as it is
written, a sinner's iniquity is full <A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A> and he is due to perish,
foreknowledge is taken from him, that he may not escape his doom. But enough of
this. I have made my point sufficiently clear, I think, that not even in the
time of the greatest danger did the vices of the people come to an end before
the actual overthrow of their cities.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C15"></A>15.</SPAN>&nbsp;Perhaps such things have occurred in the past, but have now come to an
end, or will do so at some future time. Yes, forsooth, if today any city or
province that has been smitten by God's scourge or devastated by the enemy
appears humbled, converted and amended, if practically all who bear the Roman
name do not <A NAME="p183"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|183</SPAN></A> prefer death to reformation, the end of their life to the end of their vices!
This can be quickly tested by the example of the greatest city of Gaul, three
times destroyed by successive captures,<sup><A HREF="#52">52</A> </sup>yet when the whole city had
been burned to the ground, its wickedness increased even after its destruction.
Those whom the enemy had not killed when they pillaged the city were overwhelmed
by disaster after the sack; those who had escaped death in the capture did not
survive the ruin that followed. Some died lingering deaths from deep wounds,
others were burned by the enemy's fires and suffered tortures even after the
flames were extinguished. Some perished of hunger, others of nakedness, some
wasting away, others paralyzed with cold, and so all alike by diverse deaths
hastened to the common goal.</p>
<p>Worse than all this, other cities suffered from the destruction of this
single town. There lay all about the torn and naked bodies of both sexes, a
sight that I myself endured. These were a pollution to the eyes of the city, as
they lay there lacerated by birds and dogs. The stench of the dead brought
pestilence on the living: death breathed out death. Thus even those who had
escaped the destruction of the city suffered the evils that sprang from the fate
of the rest.</p>
<p>What followed these calamities? Who can assay such utter folly? The few men
of rank who had survived destruction demanded of the emperors <A HREF="#53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>
circuses as the sovereign remedy for a ruined city. O that I might here and now
be gifted with eloquence adequate to cope with this shocking event, that there
might be at least as much <A NAME="p184"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|184</SPAN></A> virtue in my complaint as there is sorrow at its cause! Who can even decide
what chiefly merits accusation in the tale, irreverence or stupidity,
extravagance or insanity? In these terms the whole is comprised. What is more
irreverent than a petition that works injury to God? What is more stupid than
not to consider your petition carefully? What so clear a proof of hopeless
extravagance as to desire luxuries in a time of general mourning? Or more insane
than to be in the midst of evils without any understanding of them?</p>
<p>Among these, however, insanity is the least culpable, for the will is not at
fault when sin is committed through sheer madness. Therefore those of whom I
speak deserved the greater blame, because, though sane, they acted senselessly.
Do you, O citizens of Treves, long for circuses when you have been plundered and
captured, after slaughter and bloodshed, after stripes and captivity, and the
repeated destruction of your ruined city? What is more lamentable than this
stupidity, more grievous than this folly? I confess I thought you most miserable
when you were suffering destruction, but I see that you are now more miserable
when you demand public shows. At first I thought you had lost only your material
property in the capture of your city; I did not know that you had lost also your
intelligence and control of your senses. Do you then ask for theaters, and
demand a circus from our emperors? For what condition, I ask, what people and
what city? A city burned and destroyed, a people captive and killed, who have
perished, or mourn their dead; a city of which nothing survives but sheer
calamity, whose people are altogether anxious in their grief, worn out by tears,
prostrate in bereavement, so that it is hard to say whether the lot of the
living or the dead is worse to bear. So great are the miseries of the survivors
that they surpass the ill fortune of the dead.</p>
<p>Do you then seek public shows, O citizen of Treves? Where, pray, are they to
be given? Over the pyres and ashes, the bodies and blood of the dead? For what
part of your city is free from these? Where <A NAME="p185"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|185</SPAN></A>
has blood not been shed, where are bodies and mangled limbs not strewn?
Everywhere the city's appearance betrays its capture, everywhere are the horror
of captivity and the image of death.<A HREF="#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A> The remains of a most unhappy
people lie on the graves of their dead, yet you ask for circuses; the city is
blackened by fire, yet you put on a festive countenance; all things mourn, but
you rejoice! Yea more, by your infamous pleasure you provoke God, and by your
vile superstitions arouse his divine wrath. Can there be any wonder that such a
fate has befallen you, when threefold destruction has not corrected you, so that
you richly deserved to perish by the fourth?</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C16"></A>16.</SPAN>&nbsp;I have given the above account in somewhat full detail to prove that we
have borne all our sufferings not through the failure of God's providence or
through his neglect, but because of his justice and judgment ---- a most just
dispensation and worthy retribution ---- and that no portion whatever of the
Roman world and Roman name, however greatly chastised by afflictions sent from
heaven, has ever been corrected. Thus we prove that we do not deserve to enjoy
prosperity, since we are not corrected by adversity.</p>
<p>Good gifts are given us from time to time, however, unworthy though we are.
The good God, like a most indulgent father, sometimes lets us be humbled for our
sins, but does not suffer us to be afflicted long. So at one time he chastises
his children by adversity, in accordance with his discipline, and again favors
them with peace, according to his mercy. As the best and most skilful doctors
give different cures for various diseases and succor some by sweet, others by
bitter drugs; cure certain ills by cautery, others by soothing poultices; employ
ruthless surgery for some, but pour healing oil on others; seeking the same good
health by utterly different cures: so also our God, when he restrains us by
harsher blows, is seeking to cure us by cautery and surgery; when he favors us
with good fortune he is offering us soothing oil and poultices ---- for by means
<A NAME="p186"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|186</SPAN></A> of different treatments he wishes to restore us all to the same good health.</p>
<p>Gentle treatment usually corrects even the most incorrigible slaves whom
punishment has failed to reform, and kindness subdues those whom the lash failed
to make submissive to their masters. Babies, too, and almost all stubborn
children, whom threats and blows do not make amenable, are often led to
obedience by goodies and endearments. Hence we should realize that we are more
worthless than the worst slaves, and more stupid than foolish children, since
torments do not correct us as they do bad slaves, nor coaxings win us over as
they do naughty children.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C17"></A>17.</SPAN>&nbsp;I think I have now proved adequately that punishment has not corrected
any part of the Roman people; it remains to prove that neither the gifts nor the
gentle words of God correct us. What then are the gifts and gentle words of God?
What indeed but our peace and quiet, the calmness of prosperity that attends on
our hopes and wishes? Let me give you a particular instance, since the case
demands it.</p>
<p>Whenever we are in fear, distress and danger, when cities are besieged by the
enemy or provinces devastated, or the members of the state wounded by any other
adversities, and we offer prayers and vows to the heavenly hosts for help, then
if by the aid of the divine mercy our cities are saved, the devastation ended,
the hostile armies routed and all fear removed by God's grace, what do we
immediately do? Do we endeavor to recompense our Lord God by our worship, honor
and reverence for the benefits we have received at his hands? For this is the
fitting action and in accordance with human custom, that those who give us gifts
may receive due return for them. This then perhaps we do, giving God recompense
in human fashion, and making a good return for the good we have received of him.</p>
<p>So we run at once to the Lord's house, and prostrate ourselves on the ground,
we supplicate him, our joy mixed with tears, and <A NAME="p187"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|187</SPAN></A>
bedeck his doorway with, votive garlands, we adorn his altars with gifts, and
since we ourselves are making a festival of gifts to him, transfer the joy of
our countenance to his temples also. Or at least, an act no less pleasing to
him, we renounce the vices of our former lives, we give good works as a
sacrifice to him, and offer up a new conversion in return for our new joys.
Lastly we declare a holy war on all uncleanliness, shun the madness of the
circus, curse the vileness of the shows in the theater, vow a new life to the
Lord and, to obtain his protection forever, dedicate ourselves to God.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C18"></A>18.</SPAN>&nbsp;Although all that I have described should be given to God for his recent
benefits, let us consider what we actually do. Men run at once to the games, fly
off to their old insanity, the folk pour into the theaters, the whole people
riot madly at the circuses. God gives us good gifts to assure our merit, but we,
as often as we receive his benefits, multiply our crimes. He by his mercies
calls us to righteousness, but we rush headlong into wickedness; he by his</p>
<p>mercies calls us to repentance, but we rush to destruction; he calls us to
chastity, but we rush into impurity. A noble response we make to his holy
favors, nobly do we recognize and honor his gifts, who repay the kindness we
have received from him by an equal measure of injustice! Is this not injury to
our God, or can any injury be less deserved, [when] great and frequent
[gratitude] is needed instead? <A HREF="#55"><SUP>55</SUP></A></p>
<p>But since by the taint of wickedness ingrained in our nature we cannot fail
to be prey to vice except by ceasing to live at all, what hope of good is there
in us? Those who sin through ignorance correct themselves when they learn their
error; those who do not know the true religion begin to change their way of life
when they change their faith. Lastly, those who are spoiled by excessive
abundance and security, as I said, cease their depravity when they are no longer
secure. &quot;We do not err through ignorance, nor are we <A NAME="p188"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|188</SPAN></A>
outside the true religion, nor corrupted by prosperity and security: quite
the reverse. We know the true religion, so ignorance cannot serve as our excuse;
we lack the peace and wealth of our former days; all that we had has been taken
from us or changed ---- only our vices have been increased. Nothing remains of
our former peace and plenty but our crimes, which have made our prosperity
cease. Where are now the old resources and honors of Rome? The Romans were of
old the mightiest of men, now they are without strength; of old they were
feared, but now they live in fear; barbarous nations paid tribute to them, but
to these same nations they are now tributary.<A HREF="#56"><SUP>56</SUP></A> The enemy sell us the
very daylight; almost our whole safety is purchased for a price. Alas for our
misfortunes! to what a pass have we come! For this we give thanks to the
barbarians, that we are allowed to ransom ourselves from them at a price. What
could be more abjectly wretched than to live on such terms? Yet after all this
we think that we are living, we whose lives depend on tribute! We even make
ourselves additionally ridiculous by pretending that the gold we pay is merely a
gift. We call it a gift, yet it is really a ransom ---- but a ransom paid on
unusually hard and wretched terms. When captives have been redeemed, they gain
their liberty, whereas we pay ransom constantly and are never free. The
barbarians deal with us like those masters who hire out for wages slaves not
needed for their own service. In like fashion, we are never free of the payments
due: we pay ransom constantly in order to have the privilege of continuing
endlessly to pay.&nbsp;</p>

<p><A NAME="10"></A>10.&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> Here there is a lacuna in the MSS. I
have followed Pauly's conjecture to fill out the sense, but am inclined to agree
with Zschimmer, <i>op. cit., </i>p. 35, that the abrupt introduction of the
subject of the games indicates a more substantial loss in the text.</p>
<p><A NAME="11"></A>11.&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> Salvian's diatribe against the games
has been one of the most quoted portions of his work as Gregoire and Collombet
note (<i>Oeuvres de Salvien, </i>II, 476), it was much used by the French clergy
in the 18 th century, especially as a source for Lenten sermons. The Italian
translation by S. Carlo Borromeo (Milan, 1579) is actually entitled <i>Libro di
Salviano Vescovo di Marsiglia contra, gli spettacoli ed altre vanit&agrave; del mondo.
</i>The subject was one on which the majority of the Fathers wrote with
vehemence, and there is naturally a considerable degree of similarity in their
attacks. Salvian's chapters on the spectacles are perhaps closest to Tertullian,
<i>De spectaculis, </i>and to what Lactantius has to say on the subject in
various sections of his <i>Institutiones divinae.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="12"></A>12.&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> This sentence shows that in spite of
all attempts to check the custom, men were still being &quot;thrown to the
lions&quot; in the middle of the 5th century. Constantine in a.d. 325 decreed
(Cod. Just. XI. 44) : &quot;Bloody spectacles in a time of civil peace and
domestic quiet do not meet with our favor, wherefore we absolutely prohibit the
existence of gladiators.&quot; Rittershausen aptly queries whether the spectacle
of men torn and devoured by wild beasts was more suited to civil peace and quiet
than were gladiatorial combats.</p>
<p><A NAME="13"></A>13.&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> See Minucius Felix <i>Octavius </i>26.</p>
<p><A NAME="14"></A>14.&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> Already in the fourth century the
chief functions of the consuls at Rome had come to be the giving of their names
to the official year, and giving games to the people; this example therefore has
an added pertinence in the discussion of the games. See Seneca <i>De ira </i>III.
31, in the importance of the <i>consul ordinarius </i>as compared with the
consuls later in the year, who were deprived of that immortality for their
names, which until the general adoption of the Christian era was really
considerable.</p>
<p><A NAME="15"></A>15.&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> See Seneca <i>Ep. </i>VII. 2:
&quot;Nothing is so ruinous to good character as to spend time at any

<p><A NAME="23"></A>23.&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp; Tertullian makes a similar connection between <i>spectacula
</i>and <i>pompa diaboli </i>in <i>De spectaculis </i>4. On his other uses of
the phrase, and its generally symbolic meaning at this time, cf. P. de
Labriolle's article, &quot;Pompa Diaboli,&quot;<sup> </sup><i>Bulletin du Cange,
</i>II (1926), 170-181. The actual word <i>spectacula </i>was not included in
the baptismal vow, but in Salvian's interpretation was inherent in the pomp and
works of the devil. So Tertullian, in the passage cited above, says: &quot;If
then the whole apparatus of the spectacles is proven to consist of idolatry,
there is no doubt that our vow of renunciation at the font refers also to the
spectacles, which are by their idolatry in the service of the devil and his pomp
and angels.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="24"></A>24.&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;See Isidore, <i>Etymologiae </i>XVIII. 59: &quot;These
spectacles of cruelty and vanity were instituted not only by the vices of men
but by the orders of demons also. Therefore a Christian should have nothing to
do with the insanity of the circus, with the indecency of the theater, with the
cruelty of the amphitheater, with the atrocities of the arena, with the
voluptuousness of the games. For he who prefers such sights denies God, being
made a traitor to the Christian faith, who seeks again what he once renounced at the font; that
is, the devil, his pomps and works.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="25"></A>25.&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;That is, baptism.</p>
<p><A NAME="26"></A>26.&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Another instance of popular disregard for imperial edicts.
Cod. Theod. II. 8. 20, in a.d. 392, forbade circuses on Sunday except when the
emperor's birthday fell on that day. Another decree, <i>ibid. </i>II. 8. 23, of
a.d. 399, forbade theaters and races and all sorts of public shows, with the
same exception. In a.d. 409 <i>(ibid. </i>II. 8. 25), the prohibition hold even
for the emperor's birthday and the anniversaries of his rule. A few years after
Salvian's book was published, the emperors Leo and Anthemius in the East (Cod.
Just. III. 12. 9, a.d. 469) inflicted heavy penalties for presence at the
spectacles on Sunday, and on any officials who should authorize such
performances &quot;on the pretext of public business.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="27"></A>27.&nbsp;<sup>27</sup> Sources? Compare Isaiah 16.4 and 10.</p>
<p><A NAME="28"></A>28.&nbsp;<sup>28</sup> Haemmerle, <i>op. cit., </i>I. 27-28, puts the destruction of
Mayence in A.D. 405-406 (see Jerome, <i>Ep. </i>123; Migne, PL, XXII, col.
1057), and that of Cologne between 438 and 440, as it is here connected with the
fourth sack of Treves. Salvian, <i>Ep. </i>I, agrees with this in his account of
the effect on his relatives of the recent sack of the city.</p>
<p><A NAME="29"></A>29.&nbsp;<sup>29</sup> The dates of the four destructions of Treves here mentioned
have been much discussed with widely differing conclusions. The 12th century <i>Gesta
Treverorum </i>described four captures of the city, but, ranging as they do from
that of the &quot;Greeks&quot; under the Arian Constans in a.D. 380 to that of
the Franks in 463, they do not suit the conditions required by Salvian's text.
The recent tendency has been to ascribe all four captures of the city to the
Franks, and to set them fairly close together, emphasizing the phrase <i>ter
continuatis vicibus </i>in VI. 15 <i>infra. </i>Rudolph and Kenterich (<i>Quellen
zur Rechts- und Wirtschaftsgebiete der rheinischen Stadte: kurtrierische Stadte:
I. Trier, </i>Bonn 1915, 5-6) incline to date the first capture in A.D. 411-412,
the second and third in the period from 412 to 416, and the fourth in 427-428,
dates that connect well with Salvian's account and with local conditions. The
earlier and later dates assigned by some commentators, while suitable as far as
the history of Treves is concerned, are less consistent with the conditions
required by Salvian's account. For summaries of various opinions on this point,
see Haemmerle, <i>Studia Salviana </i>I, 19-26. Haemmerle himself suggests the
date 406 as that of a sack by the Vandals, and 411-413, 418, 438-439 or earlier,
as Frankish destructions of the city. This conjecture is not far from that of
Rudolph and Kenterich.</p>

<p><A NAME="32"></A>32.&nbsp;<sup>32</sup><i> </i>Baluze, referring this phrase to the burning of Treves,
somewhat gratuitously concluded that Salvian could not have been a native of
that city.</p>
<p><A NAME="33"></A>33.&nbsp;<sup>33</sup> Matthew 5. 28.</p>

<p><A NAME="41"></A>41.&nbsp;<sup>41</sup> That the reference here is to the sack of Rome by Alaric in
A.D. 410 is clearly shown by the order of events cited; if it had been intended,
as those who use this passage to prove that Salvian's book was written after
A.D. 455 assume, to refer to the Vandal sack, it would hardly have been made the
first of a series of events ending with the Vandal destruction of Carthage some
years before their sack of Rome.</p>
<p><A NAME="42"></A>42.&nbsp;<sup>42</sup> Gaiseric captured Carthage in A.D. 439, after ten years of
general Vandal control in Africa. The orthodox clergy were given their choice of
slavery or exile, as were the nobles. Church property was given over to the
Arians.</p>
<p><A NAME="43"></A>43.&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;Luke 9. 24-25.</p>
<p><A NAME="44"></A>44.&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;This phrase was overlooked by those commentators who held
that Salvian was born in the province of Africa.</p>
<p><A NAME="45"></A>45.&nbsp;<sup>45</sup>&nbsp; That is, in the first sack of the city of Treves.</p>
<p><A NAME="46"></A>46.&nbsp;<sup>46</sup> The reference to Treves is obvious. This estimate of the city
is supported by the general testimony of the writers of the early empire.
Ausonius puts Treves in the fourth place in his <i>Ordo urbium clarissimarum, </i>the
first being assigned to Rome, the second to Constantinople and Carthage, and
third to Antioch, so that Treves is second only to Rome in western Europe. The
choice of the city as the seat of the praetorian prefect of Gaul is a
significant indication of its preeminence. See also Cod. Theod. XIII. 3. 11, <i>De
medicis et professoribus </i>(a.D. 376): &quot;For the most glorious city of
Treves we have thought best to make a somewhat more ample allowance, that thirty
<i>annonae </i>be paid to a teacher of rhetoric, twenty to a teacher of Latin
grammar, and twelve to one of Greek, if a worthy one can be found.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="47"></A>47.&nbsp;<sup>47</sup> That is, the Lernaean hydra. The labors of Heracles were a
popular subject for light verse; cf. Ausonius <i>Monosticha de XII aerumnis
Herculis.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="48"></A>48.&nbsp;<sup>48</sup> Brouwer, <i>Antiquitatum et Annalium Treverensium libri XXV </i>(1671),
V. 14, p. 275, identified this city as Mayence, which seems to fit better than
Metz or Cologne, the description of utter ruin. In VI. 8 <i>supra, </i>Salvian
mentioned Mayence especially as having been destroyed, while Cologne was only
spoken of as being full of the enemy. Haemmerle, <i>op. cit., </i>I. 18, follows
Baluze in identifying the city here mentioned with Cologne instead.</p>
<p><A NAME="49"></A>49.&nbsp;<sup>49</sup> Ecclesiasticus 19. 2.</p>
<p><A NAME="50"></A>50.&nbsp;<sup>50</sup> I Samuel 26. 12.&nbsp;</p>
<p><A NAME="51"></A>51.&nbsp;<sup>51</sup> Genesis 15. 16.</p>
<p><A NAME="52"></A>52.&nbsp;<sup>52</sup>&nbsp; This phrase offers some support for the adoption of dates
for the first three captures of the city close to each other in point of time:
c.f. note 29 <i>supra.</i></p>
<p><A NAME="53"></A>53.&nbsp;<sup>53</sup><i>&nbsp;</i>Haemmerle, <i>op. cit., </i>I. 22-23, pointed out
the importance of this plural for dating the third sack of Treves, since the
joint rule of Honorius and Constantius, a.d. 420-421, was the only possible date
before Salvian's withdrawal to Lerins, when there could have been two <i>imperatores
</i>in the West to whom such an appeal could have been made. Hence the third
sack of the city must have taken place at about 420. He suggests further that
the people of Treves hoped by the circuses to attract more residents for the
rebuilding of the city.</p>
<p><A NAME="54"></A>54.&nbsp;<sup>54</sup> The Vergilian phrase, <i>imago mortis </i>(<i>Aeneid </i>II.360).</p>
<p><A NAME="55"></A>55.&nbsp;<sup>5 5</sup> The lacuna indicated by Halm is supplied according to Pauly's conjecture.</p>
<p><A NAME="56"></A>56.&nbsp;<sup>56</sup> Tribute had been paid to barbarians in return for guarantees of
the integrity of the frontier since the early empire: beginning with the fourth
century such tributes came to be due more and more to weakness, rather than to
policy, till the condition was reached which Salvian here describes.</p>
