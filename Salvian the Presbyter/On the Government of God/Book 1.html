<blockquote>
  <p>T<SPAN class="small">O THE HOLY BISHOP SALONIUS, </SPAN>S<SPAN class="small">ALVIAN SENDS GREETINGS IN THE</SPAN>
  L<SPAN class="small">ORD</SPAN></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Practically all men who have chosen some form of literary composition as a
fitting expression of their native genius have taken especial pains, whether
they were writing of useful and worthy matters, or of useless and unworthy, to
lighten the order of their discourse by the brilliance of their language and to
illumine by their style the questions under discussion. It is to style therefore
that the majority of writers on secular topics, whether in prose or verse, have
paid most attention, not considering sufficiently the necessity of choosing
subjects worthy of approbation, provided that whatever they said was either
chanted in smooth and elegant verse, or narrated in distinguished prose.<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></p>
<p>These authors have sought their own ends, and looking toward their individual
praise rather than the benefit of others have not tried to be considered
salutary and helpful, but rhetorical and eloquent. Therefore their writings are
swollen with vanity, infamous for their falsehood, smeared with filth, or
vicious because of their obscene subjects. Trafficking in such unworthy fashion
to purchase praise for ingenuity seems to me less a glorification than a
condemnation of one's genius. Since we, on the other hand, are lovers of deeds
rather than words,<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> we seek utility rather than
applause. <A NAME="p38"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|38</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not, then, for vain and worldly adornments that we solicit praise, but
for salutary prescriptions. Our writings, trifling though they are, shall
present no vain lures but actual remedies, calculated not to please idle ears
but to benefit the minds of the sick. So do we hope to gain our full reward from
heaven.</p>
<p>Now if this healing grace of ours cures the unfavorable opinion of our God
held by certain men, it will be no small reward that I have thus aided many. But
if no such benefit accrues, the very fact that I have tried to be of service may
not be unfruitful. For a mind devoted to a good work and a charitable aim,
though it has not achieved full success in its undertaking, is still rewarded
for its good intent. At this point then I shall begin.&nbsp; <A NAME="p39"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|39</SPAN></A></p>
<h3 align="center">THE FIRST BOOK</h3>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>1.</SPAN>&nbsp;By certain men God is
said to be careless and neglectful of human actions, on the ground that he
neither protects good men nor restrains the wicked; and they claim that this is
why at the present time the good are generally wretched and the wicked happy.
Since we are dealing with Christians the Holy Scriptures alone should be
sufficient to refute this charge. The many who are still somewhat infected by
pagan unbelief may perhaps be convinced by the testimony of the greatest pagan
philosophers. Let us, then, prove that not even these men had any conception of
a God careless and neglectful of the world, though they had no means of really
knowing God, since they were outside the true faith and were ignorant of the law
through which he is apprehended.</p>
<p>Pythagoras the philosopher, whom Philosophy herself regarded as her master,
said in his discourse on the nature and beneficent works of God: &quot;The Soul
moves to and fro and is diffused through all parts of the world, and from it all
living creatures receive their life...&quot; <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A></p>
<p>How then can God be said to neglect the world for which he so far shows his
love that he extends his own being through its whole mass? Plato and all the
Platonic school confess that God is the controller of all things. The Stoics
testify that he remains always as steersman within that which he guides. What
truer or more religious conception could they have had of the loving care of God
than this comparison with a helmsman? For they clearly understood that as the
helmsman never takes his hand from the tiller, so God <A NAME="p40"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|40</SPAN></A>
never in the slightest degree withdraws his care from the world; and as the
pilot catching the breezes, avoiding rocks, watching the stars, is completely
absorbed, body and soul, in his task, so our God never turns his most gracious
eyes from the whole extent of the world, nor takes away the guiding power of his
providence, nor removes the indulgence of his most kindly love. Whence comes
also that ancient mystic saying by which Maro wished to prove himself no less
philosopher than poet: &quot;For God makes his way through all lands and the
paths of the sea and the high heavens.&quot; <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> Tully
also says: &quot;Nor indeed can God himself, who is known by us, be known in any
other way than as a mind loosed and free and separated from all mortal matter,
understanding all things and moving them.&quot; <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A><i>
</i>Elsewhere he states that nothing is more immediately present than God;<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
by him the world is necessarily ruled. God, therefore, is neither subject nor
obedient to any natural force; he himself rules all nature. Unless forsooth we
are led by our great wisdom to believe that he, by whom we say all things are
ruled, at the same time both rules and neglects them! Since even men outside our
faith have been compelled by sheer necessity to say that all things are known by
God and are moved and ruled by him, how is it that some now think him careless
and neglectful of the world? Is it not he who comprehends all creation by the
fineness of his perception, moves it by his strength, rules it by his power, and
protects it by his kindness?</p>
<p>I have told you what men preeminent alike in philosophy and eloquence have
thought of the majesty and government of the most high God. Moreover, I have
cited the noblest masters of both these supreme arts expressly to facilitate my
proof that all others have either agreed, or, if they have disagreed, have done
so without any authority. And, in fact, I can find none who have differed from
this <A NAME="p41"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|41</SPAN></A> judgment, except for the
delirious ravings of the Epicureans and certain of their imitators.<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
These last have associated God with carelessness and sloth, just as they have
linked pleasure with virtue ---- so it appears that those who entertain this
idea are likely to follow the vices of the Epicureans along with their opinion
and doctrine.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>2.</SPAN>&nbsp;I do not think that
we need also use the divine word to prove so obvious a case, especially since
the sacred writings furnish such abundant and open refutation of all the claims
of ungodly men that, in meeting those of their vile charges which follow, we
shall be able to refute more fully those already mentioned. They say that God
neglects us entirely, since he neither restrains the wicked nor protects the
good, and therefore in this world the condition of the better men is
substantially the worse. They contrast the poverty of good men with the wealth
of the wicked, their weakness with the strength of the wicked, their constant
grief with the others' perpetual joy, their misery and mean estate with the
honors and prosperity of sinners.</p>
<p>I wish at the outset to ask those who mourn this state of affairs, or base
their accusations on it, this one question: is their grief for the saints, that
is, the true and faithful Christians, or for the false impostors? If for the
false, it is a needless grief that mourns for the unhappiness of the wicked,
since, to be sure, all evil men are made worse by success in their undertakings,
and rejoice at the lucky turn of their folly. Yet they ought to be most wretched
in order that they may cease to be wicked, that they may cease to apply the name
of religion to their most evil gains and to bestow the title of sanctity on
their sordid traffickings; in such a case, indeed, a comparison of the
misfortunes of sinners with their misdeeds <A NAME="p42"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|42</SPAN></A>
shows that they are less unfortunate than they deserve, for the utmost
misfortunes they can suffer leave them still less wretched than they are wicked.
It is foolish to grieve for their lack of wealth and happiness. Far less should
we lament in the case of the saints, for however unhappy they may seem to men
who do not understand their condition, it is impossible for them to be otherwise
than happy. Moreover, it is superfluous to think them wretched because of
sickness or poverty or any like misfortune, in the midst of which they count
themselves happy; for no man is wretched because of other men's judgment, but
only in his own.<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A></p>
<p>So those who are truly happy in their own estimation cannot be unhappy
through the false conception of any man; for none, I think, are more fortunate
than those who live and act according to their own determination and vows.
Religious men are lowly ----they wish to be so; poor ---- they delight in
poverty; without ambition---- they spurn it; unesteemed ---- they flee from
honors; they mourn ---- but they seek out occasion for mourning; they are weak
----nay, they rejoice in weakness. For the apostle said, &quot;When I am weak,
then am I strong.&quot; <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> Nor was this opinion held
undeservedly by the man to whom God himself spoke thus: &quot;My grace is
sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.&quot; <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A></p>
<p>It is useless for us to bemoan this affliction of bodily illness, which we
know is the mother of strength. Therefore, whatever their sorrows may have been,
any who are truly religious should be called happy, since amid any hardships or
difficulties whatsoever none are happier than those who are what they wish to
be. Although we all know individuals whose aims are vile and shameful, who think
themselves happy in gaining their desires, yet in actual fact such men are not
happy, because they ought not to desire what <A NAME="p43"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|43</SPAN></A>
they do. Moreover, the religious are happier than all others in this, that they
have what they wish and at the same time cannot possibly wish for anything
better than they have.<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> So toil, fasting, poverty,
humility and weakness are not burdensome to all who suffer them but only to
those who are unwilling to bear them. For the mind of the sufferer determines
whether his troubles are heavy or light to endure. Just as no task is so light
that it is not heavy to the man who performs it unwillingly, none is so heavy
that it does not seem light to him who performs it gladly.<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A></p>
<p>Or are we perhaps to think that it was a burden to those ancient patterns of
virtue, the Fabii, Fabricii and Cincinnati, that they, who did not wish riches,
were poor? <A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> Remember that they directed all their
efforts, all their labor, to the common good, and by their individual poverty
contributed to the growing wealth of the state. Surely you do not think that it
was with groans and sadness that they endured their famous life of rustic
economy, when they ate their cheap country fare before the very fire over which
they had cooked it, and delayed even this poor meal until evening? Did they take
it ill that they were not piling up talents of gold in the pursuit of miserly
wealth, when they were passing laws to restrict the circulation even of silver?
Could men who judged a patrician unworthy of the senate because he had wished to
increase his wealth <A NAME="p44"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|44</SPAN></A> to the sum of
ten pounds of silver possibly think it a penalty for their illicit greed that
they had not their purses stuffed with gold? <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A></p>
<p>In those days, I think, men did not despise humble ways of life, when they
wore only one short and shaggy garment, when they were summoned from the plow to
the dictator's <i>fasces, </i>and, on the point of winning fame in the consular
robes, very likely wiped off their dusty sweat on those same imperial togas that
they were about to don. In their time the magistrates were poor, but the state
wealthy, whereas now the wealth of officials makes the state poor. What madness,
I ask you, or what blindness, leads men to think that private fortunes can
survive in the midst of the need and beggary of the state? Such were the ancient
Romans; so they in their day scorned riches, though they knew not God, just as
in ours men who follow the Lord still scorn them.</p>
<p>But why do I speak of those men who in their desire to extend the Roman power
turned their scorn of private means to the public enrichment, and while
individually poor still had abundance in the common wealth of the state? Even
Greek philosophers without any interest in public gain, through sheer greed of
glory have been known to strip themselves of almost all articles of common use,
and, not content with this, have exalted their creed to the lofty pinnacle of
contempt of suffering and death, saying that even in chains and punishment a
wise man still is happy.<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> They would have it that
the power of virtue is so great that a good man can never fail to be content.
If, then, certain wise men now think that those men were not unhappy, though
they received no reward for their efforts but transient praise, how much more
must religious and saintly men cease to be thought wretched, who both enjoy at
this present time <A NAME="p45"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|45</SPAN></A> the delights of
their faith, and are to attain as well the reward of eternal blessedness?</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>3.</SPAN>&nbsp;One of those of whom
we complain said to a certain holy man who followed the true doctrine, that is,
that God rules all things and tempers his governance and guidance according to
his knowledge of human necessities: &quot;Why then, I ask, are you yourself
infirm?&quot; His line of reasoning, I suppose, was as follows: &quot;if God, as
you think, rules everything in this present life, if he dispenses all fortunes,
then how is it that a man whom I know to be a sinner is strong and healthy,
whereas you, whose sanctity I do not question, are infirm?&quot;</p>
<p>Who does not marvel at the depth of feeling of one who considers the merits
and virtues of a godly man worthy of such great recompense that he thinks they
should be rewarded in this present life by the fleshly strength of the body? I
answer, therefore, not in the name of any one saint but of them all: &quot;Do
you ask, then, whoever you are, how it is that holy men come to be weak? My
answer is brief: they make themselves infirm for the express reason that if they
are strong, they can hardly be holy.&quot;<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> I
think that men gain strength entirely through their food and drink, and are weak
through abstinence, thirst and fasting. Therefore it is not strange that those
are weak who scorn the use of the means by which others are made strong. And
there is good reason for such scorn, according to the words of the apostle Paul,
when he said: &quot;I keep under my body and bring it into subjection; lest that
by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a
castaway.&quot; <A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> If the apostle himself
considered the weakness of the body an end to be sought, who acts wisely in
avoiding it? If the apostle feared the strength of the flesh, who rightly
presumes to <A NAME="p46"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|46</SPAN></A> be strong? This, then,
is the reason why men who have given themselves over to Christ both are and wish
to be weak. Far be it from us to think that holy men are neglected by God for
the very reason for which, we trust, they are the more loved by him. We read
that the apostle Timothy was most weak in the flesh.<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
Was this a sign of God's neglect, or did Timothy through his weakness fail to
please Christ, willing as he was to be weak in order to please him? Even so the
apostle Paul, though Timothy was suffering from serious infirmities, yet
permitted him to take and sip only a very little wine; that is, he wished him to
have regard for his weakness but not so far as to attain full vigor.<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
And why was this? What other reason could there be but that which he himself has
given? &quot;For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against
the flesh; and these are contrary,&quot; he says, &quot;the one to the other, so
that ye cannot do the things that ye would.&quot; <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A></p>
<p>It was not without insight that a certain author <A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A><i>
</i>said in this connection that if the strength of the body prevents us from
doing what we wish, the flesh must be weakened in order that we may achieve our
desires. For he says: &quot;The weakness of our flesh sharpens the vigor of the
mind, and when our limbs are weakened bodily strength is transformed into
spiritual virtue. Then our inmost parts no longer seethe with disgraceful
passions, and secret desires no longer kindle a diseased mind; our senses do not
roam wantonly over various enticements, but the soul alone exults, rejoicing in
the weakness of the body as over a defeated adversary.&quot; <A NAME="p47"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|47</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This, as I said, is the cause to which religious men ascribe their
infirmities, and you, I think, can no longer deny its validity.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>4.</SPAN>&nbsp;But perhaps they
have, you say, other and greater sufferings, that is, they endure many hard and
bitter trials in this life; they arc captured, tortured and butchered. That is
true, but what are we to make of the fact that the prophets were led away into
captivity and that the apostles also suffered torments? Surely we cannot doubt
that God had the greatest concern for them, since it was for God that they bore
these afflictions. But perhaps you claim this as an additional proof that God
neglects everything that happens in this life and reserves his whole care for
the judgment to come, since the good have always suffered, as the wicked have
performed, all things evil. This idea does not seem to be that of an unbeliever,
especially as it admits the future judgment of God. But we say that the human
race is to be judged by Christ, while yet maintaining that now also God rules
and ordains all things in accordance with his reason. While we declare that he
will judge in the future, we also teach that he always has judged us in this
life. As God always governs, so too he always judges, for his government is
itself judgment.</p>
<p>In how many ways do you wish this proved, by reason, or by examples, or by
authorities? If you wish it proved by reason, who is so lacking in ordinary
human intelligence and so utterly averse to the truth of which we speak, that he
does not recognize and see that the surpassing beauty of the created world, the
inestimable grandeur of the heavens above and of the regions below are ruled by
the same power that created them? He who devised their elements will himself be
their governor. He will guide all things by a providence and reason consistent
with the majestic power by which he founded them. And certainly, since even in
those matters that are conducted by human activity, absolutely nothing exists
without reason, and all things derive their security from providence, even as
the body derives its life from the soul; so in this world not only <A NAME="p48"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|48</SPAN></A>
empires and provinces, civil and military affairs, but also the lesser offices
and private homes, the very sheep and the smaller sorts of domestic animals are
controlled by no other means than human ordinance and wisdom, as by a guiding
hand on the tiller. All this beyond a doubt is in accordance with the will and
judgment of the most high God, that the whole human race should govern the
lesser parts, or limbs of the world, following the example of God's government
of the whole body of the universe.</p>
<p>But, you suggest, in the beginning the governance of his creatures was so
determined and arranged by God; yet after he had formed and perfected the whole
scheme of things, he abdicated, and renounced the administration of earthly
matters. I suppose you mean to imply that he fled from the idea of toil and
repudiated it, that he sought to avoid the annoyance of constant effort. Or was
it that, occupied with other business, he abandoned a part of his affairs, since
he could not attend to the whole?</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>5.</SPAN>&nbsp;God then puts far
from himself, you say, all thought of mortal men. In that case what rational
ground is there for our belief in his divinity? What reason is there for
worshipping Christ, or what hope of winning his favor? For if God in this life
neglects the human race, why do we daily stretch out our hands toward heaven?
Why do we pray so often for the mercy of God? Why do we hasten to the churches?
Why kneel in prayer before the altars? There is no reason for praying if the
hope of an answer to prayer is taken from us. You see what vain folly lies in
the urging of this idea; truly, if it is accepted, nothing at all remains of our
religion. But perhaps you take refuge in the argument that we honor God in the
fear of a future judgment, and perform all the ritual of our daily worship to
gain absolution on the judgment day hereafter. In that case, what was the
meaning of the daily preaching of Paul the apostle in the church, and his
command that we offer constantly to God our prayers, our entreaties, our
requests and our thanksgivings? <A NAME="p49"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|49</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the purpose of all this? What else than, as he himself says,
&quot;that we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all chastity?&quot; <A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
For our present needs, as we see, he orders us to pray and beseech the Lord.
Surely he would not command this if he were not sure that God hearkens to
prayer. How can any one suppose that the ears of God are open for the granting
of boons at some future time, but deaf and blocked against immediate petitions?
Or what leads us when praying in the church to ask God for present safety, if we
think that he does not listen at all to our prayers? In that case we should make
no vows for our safety and prosperity.</p>
<p>Perhaps, to the end that the modesty of the request may win favor for the
voice of the petitioner, we should rather pray thus: &quot;Lord, we do not seek
prosperity in this life, nor beseech you for immediate favors, for we know that
your ears are closed to such petitions and that you do not listen to such
prayers, but we ask only for those favors that shall be granted us after our
death.&quot;</p>
<p>Granted that such a petition is not without value, on what rational basis
does it rest? For if God is without interest in this life, and closes his ears
to the prayers of his suppliants, then doubtless he who does not hear our
present pleas is deaf also to our prayers for the future. Are we to believe that
Christ listens or denies his attention according to the diverse nature of our
prayers, that lie closes his ears when we ask for present boons, and opens them
when we ask for blessings to come? But enough of this. The arguments are so
stupid and frivolous that one needs to beware lest what is said for the honor of
God seem injurious to him. For so great and terrible is the reverence due to his
sacred majesty that we should not only shudder at the arguments of our
opponents, but should also make our defence of religion with due fear and
circumspection.</p>
<p>If, therefore, it is stupid and impious to believe that the divine love
despises the care of human affairs, then God does not despise <A NAME="p50"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|50</SPAN></A>
it; moreover, if he does not scorn it, he governs; if he governs, he judges by
the very exercise of his government, since there can be no rule without the
constant exercise of judgment on the part of the ruler.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C6"></A>6.</SPAN>&nbsp;Perhaps some one may
think a proof too insecure that rests on reason alone without the support of
authority. Let us see how God has ruled the world from the beginning; for by
demonstrating that he has always ruled the universe, we shall prove that he has
at the same time exercised judgment.</p>
<p>What is the testimony of the Scriptures? &quot;Therefore God formed man of
clay and breathed into him the breath of life.&quot; And what followed? &quot;
He placed him in a paradise of pleasure.&quot; <A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
What next? What else than that he gave him law, filled him with his commands,
formed him by his instruction? But what happened then? Man transgressed the
sacred ordinance, underwent judgment, lost paradise and suffered the penalty of
damnation. Who can fail to see God as both governor and judge in this whole
account? For he placed Adam in paradise in innocence; he expelled him in guilt.
In Adam's establishment we see the divine ordinance; in his expulsion, the
divine judgment. For when God set man in a place of delight, he ordained his way
of life; but when he expelled him in guilt from that realm, he exercised
judgment. This then is the story of the first man, that is, of the father.</p>
<p>What of the second, the son? &quot;In process of time it came to pass,&quot;
say the Holy Scriptures, &quot;that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an
offering unto the Lord. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock
and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect.&quot; <A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A></p>
<p>Before I speak of the more obvious judgment of God, I think that even in the
account just given there is a certain indication of <A NAME="p51"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|51</SPAN></A>
judgment; for in the act of receiving one brother's sacrifice and rejecting the
other God gave a most open verdict as to the justice of the one and the
injustice of the other. But this was not enough. Thereafter Cain paved the way
for his later crimes by leading his brother into the wilderness; in the friendly
protection of the desert he committed his murder. He proved himself at once the
most wicked and most stupid of men, since he thought he had sufficient secrecy
for the most evil and abhorrent act if he avoided the sight of men when about to
commit fratricide with God as his witness.</p>
<p>Whence I think he had this same idea that is now so prevalent, that God does
not behold things done on earth and does not see any of the acts of wicked men.
Nor is there any doubt of this, since, when he was admitted to speech with God
after the commission of his crime, he answered that he knew nothing of his
brother's death. He was so sure of God's ignorance of his deed, that he thought
the most deadly wrong could be hidden by a mere lie.</p>
<p>But the event proved other than he anticipated. For though he thought his
fratricide unseen by God, his condemnation taught him that God had seen. I now
have one question to ask of those who deny that human affairs are regarded by
God or ruled or judged by him: are all the circumstances different in these
accounts that we have given? For I think that he is present who is concerned in
the sacrifice; he rules who rebukes Cain after his sacrifice; he is anxious who
requires the victim of the murderer; he judges who condemns the wicked slayer by
a just verdict.</p>
<p>In this incident, indeed, there is yet another point convenient to our
argument. Surely we are not to wonder that holy men are now suffering certain
hardships, since we see that God even at that time permitted the first of his
saints to be most wickedly slain. As to the reason why he permits such actions,
it is not within the power of human weakness to discover fully, nor is this a
fit occasion for such discussion. For the present it is enough to prove that
deeds <A NAME="p52"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|52</SPAN></A> of this sort do not occur
because of the negligence or inattention of God, but are permitted by the
dispensation of his wisdom. Moreover, we can by no means call him unjust, for
the will of God is the highest justice; nor does a divine action cease to be
righteous because man is incapable of grasping the workings of the divine
justice. But let us return to the main argument.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C7"></A>7.</SPAN>&nbsp;We have seen in the
accounts already given that nothing is done without the care of God, but that
some of these actions were so arranged by his divine wisdom, some endured by his
forbearance, some punished by his sentence. Certain people, perhaps, think that
these few cases do not sufficiently establish our contention; let us see if we
can make it completely clear through the experience of all men.</p>
<p>When, therefore, the human race had increased and multiplied alike in numbers
and in wickedness, as the Holy Scripture says: &quot;God seeing that the
wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the
thoughts of his heart was only evil continually, repented that he had made man
on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart, and he said: 'I will destroy man
whom. I have created, from the face of the earth.' &quot; <A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A></p>
<p>Let us consider how both the care of God and his severity are equally shown
in the whole account. For first we read, &quot;moreover God seeing&quot;;
secondly, &quot;it grieved him at his heart&quot;; and thirdly, &quot;he said,
'I will destroy man whom I have created.'&quot; In the first statement, that God
sees all things, his care is shown; in the statement that he grieves is shown
the terror of his wrath; that he punishes, his severity as a judge. &quot;God
therefore repented,&quot; says the Holy Scripture, &quot;that he had made man on
the earth&quot;; this does not indicate that God is subject to repentance or any
other emotion, but rather that the divine word, to further our understanding of
the true meaning of the Scriptures, speaks to us in terms of human feeling and
shows the force of God's anger under <A NAME="p53"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|53</SPAN></A>
the name of repentance; moreover, the divine wrath is the punishment of the
sinner.</p>
<p>What followed then? When God saw that the earth was corrupt he said to Noah:
&quot;The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with
violence through them: and behold, I will destroy them with the earth.&quot; <A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
What happened next? &quot;All the fountains of the great deep were broken up,
and the flood-gates of heaven were opened and the rain was upon the earth forty
days and forty nights.&quot; <A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> And a little later:
&quot;All flesh died that moved upon the earth.&quot; And again: &quot;And Noah
only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.&quot; <A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A></p>
<p>Now I wish to ask those who say that God neglects human fortunes whether they
believe that at this time he cared for earthly matters and judged them? I think
he not merely judged but gave a twofold judgment; for in preserving the good he
proved himself a generous giver of rewards, and in destroying the wicked, a
severe judge.</p>
<p>Perhaps these instances may seem to stupid wits to lack authority, since they
happened before the Flood ---- in another age, as it were. As if we could assume
that God was different at that time, and afterwards ceased to desire to exercise
the same care for the world! Indeed, by the divine grace I could prove my
statements by examples from all generations since the Flood, but their great
number forbids. However, certain of the more important instances will suffice,
for since God is undoubtedly the same in the greater and the lesser cases, the
lesser may be inferred from the greater.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C8"></A>8.</SPAN>&nbsp;After the Flood God
blessed the generation of men, and when this blessing had brought forth an
immeasurable host of men, God spoke to Abraham from heaven, ordering him to
leave his own land and go to a strange country. He was called, he followed; he <A NAME="p54"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|54</SPAN></A>
was guided and established; from a poor man he became rich; from an obscure man,
powerful. Though reduced by his journeyings to the lowest estate, he came to be
most high in honor. Yet in order that the previous gifts of God to him should
not seem undeserved generosity, he who rejoiced in prosperity was tested in
adversity. Then came toil, danger and fear; he was vexed by travelling, worn out
by exile, visited with shame, and deprived of his wife. God ordered him to
sacrifice his son; the father offered his child, and so far as the resolution of
his heart was concerned, performed the sacrifice. Again came periods of exile,
again fear, the hatred of the Philistines, the rapine of Abimelech ---- many
evils, yet compensated by equal consolations, for though he was afflicted in
many things, yet was he rewarded for them all.</p>
<p>What conclusion are we to draw? In all the events which we have recounted, is
not God seen examining Abraham, inviting and leading him, anxious for him, his
sponsor, protector, benefactor, testing and exalting him, at once his avenger
and his judge?<i> </i>Surely he examined him, for he chose him as the one best
man of them all; he invited him, for he called him; he was his guide, leading
him through in safety to unknown lands; anxious for him, for he visited him by
the oak tree; his sponsor, in promises of things to come; his protector,
guarding him among barbarous races; his benefactor, in that he enriched him; his
examiner, in that he wished to test him by harsh trials; his exalter, for he
made him powerful beyond all men; his avenger, for he avenged him on his
adversaries; his judge, for in avenging him he exercised judgment.</p>
<p>Moreover, God at once added another item to this history when he said:
&quot;The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is grown great, and their sin is increased
overmuch.&quot; <A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah,
he said, is grown great. He said well that sins cry out, for without doubt the
cry of sinners is great, as it ascends from earth to heaven. Why does he speak
of men's sins as crying out? <A NAME="p55"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|55</SPAN></A>
Certainly because he means that his ears are smitten by the cries of our sins,
that the punishment of sinners may not be delayed. Truly, it is a cry, and a
great cry, when the fatherly love of God is overcome by the cries of sin, so
that he is compelled to punish the sinners.<A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A></p>
<p>God showed how unwillingly he punishes even the worst of sinners, when he
said that the cry of Sodom ascended to him. That is to say: &quot;My mercy
indeed persuades me to spare them; nevertheless the cry of their sins compels me
to punish.&quot; When he had said this, what resulted? Angels were sent to
Sodom; they set out, and entered the city; they were treated hospitably by the
good and injuriously by the wicked; the wicked were blinded and the good saved.
Lot, with his dear ones who honored God, was led out of the city; Sodom itself
was burned with its wicked inhabitants.</p>
<p>I ask at this point whether it was in accordance with justice or contrary to
it that God burned these wicked men? He who says that the Sodomites were
unjustly punished by God accuses him of injustice; if, on the other hand, God
justly destroyed those evil men, he judged them.</p>
<p>Surely he judged them, and indeed his judgment clearly foreshadowed that
which is to come. For it is well known that in time to come Gehenna will be in
flames for the punishment of the wicked, just as flames from heaven then
consumed the city of Sodom and its neighbors. Moreover, God wished his immediate
action to prefigure that coming judgment, when he sent Gehenna down out of
heaven upon an impious people. So the apostle also says that God condemned the
cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by their overthrow, making them an example to those
that hereafter should live ungodly lives,<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
although his action on that occasion had in it more <A NAME="p56"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|56</SPAN></A>
of mercy than of severity. For that he so long delayed their punishment was due
to his mercy; that he finally punished them, to his justice. So when God sent
his angels to Sodom, he wished to prove to us that he is loath to punish even
wicked men; to the end that when we should read what insults the angels endured
from the people of Sodom, and see plainly the enormity of their crimes, the
disgraceful character of their vices and the obscenity of their lusts, he might
prove to us that he did not wish to destroy them, but they themselves forced
their destruction on him.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C9"></A>9.</SPAN>&nbsp;I might mention
countless further examples, but I am afraid that in my effort to give adequate
proof I may seem to have composed a whole history. Moses pasturing his sheep in
the desert saw a bush burning, heard God from the midst of the bush and received
his commands. He was exalted in power and was sent to Pharaoh; he spoke with
him, was scorned, but conquered. The Egyptian was struck down, Pharaoh's
disobedience was smitten, and not in one way alone, but many, to the end that he
should be tortured by a diversity of punishments in consideration of the
greatness of his sacrilege. What was the outcome? Ten times he rebelled; ten
times he was smitten. What is our conclusion? I think you must recognize that in
all these cases God shows equally his care for human affairs and his judgment of
them.</p>
<p>In Egypt, indeed, the judgment of God at that time was evidently not single
but manifold. For as often as he smote the rebellious Egyptians, so often he
judged them. But after the events already told, what happened? Israel was
dismissed; after celebrating the Passover they despoiled the Egyptians and
departed in wealth. Pharaoh repented, gathered his army, overtook the fugitives,
encamped beside them, was separated from them by the darkness; the sea was dried
up, Israel crossed over and by the friendly withdrawal of the waves was set
free. Pharaoh followed, the sea rolled over him, and he was drowned by the
engulfing waves. <A NAME="p57"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|57</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that the judgment of God has been made clear in these events, and
indeed not merely his judgment but also his moderation and patience. For it was
due to his patience that the Egyptians in their rebellion were often smitten, to
his judgment that for their persistent stubbornness they were condemned to
death. Therefore, after this series of adventures the race of the Hebrews,
victorious without warfare, entered the desert. They followed an uncharted
course, pathless wanderers, with God to lead the way, honored by his divine
comradeship, powerful through their heavenly leader, following a moving column
of cloud by day, of fire by night, which took on shifting changes of color to
suit the changing skies, that its dull obscurity might stand out in contrast to
the strong light of day and its flaming splendor illumine by its clear glow the
mists of night.</p>
<p>Add to this the springs that suddenly gushed forth, add the bitter waters
given and changed, keeping their old appearance but changing their character.
Add mountain peaks cleft open by streams gushing forth, dusty fields foaming
with new torrents. Add flocks of birds sent into the camp of the wanderers,
since God in his most indulgent love catered not only to the needs but also to
the palates of his people; the food granted throughout forty years by the daily
ministry of the stars, the dew of sweet morsels shed from the poles, offering
abundance not merely for nourishment but for delight. Add that the men
experienced in no part of their bodies the growth or losses natural to human
beings, their nails did not grow, nor their teeth decay, their hair stayed
always of one length, their feet were not worn by the march, their clothing was
not tattered, their shoes not broken, and thus the honor granted to the men
themselves was even sufficient to dignify their mean garments.<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
Add to all this God descending to earth to instruct his <A NAME="p58"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|58</SPAN></A>
people, lending himself, God the Son,<A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> to earthly
sight, the countless throngs of people admitted to familiar intercourse with
him, waxing strong in the power of his sacred intimacy.</p>
<p>Add to this the thunders, the lightnings, the terrifying blasts of celestial
trumpets, the fearful crashing over the whole sky, the poles rumbling with a
holy sound, the fires, mists and clouds filled with the very presence of God,
God speaking to man face to face, the law resounding from his holy lips, the
letters inscribed in minutest accuracy on the stone page by the finger of God,
the stone become a written scroll, the people learning and God teaching in a
school of heaven and earth commingled, almost a union of men and angels.</p>
<p>For it is written that when Moses had taken the words of the people to the
Lord, the Lord said to him: &quot;Lo, now I come to thee in a thick cloud, that
the people may hear when I speak with thee.&quot; <A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
And a little later: &quot;Lo, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick
cloud upon the mount.&quot; <A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A> Again: &quot;And the
Lord came down upon Mount Sinai, on the top of the mount.&quot; <A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>Again: &quot;And the Lord talked with Moses. And all the people saw the
cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and
worshipped, every man at his tent door. And the Lord spake unto Moses, face to
face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.&quot; <A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A></p>
<p>In view of all this, does God seem to take any thought for men, giving them
such great gifts, helping them so much, sharing his speech with a vile mortal,
as if admitting him to converse in his <A NAME="p59"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|59</SPAN></A>
sacred fellowship, opening before him his hands filled with immortal riches,
nourishing him with a cup of nectar, feeding him with celestial food? What
greater care, I ask, could his guidance afford, what greater love could he show,
than possession in the course of this present life of such a mirror of future
blessedness?</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C10"></A>10.</SPAN>&nbsp;Perhaps at this
juncture you may answer that God did once exercise such care for men, but now
does not at all. Why should we believe this? Because we do not now eat manna
daily as the Israelites did? But we reap fields full of grain at the harvest.
Because we do not catch quails that fly into our hands? But we devour all kinds
of birds, cattle and beasts. Because we are not granted waters gushing from
clefts opened in the rocks? But we pour the fruits of our vines into our wine
cellars. I have more to add: we ourselves, who say that the children of Israel
at that time were cared for by God but that we are neglected by him, would
absolutely reject the choice of their condition if we could receive their past
favors in exchange for our present benefits. For we should not be willing to
lose what we now have in order to gain what they then enjoyed, not that we are
better off than the Israelites were, but that they too, who were then daily fed
by the ministry of the stars and of God, preferred the old accustomed fodder for
their bellies to the favors they enjoyed. They were actually sad at their vile
recollections of carnal foods, pining away with a vulgar yearning for onions and
garlic, not because their former diet was more wholesome, but because they acted
just as we do now. They loathed what they had and longed for what they lacked.
We would rather praise bygone days than the present, not that we should prefer
to revive the past if the choice were given us, but because it is a well-known
failing of the human mind always to desire what it lacks, and, as the proverb
says, &quot;Another's goods please us, and ours please others more.&quot; <A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>
<A NAME="p60"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|60</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this may be added a trait shared by almost all, of being forever
ungrateful to God, and all in turn are bound by the deep-rooted and inborn vice
of belittling the blessings God gives, in order that they may not feel obliged
to look on themselves as his debtors.</p>
<p>But enough of this: let us at last return to our original proposition. I
think we have made no slight progress toward proving the point; still let me add
one instance more, if you please, since it is better to prove a matter more
fully than is necessary than to risk falling short of conviction.<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A></p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C11"></A>11.</SPAN>&nbsp;Freed from
Pharaoh's yoke the people of the Hebrews transgressed near Mount Sinai, and were
at once smitten by the Lord for their transgression. For it is written:
&quot;And the Lord plagued the people for their delusion concerning the calf
which Aaron made.&quot; <A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A> What greater and clearer
judgment could God give concerning sinners than that punishment should overtake
them forthwith in the midst of their sin? Yet since all the people were guilty,
why was not destruction visited on all alike? Surely because the Lord, loving
them, smote some with the sword of his sentence, in order to correct the others
by their example, and to prove to all at one time his censure in chastising
their sin and his affection in pardoning them. For his censure was shown in the
punishment, his mercy in the pardon, though disproportionately, for on that
occasion he yielded more to mercy than to severity.</p>
<p>Surely then, since our most indulgent Lord shows himself always more prone to
mercy than to punishment, even though in punishing a part of the Jewish host by
his divine censure he gave some scope to judgment and severity, yet his love
claimed the greater portion of the people ---- a special and peculiar act of
mercy to countless <A NAME="p61"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|61</SPAN></A> men that the
punishment might not destroy all who were implicated in the guilt. But toward
certain individuals and families, as we read, the censure of God was inexorable.
Such an instance is that of the man who, when the people rested on the Sabbath
day, presumed to gather wood and was killed. For although his action seemed
harmless in itself, yet the observance of the day made it sinful. Or the time
when two men were contesting with each other, and one, since he had blasphemed,
was punished by death. For it is written: &quot;Lo the son of an Israelitish
woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and
this son of an Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the
camp; and the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and
cursed. And they brought him to Moses.&quot; And a little later: &quot;And they
put him in ward, that the mind of the Lord might be showed them. And the Lord
spake unto Moses, saying, 'Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp ;
and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the
congregation stone him.' &quot; <A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A></p>
<p>Was not God's judgment immediate and manifest and his sentence pronounced
as if the heavenly decision followed the forms of our legal procedure? First the
man who had sinned was arrested, then he was led, so to speak, before the
judge's seat, thirdly accused and then put into prison, lastly punished by the
authority of the divine judgment; furthermore he was not only punished but
punished in accordance with evidence given, so that God's justice and not merely
his power was seen to condemn his guilt. This truly was meant as an example
working toward the correction of all men, so that none should commit thereafter
the deed which all the people had punished in one person. For this reason and by
this judgment the Lord does all things now and has always done them, that
whatever penalties individuals have to bear should work toward the correction of
all. <A NAME="p62"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|62</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it was also when Abihu and Nadab, men of priestly blood, were consumed by
fire from heaven, in whose case, to be sure, the Lord wished to show not merely
judgment but judgment immediately impending. For it is written that when the
fire sent by the Lord had consumed the burnt offering: &quot;Nadab and Abihu,
the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein and put
incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which he commanded
them not. And there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them and they died
before the Lord.&quot; <A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A> What else did he wish
than to show his right hand stretched over us, and his sword ever threatening?
For he punished the errors of the aforesaid men at once, in their very act, and
the crime of the sinners was scarcely committed before punishment was exacted
for their misdeeds.</p>
<p>Yet not only this was accomplished in their case, but much else besides, For,
as in these men not a wicked intention but only a misguided impulse was
punished, the Lord surely made clear what punishment any one would deserve who
committed a sin through contempt of the divine power, since even those who had
sinned only through thoughtlessness were struck down by God ---- or how guilty
they would be who acted contrary to his command, when those who merely acted
without his command were thus stricken. God also wished to further our
correction by a salutary example, that all laymen should understand how much
they ought to fear the wrath of God, since neither did the high priest's merits
rescue his sons from instant punishment, nor did the privilege of the sacred
ministry redeem them.</p>
<p>But why do I speak of men whose ill-advised action really did in some measure
affect God and work injury to his divinity? Mary spoke against Moses and was
punished; she was not only punished, but punished in due course of trial. For
first she was called to justice, then accused, and thirdly chastised. In the
accusation she <A NAME="p63"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|63</SPAN></A> learned the full
force of her sentence, and in her leprosy she paid full atonement for her crime
---- yet this punishment humbled not Mary alone, but Aaron as well. For, though
it was unsuitable for the high priest to be deformed by leprosy, yet the
correction of the Lord plagued him also. Nor was this all. In the punishment
that Mary suffered, Aaron too was involved, as sharer in her guilt; Mary indeed
was punished that Aaron might be put to confusion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, that we might recognize in the individual cases that the form of
the divine judgment is inexorable, God did not even yield to the intercession of
the injured party. For we read that the Lord spoke thus to Aaron and Mary:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant
  Moses?&quot; And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and he
  departed. And behold, Mary became leprous, and white as snow: and Moses cried
  unto the Lord, saying: &quot;Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.&quot; And
  the Lord said unto Moses: &quot;If her father had but spit in her face, should
  she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out from the camp seven days,
  and after that let her be received in again.&quot; <A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These things that we have told should be sufficient for this division of the
argument and for this part of our work; for it is an endless task to discuss all
the cases; indeed, it would be overlong merely to enumerate them without any
discussion. But let me add one more instance.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C12"></A>12.</SPAN>&nbsp;The people of the
Hebrews repented having gone out of Egypt; they were struck down: then they
grieved at the weariness and toil of the journey, and were afflicted: they
desired flesh-meat, and were smitten. And because, eating manna daily, they
desired to satiate the cravings of their bellies with illicit foods, they were
sated indeed in their passionate greed, but tortured in that very satiety.
&quot;For while their food was still in their mouths,&quot; says the Scripture,
&quot;the wrath of God came upon them, and slew very many of them and smote down
the chosen men of Israel.&quot; <A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A> <A NAME="p64"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|64</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Og rebelled against Moses: he was blotted out. Korah taunted him: he was
overwhelmed. Dathan and Abiram murmured against him: they were swallowed up.
&quot;For the earth opened and swallowed Dathan, and covered the company of
Abiram.&quot; <A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A> Two hundred and fifty leaders of
the people also, as the sacred narrative testifies, who were called upon by name
to speak at the time of the council, rose against Moses. &quot;And they gathered
themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them: 'Ye take
too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and
the Lord is among them; wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the
congregation of the Lord?' &quot; And what happened after this? &quot;There came
out a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that
offered incense.&quot; <A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A></p>
<p>When such deeds were committed, heavenly mercy was of no avail. Correction
was administered again and again, yet improvement did not follow. For just as we
are chastised again and again, and do not improve, so they too, though
constantly struck down, did not mend their ways. For what is written? &quot;But
on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against
Moses and Aaron, saying, 'Ye have killed the people of the Lord.' &quot; <A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A></p>
<p>What happened then? Fourteen thousand seven hundred men were struck down at
once and consumed by divine fire. Since all the multitude of the people sinned,
why did not the punishment fall on all alike? Especially since, as I said
before, no one escaped from Koran's sedition. Why did God on the former occasion
wish all the assemblage of sinners to be killed, but at this time a portion
only? Surely because the Lord is full of justice and mercy and therefore his
indulgence causes many concessions to his love, and his discipline to his
severity. And so on the one occasion he gave first place <A NAME="p65"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|65</SPAN></A>
to discipline that the punishment of all the guilty might redound to the general
betterment; on the other he yielded precedence to mercy, that the whole people
might not perish. Although he acted with such mercy, yet because the punishment
so often repeated for a part of the people did not profit them, finally he
condemned them all to death. This example should contribute to our fear and our
correction alike, that we, failing to be improved by their example, may not come
to be punished by a destruction like theirs.</p>
<p>There is no doubt what their end was. Although the whole race of the Hebrews
went out of Egypt to enter the promised land, yet not one of them entered it
save two holy men alone. For it is written: &quot;The Lord spake unto Moses and
unto Aaron, saying: 'How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which
murmur against me? As truly as I live, saith the Lord, as ye have spoken in mine
ears this day, so will I do to you: your carcasses shall fall in this
wilderness!'&quot; What followed? &quot;Your little ones,&quot; he said,
&quot;which you said would be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know
the land which ye have despised. But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall
in this wilderness.&quot; And what then? &quot; All died and were struck down in
the sight of the Lord.&quot; <A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A></p>
<p>What detail is lacking in this whole account? Would you see a ruler? Behold
him, correcting present sins and disposing the future. Would you see a severe
judge? Behold, he punishes the guilty. Would you see a just and loving judge?
Behold, he spares the innocent. Would you see the judge of the whole world?
Behold, his judgment is in all places. For as judge he accuses and as judge he
rules; as judge he pronounces sentence; as judge he destroys the guilty, and as
judge he rewards the innocent.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&quot;Avidi et semper pleni, quod habent desiderant.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><A NAME="12"></A>12.&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;See Salvian <i>Ad ecclesiam </i>IV.
9. 49: &quot;Every command is hard that is given to unwilling men.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="13"></A>13.&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;These were among the best-known
examples of early Roman virtue; cf. H. W. Litchfield, &quot;National <i>Exempla
Virtutis </i>in Eoman Literature,&quot; <i>Harvard Studies in Classical
Philology, </i>XXV (1914), 1-71. All these are cited in Valerius Maximus IV.
3-4, as examples of abstinence, continence and poverty, and were used by
Christian writers from Augustine and Orosius to modern times to illustrate the
same virtues. The contrast between Roman and Greek ambition which follows was
also a commonplace before Salvian's time, and has been since.</p>
<p><A NAME="14"></A>14.&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;See the story of Cornelius
Rufinus in Valerius Maximus II. 9. 4; Tertullian <i>Apologeticum </i>6.</p>
<p><A NAME="15"></A>15.&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;A stock characteristic of the
Stoic and the Epicurean sage: cf. Seneca <i>Epistulae morales </i>lxvi. 18;
Cicero <i>Disputationes Tusculanae </i>II. 7. 17, <i>De finibus </i>11. 27.</p>
<p><A NAME="16"></A>16.&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> See Salvian <i>Ep. </i>V. 3:
&quot;Although I do not think that even this infirmity of your earthly vessel
has been harmful to you, for its strength, as you know, is always hostile to the
mind; so that I am right in thinking you as much stronger now in spirit, as you
have begun to be weaker in the flesh.&quot;</p>
<p><A NAME="17"></A>17.&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> I Corinthians 9. 27.</p>
<p><A NAME="18"></A>18.&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> In common with others of his time,
Salvian used the term &quot;apostle&quot; more loosely than we do now.</p>
<p><A NAME="19"></A>19.&nbsp;<sup>17</sup> See I Timothy 5.23. An excellent
example of Salvian's occasional readiness to distort Scripture for his purpose,
perhaps justifiable in this case because of the frequent misuse of the same text
by other authors, to support both sides of the same argument.</p>
<p><A NAME="20"></A>20.&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> Galatians 5.17.</p>
<p><A NAME="21"></A>21.&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> Salvian, in <i>Ep. </i>V. 4, his
letter to &quot;sister Cattura,&quot; in which he congratulates her not only on
recovery from an illness but also on the illness itself, which had strengthened
her soul at the expense of her body. See also note 14.</p>
<p><A NAME="22"></A>22.&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> I Timothy 2. 2.</p>
<p><A NAME="23"></A>23.&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp; Genesis 2. 7-8.</p>
<p><A NAME="24"></A>24.&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;<i>Ibid. </i>4. 3-5.</p>
<p><A NAME="25"></A>25.&nbsp;<sup>23</sup> <i>Ibid. </i>6.5-7.</p>
<p><A NAME="26"></A>26.&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;<i>Ibid. </i>6.13.</p>
<p><A NAME="27"></A>27.&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;<i>Ibid. </i>7. 11-12.</p>
<p><A NAME="28"></A>28.&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;<i>Ibid. </i>7. 21, 23.</p>
<p><A NAME="29"></A>29.&nbsp;<sup>27</sup> <i>Ibid. </i>18.20.</p>
<p><A NAME="30"></A>30.&nbsp;<sup>28</sup> Rittershausen, <i>Salviani opera </i>(Altdorf
1611), <i>ad loc, </i>cites a verse listing the five sins that were proverbially
said to cry for justice to heaven:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Clamitat in caelum vox sanguinis, et Sodomorum,<br>
    vox oppressorum, viduae, pretium famulorum.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><A NAME="31"></A>31.&nbsp;<sup>29</sup> II Peter 2. 6.</p>
<p><A NAME="32"></A>32.&nbsp;<sup>30</sup> Another instance of details added
without scriptural authority: in fact the instances of leprosy and death among
the Israelites during the march seem directly contradictory to Salvian's
statements.</p>
<p><A NAME="33"></A>33.&nbsp;<sup>31</sup> Again an addition not justified by
the words of the Old Testament. Salvian, in common with other early Christian
writers, not infrequently names Christ when we should expect the name of God
instead. And the &quot;throngs of people&quot; were expressly excluded from
familiar intercourse with God; cf. Exodus 19. 21-24; 24. 1-2.</p>
<p><A NAME="34"></A>34.&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp; Exodus 19. 9.</p>
<p><A NAME="35"></A>35.&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp; <i>Ibid. </i>19. 16.&nbsp;</p>
<p><A NAME="36"></A>36.&nbsp;<sup>34</sup><i> Ibid. </i>19.20.&nbsp;</p>
<p><A NAME="37"></A>37.&nbsp;<sup>35</sup> <i>Ibid. </i>33. 9-11.</p>
<p><A NAME="38"></A>38.&nbsp;<sup>36</sup> Publilius Syrus, verse 28. Salvian's
text here is influenced by Seneca <i>De ira </i>3. 31. 1.</p>
<p><A NAME="39"></A>39.&nbsp;<sup>37</sup> Rittershausen, <i>ad loc, </i>cites
the proverb: <i>Superflua non nocent. </i>The phrasing suggests a legal
connotation, in connection with which he cites Paulus and Ulpian on the value of
more than the required number of witnesses to a will, or more written evidence
than is actually needed to prove a case.</p>
<p><A NAME="40"></A>40.&nbsp;<sup>38</sup> Exodus 32. 35.</p>
<p><A NAME="41"></A>41.&nbsp;<sup>39</sup> Leviticus 24.10-14.</p>
<p><A NAME="42"></A>42.&nbsp;<sup>40</sup> <i>Ibid. </i>10.1-2.</p>
<p><A NAME="43"></A>43.&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;Numbers 12. 8-15, condensed.
Note that Salvian uses the name Mary for the Biblical Miriam.</p>
<p><A NAME="44"></A>44.&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;Psalms 78. 30-31.</p>
<p><A NAME="45"></A>45.&nbsp;<sup>43</sup> <i>Ibid. </i>106.17.&nbsp;</p>
<p><A NAME="46"></A>46.&nbsp;<sup>44</sup> Numbers 16. 3, 35.&nbsp;</p>
<p><A NAME="47"></A>47.&nbsp;<sup>45</sup> <i>Ibid.</i> 16.41.</p>
<p><A NAME="48"></A>48.&nbsp; <sup>46</sup> <i>Ibid. </i>14. 26-29, 31-32, 37.</p>
