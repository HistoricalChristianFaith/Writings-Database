<p align="center"><b>Salvian, On the Government of God (1930) Preface to the
online edition</b></p>
<hr>

<p>Salvian of Marseilles wrote a number of works, many now lost.&nbsp; The
following survive: <i>De gubernatione dei</i> (On the government of God); <i>Ad
ecclesiam</i> (To the church, on greed); and nine letters.</p>
 
<p>The translation following of <i>On the Government of God</i> was published in
1930.&nbsp; A search of copyright records reveals that the copyright was not
renewed after 28 years, and so the translation is in the public domain in the
USA.</p>
 
<p>A public domain translation exists of <i>Ad ecclesiam</i>: &quot;Quis diues saluus. = How a rich man may be saued. Written to the    Catholike Church, by Saluianus priest, afterwards Bishop of Massilia in    France, about the yeare of Christ 480. With annotations out of the Holy    Fathers. Translated into English by N.T&quot;
-- translated by Joseph Creswell, printed at the English College Press at
Saint-Omer in 1618.&nbsp; A reprint was made in 1973, ISBN 0859671429, in the
series &quot;English recusant literature, 1558-1640 ; vol. 170&quot;.&nbsp;
However the text is incomplete, as the text to fill various lacunae, including a
missing prologue, were only discovered in the 20th century.</p>
 
<p>No public domain translation of the letters seems to exist.</p>
 
<p>The most recent English translation, which includes all the works, was made
by Jeremiah F. O'Sullivan, <i>The writings of Salvian, the presbyter</i>, in the
<i>Fathers of the Church</i> series (vol. 3), and published by the Catholic
University of America Press in 1947, reprint 1978 (ISBN 0813200032), and is
available from Amazon.com.</p>
 
<p><u>Manuscripts of <i>De gubernatione dei</i></u></p> 
 
<p>When Salvian wrote, his work was disseminated by hand-written copies; and
further copies made from those copies, and so on, down the years.&nbsp; The
oldest copies available to us are three medieval copies-of-copies-of-copies.</p>

    <td valign="top" class="thintableborder">BNF lat. 13385.&nbsp; &nbsp;This
      manuscript comes from the abbey of St. Peter at Corbie, in North
      France.&nbsp; It is no doubt the copy which is listed in the <a href="https://www.tertullian.org/manuscripts/corbie.htm">catalogues
      of the 11th century</a>.&nbsp; During the wars of the 17th century, it was
      removed with other Corbie Mss. to the new headquarters of the Benedictine
      order, the abbey at Saint-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s in Paris. At the revolution
      their property was seized, and the manuscripts passed into the
      Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale.
      <p>The manuscript contains 69 folios of parchment, each 245 x 225 mm in
      size.&nbsp; A much later paper leaf precedes these, indicating the author,
      the supposed title (<i>De Prouidentia</i>), the origin (<i>Corbiensis
      monasterii</i>), and the shelf mark (<i>Sti Germani a Pratis, n. 776, olim
      248</i>).&nbsp; The 69 leaves are in 9 quires of 8 leaves, so 3 folios are
      lacking -- one at the front and two at the end.&nbsp; The text thus
      commences in the middle of the preface.&nbsp; There are 23 lines per
      page.&nbsp; There are two sets of corrections in the manuscript, of the
      same date as the script, both correcting the text against the original
      copy.</p>

      gubernatione</i>, code 10628).&nbsp; The codex contains a great many other
      works, including poetry and works by Paulinus of Nola.
      <p>It is unclear where the codex was written.&nbsp; L. Traube suggested
      the <i>scriptorium</i> of St.Eucher of Treves, but did not convince
      others.&nbsp; It was discovered somewhere by Nicholas of Cues (Cusanus) in
      the 15th century, and all the renaissance copies were made directly or
      indirectly from it.&nbsp; On Cusanus' death, his library went to a
      charitable foundation in his home town, Bernkastel-Kues, where it still
      is.&nbsp; However B is found some time later in the hands of the
      Bollandists at Anvers, from whom it passed into the library of the Dukes
      of Bourgogne.&nbsp; The French revolutionaries conquered Belgium, and B
      then briefly entered the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale in Paris; but it returned
      to Belgium in 1815, and entered the Royal library in Brussells where it
      still is.</p>
      <p>The parchment leaves are 272 x 185 mm, and contain up to 70
      lines.&nbsp; The scribe appears to have tried to cram as much writing on
      the pages as possible, and for this reason some works in this codex have
      still not been edited scientifically.&nbsp; The text of <i>De gubernatione</i>
      is found on ff. 22-35, and is thankfully clearly legible.&nbsp; Two
      different hands have corrected the manuscript.&nbsp; The <i>incipit</i>
      reads: <i>In hoc codice continentur sancti Saluiani epi</i>[<i>scopi</i>] <i>libri
      numero octo dati ad sanctum Salonium episcopum.&nbsp; De gubernatione
      dei.&nbsp; Incipit liber primus sancto episcopo</i> [<i>salonio</i> added
      in margin by corrector B2] <i>Saluianus in domino episcopus salutem.&nbsp;
      Omnes admodum...</i> etc.&nbsp; Then after the preface and before book 1
      is a marker inviting us to look at the head of the page where it reads: <i>De
      iusto dei p</i>[<i>rae</i>]<i>sentique iudicio incipiunt dialogi
      disputantis</i>. (In Mss. A and C this text is at the end of the preface).</td>

      was written at the abbey at Clairvaux: there are two <i>ex libris</i> (on
      folio 1v and 194v) of the 12th century (<i>liber sante Marie
      Clareuallensis</i>), and of the 14th century (<i>liber sante Marie
      Clareuallis</i>).&nbsp; There are also some ancient shelfmarks of the
      abbey: B 43 (f. 1v, in a hand of the end of the 14th century), E 31 (f.1v,
      15th century) and E 13 (f.1v, f.193v, and inside of the end-board).&nbsp;
      This last reflects the catalogue of Pierre de Viery, made in
      1472.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <p>The manuscript contains three independent parts, which were put
      together in one manuscript in the middle ages, and are of different page
      sizes.&nbsp; The first (ff. 1-81, 220 x 132 mm, 10 quaternions and fol.81
      in quires of 8, 29 lines per page) contains <i>De gubernatione</i>.&nbsp;
      The second (ff. 82-121, 218x140mm, 27 lines per page) contains <i>Epistula
      VII</i> of Ferrandus of Carthage, <i>Ad Reginum Comitem</i> (PL 67, col.
      928-950), followed by 6 unpublished verses attributed to the same author,
      and Vigilius of Thapsus, <i>Dialogus contra Arianos</i> (PL 62, col.
      155-180), although the name of the author is not given in the
      manuscript.&nbsp; The third part (ff. 122-194, 220 x 135/140mm, 8
      quaternions and 1 quinion, of which the last leaf is missing, 27 lines per
      page) contains Victorinus of Pettau, <i>Commentarii in Apocalypsim
      (recensio Hieronymi) </i>(this is MS. 'C' in CSEL 49), and Angelome de
      Luxeuil, <i>Ennarationes in Cantica Canticorum</i> (PL 115, col. 551-628).</p>
      <p>The manuscript of <i>De gubernatione </i>was made by a careful, skilled
      scribe, who avoided the crass errors of many medieval scribes.&nbsp; Two
      contemporary corrector hands are visible, who use the original exemplar to
      make corrections.&nbsp; The <i>Incipit</i> is the same as in B, (<i>In hoc
      codice...Omnes admodum</i>) except that <i>prefatio</i> replaces the
      mistaken <i>liber primus</i> in B.</td>

<p>B became known first; A is a better manuscript; C is of the same family as B,
but not descended from it.&nbsp; A common ancestor must have existed in late
antiquity, from which two copies descended.&nbsp; The first of these is the
ancestor of A; the other of B and C.</p>

<p>A number of more recent manuscripts exist, all derived from B.</p>

<p>All the recentiores are descended from P, itself copied from B.&nbsp; M, K, F
and V and a are direct copies of P; U and W are copied from F (the Florence
group); V' is copied from V, T from V', T' from T.</p>

<p>The first printed edition appeared at Basle from Froben in 1530, edited by J.
A. Brassicanus, using W as his source.&nbsp; Unfortunately some of the pasges in
books VII and VIII were in a strange order.&nbsp; This was fixed in the 1564
edition by P. Galesini, who otherwise copied Brassicanus.&nbsp; The first
edition of all the works of Salvian appeared in Paris in 1580, edited by Pierre
Pithou, who used T and T' to correct the text of Brassicanus.&nbsp; Many
reprints then occurred, among them that of Conrad Rittershausen (Altdorf, 1611),
with an abundant commentary.&nbsp; Etienne Baluze did an edition in Paris in
1663, in which he made use of A, and based his edition on it, comparing it
against the text of Pithou.&nbsp; A second edition with further notes appeared
in 1669; a definitive third edition, often reprinted, in 1684.&nbsp; The
Patrologia Latina text (Migne, t. 53, col. 26-158, Paris, 1865) is a reprint of
Baluze's 3rd edition.&nbsp; G. Halm for the MGH (Berlin 1877) collated A and T,
with a collation of B; F. Pauly, in the CSEL 8 edition (Vienna, 1883) recollated
A, T, T', W, and made some use of B.</p>
