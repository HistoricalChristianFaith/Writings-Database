<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>1.</SPAN>&nbsp;I think, nay, I am
certain, that the great length of my argument will arouse distaste in many,
especially since it upbraids our vicious lives. For most men wish praise, and no
one enjoys censure. Worse than this, however evil a man is, however profligate,
he would rather be falsely praised than rightly reproved, and prefers to be
deceived by the mockery of false praise than healed by the most salutary
admonitions. Since this is true, what are we to do? Must we accede to the will
of wicked men? Or if they wish even empty praise conferred on them, is it
fitting to proffer silly and meaningless eulogies? Surely we must consider that,
as men of honor should not mock even those who wish to make themselves
ridiculous, so they should not laud in lying phrases those who yearn to be
adorned by praise, however false.<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> We must not take
into account the preferences of individuals, but rather what is fitting for us
to say, especially since the prophet said: &quot;Woe unto them that put bitter
for sweet and sweet for bitter.&quot; <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A></p>
<p>We must by every means hold fast to the truth, so that what a thing is in
fact, it may also be in words, and those that contain sweetness be called sweet,
and those that contain bitterness, bitter. This is the more obligatory in the
present discussion of a sacred matter, when our iniquities are made by many a
cause of wrath against God, and men try to avoid seeming themselves worthy of <A NAME="p225"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|225</SPAN></A>
accusation by first accusing him. When they blasphemously call him careless and
neglectful of human affairs, and say that he does not govern according to
justice, or even that he does not govern at all, what else are they doing but
accusing God of laziness and abuse and injustice? Alas for the blindness of
human folly! for the madness of insane audacity! It is God, O man, that you call
careless and neglectful. If you injured any freeborn man with such slanders, you
would be accused at law of malicious abuse; if you so attacked any illustrious
or eminent man you would be sentenced in the courts. Such slanders are chiefly
hurled at prodigal wards; it is the special byword for profligate youths, to
call them wastrels and careless and negligent about their property. What
sacrilegious words! what profane impudence! We use such terms of God as we would
not employ of any men except those of the most abandoned sort. Yet this is not
all the abuse given him: as I said before, men even brand him as unjust. If we
claim that we do not deserve our sufferings and are unworthy to endure our
present misfortunes, surely we are calling God, who bids us endure undeserved
evils, unjust. You say, however, that he does not bid, but merely permits us to
endure them. Suppose we grant this point, still I ask how far he is from
ordering what he permits? For he who knows we endure such woes and can prevent
our suffering them, proves beyond a doubt that we ought to endure whatever he
permits. From this it is manifest that his acquiescence is part of his judgment,
and that we are enduring a sentence from heaven. As all things, are subject to
sacred authority and the will of God rules everything, whatever evils and
whatever punishments we bear daily are the censure of his divine hand, which
censure, indeed, we constantly arouse and kindle by our sins. We kindle the fire
of the celestial wrath and arouse the flames by which we are burned, so that the
words of the prophet may rightly be used against us as often as we endure such
ills: &quot;Make your way into the flames of the fire that you have <A NAME="p226"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|226</SPAN></A>
kindled.'' <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> From this we see that according to the
sacred sentence each sinner is preparing for himself the suffering that he
endures. None of our misfortunes can be imputed to God; we are the authors of
our own misery. For God is gracious and merciful and, as the Scripture says, he
wishes no one to perish or be injured. So whatever is done against us is done by
our own actions;<i> </i>there is nothing more cruel to us than ourselves; we, I
say, are torturing ourselves even against God's will.</p>
<p>But, forsooth, I seem to be contradicting myself; whereas I said before that
we are punished by God on account of our sins, now I say that we are punishing
ourselves. Both are true; we are indeed punished by God, but we ourselves force
him to punish us. Inasmuch as we cause our own punishment, who can doubt that we
are chastising ourselves by our crimes? For whoever gives cause for his
punishment chastises himself, according to the saying: &quot;Every one is bound
by the chains of his sins.&quot; <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> If wicked men are
bound by the chains of their sins, every sinner doubtless binds himself when he
sins.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>2.</SPAN>&nbsp;Since I have already
spoken at length of the unchastity of Africa, let me now briefly discuss its
blasphemies, for the paganism of the majority has had no interruption. They have
indeed confined within their own walls their native crime, by which of course I
mean that &quot;Celestial&quot; demon of the Africans,<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
to which I suppose the pagans of old gave so fair-sounding a title in order that
having no divinity it should at least have a name, and lacking any virtue
derived from actual power should gain honor from its designation. Who among them
has not been initiated into the worship of that idol? Who has not been dedicated
to it by his very family and birth? I am not speaking now of men who are pagans
as much by profession and name as in their way of life, and whose name <A NAME="p227"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|227</SPAN></A>
indicates their heathen error. Paganism is certainly more tolerable and less
evil in men avowedly pagan; the more deadly peril lies in the fact that many who
have made their vows to Christ continue to give their real devotion to idols.
For did not those who were called Christians turn from the worship of Christ to
that of the &quot;Celestial deity,&quot; or ---- which is far worse ---- worship
her even before they paid their devotions to him? Who among them did not cross
the Lord's threshold redolent of the odor of demoniacal sacrifices and go up to
the altar of Christ reeking with the foulness of very demons, so that it would
be less monstrous not to come at all to the Lord's temple than to come in such a
fashion? For a Christian who does not come to church is guilty of neglect, but
one who comes in such a way is guilty of sacrilege. It is less difficult to
atone for failure to honor God than for direct insult to him. So we see that any
who have acted thus have not given honor to God, but have taken it away from
him. They have even in a way given the attention due to the church of God to an
idol, because that to which priority is accorded gains in honor from that which
is relegated to second place. See then the faith of the Africans, and especially
of the noblest among them! See what their religion and their Christianity have
been! It was in scorn of Christ that men called them Christians. Though the
apostle cries: &quot;Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils;
ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of devils,&quot; <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
it was not enough for them to drink the cup of the Lord with the cup of devils,
but they must take the latter first. It was not enough for them to match the
table of devils with the Lord's table, unless they came to the temple of God
fresh from the worship of infamous superstitions and breathed on the holy altars
of Christ the foul miasma of the diabolical spirit itself.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>3.</SPAN>&nbsp;But, you say, they do
not all do these things ---- only the highest and most powerful are guilty of
these wrongs. Suppose <A NAME="p228"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|228</SPAN></A> I agree to
this. Still, since the greater part of a city is made up of the richest and most
powerful households, you see that the whole city was polluted by the
sacrilegious superstition of a few great men. No one indeed can doubt that all
the households are either like the masters who rule them, or worse, and usually
worse! Therefore, since even good masters as a general rule have bad slaves, it
is easy to decide what sort of households all of these were, in which servile
minds, already disposed to evil, were made more vicious by the wickedness of
their masters.</p>
<p>Suppose for the sake of the argument that what we said was true only of all
the most powerful and noble. Were the vices that were common to noble and
ignoble alike less serious? I mean the hatred and abuse of all holy men, for
surely it is a sort of sacrilege to hate those who worship God. Just as the man
who injures our slaves thereby harms us, and the man who flogs another's sons
tortures the father's affection by his children's suffering, so anyone who
injures a servant of God violates the divine majesty, as the Lord said to his
apostle: &quot;He that receiveth you, receiveth me, and he that despiseth you,
despiseth me.'' <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> Our most gracious and loving Lord
shared his honor and disgrace alike with his servants, to the end that no one
who injured a servant of God should think that the man alone was hurt by his
action, since injury to God would undoubtedly be mingled with the harm inflicted
on his followers. Of this God gave us proof, according to his most indulgent
love, in these words: &quot;For he that toucheth you toucheth the pupil of my
eye.'' <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> To express the tenderness of his love he
used the most tender part of the body, that we might clearly understand that God
is injured by a contempt of his saints as slight as the touch required to injure
the eyesight. So the people of Africa injured and hated the servants of God and
God himself in them.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>4.</SPAN>&nbsp;But perhaps the
question will be asked: &quot;In what ways was <A NAME="p229"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|229</SPAN></A>
their hatred manifested?'' In the same manner, of course, in which also the
Jews' hatred of Christ was declared when they said to him: ''Thou art a
Samaritan and hast a devil,'' <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> when they mocked and
cursed him, when they breathed into his face and gnashed their teeth over his
head. Whence also the Savior himself says in the Psalms: &quot;All they that saw
me laughed me to scorn; they shot out their lips and shook their heads.'' <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
And elsewhere he says: &quot;They have tempted me and laughed me to scorn, they
gnashed upon me with their teeth.&quot; <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> So is
the hatred of the Africans for the monks ---- that is, for the servants of God
---- proved, because they mocked at and cursed them, because they attacked and
execrated them, because they did practically everything against them that the
wickedness of the Jews contrived against our Savior before they actually shed
his divine blood. But they, you say, did not kill the saints, while we read that
the Jews did.</p>
<p>Whether they killed or not, I do not know; I make no claims of that, but yet
how great a defence is it that the only element of pagan persecution lacking was
the very end of persecution? Let us assume that the saints were not killed
there; what then shall we make of the fact that they are not far from killing
who hate with the desire to kill, especially as the Lord himself says:
''Whosoever hateth his brother without a cause is a murderer?&quot; <A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A></p>
<p>Yet it was not without cause that they persecuted the servants of God. For
who can say that it was without a cause, seeing that these men differed from
them in all the characteristics of their life and habits, that in them they saw
nothing that was theirs, since all was God's? The greatest cause of discord is
diversity of interests, because it is nearly or quite impossible that a man
should love in another that with which he himself is at variance. So it was <A NAME="p230"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|230</SPAN></A>
not without cause, as I said, that they hated those in whom they saw everything
hostile and inimical to them. For they lived in constant wickedness, but the
saints in constant innocence; they lived in lust, these in chastity; they in
evil dens, these in monasteries; they almost constantly with the devil, and
these incessantly with Christ. It was not without cause that within the cities
of Africa, and especially within the walls of Carthage, a people as unhappy as
they were unfaithful could scarcely look without reviling and curses at a man
pale and in monkish garb, his flowing locks cut even to the shaved skin. And if
ever any servant of God from the monasteries of Egypt or the sacred places of
Jerusalem or the holy and venerable retreats of the desert came to that city in
performance of his sacred mission, as soon as he appeared to the people, he met
with contumely, sacrilege and curses. Nor was this all, he was flayed by the
vile derision of dissolute men and hissing mockery of the coarsest sort; so that
if any man uninformed of these things witnessed the scene, he would not think
that a man was being mocked, but that some strange and unheard-of monster was
being expelled from the city.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>5.</SPAN>&nbsp;Consider the faith of
the Africans and especially the people of Carthage. It was safer for the
apostles of old to enter the cities of the pagans, and those wild and barbarous
assemblies had less hatred of their arrival and presence. The holy vessel of
election, Paul the apostle, spoke of the worship and majesty of one God, and the
people of the Athenians, most superstitious though they were, heard him
patiently.<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> The Lycaonians also so marvelled at
the apostles that, seeing their divine strength, they thought they were not men.<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
But in Carthage the servants of God were scarcely allowed to appear in the
streets and public squares without mockery and cursing. Certain men think that
this was not persecution <A NAME="p231"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|231</SPAN></A> because
they were not actually killed. You know that brigands have a proverb that those
they spare owe their lives to them.<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> But in
Carthage this benefit was due less to the men than to the laws, for the laws of
the Twelve Tables forbade a man to be put to death without a trial. Hence we see
that the power of the Lord's religion was indeed great in a place where his
servants were only permitted to escape death at the hands of Christians because
they were defended by pagan law. Yet we wonder that such Christians are now
suffering at the hands of the barbarians, when they themselves inflicted
barbarous treatment on the saints.</p>
<p>So God is just and his judgments are righteous, for, as the Scripture says:
&quot;What men have sowed, that shall they also reap.&quot; <A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
God seems to have referred to the wickedness of the people of Africa, when he
said: &quot;Recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath
done do unto her; for she hath been proud against the Lord.&quot; <A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
Let us <A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> then be surprised and angry that they now
endure some few trials at the hands of men! Their conduct toward God has been
far worse than any treatment they have received, especially if one compares
their sufferings and their misdeeds with due consideration of the distinction
between the persons concerned.<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> <A NAME="p232"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|232</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
