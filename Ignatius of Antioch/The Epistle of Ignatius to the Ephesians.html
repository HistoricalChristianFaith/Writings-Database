</UL><P>As to my fellow-servant Burrhus, your deacon in regard to God and blessed in all things,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1128_210267">17</A></SUP> I beg that he may continue longer, both for your honour and that of your bishop. And Crocus also, worthy both of God and you, whom I have received as the manifestation<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1129_210503">18</A></SUP> of your love, hath in all things refreshed<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1130_210573">19</A></SUP> me, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ shall also refresh<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1131_210667">20</A></SUP> him; together with Onesimus, and Burrhus, and Euplus, and Fronto, by means of whom, I have, as to love, beheld all of you. May I always have joy of you, if indeed I be worthy of it. It is therefore befitting that you should in every way glorify Jesus Christ, who hath glorified you, that by a unanimous obedience "ye may be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment, and may all speak the same thing concerning the same thing,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1132_211147">21</A></SUP> and that, being subject to the bishop and the presbytery, ye may in all respects be sanctified.</P>

<P>As to our fellow-servant Burrhus, your deacon in regard to God and blessed in all things, I pray that he may continue blameless for the honour of the Church, and of your most blessed bishop. Crocus also, worthy both of God and you, whom we have received as the manifestation<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1134_211536">22</A></SUP> of your love to us, hath in all things refreshed<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1135_211612">23</A></SUP> me, and "hath not been ashamed of my chain,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1136_211689">24</A></SUP> as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ will also refresh<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1137_211771">25</A></SUP> him; together with Onesimus, and Burrhus, and Euplus, and Fronto, by means of whom I have, as to love, beheld all of you.

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter III.-Exhortations to Unity.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>I do not issue orders to you, as if I were some great person. For though I am bound for the name [of Christ], I am not yet perfect in Jesus Christ. For now I begin to be a disciple, and I speak to you as fellow-disciples with me. For it was needful for me to have been stirred up by you in faith, exhortation, patience, and long-suffering. But inasmuch as love suffers me not to be silent in regard to you, I have therefore taken<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1144_212835">27</A></SUP> upon me first to exhort you that ye would all run together in accordance with the will of God. For even Jesus Christ, our inseparable life, is the [manifested] will of the Father; as also bishops, settled everywhere to the utmost bounds [of the earth], are so by the will of Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>I do not issue orders to you, as if I were some great person. For though I am bound for His name, I am not yet perfect in Jesus Christ. For now I begin to be a disciple, and I speak to you as my fellow-servants. For it was needful for me to have been admonished by you in faith, exhortation, patience, and long-suffering. But inasmuch as love suffers me not to be silent in regard to you, I have therefore taken<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1146_213560">28</A></SUP> upon me first to exhort you that ye would run together in accordance with the will of God. For even Jesus Christ does all things according to the will of the Father, as He Himself declares in a certain place, "I do always those things that please Him."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1147_213838">29</A></SUP> Wherefore it behoves us also to live according to the will of God in Christ, and to imitate Him as Paul did. For, says he, "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1148_214035">30</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P1151_214053"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter IV.-The Same Continued.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Wherefore it is fitting that ye should run together in accordance with the will of your bishop, which thing also ye do. For your justly renowned presbytery, worthy of God, is fitted as exactly to the bishop as the strings are to the harp. Therefore in your concord and harmonious love, Jesus Christ is sung. And do ye, man by man, become a choir, that being harmonious in love, and taking up the song of God in unison, ye may with one voice sing to the Father through Jesus Christ, so that He may both hear you, and perceive by your works that ye are indeed the members of His Son. It is profitable, therefore, that you should live in an unblameable unity, that thus ye may always enjoy communion with God.</P>

<P>Wherefore it is fitting that ye also should run together in accordance with the will of the bishop who by God's appointment<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1155_214915">31</A></SUP> rules over you. Which thing ye indeed of yourselves do, being instructed by the Spirit. For your justly-renowned presbytery, being worthy of God, is fitted as exactly to the bishop as the strings are to the harp. Thus, being joined together in concord and harmonious love, of which Jesus Christ is the Captain and Guardian, do ye, man by man, become but one choir; so that, agreeing together in concord, and obtaining<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1156_215370">32</A></SUP> a perfect unity with God, ye may indeed be one in harmonious feeling with God the Father, and His beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord. For, says He, "Grant unto them, Holy Father, that as I and Thou are one, they also may be one in us."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1157_215660">33</A></SUP> It is therefore profitable that you, being joined together with God in an unblameable unity, should be the followers of the example of Christ, of whom also ye are members.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P1162_215854"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter V.-The Praise of Unity.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>For if I in this brief space of time, have enjoyed such fellowship with your bishop-I mean not of a mere human, but of a spiritual nature-how much more do I reckon you happy who are so joined to him as the Church is to Jesus Christ, and as Jesus Christ is to the Father, that so all things may agree in unity! Let no man deceive himself: if any one be not within the altar, he is deprived of the bread of God. For if the prayer of one or two possesses<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1165_216338">34</A></SUP> such power, how much more that of the bishop and the whole Church! He, therefore, that does not assemble with the Church, has even<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1166_216491">35</A></SUP> by this manifested his pride, and condemned himself. For it is written, "God resisteth the proud."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1167_216610">36</A></SUP> Let us be careful, then, not to set ourselves in opposition to the bishop, in order that we may be subject to God.</P>

<P>For if I, in this brief space of time, have enjoyed such fellowship with your bishop-I mean not of a mere human, but of a spiritual nature-how much more do I reckon you happy, who so depend<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1169_216960">37</A></SUP> on him as the Church does on the Lord Jesus, and the Lord does on God and His Father, that so all things may agree in unity! Let no man deceive himself: if any one be not within the altar, he is deprived of the bread of God. For if the prayer of one or two possesses<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1170_217260">38</A></SUP> such power that Christ stands in the midst of them, how much more will the prayer of the bishop and of the whole Church, ascending up in harmony to God, prevail for the granting of all their petitions in Christ! He, therefore, that separates himself from such, and does not meet in the society where sacrifices<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1171_217593">39</A></SUP> are offered, and with "the Church of the first-born whose names are written in heaven," is a wolf in sheep's clothing,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1172_217761">40</A></SUP> while he presents a mild outward appearance. Do ye, beloved, be careful to be subject to the bishop, and the presbyters and the deacons. For he that is subject to these is obedient to Christ, who has appointed them; but he that is disobedient to these is disobedient to Christ Jesus. And "he that obeyeth not<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1173_218090">41</A></SUP> the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him." For he that yields not obedience to his superiors is self-confident, quarrelsome, and proud. But" God," says [the Scripture] "resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble ; "<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1174_218379">42</A></SUP> and, "The proud have greatly transgressed." The Lord also says to the priests, "He that heareth you, heareth Me; and he that heareth Me, heareth the Father that sent Me. He that despiseth you, despiseth Me; and he that despiseth Me, despiseth Him that sent Me."</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VI.-Have Respect to the Bishop as to Christ Himself.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Now the more any one sees the bishop keeping silence,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1180_218800">43</A></SUP> the more ought he to revere him. For we ought to receive every one whom the Master of the house sends to be over His household,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1181_218965">44</A></SUP> as we would do Him that sent him. It is manifest, therefore, that we should look upon the bishop even as we would upon the Lord Himself. And indeed Onesimus himself greatly commends your good order in God, that ye all live according to the truth, and that no sect<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1182_219257">45</A></SUP> has any dwelling-place among you. Nor, indeed, do ye hearken to any one rather than to Jesus Christ speaking in truth.</P>

<P>The more, therefore, you see the bishop silent, the more do you reverence him. For we ought to receive every one whom the Master of the house sends to be over His household,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1184_219568">46</A></SUP> as we would do Him that sent him. It is manifest, therefore, that we should look upon the bishop even as we would look upon the Lord Himself, standing, as he does, before the Lord. For "it behoves the man who looks carefully about him, and is active in his business, to stand before kings, and not to stand before slothful men."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1185_219925">47</A></SUP> And indeed Onesimus himself greatly commends your good order in God, that ye all live according to the truth, and that no sect `has any dwelling-place among you. Nor indeed do ye hearken to any one rather than to Jesus Christ, the true Shepherd and Teacher. And ye are, as Paul wrote to you, "one body and one spirit, because ye have also been called in one hope of the faith.<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1186_220334">48</A></SUP> Since also "there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1187_220480">49</A></SUP> Such, then, are ye, having been taught by such instructors, Paul the Christ-bearer, and Timothy the most faithful.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P1192_220613"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VII.-Beware of False Teachers.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>For some are in the habit of carrying about the name [of Jesus Christ] in wicked guile, while yet they practise things unworthy of God, whom ye must flee as ye would wild beasts. For they are ravening dogs, who bite secretly, against whom ye must be on your guard, inasmuch as they are men who can scarcely be cured. There is one Physician who is possessed both of flesh and spirit; both made and not made; God existing in flesh; true life in death; both of Mary and of God; first possible and then impossible,-<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1195_221164">50</A></SUP> even Jesus Christ our Lord.</P>

<P>But some most worthless persons are in the habit of carrying about the name [of Jesus Christ] in wicked guile, while yet they practise things unworthy of God, and hold opinions contrary to the doctrine of Christ, to their own destruction, and that of those who give credit to them, whom you must avoid as ye would wild beasts. For "the righteous man who avoids them is saved for ever; but the destruction of the ungodly is sudden, and a subject of rejoicing."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1197_221747">51</A></SUP> For "they are dumb dogs, that cannot bark,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1198_221816">52</A></SUP> raving mad, and biting secretly, against whom ye must be on your guard, since they labour under an incurable disease. But our Physician is the only true God, the unbegotten and unapproachable, the Lord of all, the Father and Begetter of the only-begotten Son. We have also as a Physician the Lord our God, Jesus the Christ, the only-begotten Son and Word, before time began,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn11.htm#P1199_222209">53</A></SUP> but who afterwards became also man, of Mary the virgin. For "the Word was made flesh."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn12.htm#P1200_222324">54</A></SUP> Being incorporeal, He was in the body; being impassible, He was in a passible body; being immortal, He was in a mortal body; being life, He became subject to corruption, that He might free our souls from death and corruption, and heal them, and might restore them to health, when they were diseased with ungodliness and wicked lusts.</P>

</UL><P>Let not then any one deceive you, as indeed ye are not deceived, inasmuch as ye are wholly devoted to God. For since there is no strife raging among you which might distress you, ye are certainly living in accordance with God's will. I am far inferior to you, and require to be sanctified by your Church of Ephesus, so renowned throughout the world. They that are carnal cannot do those things which are spiritual, nor they that are spiritual the things which are carnal; even as faith cannot do the works of unbelief, nor unbelief the works of faith.

<P>Let not then any one deceive you, as indeed ye are not deceived; for ye are wholly devoted to God.

</UL><P>Nevertheless, I have heard of some who have passed on from this to you, having false doctrine, whom ye did not suffer to sow among you, but stopped your ears, that ye might not receive those things which were sown by them, as being stones<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn12.htm#P1217_224636">58</A></SUP> of the temple of the Father, prepared for the building of God the Father, and drawn up on high by the instrument of Jesus Christ, which is the cross,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn12.htm#P1218_224811">59</A></SUP> making use of the Holy Spirit as a rope, while your faith was the means by which you ascended, and your love the way which led up to God. Ye, therefore, as well as all your fellow-travellers, are God-bearers, temple-bearers, Christ-bearers, bearers of holiness, adorned in all respects with the commandments of Jesus Christ, in whom also I exult that I have been thought worthy, by means of this Epistle, to converse and rejoice with you, because with respect to your Christian life<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn12.htm#P1219_225319">60</A></SUP> ye love nothing but God only.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, I have heard of some who have passed in among you, holding the wicked doctrine of the strange and evil spirit; to whom ye did not allow entrance to sow their tares, but stopped your ears that ye might not receive that error which was proclaimed by them, as being persuaded that that spirit which deceives the people does not speak the things of Christ, but his own, for he is a lying spirit. But the Holy Spirit does not speak His own things, but those of Christ, and that not from himself, but from the Lord; even as the Lord also announced to us the things that He received from the Father. For, says He, "the word which ye hear is not Mine, but the Father's, who sent Me."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn12.htm#P1221_226085">61</A></SUP> And says He of the Holy Spirit, "He shall not speak of Himself, but whatsoever things He shall hear from Me."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn12.htm#P1222_226214">62</A></SUP> And He says of Himself to the Father, "I have," says He, "glorified Thee upon the earth ; I have finished the work which, Thou gavest Me; I have manifested Thy name to men."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn12.htm#P1223_226407">63</A></SUP> And of the Holy Ghost, "He shall glorify Me, for He receives of Mine."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn12.htm#P1224_226500">64</A></SUP> But the spirit of deceit preaches himself, and speaks his own things, for he seeks to please himself. He glorifies himself, for he is full of arrogance. He is lying, fraudulent, soothing, flattering, treacherous, rhapsodical, trifling, inharmonious, verbose, sordid, and timorous. From his power Jesus Christ will deliver you, who has founded you upon the rock, as being chosen stones, well fitted for the divine edifice of the Father, and who are raised up on high by Christ, who was crucified for you, making use of the Holy Spirit as a rope, and being borne up by faith, while exalted by love from earth to heaven, walking in company with those that are undefiled. For, says [the Scripture], "Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn12.htm#P1225_227287">65</A></SUP> Now the way is unerring, namely, Jesus Christ. For, says He, "I am the way and the life."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn12.htm#P1226_227395">66</A></SUP> And this way leads to the Father. For "no man," says He, "cometh to the Father but by Me."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn12.htm#P1227_227504">67</A></SUP> Blessed, then, are ye who are God-bearers, spirit-bearers, temple-bearers, bearers of holiness, adorned in all respects with the commandments of Jesus Christ, being "a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn12.htm#P1228_227743">68</A></SUP> on whose account I rejoice exceedingly, and have had the privilege, by this Epistle, of conversing with "the saints which are at Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus."<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn12.htm#P1229_227931">69</A></SUP> I rejoice, therefore, over you, that ye do not give heed to vanity, and love nothing according to the flesh, but according to God.</P>

Especially [will I do this<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn13.htm#P1374_246390">139</A></SUP> ] if the Lord make known to me that ye come together man by man in common through grace, individually,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn13.htm#P1375_246547">140</A></SUP> in one faith, and in Jesus Christ, who was of the seed of David according to the flesh, being both the Son of man and the Son of God, so that ye obey the bishop and the presbytery with an undivided mind, breaking one and the same bread, which is the medicine of immortality, and the antidote to prevent us from dying, but [which causes] that we should live for ever in Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>Stand fast, brethren, in the faith of Jesus Christ, and in His love, in His passion, and in His resurrection. Do ye all come together in common, and individually,<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn13.htm#P1377_247121">141</A></SUP> through grace, in one faith of God the Father, and of Jesus Christ His only-begotten Son, and "the first-born of every creature,"<SUP><A HREF="footnote/fn13.htm#P1378_247280">142</A></SUP> but of the seed of David according to the flesh, being under the guidance of the Comforter, in obedience to the bishop and the presbytery with an undivided mind, breaking one and the same bread, which is the medicine of immortality, and the antidote which prevents us from dying, but a cleansing remedy driving away evil, [which causes] that we should live in God through Jesus Christ.</P>
