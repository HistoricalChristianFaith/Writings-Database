For who would not rejoice to behold and to address her who bore the true God from her<SUP><A HREF="#P3044_494883">3</A></SUP> own womb, provided he is a friend of our faith and religion? And in like manner [I desire to see] the venerable James, who is surnamed Just, whom they relate to be very like Christ Jesus in appearance,<SUP><A HREF="#P3045_495208">4</A></SUP> in life, and in method of conduct, as if he were a twin-brother of the same womb. They say that, if I see him, I see also Jesus Himself, as to all the features and aspect of His body. Moreover, [I desire to see] the other saints, both male and female. Alas! why do I delay? Why am I kept back? Kind<SUP><A HREF="#P3046_495542">5</A></SUP> teacher, bid me hasten [to fulfil my wish], and fare thou well. Amen. </P>
