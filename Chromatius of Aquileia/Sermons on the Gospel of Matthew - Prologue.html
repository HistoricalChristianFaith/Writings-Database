Prologue (2005)</b></p>

<p><b>&sect;&nbsp;1</b> The sacrament of our salvation and faith, though in all the
divine scriptures, is especially contained in the evangelical preaching, in
which the secret of the heavenly sanctuary is revealed to us even as the mystery
of the Lord's passion and resurrection is revealed to everyone. However, the
transcribers the gospel (as it is divided into four books) are: Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John, who once had been prefigured and predestined to the duty of this
divine work, as the blessed Luke reported: <i>Inasmuch as many have undertaken
to compose a narrative of the things that have been fulfilled among us</i>.
(Luke 1:1)&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Matthew is appointed by the divine authority and grace of the holy spirit
to be the first to write down the gospel, then Mark and Luke, most recently of
all John, after he came back, upon the death of Domitian Caesar, from Patmos,
the island where he had been bound. &nbsp;After he had been posted on this
island and written the Revelation, he was disclosed the gospel he was to write
on account of the different heresies instigated by the devil that by then were
beginning to spring up.</p>
<p><b>&sect; 2&nbsp;</b>Matthew certainly and John too belong to the number of the
twelve apostles, who not only were with the Lord before the passion but also
kept company with him after the resurrection for forty days.&nbsp; They
carefully recounted everything they saw and heard according to what John
testified in his epistle, saying: <i>as we have heard and saw with our eyes and
by our hand have been examined, these things we declare to you</i>. &nbsp;(1
John 1:1-3)</p>
<p>But Mark was Peter's disciple and interpreter.&nbsp; He did not see the
Lord in the flesh but he wrote the gospel, filled full of heavenly grace and the
holy spirit.&nbsp; Luke also did not see the Lord in the flesh, but, because he
was very educated in the law (since he was a companion of Paul in everything),
he wrote down the gospel carefully in his own name, expounding from the very
beginning everything in the order of the matters as he learned with respect to
the apostles, as he himself testified, saying: <i>as those who have been there
all along and those who had been ministers of the message handed down to us</i>.
(Luke 1:2)</p>
<p><b>&sect; 3&nbsp;</b>Therefore, the authority of these four evangelists is firm
and steadfast, because they all composed by one principle. Of course, various
principles are taught in their sure foundation, but they do not disagree among
themselves on anything, because every one of them perceived the same thing by
faith concerning the Lord's incarnation, nativity, passion, resurrection, and
also his twin advent. And because we endeavor to say some things about the
gospels, the responsibility and situation of the matter advise us to test also
the truth of the gospels prefigured from the law of the Old Testament, as surely
the Apostle says:&nbsp; <i>the law was a shadow of things to come </i>(Heb
10:1), because neither can the new stand without the old nor could the old have
any stability without the new. &nbsp;It is said that everything about them is
more complete in their place when the message is to be from the two testaments.</p>
<p><b>&sect; 4&nbsp;</b>Thus, both the type and the number of the four gospels are
clearly described in the law and the prophets, as in the four rivers that flow
from one source in Eden, or in the four rows of stones that Aaron wore woven in
the priestly garment on his chest, or in the fourfold row of twelve calves that
Solomon set up under the bronze sea in the temple.&nbsp; In all of these, the
expressedexamples of the future truth cannot be doubted.&nbsp; Hence also Elijah
the Tishbite----not unknowing by the holy Spirit of the evangelical sacrament of
the preaching to come, when he freed the people from error and turned them from
idols to God----poured four jugs of water in the sacrifice he offered when he
put the burnt offering on the wood and made it three times in number.&nbsp; And
fire came down from the sky, as he openly declared even then the image of the
coming hope, that is the sacrament of the cross and the number of the gospels
and the grace of baptism and the faith in the Trinity, in which we are baptized
and made a worthy sacrifice for God, coming upon us with fire from the sky, that
is, his holy Spirit presented to us as a gift.</p>
<p><b>&sect; 5&nbsp;</b>But even clearer and plainer we find that through Ezekiel
the prophet these gospels are depicted in the four living things whose
appearance and shape are both described.&nbsp; <i>Their likeness</i>, he says, <i>is
the appearance of a human and the appearance of a lion and the appearance of a
calf and the appearance of a flying eagle.</i> (Ezek 1:10)&nbsp; Evident among
these is certainly the form of the evangelists.&nbsp; Although they are depicted
in different appearances for each changing principle, their preaching is
nonetheless not different.&nbsp; In fact, the prophet, when he said that the
appearances are specific to each, related that each of their four appearances is
heavenly, that is, each living thing has the four appearances.&nbsp; The reason
for this is not obscure, because it is meant that they are one, both
individually and collectively.&nbsp; While he certainly distinguishes and
separates them in connection with their appearances or number, the unity of
preaching still makes them inseparable and whole, because you will find
everything in each and the whole in all.&nbsp; But we must understand and get to
know just this difference among the appearances.&nbsp; <i>The appearance</i>, he
says,<i> of a human, and the appearance of a lion and the appearance of a calf
and the appearance of a flying eagle.</i>&nbsp; The appearance of a human is
understood as the gospel according to Matthew, a human since he began from the
bodily birth of the Lord to make the introduction, saying: <i>The book of the
generation of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham</i>, (Matt 1:1) etc.
&nbsp;He announces his birth by this human origin.&nbsp; Because of that, it is
thus described as the appearance of a human.&nbsp; Now, the appearance of a lion
is understood to be the gospel according to John, because, when the other
evangelists had said that Christ our God is made human according to the
assumption of flesh and born of the virgin, he revealed his timeless and divine
birth in just the beginning of his message, saying: <i>In the beginning was the
Word and the Word was with God and God as the Word</i>, (John 1:1) etc.&nbsp;
With this voice, the preacher of such divinity roared like a lion to frighten
off the heresies.</p>
<p><b>&sect; 6&nbsp;</b>The Apocalypse also mentioned these living things, but we
must carefully examine why, when the prophet had said that the first appearance
was of a human, then of a lion, did the Apocalypse put the appearance of the
lion earlier in reversed order, saying <i>The appearance of a lion and the
appearance of a human</i> (Rev 4:7), because we must point out it is so, not
accidentally but for a particular reason.&nbsp; For Matthew has thus been
described first in order in with the prophet in the appearance of a human,
because he was to write down the first gospel.&nbsp; But John is brought earlier
for this reason in the Apocalypse, because he surpassed everyone in preaching
the timeless and coeternal Son of the Father by the excellent beginning of his
preaching.&nbsp; Thus, he is placed later as to time or order, but he is
regarded first as to faith since he would know the secret, divine mysteries from
reclining on the Lord's bosom.&nbsp; But the fact that John is preferred in
connection with faith does not detract from the other evangelists since they all
were directed by one and the same Spirit to the complete instruction of the
Church and wrote about the Lord necessarily and completely.&nbsp; For, because
many different heresies were to come, the holy spirit so impacted the writing of
each as to expound the complete and perfect sacrament of the heavenly faith
through all of them, by which it confuted all enemies of the truth together.&nbsp;
Finally, the Holy Spirit at once opposes those wretched people who deny that the
Son of God was born of a virgin for our salvation, judging this as unworthy for
God, through Matthew and Luke.&nbsp; Through them, it clearly discloses both the
birth of the Lord according to the flesh and the conception and labor of the
virgin.&nbsp; However, those who dared blaspheme the true divinity of the Son of
God and the unlimited nature of his eternity, denying in particular that he was
born of the Father and is true God and had always been with the Father, St. John
and Mark nonetheless oppose at once, condemning the infidelity of their
blasphemy, testifying in the beginning of his gospel that the only-begotten Son
of God is God.</p>
<p><b>&sect; 7&nbsp;</b>But as we are all carefully following this along, I seem to
have gone on longer than I intended to.&nbsp; Let us now go back to the order.&nbsp;
Thus, St. John is described in the appearance of the lion, as best comprehended.</p>
<p>The gospel according to Luke, however, is recognized in the appearance of the
calf, because he wrote according to the law as he began from the priesthood of
Zacharias saying: <i>In the days of Herod the king of Judea, there was a certain
by the name of Zacharias from the order of Abijah and his wife of the sons of
Aaron</i>, etc.</p>
<p>For that reason, however, he has been represented by the person of the calf,
because the law he wrote according to had decreed for a type of a future truth
that, among other sacrifices, a calf be offered for the sins of the people.&nbsp;
Hence, not undeservedly, only this evangelist made mention of this fattened
calf, which was killed for the salvation and return of the lost son in the joy
of the exulting father, because St. Luke so made mention as he declared that our
Lord and Savior has suffered for the sins of the human race according to the
preceding form of the law.</p>
<p>To be sure, the appearance of the flying eagle is understood as the gospel
according to Mark, who began with a prophetic testimony saying: <i>The beginning
of the gospel of Jesus Christ Son of God, as is written in Isaiah: Behold I send
my angel before my appearance.&nbsp; A voice crying in the wilderness: Prepare
the ways of the Lord, make our God's paths straight.</i> (Mark 1:1-3)</p>
<p>And because the eagle is often described as the form of the holy spirit, who
has been spoken in the prophets, he is thus depicted in the appearance of an
eagle.&nbsp; For also only he reported that our Lord and Savior flew away to
heaven, that is, wetn back to the Father, as David had said: <i>He ascended
above the Cherubim and flew; he flew above the feathers of the wind</i>. (Ps
17:11 [18:10])</p>
<p><b>&sect; 8&nbsp;</b>Finally, as we know that the reason for such a sacrament is
arranged in each of the evangelists by the Holy Spirit, the same appearances
also combine in the person of our Lord and God.&nbsp; For, he is understood to
be a human because of the flesh that he took on from the virgin, and the calf
because of what he himself offered as a sacrifice worthy of God for our sins,
and a lion for the power of the virtue that defeated death in triumph, allowing
in himself none of the brunt of outside fears, and an eagle because, when the
mystery of the passion was completed as an eagle flew to heaven, the booty of
human flesh it snatched from our jaws has been taken with him.</p>
<p><b>&sect; 9&nbsp;</b>For the same reason in the prophet Zechariah we also read
the foretold number of the evangelists, reported by the prophet like this: <i>I
saw</i>, he said, <i>four chariots going out of two mountains ,and these
mountains</i>, he said, <i>were mountains of bronze.&nbsp; In the first chariot
were red horses, and in the second chariot were black horsed, and in the third
chariot were white horses, and in the fourth chariot were different and dappled
horses.&nbsp; And I said to the angel who was speaking to me: What are these,
lord?&nbsp; Responding he said to me: Do you not know what these are?&nbsp; And
I said: No, lord.&nbsp; And he told me: These are the four winds of the sky that
stand with God before the whole earth.</i>&nbsp; (Zech 6:1-5) And so this is the
number of the chariots.</p>
<p>In fact the following rationale, promulgated by prophetic reason, teaches us
to perceive a type of the gospel truth: we notice that the gospels have also
been clearly designated in these chariots.&nbsp; He declared that the four
horses are described in four parts, as we best recall, because each of the
gospels must be understood in the four and the four in each.&nbsp; Although the
preaching of the evangelists would rightly seem to be in four portions, they
still are undividedly of one mind for the unity of the faith.&nbsp; In fact, we
know that the gospels were clearly prefigured in these chariots, because the
prophet asked the angel speaking to him about what these were and he was told
this: <i>These are the four winds of the sky that stand with God before all the
earth</i>, which he reported by God's command to have circled all the earth.&nbsp;
And if we have not considered the saying about these winds (which blow through
the lands and generate waves or brew up storms), it is simple enough to
understand that, when they have been described in the prophets desiring only the
divine and eternal heavenly things, the Lord deservedly adds more: <i>These are
the ones that circle the earth; they soften my fury</i> (Zech 6:8). &nbsp;As we
perceptively have recognized, the divine wrath, which was over people's sins,
cannot otherwise be appeased except through the gospel's preaching, which runs
throughout the globe and gives both the remission of sins and salvation to the
human race.</p>
<p><b>&sect; 10&nbsp;</b> Yet the arrangement of the world rests upon the rationale
for this evangelical number: for we recognize the four seasons that the year
progresses through and the four corners of the earth that the four guardian
angels are assigned to, referring to the Apocalypse.</p>
<p><b>&sect; 11&nbsp;</b>And although there are said to be four gospels because of
the number of the evangelists, even though there is only gospel among them all,
as the Lord said: <i>And this gospel will be preached through the whole globe</i>
(Matt 24:14).&nbsp; He did not say <i>gospels</i> but <i>gospel</i>.&nbsp; The
apostle described this too when he says: <i>If anyone has preached to you a
gospel other than what you have received, let them be accursed.</i>&nbsp; (Gal
1:9)&nbsp; Hence, it is plain that there are certain four books of the gospels,
but one gospel is counted in these four books.&nbsp; And for that reason one
must not be prejudiced should we sometimes say "gospels" because of the
number of evangelists or when we name the gospels in this way as the most
important books or when we designate the number of the evangelists according to
the usual custom of the majority.&nbsp; Indeed we both confess and believe that
there is one true gospel according to the authority of the Lord or even the
apostle.</p>
<p><b>&sect; 12&nbsp;</b>Although we have wanted to establish the number of
evangelists from a painstaking study of the various testimonies of the prophets,
I have extended the sermon longer than I have intended to.&nbsp; But we strive
to investigate the order of the gospel according to Matthew, even with little
insight and a mediocre sermon.&nbsp;</p>

which were mainly transmitted in the manuscripts under the name of John
Chrysostom.&nbsp; Their correction attribution was recovered by &Eacute;taix and
Lemaire in the 1960's.&nbsp; This prologue has been seen as having interesting
parallels to the Muratorian canon.</p>
