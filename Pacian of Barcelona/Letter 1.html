<p>1.&nbsp; If it be not a carnal intention, my lord <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>,
but as I judge, a calling of the Spirit, that thou enquirest of us the faith of
the Catholic verity, thou, before all, taldng thy rise as far as appears, from a
streamlet at a distance, and not holding to the fountain and source of the
principal Church, shouldest, in the first instance, have shewn what or how
different are the opinions which thou followest. Thou shouldest unfold thyself
as to what cause more particularly had loosened thee from the unity of our body.
For those parts, for which a remedy is sought, should be laid bare. Whereas now
(if I may so say) the bosom of correspondence being closed, we see not on what
members more especially we have to bestow our care. For such are the heresies
which have sprung forth from the Christian head, that of the mere names the roll
would be immense. For to pass over the heretics of the Jews, Dositheus <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
the Samaritan, the Sadducees, and the Pharisees, it were long to enumerate how
many grew up in the times of the Apostles, Simon Magus, and Menander, and
Nicolaus, and others hidden by an inglorious fame. What again in later times
were Ebion, and Apelles, and Marcion, and Valentinus, and Cerdon, and not long
after them, the Cataphrygians, and Novatians, not to notice any recent swarms!</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Whom then in my letters must I first refute? Wouldest thou the mere
names of all, my paper will not contain them; <A NAME="p320"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|320</SPAN></A>
unless indeed by your writings every way condemnatory of penance you declare
your agreement with the Phrygians. But, most illustrious Lord, so manifold and
so diverse is the error of these very men, that in them we have not only to
overthrow their peculiar fancies against penance, but to cut off the heads, as
it were, of some Lernaean monster. And, in the first place, they rely on more
founders than one, for I suppose Blastus <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> the Greek
is of them; Theodotus <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> also and Praxeas <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>were once teachers of your party, themselves also Phrygians of some
celebrity, who falsely say they are inspired of Leucius <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>,
boast that they are instructed by Proculus <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>.
Following Montanus, and Maximilla, and Priscilla, howmanifold controversies have
they raised concerning the day of Easter, the Paraclete, Apostles, Prophets, and
many other disputes, as this <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> also concerning the
Catholic name, the pardon of penance.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Wherefore if we would discuss all these points, thou hadst need been
present and teachable. But if on those points merely on which thou writest, my
instruction should not be sufficiently full, yet as it is our duty to serve, in
whatsoever way we can, those who solemnly adjure us <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>,
we now, for the sake of informing you, discourse <A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
with thee summarily on those matters about which thou hast deigned to write to
us. If thou wouldest have fuller knowledge on our side, thou must on thine
declare thyself more unreservedly, lest by somewhat of obscurity in thy
enquiries, thou leave us uncertain, whether thou art consulting or censuring.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Meanwhile (and this concerns our present correspondence <A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A>)
I would above all entreat thee not to borrow authority for error from this very
fact that, as thou sayest, throughout the whole world no one has been found <A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>,
who could convince or persuade thee contrary to what thou believest. For <A NAME="p321"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|321</SPAN></A>
although we be unskilled, most skilful is the Spirit of God, and if we are
faithless, <i>faithful is God, Who cannot deny Himself.</i><A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
Then, also, because it was not allowed the Priests of God to contend long with
one who resisted <A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>. <i>We, </i>says the Apostle, <i>have
no such custom, neither the churches of God. After one admonition </i><A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A><i>,
</i>as thou thyself knowest, <i>the contentious is passed by. </i>For who can
persuade any of any thing against his will? Thine own fault was it therefore,
brother, and not theirs, if no one convinced thce of what in itself is most
excellent. For at this day too it is in thy power to despise our writings also,
if thou hadst rather refute than approve them. Yet very many resisted both the
Lord Himself, and the Apostles, nor could any ever be persuaded of the truth,
unless he consented to it by his own religious feeling.<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A></p>
<p>5. Therefore, my Lord, neither have we written with that confidence, as
though we could persuade thee, if thou resistest, but in that faith by which we
would not deny thee an entrance to holy peace, if thou wiliest. Which peace if
it be after thine own soul and heart<sup>2</sup>, there ought<sup>3</sup> to be
no contest about the name of Catholic. For if it is through God that our people
obtain this name, no question is to be raised, when Divine authority is
followed. If through man, you must discover when it was first taken. Then, if
the name is good, no odium rests with it; if ill, it need not be envied. The
Novatians, I hear, are called after Novatus or Novatian; yet it is the sect
which I accuse in them, not the name: nor has any one objected their name to
Montanus or the Phrygians.</p>
<p>5. But under the Apostles, you will say, no one was called Catholic. Be it
thus. It shall have been so. Allow even that. When after the Apostles heresies
had burst forth, and were striving under various names to tear piecemeal and
divide <i>the Dove </i>and <i>the Queen </i>of God,<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
did not the Apostolic people require a name of their own, whereby to mark the
unity of the people that were uncorrupted, lest the error of some should rend
limb by limb the <i>undefiled virgin </i><A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A><sup> </sup>of
God? Was it not seemly that the chief head should be distinguished by its own
peculiar appellation? Suppose, this very day, I entered a populous city. When I
had found Marcionites, <A NAME="p322"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|322</SPAN></A> Apollinarians,
Cataphrygians, Novatians, and others of the kind who call themselves Christians,
by what name should I recognise the congregation of my own people, unless it
were named Catholic? Come tell me, who bestowed so many names on the other
peoples? Why have so many cities, so many nations, each their own description?
The man who asks the meaning of the Catholic Name, will he be ignorant himself
of the cause of his own name if I shall enquire its origin? Whence was it
delivered to me? Certainly that which has stood through so many ages was not
borrowed from man. This name &quot;Catholic&quot; sounds not of Marcion, nor of
Apelles, nor of Montanus, nor does it take heretics as its authors.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Many things <A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> the Holy Spirit hath
taught us, Whom God sent from Heaven to the Apostles as their Comforter and
Guide. Many things reason teaches us, as Paul saith, and honesty, and, as he
says, <i>nature herself</i>. <A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A><sup> </sup>What! Is
the authority of Apostolic men, of Primitive Priests, of the most blessed Martyr
and Doctor Cyprian, of slight weight with us? Do we wish to teach the teacher?
Are we wiser than he was, and are we puffed up by the spirit of the flesh
against the man, whom his noble shedding of blood, and a crown of most glorious
suffering, have set forth as a witness of the Eternal God? What thinkest thou of
so many Priests on this same side, who throughout the whole world were compacted
together in one bond of peace with this same Cyprian? What of so many aged
Bishops, so many Martyrs, so many Confessors? Come say, if they were not
sufficient authorities for the use of this name, are we sufficient for its
rejection? And shall the Fathers rather follow our authority, and the antiquity
of Saints give way to be emended by us, and times now putrifying through their
sins, pluck out the grey hairs of Apostolic age? And yet, my brother, be not
troubled; Christian is my name, but Catholic my surname. The former gives me a
name, the latter distinguishes me. By the one I am approved; by the other I am
but marked.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp;And if at last we must give an account of the word Catholic,
and draw it out from the Greek by a Latin interpretation, &quot;Catholic&quot;
is 'every where one <A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>,' or, (as learned men <A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
think,) &quot;obedience in all,&quot; i. e. all the commands of <A NAME="p323"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|323</SPAN></A>
God. Whence the Apostle, <i>Whether ye he obedient in all things;</i><A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A><i>
</i>and again, <i>For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by
the obedience of One shall many be made righteous.</i> <A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>Therefore he who is a Catholic, the same man is obedient <A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>.
He who is obedient, the same is a Christian, and thus the Catholic is a
Christian. Wherefore our people when named Catholic are separated by this
appellation from the heretical name. But if also the word Catholic means 'every
where one,' as those first think, David indicates this very thing, when he
saith, <i>The queen did stand in a vesture of gold, wrought about with, divers
colours; </i><A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A><i><sup> </sup></i>that is, one
amidst all. And in the Song of Songs the Bridegroom speaketh these words, <i>My
dove, My undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother; she is the
choice one of her that bare her.</i><A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> Again it is
written, <i>The virgins shall be brought unto the King after her. </i>And
further, <i>Virgins without number.</i><A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A> Therefore
amidst all she is one, and one over all. If thou askest the reason of the name,
it is evident.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; But as to penance <A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>, God grant that it
may be necessary for none of the faithful; that no one after the help of the
sacred font may <i>fall into the pit </i>of death, and that Priests may not be
compelled to inculcate or to teach its tardy consolations, lest, whilst by
remedies they soothe the sinner, they open a road to sin. But we lay open this
indulgence of our God to the miserable, not to the happy; not before sin, but
after sins; nor do we announce a medicine to the whole, but to the sick. If
spiritual wickednesses have no power over the baptized, none, that fraud of the
serpent, which subverted the first man, which hath printed on his posterity so
many marks of condemnation: if it hath retired from the world, if we have
already begun to reign, if no crime steals over our eyes, none over our hands,
none over our minds, then let this gift of God be cast aside, this help
rejected; be no confession, no groans, heard; let a proud righteousness despise
every remedy.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; But if the Lord Himself <A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> hath
provided these things for His own creature man, if the same Lord Who hath
bestowed remedies on the fallen, hath given rewards to them that stand, cease to
accuse the Divine goodness, to erase by <A NAME="p324"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|324</SPAN></A>
the interposition of your own rigour so many inscriptions of heavenly mercy, or
by inexorable harshness to prohibit the gratuitous good gifts of the Lord. This
is not a largess from our own bounty. <i>Turn ye, </i>saith the Lord, <i>even to
Me, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: and rend your heart;</i><A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A><i>
</i>and again, <i>Let the wicked man leave his ways, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts </i><A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A><i>, and turn unto the Lord, and he
shall obtain mercy.</i><A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> And also after this
manner crieth the Prophet, <i>For He is gracious, and merciful, slow to anger,
and of great kindness, and repenteth Him of the evil.</i><A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
Hath the serpent so lasting a poison, and hath not Christ a remedy? Doth the
Devil kill in the world, and hath Christ no power here to help? Be we indeed
ashamed to sin, but not ashamed to repent. Be we ashamed to hazard ourselves,
but not ashamed to be delivered. Who will snatch the plank <A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
from the shipwrecked, that he escape not? Who will grudge the curing of a wound?
Doth not David say, <i>Every night I will wash my bed, I will water my couch
with my tears; </i>and again, <i>I</i> <i>acknowledge my sin, and mine
unrighteousness have I not hid; </i>and yet more, <i>I</i> <i>said, I will
confess my sins unto the Lord, and so Thou forgavest the wickedness of my heart.</i><A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
Did not the Prophet answer him <sup><A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A> </sup>when,
after the guilt of murder and adultery, penitent for Bathsheba, <i>The Lord also
hath put away from thee thy sin? </i><A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A> Did not
confession deliver the king of Babylon, when condemned after so many sins of
idolatry? And what is it that the Lord saith, <i>Shall he who has fallen not
arise, and he who has turned not return? </i><A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
What answer give the subjects of those many parables of our Lord? That the woman
findeth the coin, and rejoiceth when she hath found it? That the shepherd
carrieth back the wandering sheep? That when the son was returning, all his
goods wasted in riotous living <A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A> with harlots and
fornicators, the Father with kindness met him, and, assigning the grounds,
chideth the , envious brother, saying, <i>This My son was dead, and is alive
again, was lost, and is found.</i><A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A> What of him
who was wounded in the way, whom Levite and Priest passed by? Is he not taken
care of? <A NAME="p325"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|325</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. Ponder what the Spirit saith to the Churches.<A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A>
The Ephesians He accuses of having forsaken their love; to them of Thyatira He
imputeth fornication; the people of Sardis He blameth as loitering in the work;
those of Pergamus as teaching things contrary; of the Laodiceans He brandeth the
riches; and yet He calleth all to penance and to satisfaction. What meaneth the
Apostle, when he writeth to the Corinthians thus, <i>Lest, when I come, I bewail
many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness, and
fornication, and lasciviousness, which they have committed? </i><A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A><sup>
</sup>What, when again to the Galatians, <i>If a man be overtaken in a fault, </i>(i.
e. any whatever,) <i>ye who are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of
meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. </i><A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
Does then the master of the family in a large house guard only the silver and
golden vessels? Does he not deign to guard both the earthen and the wooden, and
some that are put together and repaired? <i>Now I rejoice, </i>saith the
Apostle, <i>that ye sorrowed to repentance; </i>and again, <i>for godly sorrow
worketh repentance unto enduring salvation.</i><A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>
But penitence, you say, was not allowed. No one enjoins a fruitless labour, <i>For
the labourer is worthy of his hire.</i><A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A> Never
would God threaten the impenitent, unless He would pardon the penitent <A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>.
This,<sup> </sup>you will say, God alone can do. It is true. But that also which
He does through His Priests, is His own authority. Else what is that which He
saith to the Apostles, <i>Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in
heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven? </i><A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>
Why said He this, if it was not lawful for men to bind and loose? Is this
allowed to Apostles only? Then to them also only is it allowed to baptize, and
to them only to give the Holy Spirit, and to them only to cleanse the sins of
the nations; for all this was enjoined on none others but Apostles.</p>
<p>12. But if both the loosening of bonds and the power of the Sacrament are
given in one place, either the whole has been derived to us from the Apostolic
form and authority, or else not even this relaxation has been made from the
decree. <i>I, </i>he saith, <i>have laid the foundation, and another buildeth
thereon.</i><A HREF="#49"><SUP>49</SUP></A> This, therefore, we build up, which
the doctrine of&nbsp;<sup> <A NAME="p326"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|326</SPAN></A> </sup>the
Apostles laid as the foundation. And, lastly, Bishops also are named Apostles,
as saith Paul of Epaphroditus, <i>My brother and fellow-soldier; but your
Apostle.</i><A HREF="#50"><SUP>50</SUP></A></p>
<p>13.&nbsp; If, therefore, the power of the Laver, and of the Anointing, gifts <A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
far greater, descended thence to Bishops, then the right of binding and of
loosing was with them. Which although for our sins it be presumptuous in us to
claim, yet God, Who hath granted unto Bishops the name even of His only Beloved,
will not deny it unto them, as if holy and sitting in the chair of the Apostles.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; I would write more, brother, were I not pressed by the hasty return
of the servant, and were I not reserving a fuller account for thee when either
present, or making confession of thy whole purport. Let no one despise the
Bishop on consideration of the man. Let us remember that the Apostle Peter hath
named our Lord, Bishop. <i>But are now, </i>he saith, <i>returned unto the
Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</i><A HREF="#52"><SUP>52</SUP></A> What shall
be denied to the Bishop, in whom operateth the Name of God? He shall indeed give
an account, if he have done any thing wrong, or if he shall have judged corrupt
and unrighteous judgment. Nor is God's Judgment forestalled, but that He may
undo the work of a wicked builder. In the mean while, if that his ministration
be holy, he abideth as an helper in the work of God. See the Apostle writeth to
Laity: <i>To whom, ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any
thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of
Christ; lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his
devices.</i><A HREF="#53"><SUP>53</SUP></A> But if what the Laity forgive, the
Apostle saith that he hath forgiven, what a Bishop hath done, in what character
can it be rejected? Therefore neither the Anointing, nor Baptism, nor remission
of sins, nor the renewing of the Body, were granted to his sacred authority,
because nothing was entrusted to him as assumed by himself, but the whole has
descended in a stream from the Apostolic privilege.</p>
<p>15. Know <A HREF="#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>, brother, that not indiscriminately
to all is this very pardon through penance granted; nor until there shall have
been either some indication of the Divine will, or perchance some visitation,
may men be <i>loosed; </i>that with <A NAME="p327"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|327</SPAN></A>
careful pondering and much balancing, after many groans and much shedding of
tears, after the prayers of the whole Church, pardon is in such wise not refused
to true penitence, as that no one thereby prejudgeth the future Judgment of
Christ. If, brother, thou wouldest write thy sentiments more openly, thou shalt
be more fully instructed.</p>
