# Writings-Database
A collection of writings from historical Christianity

All works in this repo are in the public domain. See the heading of each work to find its source.

### Pull Requests

See a typo/mistake? Please send a pull request to fix it! Most of these writings are from ancient texts that have entered the public domain and been scanned and turned into text via OCR, which often has errors.

Know of a work you want added to this repo? So long as it is associated with the historic Christian faith and in the public domain, we'll accept a pull request to add it! 

### Changes made to these works:

- If a verse of the Bible is quoted but not attributed, I've made an effort to add the attribution in parenthesis after the quote: for example, adding if the author writes "... as scripture says, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'" I will add (John 1:1)

- If a verse of the Bible is quoted and attributed, but the attribution is an abbreviation, I expand the abbreviation to its full name to improve search capabilities on this repo: for example, if a work has (Ex 1:1) I expand it to (Exodus 1:1)

- If a work has editor comments interspersed throughout the text, we remove those inline editor comments (and preferably move them to footnotes): for example, Jerome's Commentary on Daniel translated into English has commentary from both Migne and Archer interspersed throughout, so that commentary from them is removed (and in the future I hope to add it back as footnotes).
