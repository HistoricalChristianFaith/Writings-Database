<h3>Introduction</span></h3>

<p>Leontius Byzantinus was a 6<sup>th</sup> century Chalcedonian
theologian, known to us as the author of a small collection of four
christological treatises (CPG 6813-7).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>
He composed <i>Contra Nestorianos et Eutychianos</i> <i>lib. </i>III, issued
separately and then collected with a prologue by the author.&nbsp; These excited
opposition from Severian Monophysite writers, to whom he responded with the <i>Epilysis</i>,
and with the <i>Triginta Capita contra Severum</i>.</span></p>

<p>Only a little is known about his life.&nbsp; He is mentioned in the <i>Vita
Sabae</i> by Cyril of Scythopolis.&nbsp; Leontius was a monk of the New Laura, and
head of the Palestinian Origenists.&nbsp; Leontius accompanied Sabas on his journey
to Constantinople in 531, where he proved effective in defending the definition
of Chalcedon against the Monophysites.&nbsp; He seems to have made known his
Origenism, which led Sabas to condemn him.&nbsp; But he perhaps stayed in the
capital for a number of years, and a Leontius is mentioned in the <i>Acts</i> as
taking part in the anti-Monophysite synod of 536, although this may be Leontius
of Jerusalem. Returning to Palestine between 537-540, he tried to advance the
views of the Origenist party, but was forced to return to Constantinople where
he died, soon after the anti-Origenist edict of 543 was issued.</p>

<p>He also seems to be the author of the work translated here <i>Adversus
fraudes Apollinistarum</i>, a florilegium of passages from the works of the
condemned heretic Apollinarius / Apollinaris of Laodicea and his disciples.
The works of the latter could not circulate under their own name, but passages
from them were being brought forward for controversial purposes by monophysite
writers, under the impression that they were in fact by such luminaries as Pope
Julius I and Gregory Nazianzen.&nbsp; The purpose of the collection was to permit
identification of these spurious items.</p>

<p>This text has reached us in a single 10<sup>th</sup> century
manuscript, Vaticanus graecus 2195, where it appears on folios 165-184.&nbsp; The
manuscript also contains copies of other works by Leontius (which exist in
several other copies) and other works.</p>

<p>The work was first printed in a Latin translation in 1603 by
Henricus Canisius S.J., in volume 4 of his <i>Lectiones Antiquae</i>, f.106 f.
Canisius states, however, that the translation was actually made by Turrianus,
or Francesco Torres S.J. ( 1584).&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Greek text
was first printed by Angelo Mai in <i>Spicilegium Romanum</i> volume 10, part
2, p.128-151, from the Vatican ms., which he states had once belonged to
Cardinal Salvati, and then to the Colonna family, before being purchased by the
Vatican when he was in charge of the library there.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Mai's Greek
text, accompanied by the Latin translation of Turrianus, were reprinted in the <i>Patrologia
Graeca</i> series, vol. 86, cols.1948-1976.&nbsp; This translation
has been made from the Greek text in that edition.&nbsp; The column numbers from
this edition are given inline as [M.----].</p>

<p>After the
translation was completed, we became aware of an unpublished critical edition
of the works of Leontius Byzantinus, produced in 1978 by Brian Daley as a
DPhil. thesis.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>
An edition and translation of all the works of Leontius Byzantinus by Brian
Daley is forthcoming from Oxford University Press.<a href="#_ftn3"
