<p align=center class="smaller">[Translated by Bryson Sewell]</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of those who suffer from the illness of the [ideas] of
Apollinarius,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>
or those of Eutyches, or those from Dioscorus, in a desire to strengthen their
own heresy, ascribed<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>
some of Apollinarius' books<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a>
to Gregory the wonder-worker<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a></span>or Athanasius or Julius,<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a>
desiring to deceive the more simple, which they have achieved. For, they have
been able to win over<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a>
many of those who belonged to the catholic<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"
title="">[11]</a>
church because of the credibility of the individuals;<a href="#_ftn12"
name="_ftnref12" title="">[12]</a> and, among many who
belong to the true faith, you would find <i>The Faith of Apollinarius, in Part</i>,</span>ascribed to Gregory, and some of his own letters ascribed to Julius,
and some other works of his concerning the incarnation or publications<a
href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="">[13]</a> ascribed to
Athanasius, such as the appended exposition which is in accord with the creed<a
href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title="">[14]</a> of the 318.<a
href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title="">[15]</a> Not only are there
these works, but also others of this sort. But [the facts] will become clear to
you, and to everyone who loves the truth, from the works of Apollinarius
himself, which will be given in quotation, and from [those of] his disciples,
among them Valentinus, who [writes] as follows:<a href="#_ftn16"
name="_ftnref16" title="">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A chapter of the defense of Valentinus
the Apollinarian</i>. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Against<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title="">[17]</a>
those who say that we affirm that the body is of the same substance as God."<a
href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title="">[18]</a></span></p>

<p><i>From the master Apollinarius' letter to
Serapion. </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I
received your affectionate letter,<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title="">[19]</a>
master, and, with regard to the matter about which the letter-bearer was
inquiring, we have assisted him as much as we were able. </span></p>

<p>We eagerly
received back my master's<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title="">[20]</a>
letter which had been sent to Corinth<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title="">[21]</a>
and condemned the great folly of those who said<a href="#_ftn22"
name="_ftnref22" title="">[22]</a> that the flesh is of
the same substance as God." </span></p>

<p><i>And again from the same letter</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For,
the flesh is divine,<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title="">[23]</a>
not by nature, but by its union with the Word,<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"
title="">[24]</a>
so that it remains in the union, just as He himself<a href="#_ftn25"
name="_ftnref25" title="">[25]</a> says, "It is the
Spirit that gives life to the flesh;"<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title="">[26]</a>
for, of course, a body can not become incorporeal, as others foolishly say."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;[<i>M. 1950</i>]</p>



<p><i>From the letter to Dionysius, the
beginning of which is, "To me, etc." </i></p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>"To me, piety is [the] foundation of friendship,<a href="#_ftn27"
name="_ftnref27" title="">[27]</a> and [there is] no
excuse for enmity between those who guard piety. Let no one seek anything novel from me now, nor let him demand that truth be
silenced, as if thereby he was creating peace. It
is clear from what we have always written that no one can accuse<a
href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title="">[28]</a> us of those things
which are said against some [people], since we do not say either that the flesh
of our savior is from heaven, or that his<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"
title="">[29]</a>
flesh is of the same substance as God, inasmuch as it is flesh and not divine,
and that it is divine inasmuch as it is united to the divine in one person.<a
href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title="">[30]</a>" </span></p>



<p><i>And from another letter to him, the
beginning of which is, "I am astounded."</i></p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>"I am astounded at learning about some who confess, on the one hand,
that the Lord is God in flesh but who, on
the other hand, fall into the division<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31"
title="">[31]</a>
that was wickedly introduced by the followers of Paul.<a href="#_ftn32"
name="_ftnref32" title="">[32]</a>" </span></p>



<p><i>And again from the same letter.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It
is agreed that the body is from the virgin, the divine nature<a href="#_ftn33"
name="_ftnref33" title="">[33]</a> from heaven. &#932;he
body was formed in [the] womb, the divine nature is uncreated, eternal, [and]
remains one in its constitution; the body is body, the divinity, divinity. If
it is the custom in Scripture to acknowledge [Him] as completely divine, and as
completely human,<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title="">[34]</a>
let us, too, follow the divine words, and not divide what is indivisible." </span></p>



<p><i>And from the letter to Terentius.</i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And
John, on the one hand, accuses the one who divides<a href="#_ftn35"
name="_ftnref35" title="">[35]</a> Jesus, but these men
outright divide [him] by confessing the union with the body; for nothing is
joined to itself, nor is [that which is of] the same same-substance [joined] to
the same-substance, as these men did not shrink from saying. For this is
neither a composition nor a union. For nothing is joined to itself, but that
which is joined together is one thing joined to another. And, on the other
hand, if the Word is of the same substance as<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36"
title="">[36]</a>
the body, and, on the other hand, the body is of the same substance<a
href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title="">[37]</a> as the Word, then each
of these, of course, is invisible, according to this verse: 'No one saw God,
neither is he able to see [God].<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title="">[38]</a>'
For he was not made known in this way, nor was he touched, since he is
invisible. Nor is John truthful when he says, 'We have seen and our hands
touched [him].<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title="">[39]</a>'"
</span></p>



<p><i>And again from the same letter.</i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If
someone says either that the Son is two persons,<a href="#_ftn40"
name="_ftnref40" title="">[40]</a> or that the flesh is
of the same substance as God and as our flesh, or that it has descended out of
heaven, and that it wasn't assumed by the One who [came down] out of heaven,<a
href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title="">[41]</a> saying that the
divinity is liable to change,<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title="">[42]</a>
let this person be anathema."</span></p>



<p><i>From </i>'[<i>the</i>]<i>
Syllogisms</i>'<i>.</i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If
the Word is of the same substance as the body, nothing was joined with itself
by itself, but it was joined with the body and [is] not, therefore, of the same
substance as it. If the body is of the same substance as the Word, then it was
not seen and touched: for both of these are invisible and intangible, if indeed
they are of the same substance. For John says, 'We saw and we touched.<a
href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title="">[43]</a>' The spirit of the
Lord and the body are not, therefore, of the same substance. But the invisible
and [the] intangible were joined to the visible and the tangible to form a [<i>M.
1952</i>]unity, and so in this way it has become visible and tangible.
He who says that the body is of the same substance as God blasphemes, [since he
says that the] incorporeal has a body; for
the Son, being of the same substance as the Father, has his own distinctive
character<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title="">[44]</a>
even<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title="">[45]</a>
when He is united to the flesh. And it is not because he is of the same
substance as God that he was separated<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46"
title="">[46]</a>
from his own body, but in order that the body should not be thought to be of
the same substance [as the Son]."</span></p>



<p><i>And again </i>[<i>from</i>]<i>
the same </i>[<i>work</i>]<i>. </i></p>



<p><i>"</i>I, Apollinarius, and those who are with
me think as follows concerning the divine incarnation.
</p>



<p>"The living Word of God took on flesh from Mary, of the same
substance as our own flesh, in a union with the divinity, from the first
conception in the virgin, and thus became man.<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47"
title="">[47]</a>
For man, according to the Apostle, is both flesh and spirit, and this is [what
is meant by] 'the Word became flesh,<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title="">[48]</a>'
the [act of] being united with flesh as a human spirit.<a href="#_ftn49"
name="_ftnref49" title="">[49]</a> A human like us is
called 'flesh.' The Lord, as a human, is above us;<a href="#_ftn50"
name="_ftnref50" title="">[50]</a> and therefore [he is]
heavenly because of his own spirit, which is heavenly [and] to which the will
of the flesh was not opposed. And thus, in Christ, sin was being destroyed, and
death caused by sin<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title="">[51]</a>
was destroyed, and we, as sharers in this triumph, are saved by faith, and we,
though we are of an earthly father, become [heavenly] by assimilation<a
href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title="">[52]</a> to the heavenly [one].
Therefore, let him be anathema who denies that the flesh is from Mary, and who
says that it is from the uncreated<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title="">[53]</a>
nature, and that it is of the same substance as God. And [let him also be
anathema] who says that the divinity is liable to change, and that from it [there
are] carnal emotions.<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title="">[54]</a></span></p>



<p>"And I, Jobius
the bishop.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I
confess that the Lord Jesus Christ, from eternity, the divine Word, without
flesh, yet at the end of the ages<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title="">[55]</a>
having joined to himself flesh from [the] holy virgin, is God and human, one
and the same, composed of one substance, one undifferentiated<a href="#_ftn56"
name="_ftnref56" title="">[56]</a> person,<a
href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title="">[57]</a> mediating between God
and humans, joining separated creatures to the one who made [them], of the same
substance as God according to the divinity he has from his Father's being,<a
href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title="">[58]</a> and of the same
substance as humans according to the flesh, of human nature, that was joined to
him, worshiped and glorified with his own flesh, for through it he has become
our deliverance<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title="">[59]</a>
from death, and our connection to the immortal. For the flesh was perfectly
joined with the Word, never separated from it. It does not belong to<a
href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title="">[60]</a> a human, or to a
slave, or to a created person, but to the divine Word itself, the Creator, of
the same substance as God, but not of the same substance as the incorporeal
being<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title="">[61]</a>
of the ineffable Father. But those who, contrary to the teaching that we
learned from the beginning, say or teach that the flesh, perfectly joined with
the Word, and never separated from it, is of the same substance as God, that
is, as his incorporeal being,<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title="">[62]</a>
&mdash; in accordance with the apostolic command, we shun these people as causing
dissensions and scandals in [the] churches, and we consider them [to be]
outsiders, on account of their being opposed to the ancient tradition and to
the ecclesiastical peace." [<i>M. 1953</i>]</span></p>



<p><i>Valentinus
the Christian wrote the following against the </i>[<i>doctrines</i>]<i>
wickedly and impiously taught by Timothy and those with him, and by their
teacher, the most impious Polemius. </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since
Timothy, who became Polemius' chief<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title="">[63]</a>
disciple, after raising himself against the Church of Christ from a great
madness, teaches, contrary to the truth, the impiety of his teacher Polemius,
foolishly instructing his pupil Cataphronius, as he himself writes to his like-minded
fellows Paregorius, Uranius, Diodorus, Jobius, saying thus:<a href="#_ftn64"
name="_ftnref64" title="">[64]</a>that the flesh of the Lord is acknowledged as divine in the
union with the divine Word, and is confessed [as being] of the same substance
as God, [but] in its nature it remains human, and of the same substance as us.<a
href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title="">[65]</a> And again, quoting<a
href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title="">[66]</a> Cataphronius, who was
instructed by him, he says the following: that it is necessary that in the
union [the flesh]<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title="">[67]</a>
be acknowledged as the same thing<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title="">[68]</a>
as the Word of God, and that it should be thought to be of the same substance
as God, just like the Word.<a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title="">[69]</a>
And&nbsp; still [you do something] even more impious than this, Timothy,<a
href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title="">[70]</a> since you make the
flesh, which the Lord Jesus Christ wore from the holy virgin, invisible, just
as if, as you say, the flesh, through which we attained our salvation, is of
the same substance as [God], just as [the] Word of God is of the same substance
as [God]. And we believe that the flesh of the Lord &mdash; which he took up from [the]
virgin, [and] through which (always being directed by the life-giving divine
Word) mediation on our behalf<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title="">[71]</a>
is always preserved<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title="">[72]</a>&mdash; is worshiped together with the Word of God, and
is also acknowledged as divine and is glorified. For in the union with the
divine Word, the flesh is acknowledged as divine, but not of its own nature,<a
href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title="">[73]</a>with the result that it
remains in the union, just as the Lord himself says, "It is the Spirit that
gives life to the flesh.<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title="">[74]</a>"
For the body is not in any way able to be of the same substance as the
incorporeal God; [yet it is] this very thing which the followers of Timothy and
Polemius, and those with them, foolishly and impiously say, employing [their]
cunning of every sort<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title="">[75]</a>
in their desire to attach honor to the body, [that is], incorporeity, which is
impossible.<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title="">[76]</a>
But it is possible and fitting for the divine-nature<a href="#_ftn77"
name="_ftnref77" title="">[77]</a> that wears it<a
href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78" title="">[78]</a> to be glorified with
the glory of the incorporeal God, and in this way it<a href="#_ftn79"
name="_ftnref79" title="">[79]</a> is worshiped by all
creation as the Creator and the true, flesh-bearing son of God, and not as a
God-bearing man. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What,
then, is this great ignorance, or rather this faithlessness of yours, &#927;
Timothy, both your own and of those with you, and of your<a href="#_ftn80"
name="_ftnref80" title="">[80]</a> teacher Polemius,
since you say that the body is of the same substance, [but that it is also] of
a different substance than the divine-nature<a href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81"
title="">[81]</a>
on account of the union, and since you say that it<a href="#_ftn82"
name="_ftnref82" title="">[82]</a> is unchangeable,<a
href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83" title="">[83]</a> yet that is has
changed?<a href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84" title="">[84]</a>
If indeed, as you<a href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" title="">[85]</a>
say, that, as the Word of God, the flesh is of the same substance, you both
oppose yourselves and anathematize yourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as an intoxicated and
drunk person doesn't know what he is doing or what he is saying, so also you
don't know what you are saying or what you are affirming,<a href="#_ftn86"
name="_ftnref86" title="">[86]</a> since this impious
teaching, which you have very often taught, confutes you.&nbsp; Learn, therefore, you
faithless men, that a union is not [composed] of the same substance.<a
href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87" title="">[87]</a>If indeed it is of the same substance, it is<a href="#_ftn88"
name="_ftnref88" title="">[88]</a>not a union. For nothing is united or attached to itself,[<i>M.
1956</i>] but one thing [is united] with another,<a href="#_ftn89"
name="_ftnref89" title="">[89]</a> i.e.,<a href="#_ftn90"
name="_ftnref90" title="">[90]</a> [the] Word of God having
attached itself to flesh. And this is what is said by the divine evangelist,<a
href="#_ftn91" name="_ftnref91" title="">[91]</a> 'The Word became
flesh, and dwelled among us,'<a href="#_ftn92" name="_ftnref92" title="">[92]</a>
the [act of] the Word being united with living<a href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93"
title="">[93]</a>
flesh. </span></p>

<p>"And so do you not know this, O faithless men, that nature<a
href="#_ftn94" name="_ftnref94" title="">[94]</a> and substance<a
href="#_ftn95" name="_ftnref95" title="">[95]</a> are the same thing in
God,<a href="#_ftn96" name="_ftnref96" title="">[96]</a>
[who is] both inexpressible and incorporeal, and of the eternal divinity<a
href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97" title="">[97]</a> of the revered<a
href="#_ftn98" name="_ftnref98" title="">[98]</a> trinity</span>?<a href="#_ftn99"
name="_ftnref99" title="">[99]</a> The body which the Lord wore became neither eternal nor incorporeal
from the union;<a href="#_ftn100" name="_ftnref100" title="">[100]</a>
on account of this, it is not of the same substance as [his] inexpressible and
incorporeal being.<a href="#_ftn101" name="_ftnref101" title="">[101]</a>
The Lord is eternal, and, before [taking on flesh] flesh,<a href="#_ftn102"
name="_ftnref102" title="">[102]</a> he was of the same
substance as the Father, and with flesh, the Lord<a href="#_ftn103"
name="_ftnref103" title="">[103]</a> was [still] of the
same substance as the Father. The flesh was not of the same substance, for it
was a garment and a covering, and he assumed it [as a] covering<a
href="#_ftn104" name="_ftnref104" title="">[104]</a> for the hidden
mystery, and he offered [it] on behalf of man,<a href="#_ftn105"
name="_ftnref105" title="">[105]</a> and through it he
appeared to man.<a href="#_ftn106" name="_ftnref106" title="">[106]</a>
For in no other way were we able to become spectators of God, except through [the]
body. For again, the Lord is of the same substance as us according to the
flesh, but not according to the divine-nature.<a href="#_ftn107"
name="_ftnref107" title="">[107]</a> For the divine-nature
is not from a woman &mdash; by no means! And the flesh is neither from above nor
eternal. Since you<a href="#_ftn108" name="_ftnref108" title="">[108]</a>
say these things faithlessly and impiously against the truth, teaching your own
impiety with so great a subtlety of words,<a href="#_ftn109" name="_ftnref109"
title="">[109]</a>
being convicted by the truth as evil-doers and deceivers, consider it
worthwhile to know that the union glorified the [fleshly] nature.<a
href="#_ftn110" name="_ftnref110" title="">[110]</a> For it did not cause
the body [to be] of the same substance as God, as you dare to say in your
delusion,<a href="#_ftn111" name="_ftnref111" title="">[111]</a>
you who have fallen from the truth, and who insult the incarnation<a
href="#_ftn112" name="_ftnref112" title="">[112]</a>of the Word, [which
occurred] because of God's love for mankind,<a href="#_ftn113" name="_ftnref113"
title="">[113]</a>
[the] union with the body, which took place for
our salvation, since you say<a href="#_ftn114" name="_ftnref114" title="">[114]</a>
that on account of the union [it] is of the same substance as the impassible<a
href="#_ftn115" name="_ftnref115" title="">[115]</a> divine-nature.<a
href="#_ftn116" name="_ftnref116" title="">[116]</a> This is beyond all
impiety, even if you wish to make yourselves wise ten thousand times over, by
misinterpreting and slighting the divine Scriptures, and the books of our
thrice-blessed Father, and our teacher Apollinarius, since your own documents,
which you composed, refute you, [written] to deceive and to snare simpler
souls, to your own injury,<a href="#_ftn117" name="_ftnref117" title="">[117]</a>
since you were opposed to the truth. And you know that 'it is hard for you to
kick against the goads,'<a href="#_ftn118" name="_ftnref118" title="">[118]</a>and
you used a very roundabout [argument].<a href="#_ftn119" name="_ftnref119"
title="">[119]</a>
And just as the Jews committed a transgression, so also you take offence
because of the flesh of [our] Savior. And even if you are many, you shall be
reckoned as nothing because of your impiety.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If
you would remove your meddlesomeness and faithlessness from your soul, you
would understand that God appeared in a body, [<i>M. 1957</i>]giving [the]
body the opportunity to participate<a href="#_ftn120" name="_ftnref120" title="">[120]</a>
in the divine-nature.<a href="#_ftn121" name="_ftnref121" title="">[121]</a> For the body that was taken up from the holy virgin does
not itself by itself give salvation, but [salvation comes] from its association<a href="#_ftn122" name="_ftnref122"
title="">[122]</a> with the Spirit, not in order that
the body might be disparaged, but that the Spirit might be supremely praised.
Do not, then, to the deception of simpler souls, be willing to write into your
own blasphemous juxtaposition<a href="#_ftn123" name="_ftnref123" title="">[123]</a>
the juxtapositions of our thrice</span></span>-blessed father and teacher Apollinarius.<a href="#_ftn124"
name="_ftnref124" title="">[124]</a> For the
latter<a href="#_ftn125" name="_ftnref125" title="">[125]</a>
were presented<a href="#_ftn126" name="_ftnref126" title="">[126]</a>
correctly and piously by the holy and God-bearing<a href="#_ftn127"
name="_ftnref127" title="">[127]</a> man, for
they<a href="#_ftn128" name="_ftnref128" title="">[128]</a>
are concerned with [the] condition<a href="#_ftn129" name="_ftnref129" title="">[129]</a>
and honor [of each element], but do not denote [their respective] nature.<a
href="#_ftn130" name="_ftnref130" title="">[130]</a> These
things which make clear 'the being of the same substance'<a href="#_ftn131"
name="_ftnref131" title="">[131]</a> are the
very things which you faithlessly and impiously juxtaposed.<a href="#_ftn132"
name="_ftnref132" title="">[132]</a> For
nature<a href="#_ftn133" name="_ftnref133" title="">[133]</a>
and substance<a href="#_ftn134" name="_ftnref134" title="">[134]</a>
are the same thing, as I said before, and all who are confessors of the true
faith recognize this. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you, moved by strife and jealousy and
diabolical envy from the very beginning against the holy bishops, and having
contended in a most wicked contest against the truth, causing schisms in the
Church of Christ - you have turned to such impiety when you say that the body
that is subject to change<a href="#_ftn135" name="_ftnref135" title="">[135]</a>
is of the same substance as the impassible<a href="#_ftn136" name="_ftnref136"
title="">[136]</a> divine-nature on account of the
union (which is impossible and impious), a body that is of the same substance
as man, even saying that it is of the same substance as God. And how "will they
look to the one whom they have pierced?"<a href="#_ftn137" name="_ftnref137"
title="">[137]</a> For if the visible body is of the
same substance as the invisible divine-nature, as you say, each would, of
course, then be invisible, according to what is written, "No one has ever seen
God, nor is he able to see [Him]."<a href="#_ftn138" name="_ftnref138" title="">[138]</a>
Our Lord Jesus Christ is invisible according to the divine-nature that He has
had eternally from the Father, but is visible according to the flesh which He
wore from the virgin. Let both of these be placed together on one person<a
href="#_ftn139" name="_ftnref139" title="">[139]</a> and the
truth will not be broken. And so, Christ is neither two persons, nor is His
flesh of the same substance as God, but it is ruled by the Word of God. </span></p>

<p>However many of us, then, are confessors of this
unadulterated and true and apostolic faith, let us not receive the profane,
foolish blabberings of those around Timothy and Polemius and of those with
them, in accord with the Apostle's command.<a href="#_ftn140" name="_ftnref140"
title="">[140]</a> And we keep in mind what was again
spoken by him: "After one or two admonitions, avoid the factious man, knowing
that such a man is perverted, and he sins as one who is self-condemned."<a
href="#_ftn141" name="_ftnref141" title="">[141]</a> And those
around Timothy and Polemius have not only appeared as factious men, but also as
sycophants. For our thrice-blessed teacher Apollinarius called those who say
that the body of our Lord is of the same substance as the divine-nature blasphemous
and crazy. And blessed Athanasius, our most holy bishop, was wont to say that
those who dared to say that the body from Mary was of the same substance as the
divine-nature were from Hades. Timothy and his teacher Polemius and those with
them, were quite unaware that, because the divine Word was one person, and
because the flesh came into existence by means [<i>M. 1960</i>]&nbsp;of the
divine Word, adoration<a href="#_ftn142" name="_ftnref142" title="">[142]</a>
is [directed] toward God incarnated, but the adoration is not [directed] toward
the flesh. For the Word is not worshipped because of the flesh, but the flesh
is worshipped together with the Word, as a robe and covering, as I said before.
However many, then, are not in agreement with this rule [of faith],<a
href="#_ftn143" name="_ftnref143" title="">[143]</a> and with
this true, apostolic, unadulterated faith, let them be anathema. "Behold,
therefore, the dogs, behold the evil workers, behold the mutilation. For we are
the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God in Christ Jesus, and who do
not put their faith in [the] flesh."<a href="#_ftn144" name="_ftnref144"
title="">[144]</a> </span></p>



<p><i>From Timothy an Apollinarian, bishop of Berytus, to
Homonius, the bishop and himself an Apollinarian, in which there are
testimonies of Apollinarius. </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After our&nbsp; brother Agapius came to us andheard this from [a
work] of mine that was composed among us concerning
the divine incarnation of the Word, from various books of our thrice-blessed
teacher, the bishop Apollinarius, he encouraged us to take a passage from it
and to privately expound it to him with our own signature,<a href="#_ftn145"
name="_ftnref145" title="">[145]</a> for your
assurance. And so we did this, excerpting the following [passages] from his
letter written to Sarapion.</span>You yourself, then, also correctly say, 'We and Christ are
not equal.' To say that His flesh is not of the same substance as us, since it
is the flesh of God, needs a little further distinction. For it is better to
say that, on the one hand, He took on flesh that was of the same substance as
us in nature, but that, on the other hand, He rendered it divine in the union.
And you also say this, namely, that in this regard, [His flesh] is not of the
same substance as us, since it is the flesh of God, but making a further
distinction, one might say that, on the one hand, in nature His flesh is of the
same substance as us, but that, on the other hand, in the union it is divine,
and through the union it remains distinct. After our aforementioned brother
received these things, he went to you and made them known to you. You, our
master Homonius, saw these very things and, after writing [a message], you gave
him a writing tablet containing the following: 'I, Homonius the bishop, confess
that the Word of God received flesh from Mary of the same substance as us. But
if anyone should say that the flesh that was united to the Lord is, by any
means of reasoning,<a href="#_ftn146" name="_ftnref146" title="">[146]</a>
of the same substance as God, we anathematize [him].' </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although, then, you correctly confessed, on the
one hand, the nature of the flesh, saying that it is of the same substance as
us, but that, on the other hand, you anathematized its complete union with the
incarnate Word, since you wrote that, in no way is it<a href="#_ftn147"
name="_ftnref147" title="">[147]</a> inherently
connected with the divine-nature, but you only professed the union, such a
union as a holy man might possess with God &mdash; not a man who is bound to one life
and one hypostasis,<a href="#_ftn148" name="_ftnref148" title="">[148]</a>
but [a man] who is seen in the separation from the divine&mdash;nature.&nbsp; And yet,
since our blessed bishop [and] teacher Apollinarius said in various books that
the flesh of the Lord shares in both the names<a href="#_ftn149"
name="_ftnref149" title="">[149]</a> and
distinctive features<a href="#_ftn150" name="_ftnref150" title="">[150]</a>
of the Word, though the flesh remains in the union, neither undergoing any
change nor ceasing from its own nature &mdash; and that the Word shares in both the
names<a href="#_ftn151" name="_ftnref151" title="">[151]</a>
and distinctive features<a href="#_ftn152" name="_ftnref152" title="">[152]</a>
of the flesh, though it also remains Word and God in the incarnation, neither
changing nor having fallen into the nature of the body &mdash; consider it worthy to
make it clear to us whether [you wrote your message] ignorant of the things[<i>M.
1961</i>]that have been written about the holy and saving incarnation
of the Word from our Christ-bearing Father.&nbsp; You anathematized these things,
either, on the one hand, understanding [them], and you rejected them as if they
were not correctly spoken, and you slandered us in this department<a
href="#_ftn153" name="_ftnref153" title="">[153]</a> as having
accepted a heresy; and you anathematized the herald of piety together with
piety itself. For he said, in the work whose beginning is 'Holy:' 'From the
beginning Christ is correctly confessed in regard to His body in this way, and
it is not possible separately to say that the body is a created thing, wholly
inseparable from him whose body it is, but it shares in the name<a
href="#_ftn154" name="_ftnref154" title="">[154]</a> of the
uncreated and in the name<a href="#_ftn155" name="_ftnref155" title="">[155]</a>
of God, because it has been joined in a union with God.'"</span></p>

<p><i>And after other </i>[<i>things</i>]<i>.</i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this way, too, He is of the same substance
as God with regard to the invisible Spirit, since the flesh also takes part in
the name,<a href="#_ftn156" name="_ftnref156" title="">[156]</a>
since it has been joined to God, who is of the same substance."</span></p>



<p><i>And again.</i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is of the same substance as us since the
divine-nature<a href="#_ftn157" name="_ftnref157" title="">[157]</a>
is also included in the body, because &#919;e was united with that which is of
the same substance as us. The nature<a href="#_ftn158" name="_ftnref158"
title="">[158]</a> of the body is not changed in the
union with God, [a union] of the same substance, nor in the fellowship<a
href="#_ftn159" name="_ftnref159" title="">[159]</a> of the
name<a href="#_ftn160" name="_ftnref160" title="">[160]</a>
that is of the same substance. In this same way, the nature<a href="#_ftn161"
name="_ftnref161" title="">[161]</a> of the
divine-nature<a href="#_ftn162" name="_ftnref162" title="">[162]</a>
has not been changed in the fellowship<a href="#_ftn163" name="_ftnref163"
title="">[163]</a> with the human body and in the
designation<a href="#_ftn164" name="_ftnref164" title="">[164]</a>
of the flesh that is of the same substance as us." </span></p>



<p><i>And again in another work whose beginning is, "Flesh and
the one person<a href="#_ftn165" name="_ftnref165" title=""><b>[165]</b></a> that governs the flesh," he
says the following: </span></i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ is, as God,
without sin, and with flesh, the Creator from before time, of the same
substance as the only God. The flesh, since it is the flesh of God, is divine,
since it is of the same substance as God, a part united with Him, of the same
substance as God [and] not separated, for it neither moves separately or
independently, just as a human is a self-motivated<a href="#_ftn166"
name="_ftnref166" title="">[166]</a> animal.<a
href="#_ftn167" name="_ftnref167" title="">[167]</a> For, on
the one hand, in the fellowship<a href="#_ftn168" name="_ftnref168" title="">[168]</a>
with the flesh, God, who is not, by Himself, human, is human. On the other
hand, in the fellowship<a href="#_ftn169" name="_ftnref169" title="">[169]</a>
with God, the flesh, which is not, by itself, divine, is divine. And, in union
with flesh God possesses all the things that are in accord with the flesh and,
in the union with God, the flesh receives the characteristics of God."<a
href="#_ftn170" name="_ftnref170" title="">[170]</a></span></p>



<p><i>Again in another work titled, "Eulogy of Mary, and on the
incarnation," he says the following:</i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "[He]<a href="#_ftn171" name="_ftnref171"
title="">[171]</a> sees the body as greater on account
of who was united</span>[to it], greater, I say, not only than his
own body, but also than the angelic fires, for God was joined to none of them.
For none, none of those bodies gives life to the world.<a href="#_ftn172"
name="_ftnref172" title="">[172]</a> None of
the angels is made equal to God, as the One who was composed<a href="#_ftn173"
name="_ftnref173" title="">[173]</a> of body
and divinity. He makes himself equal to God when he says, "Just as the Father
has life in himself, thus did he also grant it to the Son to have life in
himself."<a href="#_ftn174" name="_ftnref174" title="">[174]</a>
</span></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><i>And after other </i>[<i>things</i>]<i> again.</i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And although, on the one hand, you know that
the Spirit is working a work<a href="#_ftn175" name="_ftnref175" title="">[175]</a>
in you [<i>M. 1964</i>] as could also be separated [from you], do you consider
yourself divine, with the result that your robe, even after it is removed from
your body, has the power to heal maladies? That which was inseparably attached
to God, [and which] became the same thing </span>asHim because of the real<a
href="#_ftn176" name="_ftnref176" title="">[176]</a> union,
for "The Word," he says, "became flesh" &mdash; do you suppose that this<a
href="#_ftn177" name="_ftnref177" title="">[177]</a> is
neither divine nor God?"<a href="#_ftn178" name="_ftnref178" title="">[178]</a></span></p>



<p><i>Again in another work, whose beginning is, "God does not
have the pleasure of eating flesh,"</i><i>he says
the following: </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not the case that both [elements] are
from heaven, but [one] is united with the heavenly [element], and there is one
person<a href="#_ftn179" name="_ftnref179" title="">[179]</a>
with [it] that became heavenly accordingly to the union, and &#919;e is adored
with the adoration of the heavenly God, and as heavenly He saves by the power
of the heavenly One." </span></p>



<p><i>And from the letter to Dionysius, whose beginning is, "To
me, piety is </i>[<i>the</i>]<i>
foundation of friendship," after a few other things he says the following:<a
href="#_ftn180" name="_ftnref180" title=""><b>[180]</b></a></i></span></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is clear from what
we have always written that no one can accuse<a href="#_ftn181"
name="_ftnref181" title="">[181]</a> us of those things
which are said against some [people], since we do not say either that the flesh
of our savior is from heaven, or that His<a href="#_ftn182" name="_ftnref182"
title="">[182]</a>
flesh is of the same substance as God, inasmuch as it is flesh and not divine,
and that it is divine inasmuch as it is united to the divine<a href="#_ftn183"
name="_ftnref183" title="">[183]</a> in one person.<a
href="#_ftn184" name="_ftnref184" title="">[184]</a>"</span></p>



<p><i>Again in another work whose beginning is, "We rightly
glorify our Lord Jesus Christ," he says the following near the end: </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "*When<a href="#_ftn185" name="_ftnref185"
title="">[185]</a> Christ was living, His body was
permeated by God's spirit,* and [the] spirit in [the] flesh was divine, [that
it, it was] heavenly mind, of which we pray to partake, according to the verse,
'We have the mind of Christ.'<a href="#_ftn186" name="_ftnref186" title="">[186]</a>
[The] holy flesh is of </span>like nature<a href="#_ftn187"
name="_ftnref187" title="">[187]</a> to the divine-nature, establishing divinity<a
href="#_ftn188" name="_ftnref188" title="">[188]</a> in<a
href="#_ftn189" name="_ftnref189" title="">[189]</a> those who
partake of it, [the] foundation of eternal life, the originator of immortality
for men,<a href="#_ftn190" name="_ftnref190" title="">[190]</a>
Creator of an eternal creation, Father of the age to come." </span></span></p>



<p><i>Again in another syllogistic work, composed for John the
Evangelist,<a href="#_ftn191" name="_ftnref191" title=""><b>[191]</b></a>whose beginning is, "All things
came into being through the Word," according to the Evangelist, he says the
following:</span></i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is He not the true God, who says, 'I am
with you for so much time, and have you not recognized me, Philip?'<a
href="#_ftn192" name="_ftnref192" title="">[192]</a> [thereby]
making known His time spent as a man with men in so much time,<a href="#_ftn193"
name="_ftnref193" title="">[193]</a> and
showing the man [to be] divine.<a href="#_ftn194" name="_ftnref194" title="">[194]</a>
And so we must not be ashamed to say that such a man is of the same substance
as God, who is revealed by the paternal form<a href="#_ftn195" name="_ftnref195"
title="">[195]</a> of [his] divinity, just like the
material for the body."<a href="#_ftn196" name="_ftnref196" title="">[196]</a></span></p>



<p><i>Again in the next place he says the following.</i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The
fact of being in equality with God, an equality that is both efficient<a
href="#_ftn197" name="_ftnref197" title="">[197]</a> and renewing, does
not make the divine human<a href="#_ftn198" name="_ftnref198" title="">[198]</a>
with respect to the body, [for] it is impossible that, in the equality with
God, there be another nature of Christ, [that is], the human [nature], to be
subject to the limitations of humanity,<a href="#_ftn199" name="_ftnref199"
title="">[199]</a>
as if [the] body were of a human and not of God."</span></p>



<p><i>And again in another syllogistic work, whose beginning is,
"That which possesses a different life </i>[<i>possesses</i>]<i> a different action," he says the
following. </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His flesh gives us life because of the
divinity<a href="#_ftn200" name="_ftnref200" title="">[200]</a>
that is united with it, for that which gives life is divine. [<i>M. 1965</i>]Therefore, the flesh is divine because it was united with God. And, on the
one hand, this saves, and we, on the other hand, are saved by partaking of it
as if it were food. That which causes growth,<a href="#_ftn201"
name="_ftnref201" title="">[201]</a> since it
is active in what is being nourished, is of the same substance and is not
nourished. Similarly, if that which gives life is not made alive in a manner
similar to that which is made alive, it is not of the same substance as it. For
otherwise it would be a body susceptible to death<a href="#_ftn202"
name="_ftnref202" title="">[202]</a> like our
own, in need of being made alive. But it is not a body susceptible to death,
but Christ's body [is a body] of life. The divine,<a href="#_ftn203"
name="_ftnref203" title="">[203]</a>
consequently, is not of the same substance as [that which is] human."</span></p>

<p><i>And in the work to Flavius, whose beginning is, "And still
even now Christ is being struck by vile men," after many other things he says: </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So much more do the specific natures of the
elements that were united<a href="#_ftn204" name="_ftnref204" title="">[204]</a>
remain in the mixing of the body with body.<a href="#_ftn205" name="_ftnref205"
title="">[205]</a> For the body is indeed body, and
the incorporeal, incorporeal. God is said to have become corporeal in the
perfect union, and the body [is said] to have been deified.<a href="#_ftn206"
name="_ftnref206" title="">[206]</a> And to
what extent God, on the one hand, who has become corporeal, is human, --
&#919;e is both. And to what extent the body, which has been deified,<a
href="#_ftn207" name="_ftnref207" title="">[207]</a> [is
divine,] -- again it is both."</span></p>



<p><i>And then, a little later, he says the following:</i></p>



<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>"Already
the body has ceased from being formed and from being in the form of a slave.
But it is glorified in the natural union with that which is unformed, and in
accord with the birth itself from the virgin.And in this regard it has
not changed from being formed into that which is uncreated, but it has been
united with that which is uncreated. And, being divine<a href="#_ftn208"
name="_ftnref208" title="">[208]</a> according
to the union with God, it is uncreated insofar as it is divine.<a
href="#_ftn209" name="_ftnref209" title="">[209]</a> And since
[the] body could not arise from the Father<a href="#_ftn210" name="_ftnref210"
title="">[210]</a> (for the Father is not made
corporeal), in this regard, it would never be called unbegotten,<a
href="#_ftn211" name="_ftnref211" title="">[211]</a> nor
unbegotten in its own nature,<a href="#_ftn212" name="_ftnref212" title="">[212]</a>
as a son or offspring, in the natural union with the begotten son from the
beginning."</span></p>



<p><i>And in the work against Diodorus, in the first </i>[<i>book</i>]<i> after the treatise on the
Trinity, in chapter 14 he says the following:</i></p>



<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>"It
was a remarkable and wondrous event and happened once, and not a second time:
the union of God with flesh. And this your own soul never accepts, nor [the
souls] of those who lead you into this impiety andinfidelity of [the] anti-Christ.&nbsp; And you mock the perfect union, and
you say, 'The distinctive properties<a href="#_ftn213" name="_ftnref213"
title="">[213]</a> of God, and the distinctive
properties<a href="#_ftn214" name="_ftnref214" title="">[214]</a>
of the flesh no longer remain, if there is a union, </span>but that the perfect
union of David is broken,if we confess the
perfect union according to the flesh from David.'"<a
href="#_ftn215" name="_ftnref215" title="">[215]</a> </span></p>



<p><i>And in the 27<sup>th</sup>
chapter he says: </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are, at any rate, vexed by the fact that,
by the grace of God, we do not admit that that which is of David's seed took on
immortality. And if we are asked for the reason, we say, 'Because of the perfect
union.'" </p>



<p><i>Again in the 61<sup>st</sup>
chapter. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is not shameful to say, on the one hand,
that the nature<a href="#_ftn216" name="_ftnref216" title="">[216]</a>
is the same, but that, on the other hand, the origin<a href="#_ftn217"
name="_ftnref217" title="">[217]</a> is
different. For it is vain and superfluous to introduce the virgin birth, if
that which was born should not be worthy of the birth, but [be] the same as
those who are born from a man and a woman. You are mocking the perfect union as
if it were perfect impiety, which the divine Scriptures clearly [<i>M. 1968</i>]introduce, neither making the human part of God destructive<a
href="#_ftn218" name="_ftnref218" title="">[218]</a> [of the
divine], nor overthrowing the human part by the divine." </span></p>

<p><i>And in the second
book against the same Diodorus,
in chapter 22, he says: </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And since you exhort us to answer how that
which is from the divine substance<a href="#_ftn219" name="_ftnref219" title="">[219]</a>
is the seed of David, listen: in regard to the incarnation, how is that which
is created uncreated? By being united with the uncreated. How is the fruit of
David's loins the Creator of [the] Creator? By having been united with the
Creator. How is that which is from Abraham before Abraham? By having been
united with what was before Abraham." </span></p>



<p><i>And in the 36<sup>th</sup>
chapter of the same work. </i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But let him who spouts this nonsense say how
that which has been joined to God in union with [His] person<a href="#_ftn220"
name="_ftnref220" title="">[220]</a> is not
divine<a href="#_ftn221" name="_ftnref221" title="">[221]</a>
with Him? How is that which was united with the uncreated in a living union not
uncreated with Him? For if the name<a href="#_ftn222" name="_ftnref222" title="">[222]</a>
was not shared, there would in no way be such a mixing. But it would be the
most illogical thing of all if, on the one hand, we named that which is
incorporeal by the [properties] of the body, saying 'the Word became flesh.'<a
href="#_ftn223" name="_ftnref223" title="">[223]</a> And on
the other hand, let us not call the body by the [properties] of the
incorporeal, but rather according to the union with it. And if someone wonders
how the created is united with the name<a href="#_ftn224" name="_ftnref224"
title="">[224]</a> of the uncreated, another will
justly wonder still yet more how the uncreated has been united with the name<a
href="#_ftn225" name="_ftnref225" title="">[225]</a> of the
created flesh." </span></p>



<p><i>And in the epilogue
of the same work he says: </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the Word is called flesh on account of the
union, then the flesh [must] be called Word on account of the union. As the
Word is [uncreated], so [the flesh], too, is uncreated, not because it wasn't
created, but because it appeared as Word from the union." </p>



<p><i>Again in the
following </i>[<i>place</i>]<i> he
says thus:</i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As humans are of the same substance as
irrational animals in regard to the irrational body, yet are of a different
substance<a href="#_ftn226" name="_ftnref226" title="">[226]</a>
insomuch as they are rational, so too the Lord is of the same substance as
humans with respect to the flesh, but is of a different substance inasmuch as
He is Word and divine.<a href="#_ftn227" name="_ftnref227" title="">[227]</a>"</span></p>



<p><i>And in a syllogistic work, whose beginning is, "Whatever
two things are joined, they remain as two either in form or concord," he says
the following. </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A tool,<a href="#_ftn228" name="_ftnref228"
title="">[228]</a> and that which causes movement,<a
href="#_ftn229" name="_ftnref229" title="">[229]</a> by nature
complete one operation. What has one operation also has one substance.<a
href="#_ftn230" name="_ftnref230" title="">[230]</a>
Accordingly, there is one substance of the Word and of the tool." </span></p>



<p><i>Again in a dialogue, whose beginning is, "You say that
Christ is God or man," after the first few things, when his opponent has asked
how the body is God and Creator and Master, he answers by saying: </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the body of God and [the] Creator and [the]
Master possesses a unity, which we have not discovered to be of man with God." </p>

<p><i>&nbsp;</i>[<i>M.
1969</i>]<i> Again in a work whose beginning is, "Let us guard the goodness of </i>[<i>the</i>]<i>
faith," he says the following near the end.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O you truly wretched and low-souled men, who

small! For those who are not wholly ignorant even these things are enough [to
demonstrate] that the letters that are published under the name of Julius,
except those which Athanasius and the historians mention from among his
letters, are the letters of Apollinarius. For Apollinarius' own disciples are
older than all who made use of these [letters], non only [older than] the
schismatics of Julian (as is reasonable), but also [older than] the orthodox,
some of whom, mislead by the title<a href="#_ftn232" name="_ftnref232" title="">[232]</a>
of these [letters], maintained in equal measure both in thinking and saying
that these letters were orthodox<a href="#_ftn233" name="_ftnref233" title="">[233]</a>
because of the credibility of the author. And especially, more than all the
orthodox, it is reasonable that these men should know the works of their own
teacher. But in order that we may recognize his<a href="#_ftn234"
name="_ftnref234" title="">[234]</a> work
works (even if some falsely ascribe them to Julius and to Athanasius), not only
from his own disciples, but also from the consistency of the works, and from
their character, bring forth passages of his works in addition to what his own
disciples brought forward, and let us compare his works whole and compete, for
the complete assurance of those who, loving truth, read the agreement between<a
href="#_ftn235" name="_ftnref235" title="">[235]</a> both
these works and those which bear false headings.</span></p>



<p><i>From an old copy of </i>[<i>a work of</i>]<i> Apollinarius that was discovered in
the library of Andrew, the bishop, beloved by God</i>,<a href="#_ftn236"
name="_ftnref236" title="">[236]</a>
<i> of the Church of the Sidonians. </i></span></p>



<p><i>"To the highly honored masters, </i>[<i>the</i>]<i> bishops in Diocaesarea,
greetings in </i>[<i>the</i>]<i> Lord. </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After we had sent our letter of honor, we were
expecting that we would likewise obtain [letters] from Your Charity, O most
honored masters, such as [we] always [received] from the blessed bishop
Athanasius, who knew us to be in agreement with his teachings and obedient in
every regard. But since you didn't write back (reasoning that the length of the
letter didn't render our opinion clear to you), behold, we are writing what is
manifestly in accord with both our and your shared teacher &mdash; I am saying these
things concerning the divine incarnation, since, on account of these things, a
great tumult was set into motion, not by us, but by others whom I shall pass
over in silence. We confess that the Word of God did not come upon a holy man,<a
href="#_ftn237" name="_ftnref237" title="">[237]</a> [an event
which occurred] among the prophets,<a href="#_ftn238" name="_ftnref238" title="">[238]</a>
but that the Word itself became flesh, without having taken on a human mind,
which is fickle and made prisoner by foul thoughts, but a divine mind,
steadfast and heavenly. And for this reason, our savior didn't possess a body
that was lifeless, devoid of feeling, and unintelligent, for neither was His
body able to be unintelligent when the Lord became human on our account. Since
He was truly [the] Son of God, He also became Son of man. And, since he was the
only begotten Son of God, He also became the firstborn among many brothers. And
so, the Son of God who was before Abraham was not one, and the [Son] after
Abraham another, but [He is the] one, perfect, only begotten of God. And He is
perfect by divine perfection, and not by a human [perfection]. We confess that
we have fellowship with those who are thusly minded [<i>M. 1972</i>], but with
those who think and write otherwise we have no fellowship."</span></p>

<p><i>From the same </i>[<i>work</i>]<i>, from the Faith, in part. </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since some have greatly troubled us by
attempting to overturn our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ by representing Him
as God incarnate, a man united with God, for this reason we are making a
confession concerning the aforementioned faith, rejecting the faithless
confession, and its specious appearance, where it says that God took on a
complete man, since a complete man is not, according to the Scriptures, free
from sin in the present life, because he is unable to bring his own operations<a
href="#_ftn239" name="_ftnref239" title="">[239]</a> in line
with the divine operations, and, for this reason, he is not free from death.
But God, united with human flesh, possesses His own operation pure, since his
mind is unconquered by spiritual and carnal passions, and since he leads His
flesh and His carnal movements<a href="#_ftn240" name="_ftnref240" title="">[240]</a>
divinely and without sin. And not only is He unsubdued by death, but He also
destroys death. And there is One with a true and divine perfection.&nbsp; Two
persons,<a href="#_ftn241" name="_ftnref241" title="">[241]</a>
and two natures,<a href="#_ftn242" name="_ftnref242" title="">[242]</a>
are not perfect by themselves; for it is not right to say that there are two
Sons, or to worship four</span> (God, [the] Son of
God, [the] Son of man, and the Holy Spirit), nor to glorify man before the Holy
Spirit. And so we, too, anathematize as impious those who place man in the
divine doxology together with God and with the Son before the Spirit.&nbsp; We say
that each one of us is a complete man being received by God for salvation, each
one of us who are being sanctified and are receiving the likeness of the
heavenly man, and who are being made divine in the likeness of Him who is truly
God by nature, according to [the] flesh of [the] man, our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>



<p><i>And in the preceding
chapter.</i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We confess [the] one true God as sole ruler,
and that [the] one true Son is from the true God, by nature possessing the
paternal divinity, that is, being of the same substance as God. And we confess
on Holy Spirit, in nature and in truth, which sanctifies and deifies all, being
of the substance<a href="#_ftn243" name="_ftnref243" title="">[243]</a>
of God through the Son. And those who say that either the Son or the Holy
Spirit is a creation, we anathematize, as well as those who assert that the Son
or the Spirit never existed. We confess all created things as subject and
created by God through [the] Son, and sanctified by the Holy Spirit. [And]
still we confess that the Son of God became [the] Son of man, not in name but
in truth taking up flesh from the virgin Mary, and that He is one [and]
perfect, not two perfect [elements] united together, himself [the] Son of God
and [the] Son of man, one hypostasis,<a href="#_ftn244" name="_ftnref244"
title="">[244]</a> and one person,<a href="#_ftn245"
name="_ftnref245" title="">[245]</a> and [we
confess] that the worship of the Word and the flesh is one. And we anathematize
those who say that there are two, and who perform different [types of]
adorations [<i>M. 1973</i>], one divine and one human, and those who worship
the man from Mary as if he were another in addition to the God from God. We
confess the suffering of Christ in the flesh, His resurrection by the power of
His divinity, His ascent into Heaven, His coming glorious advent for [the]
judgment of the living and the dead, and for [the] eternal life of the
sanctified." </span></p>



<p><i>From the same Apollinarius, from the work, "For the
tradition of renunciation and faith," whose beginning is, "The Devil, after
deceiving him, possessed the man who fell from God." </i></p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the same man is completely human and
divine, the pious mind, since, on the one hand, it does not worship the man,
but does, on the other hand, worship God, will be found to be both worshiping
and not worshiping the same person,<a href="#_ftn246" name="_ftnref246" title="">[246]</a>
which is impossible. For while the man will not consider himself worthy of
worship, because he won't want to act impiously, God, on the other hand, knows
that He is worthy of worship. And it is impossible that the same person knows
that he is and is not worthy of worship. Accordingly, then, it is impossible
that the same one be both entirely divine and human, but [it is possible] in
the unity of the mixed divine and incarnate nature.<a href="#_ftn247"
name="_ftnref247" title="">[247]</a> And so
the worshipers look to God inseparable from the flesh, and they do not look to
one who, on the one hand, is not worthy of worship, and to another who, in
contrast, is worthy of worship. Nor is it in Him<a href="#_ftn248"
name="_ftnref248" title="">[248]</a> that the
one doesn't endure [himself] to be worshipped, while the other accepts the
worship which leads to [the] salvation of the worshippers. But in reality there
is One in accordance with one substance,<a href="#_ftn249" name="_ftnref249"
title="">[249]</a> and in no way are there two in two
persons<a href="#_ftn250" name="_ftnref250" title="">[250]</a>
who exist according to their own measures and their own merits."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that the person who has not determined
entirely to be contentious no longer thinks that he can contradict these things
with good reason, but that, straight away, (so as to speak freely<a
href="#_ftn251" name="_ftnref251" title="">[251]</a>) he is
obedient to the truth, and he agrees with all the decrees, that some of the
letters, which are falsely ascribed to Julius, Gregorius, and Athanasius,
belong to Apollinarius, or indeed concerning works on the incarnation. We need
not wonder, if even [from among] the associates of Valentius, and those of
Timothy, who are disciples of Apollinarius, some of them confess the 'same
substance,'<a href="#_ftn252" name="_ftnref252" title="">[252]</a>
while others deny it, and [if] both groups from the teacher contend against one
another. For indeed even Gregory the theologian<a href="#_ftn253"
name="_ftnref253" title="">[253]</a></span>expounds
some even more impious blasphemies of his<a href="#_ftn254" name="_ftnref254"
title="">[254]</a> in the letter to Nectarius, as if
they were from his<a href="#_ftn255" name="_ftnref255" title="">[255]</a>
works. "For," he says, "he affirms that the flesh that was taken up by the only
begotten Son in accordance with the dispensation<a href="#_ftn256"
name="_ftnref256" title="">[256]</a> is not
required for the transformation of our own nature,<a href="#_ftn257"
name="_ftnref257" title="">[257]</a> but that
that fleshly nature<a href="#_ftn258" name="_ftnref258" title="">[258]</a>
was in the Son from the beginning." <i>And after saying a few more things, he
adds: </i>"And this is not yet terrible, but the most difficult thing of all,
that he makes the only begotten God himself, the judge of all, the originator
of life [and] the destroyer of death, mortal, and that he received His
suffering with His own divinity, and in that death of his body, which lasted
for three days, His divinity was killed with the body, and in this way He arose
again from the Father's side from death. It would take a long time to go
through everything else he adds to such eccentricities."<a href="#_ftn259"
name="_ftnref259" title="">[259]</a> </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is no wonder, therefore, if by means of his
lesser impiety, saying that the body became of the same substance as the
divine-nature,<a href="#_ftn260" name="_ftnref260" title="">[260]</a>
[<i>M. 1976</i>] he advanced to greater impieties, adding ignorance to
ignorance and impiety to impiety. And Timothy appears rather to be a member with
those who boldly speak the forbidden impiety and wickedness.<a href="#_ftn261"
name="_ftnref261" title="">[261]</a> For
through this he was able to receive his commendatory letters from the great
Athanasius to the Westerners, as if he were zealous against the impiety of
Arius, and from them [he received] a letter to carry to the bishop. Yet his
fabrication did not go unnoticed forever. For a second time after Athanasius'
death, after he had again been sent to Rome, he received<a href="#_ftn262"
name="_ftnref262" title="">[262]</a> both his
own destruction, and that of the one who sent him, Apollinarius.</span></p>

John 1:1. The Apollinarian is here arguing from the fact that God is
invisible.&nbsp; If the flesh of Jesus is of the same substance as his Godhood, he

because of the difference in gender. &#963;&#940;&#961;&#958; [flesh] must be

including among them some of Apollinarius, hence tampering with Apollinarius'
ideas and presenting them in a corrupt fashion," or, "You are taking the
framework Apollinarius uses to discuss the relationship of Christ's body and
divinity, but turn it blasphemous by the introduction of ideas and changes not
from Apollinarius, since his own juxtapositions deal in the realm of 'condition

subject is stated in the text. The Latin introduces 'Mary' as the subject, but
this seems rather unlikely to be correct. First of all, why would Mary see 'the
body' greater than herself? Christ's body? But this makes little sense.
Secondly, there is a masculine/neuter <u>reflexive</u> possessive pronoun,
"greater, I say, not only than HIS/ITS [&#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#965;]
body, but also than angelic fires...." This particular reflexive pronoun reflects
the gender of the antecedent, and cannot be feminine, which would require
&#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8134;&#962; if 'Mary' were the subject. So, the antecedent
(the subject of the first verb, "[ ] sees,") must be either masculine or
neuter, and the neuter here makes little sense. It seems best, then, to supply
"He" for the first subject, only capitalized because it stands first in the
sentence, and "his," not capitalized, for the possessive pronoun.</p>
