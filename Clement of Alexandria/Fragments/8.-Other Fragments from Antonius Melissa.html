<FONT  SIZE=3>I.-Book I. Sermon 17, on Confession.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Repentance then becomes capable of wiping out every sin, when on the occurrence of the soul's fault it admits no delay, and does not let the impulse pass on to a long space of time. For it is in this way that evil will be unable to leave a trace in us, being plucked away at the moment of its assault like a newly planted plant.</P>

<P>As the creatures called crabs are easy to catch, from their going sometimes forward and sometimes backward; so also the soul, which at one time is laughing, at another weeping, and at another giving way to luxury, can do no good.</P>

<P>He who is sometimes grieving, and is sometimes enjoying himself and laughing, is like a man pelting the dog of voluptuousness with bread, who chases it in appearance, but in fact invites it to remain near him.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>2. Book I. Sermon 51, on Praise.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>Some flatterers were congratulating a wise man. He said to them, If you stop praising me, I think myself something great after your departure; but if you do not stop praising me, I guess my own impurity.</P>

<P>Feigned praise is worth less than true censure. </P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>3. Book II. Sermon 46, on the Lazy and Indolent.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>To the weak and infirm, what is moderate appears excessive.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>4. Book II. Sermon 55, on Your Neighbour-That You are to Bear His Burdens, Etc.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>The reproof that is given with knowledge is very faithful. Sometimes also the knowledge of those who are condemned is found to be the most perfect demonstration.</P>

</UL><P>To the man who exalts and magnifies himself is attached the quick transition and the fall to low estate, as the divine word teaches.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>6. Book II. Sermon 87.</FONT></P>

  </UL><P>Pure speech and a spotless life are the throne and true temple of God.</P>
