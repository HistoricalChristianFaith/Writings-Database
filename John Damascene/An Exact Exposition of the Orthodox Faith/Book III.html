was thus snared by the assault of the arch-fiend, and broke his Creator&#8217;s
command, and was stripped of grace and put off his confidence with God, and
covered himself with the asperities of a toilsome life (for this is the meaning
of the fig-leaves<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn1' href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>1</span></a> ); and was clothed about
with death, that is, mortality and the grossness of flesh (for this is what the
garment of skins signifies); and was banished from Paradise by God&#8217;s just
judgment, and condemned to death, and made subject to corruption. Yet,
notwithstanding all this, in His pity, God, Who gave him his being, and Who in
His graciousness bestowed on him a life of happiness, did not disregard man<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn2' href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>2</span></a> . But He first trained him in many ways
and called him back, by groans and trembling, by the deluge of water, and the
utter destruction of almost the whole race<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn3'
href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>3</span></a>
, by confusion and diversity of tongues<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn4'
href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>4</span></a>
, by the rule<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn5' href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>5</span></a> of angels<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn6' href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>6</span></a> , by the burning of cities<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn7' href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>7</span></a> , by figurative manifestations of God,
by wars and victories and defeats, by signs and wonders, by manifold faculties,
by the law and the prophets: for by all these means God earnestly strove to
emancipate man from the wide-spread and enslaving bonds of sin, which had made
life such a mass of iniquity, and to effect man&#8217;s return to a life of
happiness. For it was sin that brought death like a wild and savage beast into
the world<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn8' href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>8</span></a> to the ruin of the human life. But it
behoved the Redeemer to be without sin, and not made liable through sin to
death, and further, that His nature should be strengthened and renewed, and
trained by labour and taught the way of virtue which leads away from corruption
to the life eternal and, in the end, is revealed the mighty ocean of love to
man that is about Him<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn9' href="#_edn9"
name="_ednref9" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>9</span></a> . For the
very Creator and Lord Himself undertakes a struggle<sup>1<a style='mso-endnote-id:
edn10' href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>0</span></a></sup> in behalf of the work of His own
hands, and learns by toil to become Master. And since the enemy snares man by
the hope of Godhead, he himself is snared in turn by the screen of flesh, and
so are shown at once the goodness and wisdom, the justice and might of God.
God&#8217;s goodness is revealed in that He did not disregard<sup>1<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn11' href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>1</span></a></sup> the frailty of His own handiwork,
but was moved with compassion for him in his fall, and stretched forth His hand
to him: and His justice in that when man was overcome He did not make another
victorious over the tyrant, nor did He snatch man by might from death, but in
His goodness and justice He made him, who had become through his sins the slave
of death, himself once more conqueror and rescued like by like, most difficult
though it seemed: and His wisdom is seen in His devising the most fitting
solution of the difficulty<sup>1<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn12' href="#_edn12"
name="_ednref12" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>2</span></a></sup> .
For by the good pleasure of our God and Father, the Only-begotten Son and Word
of God and God, Who is in the bosom of the God and Father<sup>1<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn13' href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>3</span></a></sup> , of like essence with the Father
and the Holy Spirit, Who was before the ages, Who is without beginning and was
in the beginning, Who is in the presence of the God and Father, and is God and
made in the form of God<sup>1<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn14' href="#_edn14"
name="_ednref14" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>4</span></a></sup> ,
bent the heavens and descended to earth: that is to say, He humbled without
humiliation His lofty station which yet could not be humbled, and condescends
to His servants<sup>1<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn15' href="#_edn15"
name="_ednref15" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>5</span></a></sup> ,
with a condescension ineffable and incomprehensible: (for that is what the
descent signifies). And God being perfect becomes perfect man, and brings to
perfection the newest of all new things<sup>1<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn16'
href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>6</span></a></sup>
, the only new thing under the Sun, through which the boundless might of God is
manifested. For what greater thing is there, than that God should become Man?
And the Word became flesh without being changed, of the Holy Spirit, and Mary
the holy and ever-virgin one, the mother of God. And He acts as mediator
between God and man, He theonly lover of man conceived in the Virgin&#8217;s chaste
womb without will<sup>1<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn17' href="#_edn17"
name="_ednref17" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>7</span></a></sup> or
desire, or any connection with man or pleasurable generation, but through the
Holy Spirit and the first offspring of Adam. And He becomes obedient to the
Father Who is like unto us, and finds a remedy for our disobedience in what He
had assumed from us, and became a pattern of obedience to us without which it
is not possible to obtain salvation<sup>1<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn18'

href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>1</span></a></sup>
, as the divine apostle said: but about this we will speak more accurately
later. And bearing glad tidings to her, he said, <i>Hail thou highly favoured
one, the Lord is with thee</i><sup>2<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn22'
href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>2</span></a></sup>
. And she was troubled at his word, and the angel said to her, <i>Fear not,
Mary, for thou hast found favour with God, and shalt bring forth a Son and
shalt call His name Jesus</i><sup>2<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn23'
href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>3</span></a></sup>

edn24' href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span

the interpretation Saviour. And when she asked in her perplexity, <i>How can
this be, seeing I know not a man</i><sup>2<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn25'
href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>5</span></a></sup>

the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing
which shall be born of thee</i><sup>2<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn26'
href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>6</span></a></sup><i>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>So then, after the assent of the holy Virgin, the
Holy Spirit descended on her, according to the word of the Lord which the angel
spoke, purifying her<sup>2<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn29' href="#_edn29"
name="_ednref29" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>9</span></a></sup> ,

to bring forth<sup>3<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn30' href="#_edn30"
name="_ednref30" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>0</span></a></sup> .
And then was she overshadowed<sup>3<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn31'
href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>1</span></a></sup>
by the enhypostatic Wisdom and Power of the most high God, the Son of God Who
is of like essence with the Father as of Divine seed, and from her holy and
most pure blood He formed flesh animated with the spirit of reason and thought,
the first-fruits of our compound nature<sup>3<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn32'
href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>2</span></a></sup>
: not by procreation but by creation through the Holy Spirit: not developing
the fashion of the body by gradual additions but perfecting it at once, He
Himself, the very Word of God, standing to the flesh in the relation of
subsistence. For the divine Word was not made one with flesh that had an
independent pre-existence<sup>3<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn33' href="#_edn33"
name="_ednref33" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>3</span></a></sup> ,
but taking up His abode in the womb of the holy Virgin, He unreservedly in His
own subsistence took upon Himself through the pure blood of the eternal Virgin
a body of flesh animated with the spirit of reason and thought, thus assuming
to Himself the first-fruits of man&#8217;s compound nature, Himself, the Word, having
become a subsistence in the flesh. So that<sup>3<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn34'
href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>4</span></a></sup>
He is at once flesh, and at the same time flesh of God the Word, and likewise
flesh animated, possessing both reason and thought<sup>3<a style='mso-endnote-id:
edn35' href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title=""><span

having become God, but of God as having become Man<sup>3<a style='mso-endnote-id:
edn36' href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>6</span></a></sup> . For being by nature perfect God,
He naturally became likewise perfect Man: and did not change His nature nor
make the dispensation<sup>3<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn37' href="#_edn37"
name="_ednref37" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>7</span></a></sup> an
empty show, but became, without confusion or change or division, one in
subsistence with the flesh, which was conceived of the holy Virgin, and
animated with reason and thought, and had found existence in Him, while He did
not change the nature of His divinity into the essence of flesh, nor the
essence of flesh into the nature of His divinity, and did not make one compound
nature out of His divine nature and the human nature He had assumed<sup>3<a

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>For the two natures were united with each other without
change or alteration, neither the divine nature departing from its native
simplicity, nor yet the human being either changed into the nature of God or
reduced to non-existence, nor one compound nature being produced out of the
two. For the compound nature<sup>4<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn40' href="#_edn40"
name="_ednref40" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>0</span></a></sup>
cannot be of the same essence as either of the natures out of which it is
compounded, as made one thing out of others: for example, the body is composed
of the four elements, but is not of the same essence as fire or air, or water
or earth, nor does it keep these names. If, therefore, after the union,
Christ&#8217;s nature was, as the heretics hold, a compound unity, He had changed
from a simple into a compound nature<sup>4<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn41'
href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>1</span></a></sup>
, and is not of the same essence as the Father Whose nature is simple, nor as
the mother, who is not a compound of divinity and humanity. Nor will He then be
in divinity and humanity: nor will He be called either God or Man, but simply
Christ: and the word Christ will be the name not of the subsistence, but of
what in their view is the one nature.<i><o:p/></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>We, however, do not give it as our view that Christ&#8217;s
nature is compound, nor yet that He is one thing made of other things and
differing from them as man is made of sold and body, or as the body is made of
the four elements, but hold<sup>4<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn42' href="#_edn42"
name="_ednref42" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>2</span></a></sup>
that, though He is constituted of these different parts He is yet the same<sup>4<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn43' href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>3</span></a></sup> . For we confess that He alike in
His divinity and in His humanity both is and is said to be perfect God, the
same Being, and that He consists of two natures, and exists in two natures<sup>4<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn44' href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>4</span></a></sup> . Further, by the word &#8220;Christ&#8221; we
understand the name of the subsistence, not in the sense of one kind, but as
signifying the existence of two natures. For in His own person He anointed
Himself; as God anointing His body with His own divinity, and as Man being
anointed. For He is Himself both God and Man. And the anointing is the divinity
of His humanity. For if Christ, being of one compound nature, is of like
essence to the Father, then the Father also must be compound and of like
essence with the flesh, which is absurd and extremely blasphemous<sup>4<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn45' href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title=""><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>How, indeed, could one and the same nature come to
embrace opposing and essential differences? For how is it possible that the
same nature should be at once created and uncreated, mortal and immortal,
circumscribed and uncircumscribed?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>But if those who declare that Christ has only one
nature should say also that that nature is a simple one, they must admit either
that He is God pure and simple, and thus reduce the incarnation to a mere
pretence, or that He is only man, according to Nestorius. And how then about
His being &#8220;perfect in divinity and perfect in humanity&#8221;? And when can Christ be
said to be of two natures, if they hold that He is of one composite nature
after the union? For it is surely clear to every one that before the union

are not looking to the question of soul and body. For when we compare together
the soul and the body it cannot be said that they are of one nature. But since
there are very many subsistences of men, and yet all have the same kind of
nature<sup>4<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn49' href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49"

composed of soul and body, and all have part in the nature of the soul, and
possess the essence of the body, and the common form: we speak of the one
nature of these very many and different subsistences; while each subsistence,
to wit, has two natures, and fulfils itself in two natures, namely, soul and
body.</p>

a common form cannot be admitted in the case of our Lord Jesus Christ. For
neither was there ever, nor is there, nor will there ever be another Christ
constituted of deity and humanity, and existing in deity and humanity at once
perfect God and perfect man. And thus in the case of our Lord Jesus Christ we
cannot speak of one nature made up of divinity and humanity, as we do in the

to do with an individual, but Christ is not an individual. For there is no
predicable form of Christlihood, so to speak, that He possesses. And therefore
we hold that there has been a union of two perfect natures, one divine and one
human; not with disorder or confusion, or intermixture<sup>5<a

or as a matter of dignity or agreement in will, or equality in honour, or
identity in name, or good pleasure, as Nestorius, hated of God, said, and
Diodorus and Theodorus of Mopsuestia, and their diabolical tribe: but by
synthesis; that is, in subsistence, without change or confusion or alteration
or difference or separation, and we confess that in two perfect natures there
is but one subsistence of the Son of God incarnate<sup>5<a style='mso-endnote-id:

the same subsistence belong ing to His divinity and His humanity, and granting
that the two natures are preserved in Him after the union, but we do not hold
that each is separate and by itself, but that they are united to each other in
one compound subsistence. For we look upon the union as essential, that is, as
true and not imaginary. We say that it is essential<sup>5<a style='mso-endnote-id:

two natures resulting in one compound nature, but in the sense of a true union
of them in one compound subsistence of the Son of God, and we hold that their
essential difference is preserved. For the created remaineth created, and the
uncreated, uncreated: the mortal remaineth mortal; the immortal, immortal: the
circumscribed, circumscribed: the uncircumscribed, uncircumscribed: the
visible, visible: the invisible, invisible. &#8220;The one part is all glorious with

became man, and both His wonders and His sufferings are known to us, although
His wonders were worked in His divine capacity, and His sufferings endured as
man. For we know that, just as is His one subsistence, so is the essential
difference of the nature preserved. For how could difference be preserved if
the very things that differ from one another are not preserved? For difference
is the difference between things that differ. In so far as Christ&#8217;s natures
differ from one another, that is, in the matter of essence, we hold that Christ
unites in Himself two extremes: in respect of His divinity He is connected with
the Father and the Spirit, while in respect of His humanity He is connected
with His mother and all mankind. And in so far as His natures are united, we
hold that He differs from the Father and the Spirit on the one hand, and from
the mother and the rest of mankind on the other. For the natures are united in
His subsistence, having one compound subsistence, in which He differs from the
Father and the Spirit, and also from the mother and us.</p>

of His humanity the properties of divinity: for we do not say that His flesh or
His humanity is uncreated. But when we speak of His subsistence, whether we
give it a name implying both natures, or one that refers to only one of them,
we still attribute to it the properties of both natures. For Christ, which name
implies both natures, is spoken of as at once God and man, created and
uncreated, subject to suffering anti incapable of suffering: and when He is
named Son of God and God, in reference to only one of His natures, He still
keeps the properties of the co-existing nature, that is, the flesh, being
spoken of as God who suffers, and as the Lord of Glory crucified<sup>6<a

divine nature, a child before the ages, and man who knew no beginning; it is
not, however, as child or man but as God that He is before the ages, and became
a child in the end. And Ibis is the manner of the mutual communication, either
nature giving in exchange to the other its own properties through the identity

nature, but hold that there are three subsistences actually existing, anti hold
that all things that are of nature and essence are simple, and recognise the
difference of the subsistences only in the three properties of independence of
cause and Fatherhood, of dependence on cause and Sonship, of dependence on
cause and procession<sup>7<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn71' href="#_edn71"

And we know further that these are indivisible and inseparable from each other
and united into one, and interpenetrating one another without confusion. Yea, I
repeat, united without confusion, for they are three although united, and they
are distinct, although inseparable. For although each has an independent
existence, that is to say, is a perfect subsistence and has an individuality of
its own, that is, has a special mode of existence, yet they are one in essence
and in the natural properties. and in being inseparable and indivisible from
the Father&#8217;s subsistence, and they both are and are said to be one God. In the
very same way, then, in the case of the divine and ineffable dispensation<sup>7<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn72' href="#_edn72" name="_ednref72" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>2</span></a></sup> , exceeding all thought and
comprehension, I mean the Incarnation of the One God the Word of the Holy
Trinity, and our Lord Jesus Christ, we confess that there are two natures, one
divine and one human, joined together with one another and united in
subsistence<sup>7<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn73' href="#_edn73" name="_ednref73"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>3</span></a></sup> , so that one
compound subsistence is formed out of the two natures: but we hold that the two
natures are still preserved, even after the union, in the one compound
subsistence, that is, in the one Christ, and that these exist in reality and
have their natural properties; for they are united without confusion, and are
distinguished and enumerated without being separable. And just as the three
subsistences of the Holy Trinity are united without confusion, and are
distinguished and enumerated without being separable<sup>7<a style='mso-endnote-id:
edn74' href="#_edn74" name="_ednref74" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>4</span></a></sup> , the enumeration not entailing
division or separation or alienation or cleavage among them (for we recognise
one God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit), so in the same way the
natures of Christ also, although they are united, yet are united without
confusion; and although they interpenetrate one another, yet they do not permit
of change or transmutation of one into the other<sup>7<a style='mso-endnote-id:
edn75' href="#_edn75" name="_ednref75" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>5</span></a></sup> . For each keeps its own natural
individuality strictly unchanged. And thus it is that they can be enumerated
without the enumeration introducing division. For Christ, indeed, is one,
perfect both in divinity and in humanity. For it is not the nature of number to
cause separation or unity, but its nature is to indicate the quantity of what
is enumerated, whether these are united or separated: for we have unity, for
instance, when fifty stones compose a wall, but we have separation when the
fifty stones lie on the ground; and again, we have unity when we speak of coal
having two natures, namely, fire and wood, but we have separation in that the
nature of fire is one thing, and the nature of wood another thing; for these
things are united and separated not by number, but in another way. So, then,
just as even though the three subsistences of the Godhead are united with each
other, we cannot speak of them as one subsistence because we should confuse and
do away with the difference between the subsistences, so also we cannot speak
of the two natures of Christ as one nature, united though they are in
subsistence, because we should then confuse and do away with and reduce to
nothing the difference between the two natures.<i><o:p/></i></p>

It is particular not as though it had part of the nature and had not the rest,
but particular in a numerical sense, as being individual. For it is in number
and not in nature that the difference between subsistences is said to lie. Essence,
therefore, is predicated of subsistence, because in each subsistence of the
same form the essence is perfect. Wherefore subsistences do not differ from
each other in essence but in the accidents which indeed are the characteristic
properties, but characteristic of subsistence and not of nature. For indeed

of human nature the whole essence of the Godhead was united. For God the Word
omitted none of the things which He implanted in our nature when He formed us
in the beginning, but took them all upon Himself, body and soul both
intelligent and rational, and all their properties. For the creature that is
devoid of one of these is not man. But He in His fulness took upon Himself me

subsistences are at once the same and different in essence, and that the Holy

href="#_edn130" name="_ednref130" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>0</span></a></sup>
is regarded either abstractly as a matter of pure thought<sup>13<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn131' href="#_edn131" name="_ednref131" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>1</span></a></sup> (for it has no independent
existence): or commonly in all subsistences of the same species as their bond
of union, and is then spoken of as nature viewed in species: or universally as
the same, but with the addition of accidents, in one subsistence, and is spoken
of as nature viewed in the individual, this being identical with nature viewed
in species<sup>13<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn132' href="#_edn132"
name="_ednref132" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>2</span></a></sup> .
God the Word Incarnate, therefore, did not assume the nature that is regarded
as an abstraction in pure thought (for this is not incarnation, but only an
imposture and a figment of incarnation), nor the nature viewed in species (for
He did not assume all the subsistences): but the nature viewed in the
individual, which is identical with that viewed in species. For He took on
Himself the elements of our compound nature, and these not as having an
independent existence or as being originally an individual, and in this way assumed
by Him, but as existing in His own subsistence. For the subsistence of God the
Word in itself became the subsistence of the flesh, and accordingly &#8220;the Word
became flesh<sup>13<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn133' href="#_edn133"
name="_ednref133" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>3</span></a></sup> &#8220;
clearly without any change, and likewise the flesh became Word without
alteration, and God became man. For the Word is God, and man is God, through
having one and the same subsistence. And so it is possible to speak of tile
same thing as being the nature of the Word and the nature in the individual.
For it signifies strictly and exclusively neither the individual, that is, the
subsistence, nor the common nature of the subsistences, but the common nature
as viewed and presented in one of the subsistences.<i><o:p/></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>Union, then, is one thing, and incarnation is
something quite different. For union signifies only the conjunction, but not at
all that with which union is effected. But incarnation (which is just the same
as if one said &#8220;the putting on of man&#8217;s nature&#8221;) signifies that tile
conjunction is with flesh, that is to say, with man, just as the heating of
iron<sup>13<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn134' href="#_edn134" name="_ednref134"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>4</span></a></sup> implies its union
with fire. Indeed, the blessed Cyril himself, when he is interpreting the
phrase, &#8220;one nature of God the Word Incarnate,&#8221; says in the second epistle to
Sucensus, &#8220;For if we simply said &#8216;the one nature of the Word&#8217; and then were
silent, and did not add the word &#8216;incarnate.&#8217; but, so to speak, quite excluded
the dispensation<sup>13<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn135' href="#_edn135"
name="_ednref135" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>5</span></a></sup> ,
there would be some plausibility in the question they feign to ask, &#8216;If one
nature is the whole, what becomes of the perfection in humanity, or how has the
essence<sup>13<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn136' href="#_edn136" name="_ednref136"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>6</span></a></sup> like us come to
exist?&#8217; But inasmuch as the perfection in humanity and the disclosure of the
essence like us are conveyed in the word &#8216;incarnate,&#8217; they must cease from
relying on a mere straw&#8221; Here, then, he placed the nature of the Word over
nature itself. For if He had received nature instead of subsistence, it would
not have been absurd to have omitted the &#8220;incarnate.&#8221; For when we say simply
one subsistence of God the Word, we do not err<sup>13<a style='mso-endnote-id:
edn137' href="#_edn137" name="_ednref137" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>7</span></a></sup> . In like manner, also, Leontius
the Byzantine<sup>13<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn138' href="#_edn138"
name="_ednref138" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>8</span></a></sup>
considered this phrase to refer to nature, and not to subsistence. But in the
Defence which he wrote in reply to the attacks that Theodoret made on the
second anathema, the blessed Cyril<sup>13<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn139'
href="#_edn139" name="_ednref139" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>9</span></a></sup>
says this: &#8220;The nature of the Word, that is, the subsistence, which is the Word
itself.&#8221; So that &#8220;the nature of the Word&#8221; means neither the subsistence alone,
nor &#8220;the common nature of the subsistence,&#8221; but &#8220;the common nature viewed as a
whole in the subsistence of the Word.&#8221;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>It has been said, then, that the nature of the Word
became flesh, that is, was united to flesh: but that the nature of the Word
suffered in the flesh we have never heard up till now, though we have been
taught that Christ suffered in the flesh. So that &#8220;the nature of the Word&#8221; does
not mean &#8220;the subsistence.&#8221; It remains, therefore, to say that to become flesh
is to be united with the flesh, while the Word having become flesh means that
the very subsistence of the Word became without change the subsistence of the
flesh. It has also been said that God became man, and man God. For the Word
which is God became without alteration man. But that the Godhead became man, or
became flesh, or put on the nature of man, this we have never heard. This,
indeed, we have learned, that the Godhead was united to humanity in one of its
subsistences, and it has been stated that God took on a different form or
essence<sup>14<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn140' href="#_edn140" name="_ednref140"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>0</span></a></sup> , to wit our own.
For the name God is applicable to each of the subsistences, but we cannot use
the term Godhead in reference to subsistence. For we are never told that the
Godhead is the Father alone, or the Son alone, or the Holy Spirit alone. For
&#8220;Godhead&#8221; implies &#8220;nature,&#8221; while &#8220;Father&#8221; implies subsistence just as
&#8220;Humanity&#8221; implies nature, and &#8220;Peter&#8221; subsistence. But &#8220;God&#8221; indicates the
common element of the nature, and is applicable derivatively to each of the
subsistences, just as &#8220;man&#8221; is. For He Who has divine nature is God, and he who
has human nature is man.</p>

of her was true God, she who bare the true God incarnate is the true mother of
God. For we hold that God was born of her, not implying that the divinity of
the Word received from her the beginning of its being, but meaning that God the
Word Himself, Who was begotten of the Father timelessly before the ages, and
was with the Father and the Spirit without beginning anti through eternity,
took up His abode in these last days for the sake of our salvation in the
Virgin&#8217;s womb, and was without change made flesh and born of her. For the holy
Virgin did not bare mere man but true God: and not mere God but God incarnate,
Who did not bring down His body from Heaven, nor simply passed through the

was that the very same nature, which had sinned and fallen and become
corrupted, should triumph over the deceiving tyrant and so be freed from
corruption, just as the divine apostle puts it, <i>For since by man came death,
by man came also the resurrection of the dead</i><sup>14<a style='mso-endnote-id:

he does not say that His body is from heaven, but emphasises the fact that He
is not mere man. For, mark, he called Him both Adam and Lord, thus indicating
His double nature. For Adam is, being interpreted, earth-born: and it is clear
that man&#8217;s nature is earth-born since he is formed from earth, but the title
Lord signifies His divine essence.</p>

only-begotten Son of God and God is the same as He who was made man of the
Virgin, and that He who was born of the Virgin is the same as the Son of God

and Himself became subsistence for it. For this is the meaning of &#8220;made of a woman.&#8221;
For how could the very Word of God itself have been made under the law, if He

the ages, have been born of a woman unless He had become man? For the son of
man must clearly be man himself. But if He Who was born of a woman is Himself
God, manifestly He Who was born of God the Father in accordance with the laws

, Who is in truth God incarnate. For the Word Himself became flesh, having been
in truth conceived of the Virgin, but coming forth as God with the assumed
nature which, as soon as He was brought forth into being, was deified by Him,
so that these three things took place simultaneously, the assumption of our
nature, the coming into being, and the deification of the assumed nature by the
Word. And thus it is that the holy Virgin is thought of and spoken of as the
Mother of God, not only because of the nature of the Word, but also because of
the deification of man&#8217;s nature, the miracles of conception and of existence
being wrought together, to wit, the conception the Word, and the existence of
the flesh in the Word Himself. For the very Mother of God in some marvellous
manner was the means of fashioning the Framer of all things and of bestowing
manhood on the God and Creator of all, Who deified the nature that He assumed,
while the union preserved those things that were united just as they were
united, that is to say, not only the divine nature of Christ but also His human
nature, not only that which is above us but that which is of us. For He was not

with the number of wills and energies that belong essentially to His natures.
(For He was endowed with the powers of willing and energising in both natures,
for the sake of our salvation) It does not introduce division: God forbid! but
merely brings out the fact that the differences between them are safeguarded

faculties belonging to nature, not to subsistence; I mean those faculties of

But he who exercises volition, that is to say the subsistence, for instance
Peter, is spoken of as willing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

href="#_edn169" name="_ednref169" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>9</span></a></sup>
, Christ is one and His subsistence is one, He also Who wills both as God and
as man is one and the same. And since He has two natures endowed with volition,
inasmuch as they are rational (for whatever is rational is endowed with
volition and free-will), we shall postulate two volitions or natural wills in
Him. For He in His own person is capable of volition in accordance with both
His natures. For He assumed that faculty of volition which belongs naturally to
us. And since Christ, Who in His own person wills according to either nature,
is one, we shall postulate the same object of will in His case, not as though
He wills only those things which He willed naturally as God (for it is no part
of Godhead to will to eat or drink and so forth), but as willing also those
things which human nature requires for its support<sup>17<a style='mso-endnote-id:
edn170' href="#_edn170" name="_ednref170" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>0</span></a></sup> , and this without involving any
opposition in judgment, but simply as the result of the individuality of the
natures. For then it was that He thus willed naturally, when His divine
volition so willed and permitted the flesh to suffer and do that which was
proper to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

style='mso-endnote-id:edn171' href="#_edn171" name="_ednref171" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>1</span></a></sup> is manifest from this. Excluding
the divine life, there are three forms of life: the vegetative, the sentient,
and the intellectual. The properties of the vegetative life are the functions
of nourishment, and growth, and production: that of the sentient life is
impulse: and that of the rational and intellectual life is freedom of will. If,
then, nourishment belongs by nature to the vegetative life and impulse to the
sentient, freedom of will by nature belongs to the rational and intellectual
life. But freedom of will is nothing else than volition. The Word, therefore,
having become flesh, endowed with life and mind and free-will, became also
endowed with volition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>Further, that which is natural is not the result of
training: for no one learns how to think, or live, or hunger, or thirst, or
sleep. Nor do we learn how to will: so that willing is natural.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>And again: if in the case of creatures devoid of
reason nature rules, while nature is ruled in man who is moved of his own
free-will and volition, it follows, then, that man is by nature endowed with
volition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

the blessed and super-essential Godhead, and if the divine nature is by nature

every man and not present in some and absent in others, and if that which is
seen to be common to all is a characteristic feature of the nature that belongs
to the individuals of the class, surely, then, man is by nature endowed with
volition<sup>17<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn174' href="#_edn174"

class=MsoEndnoteReference>5</span></a></sup> . So that since man is by nature
endowed with volition, the Lord also must be by nature endowed with volition,
not only because He is God, but also because He became man. For just as He
assumed our nature, so also He has assumed naturally our will. And in this way
the Fathers said that He formed our will in Himself<sup>17<a style='mso-endnote-id:

hypostatic or unnatural. But if it is hypostatic, the Son must thus, forsooth,
have a different will from what the Father has: for that which is hypostatic is
characteristic of subsistence only. And if it is unnatural, will must be a
defection from nature: for what is unnatural is destructive of what is natural.</p>

Father or as God. Now if as Father, His will will be different from that of the

hold not that it is dominated by necessity, but that it is free. For if it is
rational, it must be absolutely free. For it is not only the divine and
uncreated nature that is free from the bonds of necessity, but also the
intellectual and created nature. And this is manifest: for God, being by nature
good and being by nature the Creator and by nature God, is not all this of
necessity. For who is there to introduce this necessity?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

several senses, one in connection with God, another in connection with angels,
and a third in connection with men. For used in reference to God it is to be
understood in a superessential manner, and in reference to angels it is to be
taken in the sense that the election is concomitant with the state<sup>19<a

of no interval of time at all: for while the angel possesses free-will by
nature, he uses it without let or hindrance, having neither antipathy on the
part of the body to overcome nor any assailant. Again, used in reference to men,
it is to be taken in the sense that the state is considered to be anterior in
time to the election. For than is free and has free-will by nature, but he has
also the assault of the devil to impede him and the motion of the body: and
thus through the assault and the weight of the batty, election comes to be
later than the state.</p>

obeyed of his own will and ate of his own will, surely in us the will is the
first part to suffer. And if the will is the first to suffer, and the Word
Incarnate did not assume this with the rest of our nature, it follows that we
have not been freed from sin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>Moreover, if the faculty of free-will which is in
nature is His work and yet He did not assume it, He either condemned His own
workmanship as not good, or grudged us the comfort it brought, and so deprived
us of the full benefit, and shewed that He was Himself subject to passion since
He was not willing or not able to work out our perfect salvation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>Moreover, one cannot speak of one com pound thing
made of two wills in the same way as a subsistence is a composition of two
natures. Firstly because the compositions are of things in subsistence (<i>hypotasis</i>),

speak of composition of wills and energies, we will be obliged to speak of
composition of the other natural properties, such as the uncreated and the
created, the invisible and the visible, and so on. And what will be the name of
the will that is compounded out of two wills? For the compound cannot be called
by the name of the elements that make it up. For otherwise we should call that
which is compounded of natures nature and not subsistence. And further, if we
say that there is one compound will in Christ, we separate Him in will from the
Father, for the Father&#8217;s will is not compound. It remains, therefore, to say
that the subsistence of Christ atone is compound and common, as in the case of
the natures so also in that of the natural properties.</p>

with reference to the decision arrived at after investigation and deliberation
concerning something unknown, that is to say, after counsel and decision. And
after judgment comes preference<sup>19<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn195'
href="#_edn195" name="_ednref195" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>5</span></a></sup>
, which chooses out and selects the one rather than the other. But the Lord
being not mere man but also God, and knowing all things, had no need of
inquiry. and investigation, and counsel, and decision, and by nature made
whatever is good His own and whatever is bad foreign to Him<sup>19<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn196' href="#_edn196" name="_ednref196" title=""><span

prophet, <i>Before the child shall know to prefer the evil, he shall choose the

choosing the good</i><sup>19<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn197' href="#_edn197"

For the word &#8220;before&#8221; proves that it is not with investigation and
deliberation, as is the way with us, but as God and as subsisting in a divine
manner in the flesh, that is to say, being united in subsistence to the flesh,
and because of His very existence and all-embracing knowledge, that He is
possessed of good in His own nature. For the virtues are natural qualities<sup>19<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn198' href="#_edn198" name="_ednref198" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>8</span></a></sup> , and are implanted in all by
nature and in equal measure, even if we do not all in equal measure employ our
natural energies. By the transgression we were driven from the natural to the
unnatural<sup>19<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn199' href="#_edn199"

our attaining virtue which was foreign to our nature, but to enable us to cast
aside the evil that was foreign and contrary to our nature: just as on
laboriously removing from steel the rust which is not natural to it but

energy: and it is simple energy not involving any relationship, the mind
sending forth the thoughts peculiar to it in an independent and invisible way,
for if it did not do so it could not justly be called mind. Again, the
revelation and unfolding of thought by means of articulate speech is said to be
energy. But this is no longer simple energy that revolves no relationship, but
it is considered in relation as being composed of thought and speech. Further,
the very relation which be who does anything bears to that which is brought
about is energy; and the very thing that is effected is called energy<sup>21<a

what is to be and then performs it thus by means of the body. And so the
hegemony belongs to the soul, for it uses the body as an instrument, leading

booty is led and moved by the soul. And with regard to the effect, the touching
and handling and, so to speak, the embrace of what is effected, belong to the
body, while the figuration and formation belong to the soul. And so in

the leper heard the &#8220;I will,&#8221; belong to His humanity, while the multiplication
of the loaves and the purification of the leper belong to His divinity. For
through both, that is through the energy of the booty anti the energy of the
soul. He displayed one and the same, cognate and equal divine energy. For just
as we saw that His natures were united and permeate one another, and yet do not
deny that they are different but even enumerate them, although we know they are
inseparable, so also in connection with the wills and the energies we know
their union, and we recognise their difference and enumerate them without
introducing separation. For just as the flesh was deified without undergoing
change in its own nature, in the same way also will and energy are deified
without transgressing their own proper limits. For whether He is the one or the
other, He is one and the same, and whether He wills and energises in one way or
the other, that is as God or as man, He is one and the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

in virtue of His double nature. For things that have diverse natures, have also
different energies, and things that have diverse energies, have also different
natures. And so conversely, things that have the same nature have also the same
energy, and things that have one and the same energy have also one and the same
essence<sup>21<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn214' href="#_edn214" name="_ednref214"

must be true: either, if we hold that Christ has one energy. we must also hold
that He has but one essence, or, if we are solicitous about truth. and confess
that He has according to the doctrine of the Gospels and the Fathers two
essences, we must also confess that He has two energies corresponding to and
accompanying them. For as He is of like essence with God and the Father in
divinity, He will be His equal also in energy. And as He likewise is of like
essence with us in humanity He will be our equal also in energy. For the
blessed Gregory, bishop of Nyssa, says<sup>21<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn216'
href="#_edn216" name="_ednref216" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>6</span></a></sup>

power.&#8221; For all energy is the effect of power. But it cannot be that uncreated
and created nature have one and the same nature or power or energy. But if we should
hold that Christ has but one energy, we should attribute to the divinity of the
Word the passions of the intelligentspirit, viz. tear and grief and anguish.</p>

true converse must hold good that energy is also introduced along with
personality; and there will be also three energies of the Holy Trinity just as
there are three persons or subsistences, or there will be one person and one
subsistence just as there is only one energy. Indeed, the holy Fathers have

the steel, and the burn is the effect of the energy of the fire: and these are
kept quite distinct in the burnt cut, and in the cut burn, although neither
does the burning take place apart from the cut after the union of the two, nor
the cut apart from the burning: and we do not maintain on account of the
twofold natural energy that there are two flaming swords, nor do we confuse the
essential difference of the energies on account of the unity of the flaming
sword. In like manner also, in the case of Christ, His divinity possesses an
energy that is divine and omnipotent while His humanity has an energy such as
is our own. And the effect of His human energy was His taking the child by the
hand and drawing her to Himself, while that of His divine energy was the
restoring of her to life<sup>22<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn226' href="#_edn226"

For the one is quite distinct from the other, although they are inseparable
from one another in theandric energy. But if, because Christ has one subsistence,
He must also have one energy, then, because He has one subsistence, He must
also have one essence.</p>

that it is human, we shall be guilty of the impiety of saying that He is mere
man. And if we hold that it is neither divine nor human, we must also hold that
He is neither God nor man, of like essence neither to the Father nor to us. For
it is as a result of the union that the identity in hypostasis arises, but yet
the difference between the natures is not done away with. But since the
difference between the natures is preserved, manifestly also the energies of
the natures will be preserved. For no nature exists that is lacking in energy.</p>

created or uncreated; for between these there is no energy, just as there is no
nature. If, then, it is created, it will point to created nature alone, but if
it is uncreated, it will betoken uncreated essence alone. For that which is
natural must completely correspond with its nature: for there cannot exist a

It is not His human nature that raises up Lazarus from the dead, nor is it His
divine power that sheds tears: for the shedding of tears is peculiar to human
nature while the life is peculiar to the enhypostatic life. But yet they are
common the one to the other, because of the identity in subsistence. For Christ
is one, and one also is His person or subsistence, but yet He has two natures,
one belonging to His humanity, and another belonging to His divinity. And the
glory. indeed, which proceeded naturally from His divinity became common to
both through the identity in subsistence. and again on account of His flesh
that which was lowly became common to both. For He Who is the one or the other,
that is God or man, is one and the same, and both what is divine and what is
human belong to Himself. For while His divinity performed the miracles, they
were not done apart from the flesh, and while His flesh performed its lowly
offices, they were not done apart from the divinity. For His divinity was
joined to the suffering flesh, yet remaining without passion, and endured the
saving passions, and the holy mind was joined to the energising divinity of the
Word, perceiving and knowing what was being accomplished.</p>

His divinity. Although, therefore, from the first conception there was no
division at all between the two forms<sup>23<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn233'

superhuman way, walking with earthly feet on unstable water, not by turning the
water into earth, but by causing it in the superabundant power of His divinity
not to flow away nor yield beneath the weight of material feet. For not in a
merely human way did He do human things: for He was not only man, but also God,

distinguishing it from divine energy. For, to speak generally, of nothing is
the existence recognised or defined by comparison or collation. If it were so,
indeed, existing things would turn out to be mutually the one the cause of the
other. For if the human activity is passion because the divine activity is
energy, assuredly also the human nature must be wicked because the divine
nature is good, and, by conversion and opposition, if the divine activity is
called energy because the human activity is called passion, then also the
divine nature must be good because the human nature is bad. And so all created

is a conservative and invariable force; and energy, because it is a
distinguishing mark, and reveals the absolute similarity between all things of
the same class; and difference, because it distinguishes; and activity, because
it makes manifest; and property, because it is constituent and belongs to that
alone, and not to any other; and quality, because it gives form; and passion,
because it is moved, For all things that are of God and after God suffer in
respect of being moved, forasmuch as they have not in themselves motion or
power. Therefore, as has been said, it is not in order to distinguish the one
from the other that it has been named, but it is in accordance with the plan
implanted in it in a creative manner by the Cause that framed the universe.

it energy. For he who said, &#8220;For either form energises close communion with the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>And again: man&#8217;s unity in species is not the same
thing as the unity of soul and body in essence. For man&#8217;s unity in species
makes clear the absolute similarity between all men, while the unity of soul
and body in essence is an insult to their very existence, and reduces them to nothingness:
for either the one must change into the essence of the other, or from different
things something different must be produced, and so both would be changed, or
if they keep to their own proper limits there must be two natures. For, as
regards the nature of essence the corporeal is not the same as the incorporeal.
Therefore, although holding that man has one nature, not because the essential
quality of his soul and that of his body are the same, but because the
individuals included under the species are exactly the same, it is not
necessary for us to maintain that Christ also has one nature, for in this case
there is no species embracing many subsistences.</p>

immediately composes it. For we do not say that a house is composed of earth

change in nature, but rather the oeconomical union(I mean the union in
subsistence by virtue of which it was united inseparably with God the Word),
and the permeation of the natures through one another, just as we saw that
burning permeated the steel. For, just as we confess that God became man
without change or alteration, so we consider that the flesh became God without
change. For because the Word became flesh, He did not overstep the limits of
His own divinity nor abandon the divine glories that belong to Him: nor, on the
other hand, was the flesh, when deified, changed in its own nature or in its
natural properties. For even after the union, boil the natures abode unconfused
and their properties unimpaired. But the flesh of the Lord received the riches
of the divine energies through the purest union with the Word, that is to say,
the union in subsistence, without entailing the loss of any of its natural
attributes. For it is not in virtue of any energy of its own but through the
Word united to it, that it manifests divine energy: for the flaming steel
burns, not because it has been endowed in a physical way with burning energy,
but because it has obtained this energy by its union with fire<sup>25<a

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

own nature and life-giving through its union with the Word in subsistence. And

thing that is burnt, but makes distinct both what is burnt, and what burned it,
and is indicative not of one but of two natures, so also the deification does
not bring about one compound nature but two, and their union in subsistence.
Gregory the Theologian, indeed, says, &#8220;Whereof the one deified, the other was

ground of complaint if, after He had overcome man, God should have used force

would His becoming man have been to us if He Who suffered first was not saved,
nor renewed and strengthened by the union with divinity? For that which is not
assumed is not remedied. He, therefore, assumed the whole man, even the fairest
part of him, which had become diseased, in order that He might bestow salvation
on the whole. And, indeed, there could never exist a mind that had not wisdom

utterly reduced to nothingness.</p>

was in His own image, became man. But what is that which was in His own image,

the image of God. Mind, then, mingles with mind, and mind holds a place midway

a soul without mind, He assumed the soul of an irrational animal.</p>

become flesh without soul or mind, but man. He says, indeed, Himself, <i>Why
seek ye to kill Me, a Man that hath told you the truth</i><sup>26<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn268' href="#_edn268" name="_ednref268" title=""><span

flesh but is itself under the dominion of the divinity of the Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

the power of will. But His human will was obedient anti subordinate to His
divine will, not being guided by its own inclination, but willing those things
which the divine will willed. For it was with the permission of the divine will
that He suffered by nature what was proper to Him<sup>26<a style='mso-endnote-id:
edn269' href="#_edn269" name="_ednref269" title=""><span

escape the death, it was with His divine will naturally willing and permitting
it that He did so pray and agonize and fear, and again when His divine will
willed that His human will should choose tire death, the passion became
voluntary to Him<sup>27<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn270' href="#_edn270"
name="_ednref270" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>0</span></a></sup> .
For it was not as God only, but also as man, that He voluntarily surrendered
Himself to the death. And thus He bestowed on us also courage in the face of
death. So, indeed, He said before His saving passion, <i>Father, if it be
possible, let this cup pass from Me</i><sup>27<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn271'
href="#_edn271" name="_ednref271" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>1</span></a></sup>
,&#8221; manifestly as though He were to drink the cup as man and not as God. It was
as man, then, that He wished the cup to pass from Him: but these are the words
of natural timidity. <i>Nevertheless</i>, He said, <i>not My will</i>, that is
to say, not in so far as I am of a different essence from Thee, <i>but Thy will
be done</i><sup>27<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn272' href="#_edn272"

the is to say, My will and Thy will, in so far as I am of the same essence as
Thou. Now these are the words of a brave heart. For the Spirit of the Lord,
since He truly became man in His good pleasure, on first testing its natural
weakness was sensible of the natural fellow-suffering involved in its
separation from the body, but being strengthened by the divine will it again
grew bold in the face of death. For since He was Himself wholly God although
also man, and wholly man although also God, He Himself as man subjected in
Himself and by Himself His human nature to God and the Father, and became
obedient to the Father, thus making Himself the most excellent type and example
for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>Of His own free-will, moreover, He exercised His
divine and human will. For free-will is assuredly implanted in every rational
nature. For to what end would it possess reason, if it could not reason at its
own free-will? For the Creator hath implanted even in the unreasoning brutes
natural appetite to compel them to sustain their own nature. For devoid of
reason, as they are, they cannot guide their natural appetite but are guided by
it. And so, as soon as the appetite for anything has sprung up, straightway
arises also the impulse for action. And thus they do not win praise or
happiness for pursuing virtue, nor punishment for doing evil. But the rational
nature, although it does possess a natural appetite, can guide and train it by
reason wherever the laws of nature are observed. For the advantage of reason
consists in this, tire free-will, by which we mean natural activity in a
rational subject. Wherefore in pursuing virtue it wins praise and happiness,
and in pursuing vice it wins punishment.</p>

free-will those things which His divine will willed it to will. For the flesh
was not moved at a sign from the Word, as Moses and all the holy men were moved
at a sign from heaven. But He Himself, Who was one and yet both God and man,
willed according to both His divine and His human will. Wherefore it was not in
inclination but rather in natural power that the two wills of the Lord differed
from one another. For His divine will was without beginning and all-effecting,
as having power that kept pace with it, and free from passion; while His human
will had a beginning in time, and itself endured the natural and innocent

way we could speak of one new nature resulting from the union of the divine
with the human nature. For, according to the holy Fathers, things that have one
energy have also one essence. But Ire wished to indicate the novel and
ineffable manner in which the natural energies of Christ manifest themselves, a
manner befitting the ineffable manner in which the natures of Christ mutually,
permeate one another, and further how strange and wonder-rid and, in the nature
of things, unknown was His life as man<sup>27<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn276'

union. For we hold that the energies are not divided and that the natures do
not energies separately, but that each conjointly in complete community with
the other energises with its own proper energy<sup>27<a style='mso-endnote-id:

energise merely in a human manner, for He was not mere man; nor did the divine
part energise only after the manner of God, for He was not simply God, but He
was at once God and man. For just as in the case of natures we recognise both
their union and their natural difference, so is it also with the natural wills

whether we say &#8220;Christ energises according to either of His natures,&#8221; or
&#8220;either nature energises in Christ in communion with the other.&#8221; The divine
nature, then, has communion with the flesh in its energising, because it is by
the good pleasure of the divine will that the flesh is permitted to suffer and
do the things proper to itself, and because the energy of the flesh is
altogether saving, and this is an attribute not of human but of divine energy.
On the other hand the flesh has communion with the divinity of the Word in its

remembering the times He spent on earth and all He suffered, but it has

Adam was assailed. But the Lord repulsed the assault and dispelled it like
vapour, in order that the passions which assailed him and were overcome might
be easily subdued by us, and that the new Adam should save the old. </p>

If, then, as Gregory the Theologian holds, you are to separate the realm of
sight from the realm of thought, the flesh is to be spoken of as both servile
and ignorant, but on account of the identity of subsistence and the inseparable
union the soul of the Lord was enriched with the knowledge of the future as
also with the other miraculous powers. For just as the flesh of men is not in
its own nature life-giving, while the flesh of our Lord which was united in
subsistence with God the Word Himself, although it was not exempt from the
mortality of its nature, yet became life-giving through its union in
subsistence with the Word, and we may not say that it was not and is not for
ever life-giving: in like manner His human nature does not in essence possess
the knowledge of the future, but the soul of the Lord through its union with
God the Word Himself and its identity in subsistence was enriched, as I said,
with the knowledge of the future as well as with the other miraculous powers.<i><o:p/></i></p>

Son, then, would not have all the Father&#8217;s attributes, if He is the Father&#8217;s

<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none'>The word fear has a double meaning. For fear is natural
when the soul is unwilling to be separated from the body, on account of the
natural sympathy and close relationship planted in it in the beginning by the
Creator, which makes it fear and struggle against death and pray for an escape
from it. It may be defined thus: natural fear is the force whereby we cling to
being with shrinking<sup>29<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn293' href="#_edn293"
name="_ednref293" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>3</span></a></sup> .
For if all things were brought by the Creator out of nothing into being, they
all have by nature a longing after being and not after non-being. Moreover the inclination
towards those things that support existence is a natural property of them.
Hence God the Word when He became man had this longing, manifesting, on the one
hand, in those things that support existence, the inclination of His nature in
desiring food and drink and sleep, and having in a natural manner made proof of
these things, while on the other hand displaying in those things that bring
corruption His natural disinclination in voluntarily shrinking in the hour of
His passion before the flee of death. For although what happened did so
according to the laws of nature, yet it was not, as in our case, a matter of
necessity. For He willingly and spontaneously accepted that which was natural.
So that fear itself and terror and agony belong to the natural and innocent
passions and are not under the dominion of sin.<i><o:p/></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

reasoning and want of faith, and ignorance of the hour of death, as when we are
at night affected by fear at some chance noise. This is unnatural fear, and may
be thus defined: unnatural fear is an unexpected shrinking. This our Lord did
not assume. Hence He never felt fear except in the hour of His passion,
although He often experienced a feeling of shrinking in accordance with the
dispensation. For He was not ignorant of the appointed time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

Apollinarius says that He did actually feel fear. &#8220;Wherefore the Lord said: <i>Now

The &#8216;now&#8217; indeed means just &#8216;when He willed,&#8217; but yet points to what actually
was. For He did not speak of what was not, as though it were present, as if the
things that were said only apparently happened. For all things happened
naturally and actually.&#8221; And again, after some other matters, he says,&#8221; In
nowise does His divinity admit passion apart from a suffering body, nor yet
does it manifest trouble and pain apart froth a pained and troubled soul, nor
does it suffer anguish and offer up prayer apart from a mind that suffered anguish
and offered up prayer. For, although these occurrences were not due to any
overthrow of nature, yet they took place to shew forth His real being<sup>29<a

mind was in no need either of any uprising towards God, since it had been once
and for all united in subsistence with the God Word, or of any petitioning of
God. For Christ is one. But it was because He appropriated to Himself our
personality and took our impress on Himself, and became an ensample for us, and
taught us to ask of God and strain towards Him, and guided us through His own holy
mind in the way that leads up to God. For just as He<sup>29<a style='mso-endnote-id:

from both, I mean, from His soul and His body, and so even thus His one
hypostasis was not divided into two hypostases. For body and soul received
simultaneously in the beginning their being in the subsistence<sup>31<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn315' href="#_edn315" name="_ednref315" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>5</span></a></sup> of the Word, and although they
were severed from one another by death, yet they continued, each of them,
having the one subsistence of the Word. So that the one subsistence of the Word
is alike the subsistence of the Word, and of soul and body. For at no time had
either soul or body a separate subsistence of their own, different from that of
the Word, and the subsistence of the Word is for ever one, and at no time two.
So that the subsistence of Christ is always one. For, although the soul was
separated from the body topically, yet hypostatically they were united through
the Word.</p>

href="#_edn316" name="_ednref316" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>6</span></a></sup>
has two meanings<sup>31<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn317' href="#_edn317"
name="_ednref317" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>7</span></a></sup> .
For it signifies all the human sufferings, such as hunger, thirst, weariness,
the piercing with nails, death, that is, the separation of soul and body, and
so forth. In this sense we say that our Lord&#8217;s body was subject to corruption.
For He voluntarily accepted all these things. But corruption means also the
complete resolution of the body into its constituent elements, and its utter
disappearance, which is spoken of by many preferably as destruction. The body
of our Lord did not experience this form of corruption, as the prophet David
says, <i>For Thou will not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt Thou suffer
Thine holy one to see corruption</i><sup>31<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn318'

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none'>Wherefore to say, with that foolish Julianus and
Gaianus, that our Lord&#8217;s body was incorruptible, in the first sense of the
word, before His resurrection is impious. For if it were incorruptible it was
not really, but only apparently, of the same essence as ours, and what the
Gospel tells us happened, viz. the hunger, the thirst, the nails, the wound in
His side, the death, did not actually occur. But if they only apparently
happened, then the mystery of the dispensation is an imposture and a sham, and
He became man only in appearance, and not in actual fact, and we are saved only
in appearance, and not in actual fact. But God forbid, and may those who so say
have no part in the salvation<sup>31<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn319'

meaning of the word &#8220;corruption,&#8221; we confess that our Lord&#8217;s body is
incorruptible, that is, indestructible, for such is the tradition of the
inspired Fathers. Indeed, after the resurrection of our Saviour from the dead,
we say that our Lord&#8217;s body is incorruptible even in the first sense of the
word. For our Lord by His own body bestowed the gifts both of resurrection and
of subsequent incorruption even on our own body, He Himself having become to us
the firstfruits both of resurrection and incorruption, and of passionlessness<sup>32<a
