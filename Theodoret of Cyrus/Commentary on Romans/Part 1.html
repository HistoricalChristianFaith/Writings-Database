<p align="center">COMMENTARY OF THEODORET, BISHOP OF CYRUS IN SYRIA, ON ST. PAUL'S
EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS.</p>



<blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p><A NAME="p34"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|34</SPAN></A>Theodoret was born at Antioch, A.D. 386. His studies were pursued
under Theodore of Mopsuista and Chrysostom, from the works of the latter of
whom the present commentary is by many esteemed little more than an
abridgement. This, however, on comparing the writings of both those Fathers,
can hardly perhaps be admitted in its fullest sense, but rather in that in
which Theodoret himself represents it, when in his preface to St. Paul's
Epistles, speaking not of Chrysostom, or Theodore, who himself also had composed 
		an exposition of those Epistles, but generally, he says,
		<span class="Greek">&#x03A4;&#x1F70;&#x03C2; &#x1F00;&#x03C6;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x03BC;&#x1F70;&#x03C2; &#x1F10;&#x03BA; &#x03C4;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD; &#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03C9;&#x03BD; &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BB;&#x03BB;&#x1F73;&#x03BE;&#x03C9; &#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x1F73;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;, &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2; &#x03B4;&#x1F72; &#x1F45;&#x03C4;&#x03B9; &#x03BC;&#x1F71;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B1; &#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x1FF6;</span><b><i>.</i></b></p>
		<p>At the death of his parents he distributed his whole inheritance
to the poor, reserving nothing for himself. About the year 420 he was, against
his own will, appointed to the bishopric of Cyrus, to which diocese he became a
great benefactor, both spiritually and temporally; extirpating heresy
oftentimes at the risk of his life; in private charity and public improvements
expending almost all his church revenues; neither receiving himself, nor
permitting his domestics to receive any thing of any man to conciliate favour;
but throughout fulfilling the part of a good and active shepherd in all his
doings and conduct. Although in those troublous times of mutual accusation and
recrimination, suffering awhile under suspicions in the matters of Nestorius,
his innocence and orthodoxy were finally established at the council of
Chalcedon, under the emperor Marcian, A.
		D. 451, from whence retiring to his diocese he passed the rest of his
life in quiet, engaged in his labours on the holy Scriptures, and at length
died A. D. 457.</p>
		<p>&quot;Of all the Fathers, who have composed works of different
kinds, Theodoret is one of those,&quot; says Dupin (tom. iii. part 2,)
&quot;who has been very happy in every one of them. There are some who have
been excellent writers in matters of controversy, but bad interpreters. Others
have been good historians, but bad divines. Some have good success in morality,
who have no skill in doctrinal points. And very rare is it for those who have
addicted themselves to works of piety to be good critics. Theodoret had all
these qualities, and it may be said, that he has equally deserved the name of a
good interpreter, divine, historian, <A NAME="p35"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|35</SPAN></A> writer of controversies, apologist for religion, and author of
works of piety. But he has principally excelled in his compositions upon the
holy Scripture, in which, according to the judgment of the learned Photius, be
has outdone almost all other commentators. 'He passes over nothing,' says that
writer, 'which needs explication, nor can we find any who unfolds all manner of
difficulties better, and leaves fewer things obscure.'&quot;</p>
		<p>It may be remarked, in conclusion, that the points of divinity
which he chiefly urges, and of which indeed he seems never to lose sight, are
those connected with that leading mystery of our religion, the divinity and
consubstantiality of our Lord, both because this was the specific point on
which the heretics of his day chiefly erred, and against the denial of which
consequently he directed his arguments: and that he distinctly maintained the
procession of the Holy Spirit from the [Greek]. Rom. viii. 11. [Greek]. Answer

<h3 align=center>ARGUMENT.</h3>



<p>Various and comprehensive is the doctrine which the holy apostle
unfolds in the present epistle. Its general scope is this:&#8212;worthy of all awe
and adoration to the sincere believer as is the mystery of the divine
incarnation, clearly manifesting, as it does, the loving mercy of God; they
nevertheless who are involved in the darkness of infidelity, and have not
admitted the light of intellectual illumination, scorn that which not even the
company of angels can worthily celebrate, as the inspired apostle distinctly
says in his Epistle to the Corinthians (I Cor. i. 18). &quot;For the preaching
of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to them that are saved it
is the power of God.&quot; In this Epistle to the Romans, therefore, he
exhibits the indispensable necessity of this saving gospel, together with its
utility and advantage to all mankind, Jews or Greeks. In order to which, in the
first place he convicts the Greeks of having palpably corrupted the moral sense
of good and evil, implanted in their constitution by their Maker, and
transgressed the natural law; and secondly, the Jews of having, although in the
enjoyment of the written instructions of the divine laws, yet rejected the
benefit arising from them, and rendered themselves thereby obnoxious to the heavier
retribution. After this, he shows that our God and Saviour came not for the
condemnation and punishment of sinners, but to bring pardon for their offences,
to promise victory over death, and proclaim eternal life.</p>



<p>Again, perceiving that the Jews clung but too much to the law, and
those who savoured of the errors <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> of Marcion and Valentine, with the <SPAN CLASS=pb><A NAME="p36">|36</A></SPAN> Manichees, too much altogether undervalued and condemned it, as an
expert general surrounded on all sides by his enemies strikes down first one,
and then the other, so does the holy apostle break in pieces, by divine grace,
the band of the heretics, and all the array of the Jews. For how does he
conduct the argument? By neither elevating the law too high, because of the
extravagance of the Jews, nor giving any occasion for reproach to the profane
heretics, but demonstrating that it taught all that was needful, and brought in
the doctrine of justification, although incompetent to convey justification
itself by reason of the infirmity of those under it; and showing that faith
brings to effect the design of the law, and what it fain would do, but cannot,
it perfects through the grace of the thrice holy Spirit. By all which we learn,
how continually regardful of mankind is God our Creator, in that not only did
he implant in our nature the power of discriminating between good and evil, but
also by the very works of his creation led such as were willing to piety and
holiness, for although all were not thus willing to see the truth, they who
were had full enjoyment of it, as they desired.</p>



<p>He next further instructs us, that the God of all turned not to
this plan of our salvation, as though in a change of council from any of his
former designs, but as having long ago foretold it in the ancient prophets; he
sets forth the cause of the rejection of the Jews; and admonishes the believing
Gentiles not to boast over them; exhorting them to lead the way in the gospel.
With these doctrinal lessons he joins recommendations to practical virtue, at
once displaying the truth, and reforming the morals. Such then is the general
argument of the epistle, all the particulars in which the interpretation of the
separate passages will now clearly make known to us.</p>



<h3 align=center>Chapter
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>I.</SPAN></h3>



<p>1. <i>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called an Apostle</i>.
Governors and generals superscribe their letters with the designations of their
respective dignities, priding themselves thereon, and puffed up in fancied
greatness by each fresh tide of honour; the holy apostle is content to call
himself &quot;one born out of due time,&quot;<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> and &quot;the chief of
sinners,&quot; and to pronounce himself &quot; unworthy the apostleship;&quot;
while yet, for the benefit of such as should receive his epistles, he prefixes
to them the appellations which by grace he had obtained, that so, by seeing the
honours belonging to the writer, they might the more readily and zealously
welcome them. And he begins by Paul, not as having been so named of old by his
parents, but as preferred to it after his call, as was Simon to that of Peter,
and the sons of Zebedee to those of Sons of Thunder, Jacob to that of Israel,
and Abram to that of Abraham. Next, servant of Jesus Christ, whom infidels
reviled as dead and crucified, and a mere carpenter's son, and yet whose
service the apostle notwithstanding chose above any sovereignty.</p>



<p>Then he speaks of himself as called, alluding to his divine call,
and <A NAME="p37"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|37</SPAN></A> adds the name <i>an apostle</i>, teaching us that this also he had
gained. For since our Lord gave this designation to the twelve, so the holy
apostle here also places it, not as in a presumptuous self-assumption thereof,
but as having had it bestowed upon him by his Master himself. &quot;For
depart,&quot; said he unto him, &quot;because I will send thee for hence unto
the Gentiles,&quot; (Acts xxii. 21;) and this be farther proves by what
follows, namely; <i>separated unto the gospel of God</i>. I am not
self-elected, exclaims he, but have been entrusted with the ministry of the
word by God himself. Now it was the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost,
who thus set him apart; for that the Father did so, he himself declares in his
Epistle to the Galatians (i. 15, 16). &quot; It pleased God, who separated me
from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his Son in me;
that I might preach him among the heathen and that, again, the only- begotten
Son did this likewise, is evident where the apostle tells us in the Acts
(xxiii. 21) how the Lord was seen of him in the temple, commanding him to
hasten and go out, because the Jews would not receive his preaching, adding,
&quot;Depart, for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.&quot;</p>



<p>And the very same thing he said to Ananias, when he was hesitating
and drawing back, (Acts ix. 15;) &quot;Go thy way, for this man is a chosen
vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the
children of Israel.&quot; And so St Luke also tells us, (xiii. 2,) that
&quot;as the prophets were ministering unto the Lord, and fasting, the Holy
Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called
them.&quot; Evident therefore from hence is the equality of the Trinity. And so
also the gospel he now speaks of as the gospel of God, and a little onward as <i>the
gospel of the Son</i>, saying, &quot; for God is my witness, whom I serve with
my spirit <i>in the gospel of his Son</i>.&quot; This I have not noted on idly,
or to no purpose, but in order to point out how indifferently the teachers of
the truth mention the same things, sometimes as those of the Father, and
sometimes as those of the Son.</p>



<p>The doctrines also preached he designates as <i>the gospel</i>,
because they promise the supply of so many blessings, announcing reconciliation
with God, the overthrow of the devil, forgiveness of sins, conquest over death,
the resurrection of the deceased, eternal life, and the kingdom of heaven.
Having then thus stated that he had been separated to the gospel of God, the
holy apostle next proceeds immediately to prove in the first place its
antiquity, lest any should be foolish enough to except against it as a novelty,
and so reject it; and says, 2. <i>Which he has promised afore by his prophets
in the holy Scriptures</i>, for the Old Testament is full of predictions
concerning the Lord. Nor does he call them holy for no reason, but firstly to
show that he acknowledged their inspiration; secondly, as excluding all other
writings, for the inspired book alone contains all things we can need. And he
adds the nature of the promise,&#8212; 3: <i>Concerning his Son, which was made of
the seed of David, according to the flesh</i>. By all the prophets, says he,
God has prophesied of the things relating to his Son, who, in his nature
begotten of him before all eternity, yet made himself the son of David,
inasmuch as he took his human nature, of the seed of David. Having then thus
mentioned David, it was necessary that he should subjoin, <i>according to the
flesh</i>, lest he should be considered as by nature the son of David, and by
grace only <A NAME="p38"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|38</SPAN></A> the Son of God; for the addition, <i>according to the flesh</i>,
indicates that as to his divinity he is in truth the Son of God the Father. For
indeed this phrase we can never find applied to those who simply are such as
they appear; as St. Matthew the evangelist witnesses, when saying, Abraham
begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah, and so going through
the whole genealogy in order, he never yet uses this expression, according to
the flesh, seeing that it suited not them which were mere men; and so then the
divine incarnate Word of God being not only man, but God also from eternity,
the apostle, having mentioned David, necessarily adds <i>according to the
flesh</i>, clearly to teach us how he was indeed the Son of God, and how yet
made to be of David;&nbsp; 4.
<i>And declared to be the Son of God with power,
according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead of Jesus
Christ our Lord.</i></p>



<p>Before his cross and passion, not only to the other Jews, but even
to the apostles themselves, our Lord Christ did not seem to be God; for they
were misled by his perfect humanity, when they saw him eating and drinking, and
sleeping, and becoming fatigued; nor could even his miracles bring them to this
conviction; and thus, for instance, when they beheld the miracle at the sea of
Tiberias (Matt. viii. 27,) they cried out, &quot;What manner of man is this,
that even the winds and the sea obey him!&quot; In full accordance with which,
our Lord said unto them, (John xvi. 12,) &quot;I have many things to say unto
you, but ye cannot bear them yet. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is
come, he will guide you into all truth and again, (Luke xxiv. 49,) &quot;Tarry
ye here in this city, until ye shall be endued with power from on high, the
holy Ghost coming upon you.&quot;</p>



<p>Before his passion, then, such were the ideas they entertained of
him; but after his resurrection and ascension to heaven, and the illumination
of the thrice holy Spirit, and the various miracles which by the invocation of
his sacred name they performed, all the faithful knew that be is God, and the
only-begotten Son of God. This then the holy apostle teaches here, that he, who
according to the flesh was designated as the son of David, was proved and set
forth as the Son of God, in the power exercised by the thrice holy Spirit,
after the resurrection from the dead of the same our Lord Jesus Christ; 5. By
whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among
all nations, for his name. For he himself sent us forth as teachers, committing
to us the salvation of all nations, and giving grace suitable to that
preaching, that they who hear it may hearken unto us, and believe the word. 6.
Among whom are ye also called of Jesus Christ. Of which nations, whose
husbandry is thus entrusted to me, ye are part; for think not that I am
appropriating what belongs to another, or seizing on fields allotted to some
one else, for the Lord hath constituted me the minister of all the Gentiles; 7.
<i>To all that are beloved of God in Rome, called saints.</i></p>



<p>He at the same time honours them with such high and divine appellations,
and represses every rising of arrogance. For, in the first place, instead of
making any distinction between them as the masters of the world, and the other
nations, he joins them with them; and, secondly, he writes to all, without
respect of persons, addressing together, servants, beggars, and working-people;
the wealthy, and the powerful; for that there were some of the latter who
believed, he shows in the Epistle to <A NAME="p39"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|39</SPAN></A> the Philippians, (iv. 22,) saying, &quot;They that are of Caesar's
household salute you.&quot; It is evident, indeed, that he writes not to the
unbelieving, but to those already converted, wherefore he calls them both <i>called</i>,
and <i>saints,</i> exalting them with such spiritual appellations, and
inflaming thereby their love towards their great Benefactor. <i>Grace be unto
you, and peace from God our Father</i>, <i>and the Lord Jesus Christ</i>.</p>



<p>Thus then he completes the introduction to his letter, &quot;Paul,
a servant of Jesus Christ, to all that in Rome are beloved of God, called
saints; grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ;&quot; the rest which intervenes he
threw in between, in order to mark whose messenger be had been constituted, and
what were the tidings wherewith he had been entrusted, and to whom he had been
commissioned to bring them. And he invokes on them first <i>God's grace</i>,
because by this it was that believers obtained salvation; and next <i>peace</i>,
by which he indicates the full establishment of virtue, since he alone has
peace with God who has embraced an evangelical course, seeking ever to serve
him in all things. And of these gifts he shows that not the Father only, but
the Son also is the giver, in saying, <i>from God our Father, and the Lord
Jesus Christ;</i> by which expression he plainly teaches the equality of the
Father and the Son. 8. <i>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you
all</i>, <i>that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</i></p>



<p>The apostle speaks not thus to flatter them, but in strict truth.
For it was impossible that what happened at Rome should not be known throughout
all the world; since there anciently the Roman emperors had their palaces, and
from thence the monarchs proceeded, and the collectors of tribute throughout
the different cities, and there resorted all who sought the favour of royalty,
by all of whom it was spread abroad, that Rome bad received the doctrine of
Christ; which was of the greatest benefit to those who heard it, on which account
the holy apostle returns thanks to God for the same. <A NAME="p93"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|93</SPAN></A> </p>



<p>And now, since he had declared that he had been appointed the
teacher of all the gentiles, and yet during so long a time had neither come
himself unto them, nor instructed them in the truth by letters, he is
constrained to speak in his own defence, and calls God to witness his affection
towards them. 9. <i>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the
gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my
prayers</i>; 10. <i>Making request, if by any means now at length I might have
a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you</i>.</p>



<p>There are many kinds of service; for he who prays to God is
serving him, and he who fasts; and he who applies himself to the diving
oracles; and indeed even he who busies himself in providing hospitality to
strangers; and here then the holy apostle speaks of <i>serving God</i> in
bringing the gospel of his Son to the gentiles, and serving <i>in the spirit</i>,
that is, in the spiritual gift conferred on him;<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> so pleasing to God did <A NAME="p94"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|94</SPAN></A> he feel was the glory of his Son. And, expressing himself
critically, he does not simply say that he begged for this entrance unto them,
but <i>according to the will of God</i>, that is, if it so please the Ruler of
all things. If then where the salvation of so many thousands was concerned,
the apostle yet asked not any thing absolutely, but to his petition joined the
Divine will, how inexcusable must ourselves be, if busied about, and praying
for, the mere objects of sense, we rest not at once all things concerning us on
the Divine good pleasure. 11. <i>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto
you some spiritual gift</i>. What he says is full of humility; his words are
not, that I may &quot;give,&quot; but that I
may &quot;<i>impart</i>;&quot; that is, of what I
myself have received I may communicate unto you. Inasmuch, moreover, as the
great Peter had already conveyed to them the doctrines of the gospel, he
necessarily adds, to the end ye may be established; for I desire, says he, not
to bring you some other doctrine, but to confirm that already preached among
you, and to water trees already planted.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A> And full of modesty again is what he
adds, 12. <i>That is, that I may be comforted together with you, by the mutual
faith both of you and me</i>; for not only do I wish to give, but to receive
also from you, for the zeal of the disciple comforts and invigorates the
master. 13. <i>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that often times I
purposed to come unto you, but was prevented hitherto</i>.</p>



<p>He shows what he had intended, and how Providence had overruled
that intention; for Divine grace, says he, orders me even as he will; and having
thus thrown in the &quot;<i>I have hitherto been prevented</i>,&quot; he shows
the more clearly on what account he had been anxious to come to them&#8212; <i>that I
might have some fruit among you also, even as among other gentiles</i>. 14. <i>I
am a debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians; both to the wise and to
the unwise</i>; 15. <i>So that as much as in me lies, I am ready to preach the
gospel to you that are at Rome also</i>. I have been appointed the teacher of
all nations, wherefore I owe the debt of an evangelist not to the Greeks only,
but to the Barbarians also. For this was it that the grace of the Spirit
conferred on us the gift of other tongues; and it behoves us to discharge our
debt both to those who boast in their wisdom, and to those who are unlearned
likewise. By wise he means those who prided themselves on their eloquence; by
unwise, those who for their ignorance were so denominated by such as were
called philosophers, or wise men. And, as not all would receive the preaching
of the gospel, fitly has he added, <i>as much as in me lies</i>; for it is mine
to preach, but the believing depends on the hearers. And as he frequently calls
this preaching by the name of the gospel, and the gospel contains an account of
our Lord's passion, cross, and death, all which to the unbeliever seemed full
of dishonour, he seasonably adds, 16. <i>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of
Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth,
to the Jew first, and also to the Greek</i>. I look not, says he, to the
apparent disgrace, but to the blessing arising therefrom, namely, that from it
believers obtain salvation. <A NAME="p95"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|95</SPAN></A> </p>



<p>And thus of mere outward objects many have their own property
bidden within them; as pepper, for instance, has a cold appearance, and to
those that are unacquainted with it shows no sign of heat, while he that bites
it with his teeth perceives its fiery nature; on which account physicians rank
it among hot things as to its quality, as though not looking so, and yet
capable of being proved to be such. And thus also corn may become the root, and
the stock, and the ear, which yet it could never seem, until it has been sown
in the furrows of the field. Justly then does the holy apostle call the saving
gospel <i>the power of God</i>, as exhibiting its power, and bestowing
salvation, only on believers. And this he says is offered to all, both Jews and
Greeks; and the Jews he puts first, before the Greeks, inasmuch as our Lord
Christ sent the holy apostles as preachers to them first; for thus God
proclaims by the prophet (Is. xlii. 6,) &quot;I have appointed thee for a
covenant of the people, for a light of the gentiles calling the Jews the
people, since of them he sprung according to the flesh. 17. <i>For therein is
the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith</i>; not to all is it
revealed, but to those who have the eyes of faith.</p>



<p>The holy apostle here teaches us how from of old God has thus
provided for us, and predicted the same by the prophets; and even before the
prophets, had his own determination concerning these things secretly within
himself, for this also he states in another place, (Eph. iii. 9,) saying,
&quot;The mystery which hath been hidden in God, who created all things;
&quot;and again, (1 Cor. ii. 7,) &quot;We speak the wisdom hidden in a mystery,
which God foreordained before the world, unto our glory.&quot; And here
therefore he says not that <i>righteousness is given</i>, but <i>revealed</i>;
for that which had been so long hidden is now made known to believers. <i>From
faith to faith</i>, says he; for we ought to believe the prophets, and by them
be brought to the faith of the gospel.</p>



<p>But this may bear another sense also; for he who believes in our
Lord Christ, and has received the grace of the most holy baptism, and enjoys
the free gift of adoption, is led on to believe in yet further coming
blessings; the resurrection of the dead, I mean, eternal life, and the kingdom
of heaven. By the <i>righteousness of God, revealed in the gospel</i>, he
speaks not only of that which is hereby supplied to us, but that also which is
so plainly set forth in the mysterious scheme of this his dispensation. For he
effected not our salvation by mere power, nor destroyed the strength of death
by his mere voice and command, but by combining pity with justice. For the very
only-begotten Word of God, by putting on the nature of Adam, and keeping it
free from all sin, obtained this for us, and paying the debt of nature,
discharged the common forfeit of mankind.</p>



<p>But all this the holy apostle teaches more clearly below, and it
were better for us to follow on our exposition passage by passage. Having then
said that this salvation was offered to both Jews and Greeks, provided they
were themselves duly disposed towards it, he confirms the assertion by the
testimony of Scripture, saying, <i>Even as it is written, The just shall live
by faith</i>. This he subjoins for the sake of the Jews, in order to teach them
not to cling still to the dispensation of the law, but listen rather to their
own prophets, who from of old set forth salvation <A NAME="p96"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|96</SPAN></A> through faith. And here, quitting his first point&#8212;the censure of
the Jews, he commences his charge against all the gentile nations, that they
had recklessly violated the law implanted in their nature by their Maker. And
this blame of them includes a vindication of the Creator; for when he formed
them, he suffered them not to live like the irrational creation, but dignified
them with reason, and gave them judgment, and established in them the power of
discriminating between good and evil; which position is evidenced by such as,
before the coming of the Mosaic law, were illustrious for holiness and virtue,
as well as by such as followed the opposite course. For so Adam, the instant
he had transgressed the commandment, and eaten the forbidden fruit, attempted
to hide himself, under the stings of conscience; and when called to account,
neither denied what had been done, nor pretended ignorance in his defence, but
threw the blame of the accusation on the woman; which plainly shows that our
nature possessed the power of discerning the true character of things. And thus
again Cain, having privily slain his brother, when examined, &quot;Where is thy
brother Abel?&quot; denied it, and attempted to conceal what had been done, but
when convicted, confessed that his punishment was just, and owned the equity of
his judge, acknowledging that he had sinned beyond pardon; and a thousand other
similar instances are to be found in the holy Scriptures: wherefore the holy
apostle adds, 18. <i>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in ungodliness.</i>
For nature taught them both that God was the Maker of all things, and that they
ought to avoid unrighteousness, and seek righteousness; but they used not the
instructions which it gave as they ought to have done; wherefore he threatened
them with future punishment.</p>



<p>He here puts the word <i>revealed</i>, in that disbelievers who
hearkened not to those threats were the very persons who should experience the
truth of what he said. And vengeance he calls the <i>wrath of God</i>; not that
God punishes with any passion of mind, but that by giving it so awful a name he
might alarm the gainsayer. And he says, is revealed <i>from heaven,</i> because
our God and Saviour will appear from thence, as the Lord himself declares,
(Mark xiii. 26,) &quot;Then shall ye see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of
heaven, with power and great glory.&quot; 19. <i>Because that which may be
known of God is manifest in them:</i> who then gave them this knowledge? <i>for
God hath showed it unto them.</i> 20. <i>For the invisible things of Him from
the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things
that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead.</i> Creation, says he, and
all things made in that creation, the succession of time, the change of
seasons, the alternations of day and night, the labourings of the clouds, the
blasts of the winds, the fruitfulness of plants and seeds, and the various
other similar phenomena, plainly point out to us,&nbsp; that God is both the Maker
of all things, and that He wisely holds the keys of the creation; for He who
framed all things of His alone lovingkindness, can never leave neglected what
He hath brought into being; wherefore the holy Apostle says not the invisible
thing, but <i>invisible</i> <i>things;</i> that is, His creation, His
providence, His just sentence on each person, and all His various
dispensations; most unpardonable then are they who, enjoying such a multitude
of teachers, yet have received no <A NAME="p97"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|97</SPAN></A> improvement from so many lessons, for this he adds, <i>so that
they are without excuse</i>, for the works of creation themselves almost cry
out against them, that they have nothing to plead in arrest of the threatened
evils. 21. <i>Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,
neither were thankful</i>. For that they were aware of the existence of God,
they themselves testify by their continual use of His adorable name, while yet
rejecting all suitable sentiments concerning him. <i>But became vain in their
imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened</i>, for they followed
senseless notions, and welcomed in the darkness of infidelity. 22. <i>Professing
themselves wise, they became fools</i>. He increases their reprobation by the
very name they gave themselves, in that, while calling themselves <i>wise</i>,
they proved by their works that they were void of understanding. 23. <i>And
changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like unto
corruptible man</i>. For not choosing to perceive that the Maker of all things
is superior to decay, and far above all that is seen, they called the likenesses
of their own bodies, gods; for indeed it was not intelligences, which are
invisible, (ch. i. 23-27,) that their statuaries, sculptors, and painters,
endeavoured to convey representations of, but perishable mortal bodies; nor was
this impiety enough, but they must needs, moreover, worship the images of <i>birds,
beasts, and creeping things</i>; and while they should rather have considered
that some of these men eat as food, some loathe as unclean, and some avoid as
noxious, in their excess of madness and folly they made the likeness of these
very things &#8212;which men thus ate, loathed, or killed&#8212;into gods. 24. <i>Wherefore
God also gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts, to
dishonour their own bodies between themselves</i>. He puts <i>gave them up for
permitted</i>; and he means, that, seeing them willing neither by the works of
creation to be led up to the Creator, nor by the judgment of reason to choose
the better and avoid the worse in practice, he deprived them of his special
providence, and suffered them to be carried about like an unsteady vessel, no
longer enduring to direct those, who had fallen into the grossest impiety,
productive of a lawless life. 25. <i>Who changed the truth of God into a lie,
and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed
for ever. Amen.</i> Impiety, he says, was the foundation of their iniquities,
and by both they became stripped of the Divine grace. The name &quot;God&quot;
is what he here means by the truth of God, an idol made with hands by <i>a lie</i>;
because that when they ought to have worshipped the true God, they offered the
adoration belonging to Him to the creature instead. And to the same reproach do
they lie open, who call the only-begotten Son of God a creature, and yet
worship Him as God; for they ought either, admitting His divinity, to rank Him
not with created things, but with God who begat Him; or else, pronouncing Him a
created being, not to pay adoration to Him as divine.&#8212;But let us pursue the
order of our exposition. 26. <i>For this cause, God gave them up to infamous
passions, for even their women did change the natural use into that which is
against nature</i>. 27. <i>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use
of the woman, burned in their lust one towards another, men with men working
that which is unseemly</i>. Iniquity walks hand in hand with impiety, so that
as they had changed the truth of God into a lie, so did they in like manner
exchange the proper object and exercise of the <A NAME="p98"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|98</SPAN></A> passions for that which was abominable. <i>And receiving in themselves
that recompense of their error which was meet</i>. For infamy is the severest
penalty of such affections. And thus, what not even a victorious enemy had ever
attempted to inflict on them, they themselves willingly ran into; and
punishment thereby, heavier than that which any judge would impose, do they
voluntarily bring on themselves. And what then was the cause of all these
evils? 28. <i>And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,
God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not
convenient</i>. For if they had been willing to know Him, they would have
followed the Divine laws; but now, choosing to deny their Maker, they were
altogether stripped of his protecting care, whereby they wrecklessly ventured
on every kind of wickedness.&nbsp; 29. <i>Being filled with all unrighteousness</i>.
By <i>unrighteousness</i> he means that (disposition) which is diametrically
opposed to righteousness, for from this springs every kind of reprehensible
conduct. And he proceeds to detail its natural fruits. <i>Fornication,
wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit,
malignity; whisperers</i>,&nbsp; 30. <i>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful,
proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents</i>, 31. <i>Without
understanding, covenant- breakers, without natural affection, faithless,
unmerciful</i>. By <i>fornication</i> he signifies intercourse independent of
marriage. By <i>wickedness</i>, a savage disposition. By <i>covetousness</i>,
the desire of getting more and more, and the carrying off of what does not
belong to oneself. By <i>maliciousness</i>, the bent of the mind to evil, and
the planning of injury to a neighbour. <i>Full of envy</i>. Bitter is the
passion, and unable to bear the prosperity of a neighbour. It is the parent of <i>murder</i>,
and conceives <i>deceit</i>. Wounded by envy, and calling in deceit as an
helpmate, Cain led his brother forth into the field, and feared not to slay
him. By <i>malignant</i>, he means such as exercise their thoughts in laying
snares, and designing mischief to those around them.&nbsp; By <i>whisperers</i>,
such as privily murmur into the ear abuse of others standing by. By <i>backbiters</i>,
such as recklessly indulge in the scandal of the absent. By <i>haters of</i> <i>God</i>,
such as are inimically disposed towards him. By <i>despiteful</i>, such as are
given to petulance and insolence. By <i>proud</i>, such as are overmuch
elevated by every superiority they possess. By <i>boasters</i>, such as are
vainly puffed up, while haying no just cause for so exalted self- complacency.
By <i>inventors of evil things</i>, such as not only fearlessly run through all
existing ordinary evil, but devise yet further means of ill-doing in addition. <i>Disobedient
to parents</i>; and baseness indeed is this, of the grossest kind, nature
herself condemning it. <i>Without understanding</i>; for they who have fallen
upon so lawless a life have lost all marks of reason. <i>Covenant breakers</i>;
such as have embraced an unsocial and depraved state. <i>Without natural
affection</i>; such as will not learn the laws of friendship. <i>Faithless</i>;
such as fearlessly break through all engagements. <i>Unmerciful</i>; such as
imitate the ferocity of the brute creation. 32. <i>Who, knowing the judgment of
God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the
same, but have pleasure in those that do them</i>. We have shown how nature
teaches us to choose good, and avoid evil; but these, says he, nevertheless,
think it not enough <i>to commit such things</i>, unless they also <i>commend
such as do so likewise</i>: which is the last excess <A NAME="p99"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|99</SPAN></A> of wickedness, seeing that they ought not only to hate the
transgressions of others, but with loathing to reprobate even their own. <A NAME="p158"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|158</SPAN></A></p>
<h3 align=center>Chapter <SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>II.</SPAN>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>He proceeds now in another way to prove our possession of the
power of discriminating between good and evil. 1. <i>Therefore thou art inexcusable,
O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another thou
condemnest thyself for thou that judgest doest the same things</i>. But,
although thus situated, if you had received authority from any one to pass
sentence, you would punish the transgressors of the law as guilty, so perfect a
distinguishment have you between good and its <A NAME="p159"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|159</SPAN></A> opposite. It becomes you then to be aware, that in the very
judgment you pronounce on others as sinners, you involve yourselves in the same
condemnation, for you have not hesitated to fall into the same transgressions.
2. <i>But we answer that the judgment of God is according to truth against them
which commit such things</i>: but it is evident to those who think rightly,
that by the divine law all who transgress are obnoxious to punishment. 3. <i>And
thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest
the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</i> 4. <i>Or despisest
thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and long-suffering</i>? We know
indeed that in His own due time the righteous Judge will inflict vengeance on
every sinner, but you, says he, who are so ready to punish others, and to shut
your eyes to your own transgressions, imagine that you will escape the divine
tribunal. Not so. God bears with you, and has long-suffering, because He yet
waits your repentance, as he subjoins, <i>not knowing that the goodness of God
leadeth thee to repentance.</i> 5. <i>But after thine hardness and impenitent
heart treasurest up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation
of the righteous judgment of God</i>; 6. <i>Who will render to every man
according to his deeds</i>. For since you have an obdurate spirit, and remain
still in your iniquity, you are passing against yourself the sentence of
punishment, which God in mercy indeed yet delays, but will in the last day set
forth, allotting to each a recompense correspondent to their own works.</p>

<p>Well does he adopt the expression, <i>treasurest up unto thyself</i>
in order to show, that nothing of ours, whether word or deed, is consigned to
oblivion, but that they who love virtue are laying up for themselves a store of
good, and the workers of evil-doing the same (of evil). 7. <i>To them who by
patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory, and honour and immortality,
eternal life</i>. He teaches the difficulties of virtue, and displays its
crown, for the <i>patient continuance in welldoing</i> is expressive of those
difficulties, in that we must persevere in and carry through our virtue, and so
expect its crown: but the labour is but for a time, the gain eternal; and this <i>eternal</i>
he joins not to the life only, but to the <i>glory</i>, the <i>honour</i> and
the <i>immortality</i> also, being desirous to illustrate the reward of our
good deeds in as many ways as possible. 8. <i>But unto them that are
contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation
and wrath</i>, 9. <i>Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that
worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile</i>.</p>



<p>As with respect to the former party, it was not simply to any
chance person, nor to such as follow virtue sluggishly, that he promised those
blessings, but to those who are contented to undergo its difficulties and
labours, in like manner does he now threaten the heavy denunciations upon sin
not to such as are betrayed into it on some chance occasion, but such as
determinately pursue it, as is evident from the <i>are contentious</i>, the <i>obey
not the truth</i>, and the <i>work evil</i>. Jews and Gentiles equally, says
he, he will punish if transgressors, and deem worthy of the crown if zealous
after holiness and righteousness. By the <i>Gentiles</i> he means not such as
had become converts to the divine preaching, but such as had lived antecedently to our Lord's incarnation; nor to those among them who were idol-worshippers;
but those who, being beyond the Mosaic polity, yet had embraced true piety, and
sought after <A NAME="p160"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|160</SPAN></A> righteousness, does he promise eternal life. 10. <i>But glory,
honour, and peace to every man that doeth good, to the Jew first, and also to the
Gentile</i>.</p>



<p>He speaks thus, not without a distinct design, but with a view to
what follows, where he enters upon the accusation of the Jews. 11. <i>For there
is no respect of persons with God</i>. 12. <i>For as many as have sinned
without law shall also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the
law, shall be judged by the law</i>. God, says he, is the Maker of all, and
therefore the Judge of all; and the Jews then will he take account of, and
condemn, according to the Mosaic code, but those that have never received it,
whom he means by the <i>without law</i>, and their sin, He will justly punish
according to the knowledge of good and evil implanted in their nature. 13. <i>For
not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall
be justified</i>. For the law was not sent to us to gratify our ears, but to
lead us to the practice of what is right.&nbsp; 14. <i>For when the Gentiles which
have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having
not the law, are a law unto themselves</i>.</p>

<p>For that the divine law demands such a practical obedience they
also testify, who, antecedently to the Mosaic code, exercised themselves in
holy thoughts, and adorned their lives with virtuous deeds, and became their
own lawgivers. 15. <i>Which show the work of the law written in their hearts,
their conscience also being witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing
or else excusing one another</i>. 16. <i>In the day when God shall judge the
secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel</i>. He shows that the law
of nature was <i>written in their hearts</i>, and that the <i>self-condemnation</i>
or <i>self-vindication</i> of conscience was according to truth.</p>



<p>And I think it worth while to illustrate this by some example.
When then the admirable Joseph was bringing his plot to bear concerning
Benjamin, and attempting to take him for a slave, as if he had stolen the cup,
in order to prove the temper of his brethren as it were in the fire, then was
clearly manifested the strength of the testimony of <i>conscience</i>. For
then they were least inclined to turn their minds to that tragedy, and yet
could not but remember the sin themselves had committed two and twenty years
before, so that they cried one to another, (Gen. xlii. 21, 22,) that the blood
of our younger brother is required at our hands, while Reuben reminded them of
his entreaties among them. Agreeably then to this instance may we describe the
future judgment and conscience of those who lived beyond the polity of the law,
now as pleading their defence, and alleging ignorance, and now again admitting
the justice of the accusation, and confessing the equity of the sentence passed
upon them. And thus, again, Abimelech, (Gen. xx. 4, 8,) having the testimony of
his own conscience, cried to God, &quot;Lord, wilt thou slay an unconscious and
righteous nation? Said he not unto me, She is my sister, and she, even she
herself said, He is my brother? with an innocent heart have I done this
thing.&quot;</p>



<p>Having thus then laid down these matters, the holy apostle now
turns his discourse to the Jews, and says, 17. <i>Behold, thou art entitled a
Jew</i>, for this title was from of old a general and honourable one, wherefore
he says not merely named, but <i>entitled; and restest in the law</i>, for thou
weariest not thyself, like him who is a stranger to the law, in searching after
what is right and fitting in practice, but hast the law itself teaching thee
all things plainly; and <i>makest thy boast of God</i>, as of one, who has
honoured thee above all the <A NAME="p161"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|161</SPAN></A> nations on the earth, dignified thee with his especial providence,
bestowed on thee the law, and led thee by the prophets. 18. <i>And knowest the
will</i>, that is, the will of God: <i>and discernest the differences</i>, that
is, between things which are opposite to each other, righteousness and unrighteousness,
justice and injustice, temperance and excess, piety and impiety; <i>Being
instructed out of the law</i>, for this it is, which was thy teacher in these
matters; 19. <i>And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a
light of them in darkness</i>, 20. <i>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher
of babes</i>. He here points out their arrogant self- opinion, and lays bare
the superciliousness they exhibited towards proselytes; <i>which hast the form
of knowledge, and of the truth in the law</i>, for the divine law has furnished
thee with the characters of all these things. 21. <i>Thou therefore that
teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should
not steal, dost thou steal</i>? 22. <i>Thou that sayest a man should not commit
adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols<sub>t</sub>
dost thou commit sacrilege</i>? 23. <i>Thou that makest thy boast of the law,
through breaking the law dishonourest thou God</i>? He shows that they had
drawn no benefit from the establishment of the law among them, but being
content to pride themselves on its mere letter, and endeavouring to teach
others, while by their deeds contradicting their words, so boasted in the law
in vain; and he adds a proof to confirm the accusation, 24. <i>For the name of
God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written</i>; not
only art thou not the cause of glory being given to God, but through thee many
tongues are excited to speak evil of his name, in that when they witness thy
wicked life, they openly reproach the God who hath chosen thee for his own.</p>



<p>Having, thus shown that they had taken no advantage from the
Mosaic legislation, he turns his discourse to circumcision, and proves that it
also is deprived of its object, when separated from the other works belonging,
thereto; 25. <i>For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law; but if
thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision</i>. The
holy apostle follows in the train of the ancient prophecies, the God of all
says by the prophet Jeremiah, (ix. 26;iv, 4.)
&quot;All the Gentiles are uncircumcised in the flesh, but the house of Israel
are uncircumcised in their hearts;&quot; and again, &quot;Circumcise yourselves
to God;&quot; adding, in order to show what is the circumcision which he speaks
of as pleasing to God, &quot;take away the hardened foreskin of your
hearts.&quot;</p>





<p>Starting from this point, the holy apostle shows that circumcision
is idle, if the circumcision of the heart be wanting, for it was instituted in
order to that, which if absent the other is of no avail, since it bears but the
part of a sign. For where we put gold, or silver, or precious stones, or
valuable raiment, we are in the habit of affixing a mark, but, when none of
these is within, the inscription of such a mark is idle. 26. <i>Therefore if
the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his
uncircumcision be counted for circumcision</i>? The law, says he, demands
practice; when then thou who art circumcised hast not this, but the
uncircumcised has, oughtest not thou justly to be, called a sinner, and he
receive thine honourable name instead; no longer, acceding to your reproaches,
being named uncircumcised, but rather <A NAME="p162"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|162</SPAN></A> 
circumcised, as having cut off the evil of his heart. 27. <i>And shall
not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee who by
the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law</i>? Worthy of all
admiration is the exceeding greatness of the apostle's wisdom, in that it is
not the natural, which he opposes to the written, law, but the despised name to
the honoured, uncircumcision to circumcision. And this he says is free from
blame, for no one is born so of his own choice, but so the Creator formed his <i>nature</i>,
wherefore neither can any injury arise from thence to such as love virtue;
while thou hast received from thine ancestors the sign of circumcision, and
hast the law teaching thee what thou shouldest do, and yet in thy works actest
contrary to all that the law points at.</p>



<p>Having thus demonstrated that circumcision was given for a sign,
and had afterwards become idle, he then proves that neither has the name <i>a
Jew</i> any advantage, 28. <i>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly,
neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh</i>; 29. <i>But he
is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the
spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God</i>. He
falls back here upon the testimony of the prophetic writings, which we have
above quoted, for &quot;Circumcise&quot; says he, &quot;the hardened foreskin
of your hearts.&quot; <A NAME="p231"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|231</SPAN></A> </p>



<h3 align=center>Chapter <SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>III.</SPAN>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Having thus checked the pride of the Jew, and shown that he
boasted in vain in circumcision, and in the law, and in the name of a Jew; lest
any one should suppose that he spoke thus from an angry or hostile <A NAME="p232"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|232</SPAN></A> feeling, he continues, 1. <i>What more then had the Jew, or what
profit was there in circumcision</i>? If then, says he, some among heathen and
alien nations, who were adorned with piety and virtue, share in the divine
favour, to what good did God separate Israel from the Gentiles, and give them
the rite of circumcision? for by the <i>more</i> of the Jew he means advantage
above the Gentiles. 2. <i>Much in every way</i>. For He chose their ancestors,
He freed them from the dominion of the Egyptians, He made them the wonder of
nations by miracles of all kinds, He gave the law for their assistance, and set
over them His prophets; for this is what he means by <i>much in every way</i>:
while yet omitting the specific enumeration of all these, he is content to
mention the institution of the law alone&#8212;<i>Chiefly that unto them were committed
the oracles of God</i>. For this was the highest honour: while the other
nations possessed only that knowledge which nature gives, themselves to have
received the gift of the law in addition. 3. <i>For what if some did not
believe, shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect</i>? God
forbid. Well knew the God of all, says be, from of old, both who would keep His
law, and who would break it. They, therefore, who did not believe, by no means
invalidated<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> the divine mercies; nay, for even though all mankind should prove
ungrateful towards Him, this their ingratitude could not diminish the glory of
God; as he explains in what follows, 4. Yea, <i>let God be true, but every man
false</i>. For granting, says he, for argument's sake, that no one soul of man
offered to Him the praise and honour due, but all were infected with
ingratitude, which is what he means by <i>every man being false</i>, what
diminution would God's glory suffer from hence?</p>



<p>And the same thing has the blessed Apostle observed in another
place, &quot;For if we believe not,&quot; says he, (2 Tim. ii. 13,) &quot;yet
He abideth faithful. He cannot deny Himself.&quot; And here he subjoins the
testimony of scripture, <i>as it is written, that Thou mightest be justified
in Thy sayings, and mightest overcome when Thou judgest</i>. The word that here
denotes not the reason, but the result; for we do not therefore sin in order
that we may set forth the loving-kindness of God, but Himself supplies the
streams of His mercies to bring salvation to all; while men being free agents,<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
some prefer the service of God, and some walk in the contrary direction; and so
each find their end correspondent with the path they have chosen. But still
God's mercies having been extended to them (the latter) also, thus <i>is He
fully justified in</i> afterwards <i>judging them</i>, by His previous care
bestowed on them. And thus He Himself speaks to Israel, (Micah vi. 3,) &quot;O
My people, what have I done unto thee, or how have I grieved thee, or wherein
have I wearied thee, testify against Me?&quot; and then enumerates His blessings
one by one in order. And thus again in Jeremiah (ii. 5,) does He cry out,
&quot;What iniquity have your fathers found in Me, that they are gone far from
Me, <A NAME="p233"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|233</SPAN></A> and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?&quot; and again
subjoins a list of His past kindnesses. And here the holy apostle introduces a
conclusion in the person of his adversary: 5. <i>But if our unrighteousness
commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say, is not God unrighteous,
who taketh vengeance? I speak as a man</i>. 6. <i>God forbid</i>.</p>



<p>It was necessary that he should bring forward the objection raised
by others, and he shows its absurdity by his disavowal of it; for not I, says
he, speak thus, but have only stated the position of others, which is what he
means by as a man. For then how shall God judge the world? 7. <i>For if the
truth of God hath more abounded through my falseness unto His glory, why yet am
I also judged as a sinner</i>? It is one of the most absurd things thus to
speak; for the sentence of God is just. Nor can my own unworthiness advance at
all the glory arising to God for His kindness, for it were the extremest
injustice that they who advanced His glory should yet suffer vengeance from Him,
and expect eternal punishment; this indeed is what not even the most unjust of
men would do, how far less then He, from whom flow the very fountains of
righteousness! 8. <i>And not also, as we be slanderously reported, and as some
affirm that we say, Let us do evil that good may come? whose damnation is just</i>.
None of these things, says he, we ourselves maintain, but <i>are calumniously
reported so to speak by others, who will suffer the due reward of their
calumny</i>. For we must know that, as the holy apostles had declared that
where sin abounded, grace did yet more abound, some who themselves were zealous
in piety, yet uttering false accusations against them, had published, that they
had said, <i>Let us do evil that good may come</i>. But not such indeed was the
object of the apostolic doctrine, for they laid down exactly contrary rules,
that all should abstain from every iniquity, while only exhorting such as came
to their thrice-holy instructions to be of good cheer, in the pardon vouchsafed
by God for past offences. And here, ceasing from our exposition awhile, and
resting our mind, let us laud and magnify Him, from whose gift it cometh, that
man hath a mouth to speak withal, or remaineth mute and dumb; and pray to Him
that we may fully comprehend the mind of the apostolic doctrines. For He
assuredly will grant it, who hath said, &quot;Ask, and it shall be given you;
seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.&quot; With
whom, to the Father, together with the thrice-holy Spirit, belong glory and
majesty, now and for ever, unto endless ages. Amen.</p>



<h2 align=center>Book II.</h2>



<p>We have already said, that the holy apostle was desirous of
showing the necessity of the incarnation of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ;
on which account he began by speaking of those, who were strangers to, as well
as those also who were under, the law, and convicted the former of having
transgressed the natural, and the latter the Mosaic, law, and become worthy of
the deepest punishment. Herein does he imitate a skilful physician, who first
points out to his patients the virulent nature of their disorder, and then so
offers the assistance of his healing remedies. For this he also does; having
exhibited the sin of both parties, <A NAME="p234"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|234</SPAN></A> and proved them deserving of, and obnoxious to, punishment, he next
produces his medicine of faith, and sets forth the loving-kindness of the
divine dispensation, and says, 9. <i>In what then are we better than they? for
we have proved before both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin:</i>
10. <i>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: 11. There is
none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God</i>. 12. <i>They
are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is
none that doeth good, no, not one. </i>13.<i> Their throat is an open sepulchre;
with their tongues have they used deceit; the poison of asps is under their
lips: </i>14. <i>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: </i>15. <i>Their
feet are swift to shed blood: </i>16. <i>Destruction and misery are in their
ways: </i>17.<i> And the way of peace have they not known: 18. There is no fear
of God before their eyes.</i></p>



<p>In the part above explained, where he was comparing the case of
the circumcision with that of the uncircumcision, he subjoined, &quot;What more
then had the Jew?&quot; and here, wishing to show the pre-eminence of the grace
of the gospel, he says, <i>In what then are we better than they? for we have
demonstrated that those without the law, and those within it, have both gone
astray</i>, and he adds the testimony of David as exactly adapted to the matter
in hand; and he does so, as being particularly studious of brevity, since
otherwise he might have called in all the prophets to the condemnation of the
Jews, who allege the same, and even worse, things against them; whence he goes on,
19. <i>Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who
are under the law</i>. He words this with the greatest accuracy of expression,
in that he puts it not &quot;concerning&quot; those who are under the law, but
to those who are under the law; for it speaks much concerning the Babylonians,
and Persians, and Medes, and Egyptians, and many other nations, but,
nevertheless, even these predictions concerning them it addresses to the Jews. <i>That
every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God</i>.
And again, he employs the word that according to his favourite idiom, (or use
of it,) for the God of all did not therefore bestow laws, and send forth His
exhortations among men, <i>in order that</i> He might render them obnoxious to
punishment, but consulting for their salvation has He done this; themselves it
is who, by pursuing an opposite course, have drawn this vengeance on
themselves.</p>



<p>Being now about to enter on the privileges of faith, he first
demonstrates that all have need of it, and especially, above others, those who
boasted in the law: 20. <i>Because that by the deeds of the law there shall no
flesh be justified in His sight</i>. Some of the injunctions of the Mosaic law
agreed with the knowledge of nature, such as, &quot;Thou shalt not commit
adultery;&quot; &quot;Thou shalt do no murder;&quot; &quot;Thou shalt not
steal;&quot; &quot;Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbour;&quot; &quot;Honour thy father and mother and others of this kind:
for they who had never received that law, were yet fully aware that each of these
was deserving not only of condemnation, but of punishment likewise. And some,
again, the Lawgiver imposed on the Jews as suitable to them for that present
time only; such, I mean, as circumcision, and the sabbath, and sacrifices, and
sprinklings, and the rites respecting the leper, and the seminally unclean,
and such-like; which are the symbols of other things, and when fulfilled, are
not in themselves sufficient to make the doer just. <A NAME="p235"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|235</SPAN></A> 
Wherefore the holy apostle says, <i>therefore by the works of the law
there shall no flesh be justified in His sight</i>; and then, lest any one
should suppose that he was passing a censure on the law, he adds, <i>For by the
law is the knowledge of sin</i>. The law, says he, has given to man a more
accurate discrimination of sin, and made the condemnation lying on it the
heavier; but for the establishment of virtue it is not competent to be
sufficient for men.</p>



<p>Having thus shown that the law was only the teacher of good, he
proceeds to exhibit the power of grace: 21. <i>But now the righteousness of God
without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets</i>.
Who can sufficiently admire the power of the apostle's wisdom, who shows at
once that the law had come to an end, and that it consented to (the covenant of
<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>) grace. And aptly does he say <i>manifested</i>, for it has now laid clearly
before all the hidden mystery of the dispensation; while in this comparison
between <i>grace</i> and the <i>law</i>, by proving that both the <i>law</i>
and <i>the prophets were witnesses</i> to the former, he exhibits the greatness
of its conquest over the latter: 22. <i>Even the righteousness of God, which is
by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all that believe</i>. What had been
before put down is here repeated, that what was wanting might be added; for
having said <i>the righteousness of God is manifested</i>, and then interrupted
the sentence to speak of its character, it was necessary that he should resume
the phrase again, and show that it was <i>by faith in the Lord Christ</i> that <i>all
</i>who desired to do so enjoyed it, whether Jews or Greeks; the <i>unto all</i>
refers to the Jews, the <i>upon all</i> to the other nations; and this he goes
on to set forth more clearly&#8212;<i>For there is no difference</i>: 23. <i>For all
have sinned, and come short of the glory of God</i>. He briefly shows that <i>all
are guilty</i>, and need (the covenant of) grace: 24. <i>Being justified freely
by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus</i>. For by
bringing faith alone,<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> we have received remission of our sins, in that the Lord
Christ has offered up His own body for us, to be, as it were, the price of redemption.</p>



<p>25. <i>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiatory, through faith
in His blood</i>. The propitiatory was a golden plate, which lay over the ark,
having at either end the figure of a cherub, (Exod. xxv.) and from thence the
mercy of God was manifested to the high priest in his ministrations. The holy
apostle here then teaches, that the Lord Christ was the true propitiatory, for
that ancient one was but a type of this. This name, however, is applied to Him
as man, and not as God; for as God He Himself speaks from the propitiatory;
while as man He receives this appellation even as others, such as
&quot;sheep&quot; and &quot;lamb,&quot; and <A NAME="p236"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|236</SPAN></A> &quot;sin&quot; and &quot;curse,&quot; and the like. (See John i.
29, 36. Acts viii. 32.
2 Cor. v. 21. Gal. iii. 13.) And the ancient
propitiatory was bloodless in itself, inasmuch as it was also inanimate, and
received only the sprinklings of the blood of the victims; but the Lord is God,
and propitiatory, and high priest, and lamb, arid in His own blood hath worked
out our salvation, demanding faith only from us.&#8212;<i>To declare His
righteousness for the remission of sins that are past:</i> 25. <i>Through the
forbearance of God, to declare, I say, at this time His righteousness</i>. God
has both exhibited His own mercy in so long bearing with sinners, and has made
manifest His righteousness to all men; for that it was not without any further
view that He thus bore with sinners, but as preparing for them this mean of
salvation, the next sentence shows&#8212;<i>that He might be just, and the justifier
of him that believeth in Jesus</i>. For both these things should we learn from
hence, that the God of all has ordered His dispensations concerning ourselves
with justice equally as with mercy; and that whosoever believes in the Lord
Christ is made partaker of the righteousness which is by faith.</p>



<p>Thus briefly having stated the free gifts conferred by (the
covenant of) grace, he returns to his discourse respecting the law, and shows
that it yielded the victory to grace. 27. <i>Where is boasting then</i>? This
must be read interrogatively, and then comes the answer, <i>It is excluded</i>.
He says not destroyed, but <i>excluded</i>; that is, has no longer any place.<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
By <i>boasting</i> he means the haughty self-esteem of the Jews, who exalted
themselves as the only possessors of God's favour; while now, divine grace
having appeared abroad, and been shed among all nations, this arrogance had
been put out of the question, in that God had given to man a short and easy
mean of salvation in faith; for this the apostle continues to show forth in the
following sentences also, <i>By what law</i>? <i>of works? Nay, but by the law
of faith</i>. He calls <i>faith</i> here a <i>law</i>, not from
inconsideration, but as recollecting the prophecy of Jeremiah (xxxi. 31, 32,) &quot;For in those days, saith the Lord, and at that
time, I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house
of Judah, not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers.&quot;</p>



<p>If then the Mosaic law is thus styled a covenant, and the new covenant
again bears also the same name, and faith in Christ be the <i>law</i> it
enacts, in strict accordance with the phraseology of the prophet does the holy
apostle here apply the name of the <i>law</i> to faith. And then he subjoins
the conclusion concerning faith: 28. <i>We conclude therefore that a man is
justified by faith, without the works of the law</i>. By <i>law</i> here he
means that of Moses; but at the same time he says not, <i>we conclude that by
faith </i>a Jew <i>is justified</i>, but <i>a man</i>, the common name of the
whole human race; as he goes on to reason, 29. <i>Is He the God of the Jews
only; is He not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also</i>. And then,
as a position which cannot be disputed, he confirms it by the assertion, 30.
Seeing that it is one God which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and
the uncircumcision through faith. It is one God, who is the God of all; one,
who is the Maker of all; nor is it possible that He should be careful for some,
and leave others uncared for; wherefore <A NAME="p237"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|237</SPAN></A> He extends His salvation to all that believe. By <i>circumcision</i>
he means the Jews, by <i>uncircumcision</i> the Gentiles. And he next resolves
the objection which might be raised, 31. <i>Do we then make void the law
through faith? God forbid; yea, we establish the law</i>. For of old both the <i>law</i>
and the prophets prophesied of the things concerning the <i>faith,</i> and in
receiving therefore the faith <i>we confirm the law</i>. He then brings forward
evidences of all this, and, while having it in his power to adduce a vast
variety of testimonies from the prophets, prefers going at once to the very
root of the Jews, and demonstrates that the righteousness of the patriarch
Abraham himself was that which is of faith. <A NAME="p291"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|291</SPAN></A> </p>
<h3 align=center>Chapter <SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>IV.</SPAN>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>1. <i>What shall we then say that Abraham our father hath found,
as pertaining to the flesh</i>? What righteousness, says he, before he believed
in God, have we heard that Abraham our father had as his own by works? for <i>as
pertaining to the flesh</i> means that which is of works, inasmuch as it is by
our fleshly bodies that works are done. 2. <i>For if Abraham were justified by
works he hath whereof to glory, but not before</i> <i>God</i>.<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> The full
performance of good works crowns the doers with the prize, but does not exhibit
the loving-kindness of God; while faith sets forth both the disposition of the
believer towards God, and the loving-kindness of God, who by accepting such
faith proclaims him who has acquired it, victorious. And this he confirms by
the testimony of Scripture, 3. <i>For what saith Scripture? Abraham believed
in God, and it was counted to him for righteousness</i>. For the blessed
Abraham obtained not the divine attestation by living according to the law, but
enjoyed the riches of justification by believing on Him that called him. 4. <i>Now
to him that earneth it by his works the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of
debt</i>. For the doer of righteousness demands his reward, while the
righteousness which is of faith is the free gift of the God of all, as is
further exhibited in what follows, 5. <i>But to him that earneth it not by his
works, but believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted
for righteousness</i>.<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A></p>



<p>Having thus, in the instance of the patriarch Abraham,
demonstrated that faith was older than the law, he now again calls in another
trustworthy witness of this,&#8212;David the prophet and king, to whom the God of
all renewed the promises made to Abraham. For as he had promised to Abraham,
(Gen. xxii. 18,) that &quot;in his seed He would bless all nations,&quot; in
like manner did He proclaim to the most excellent David, (Ps. lxxxix. 35, 38,)
&quot;Once have I sworn in my holiness that I will not fail David. His seed
remaineth for ever, and His throne as the sun before Me, and as the moon
established for ever, and faithful is the witness in heaven:&quot; and again,
(v. 25,) &quot;I will set His hand also in the sea, and His right hand in the
rivers:&quot; and again, (Ps. lxxii. 11,) &quot;Yea all kings shall fall down
before Him, all nations shall serve Him:&quot; and such like.</p>



<p>And since then he had shown that the blessed Abraham had obtained
justification by faith, but then Abraham lived before the establishment of the
law, it was necessary that he should now show that David, who <A NAME="p292"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|292</SPAN></A> lived under the law, himself also bore witness to (the covenant
of) grace; and accordingly he says, 6. <i>Even as David also describeth the
blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</i>
7. <i>Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins
are covered</i>. 8. <i>Blessed is the man, to whom the Lord will not impute sin</i>.
The law, says he, brought punishment on such as sinned, but the prophet speaks
of the blessedness of those, who have received forgiveness of their sins. It is
evident, therefore, that he is speaking of the blessedness of our own
condition, and foretelling the free gifts of grace; and this grace be shows is
open to all, saying interrogatively, 9. <i>Cometh this blessedness then upon
the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also</i>? And then again he
establishes his position by the case of the patriarch Abraham, <i>For we say
that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness</i>. 10. <i>How was it
then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision</i>? <i>Not in
circumcision</i>, <i>but in uncircumcision</i>. He proves that faith is older
not merely than the law, but than circumcision itself, and that while
circumcision was yet unestablished, the patriarch received the testimony of his
righteousness, the righteousness which is of faith. How then could he need
circumcision, while having already obtained the righteousness which is of
faith? This he clearly explains, 11. <i>And he received the sign of
circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being
uncircumcised</i>. Circumcision itself, says he, is not righteousness, but a
testimony of righteousness, and a seal and sign of that faith, which he bad
exhibited before he was circumcised. <i>That he might be the father of all them
that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed
unto them also</i>. 12. <i>And the father of circumcision</i>. Here we must
make a full stop. For herein he shows that the patriarch first was the father
of such as believed, being uncircumcised, inasmuch as he himself, while
uncircumcised, offered to God the tribute of faith; and then of the Jews also,
as of those who were sharers with him in the circumcision; and this he lays
down again, yet more clearly, in what follows, <i>Not to them only who are of
the circumcision, but to them also who walk in the steps of that faith of our
father Abraham, which he had while yet uncircumcised</i>. For if any one sprung
from the Gentiles, and not having received circumcision, should follow in the
footsteps of that faith of the patriarch, which he had before his own
circumcision, he would not fail of relationship to him; in that the God of all,
foreseeing, as God, that He would hereafter gather together one people of the
Gentiles, and the Jews, and extend to them salvation through faith, represented
both of old in the patriarch Abraham. And thus then he calls him <i>the father</i>
of the Gentiles, in having shown that he had acquired, before his circumcision,
the righteousness which is of faith, and after his circumcision, had not walked
under the Mosaic law, but continued under the guidance of the same faith; in
order that both Jews and Greeks, looking to him, might in common aim at his
faith, neither the one anxious for his circumcision, nor the other his
uncircumcision, for it is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, but faith
which the holy Scripture speaks of as (the mean of v. 3, 5, 9, &amp;c.)
righteousness.</p>



<p>Having thus shown that faith was both older and more excellent
than the law, he now also shows that the law was subsequent to the promise <A NAME="p293"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|293</SPAN></A> given to Abraham, in order thereby to make it manifest that (the
covenant of) grace was itself also anterior to the law, seeing that of this it
was, that the promises were given to Abraham; for the promise was, that
&quot;in his seed all the nations should be blessed,&quot; which promise
received its accomplishment in Christ. 13. <i>For the promise, that he should
be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham or to his seed, through the law,
but through the righteousness of faith</i>: for it was by believing in God, and
not by walking according to the Mosaic law, that he received the promise of the
blessing of the nations. 14. <i>For if they which are of the law be heirs,
faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect</i>; for if they who
live according to the law obtain the promised blessings, in vain did Abraham
believe in God, and false and not true were the promises made to him by God.
15. Because the law worketh wrath; for it is the character of the law to punish
the transgressors thereof; by wrath he means punishment; for where no law is
there is no transgression, for the law punishes the violators of it, for with
the law are connected observance and violation; some through zeal for virtue
preferring to keep it, and some through love of ease carelessly suffering themselves
to violate it.</p>



<p>16. <i>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the
end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the
law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us
all</i>. He puts down the arrogance of the Jews by applying the name,
seed of <i>Abraham</i>, to such as imitated the faith of Abraham, however
aliens in blood. But if then, while the law punishes transgressors, (the
covenant of) grace gives forgiveness of sins, it confirms thereby the promise
made by God, in bringing that blessing on the <i>nations</i>. And as He had
called Abraham, <i>the father</i> both of the nations, and of the Jews, he
supports the expression by testimony from Scripture, 17. <i>As it is written, I
have made thee a father of many nations</i>, and then he strengthens this testimony
by an evidence, <i>Before Him whom he believed, even God who quickeneth the
dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were</i>. For as,
says he, God is the Maker of all, and the God, and carer for, all, so did He
constitute Abraham, <i>the father of all</i>, not of the Jews only, but of all
who believe.</p>



<p>And he (next) exhibits the greatness of Abraham's faith, 18. <i>Who
against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations,
according to that which was spoken, &quot;So shall thy seed be.&quot; </i>&nbsp;19. <i>And
not being weak in faith so as to consider his own body now dead, being about an
hundred years old, neither the deadness of Sarah's womb</i>; for while he saw
that his wife was barren, that the impotency of old age lay upon both, and that
there appeared not, according to human calculation, the smallest hope of
child-bearing, and was unable to produce a single similar instance from earlier
times for his encouragement, he yet welcomed the divine promise with
confidence; for <i>against hope</i> means hope from nature; <i>in hope</i>,
confidence in the divine promise. 20. <i>But he staggered not at the promise of
God, through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God: </i>21. <i>And
being fully persuaded that, what He had promised, He was able also to perform</i>.
For he looked not to the impotence of nature, but trusted, without doubting, in
the Creator of that nature. 22. <i>Wherefore also it was imputed unto him for
righteousness</i>; that is, faith was. <A NAME="p294"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|294</SPAN></A> </p>





<p>Having thus shown that faith flourished among those, who were
under the law, and those also who lived before it, he turns his discourse to
the object proposed. 23. <i>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that
faith was reckoned unto him for righteousness</i>, 24. <i>But for us also, to
whom it shall be reckoned, if we believe on Him that raised up Jesus our Lord
from the dead</i>. Thus then the patriarch, while he saw the womb of his wife
dead, yet believed that it was easy for God to fulfil his promise; and thus
then we, while we hear the Jews declaring that our Lord Christ is dead, believe
that He is risen again; wherefore we, in our turn, gather the fruits of faith,
and enjoy the righteousness springing therefrom. For not for nothing were
recorded the things which the Lord God did regarding the patriarch Abraham, but
that we, beholding them, might exhibit the like faith ourselves. He <i>that
raised up our Lord Christ</i> is spoken of His humanity, for, in the nature in
which He suffered, in that it was that He arose, and the suffering was of the
flesh, and not of the impassible Godhead. 25. <i>Who was delivered up for our
offences, and was raised again for our justification</i>; for for our offences
He underwent His passion, that He might pay off our debt, and that His
resurrection might work out the common resurrection of all; for by it we both
gain the means of our own justification, and, being buried with Him in baptism,
receive remission of sins.</p>



<p>Having thus shown the power of faith, and displayed the gifts of
(the covenant of) grace, he now turns his discourse to exhortation, bidding us
also take heed to the practice of virtue; for having said that, when (the
covenant of) faith was revealed, the law became superseded, and that the
patriarch had attained the righteousness which is of faith, it was necessary
that he should add moral counsels, lest such as lived at ease should take
occasion from hence to neglect practical virtue, under the plea that faith
alone was sufficient<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> for justification. <A NAME="p349"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|349</SPAN></A> </p>



<h3 align=center>Chapter <SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>V.</SPAN>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>1. <i>Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace
with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, </i>2. <i>By whom now we have
access, by faith, into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the
glory of God</i>. Faith then has given us remission of sins, and made us
blameless and just by the regeneration of the baptismal font, and it is
incumbent on you to preserve the peace thus effected. For the only-begotten by
His incarnation has reconciled you, while you were in hostility with Him, and
sin it was that produced this hostility, righteousness therefore it must be
which will maintain the peace commenced; and this then we are in every way
bound to pursue by the consideration of the hopes held out, and the glory promised
by God to be given to us. For the recompense of our labours he calls not
payment, but <i>glory</i>, to show the excess of our reward. And as they had at
that time to endure many troubles, being beaten, tortured, and subjected to a
thousand kinds of death, he most fitly brings forward the sources of
consolation connected with these things, 3. <i>And not only so, but we even
glory in tribulations</i>. He has displayed brightly his own insuperable
magnanimity, for it is not, we patiently endure afflictions, which he says, but
<i>we even rejoice in afflictions</i>; we are exalted, he exclaims, and take
pride to ourselves, as fellow-sharers with the Lord of sufferings; but this he
says not openly, because they alone could so feel, who with himself had arrived
at completeness<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> in the faith; the rest he encourages by what should come
hereafter. 4. <i>Knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience
proof,</i><A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A><i> and proof hope. </i>5. <i>And hope maketh not ashamed</i>. When
misfortunes surround a man, and he bears their attack nobly, he is thereby
shown <i>to stand his proof</i>, <A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> and leans on the <i>hope</i> of the future;
and this is not a fallacious hope, but one based on truth; which is what he
means by <i>maketh not ashamed</i>, they who hope, and then are disappointed,
being confounded and ashamed. <A NAME="p350"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|350</SPAN></A></p>



<p><i>Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy
Ghost which is given unto us</i>. For the grace of the
thrice holy Spirit, which we received through baptism, has kindled the love of
God within us. And he then sets forth the causes of this love. 6. <i>For when
we were yet without strength, in time Christ died for the ungodly. </i>7. <i>For
scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet peradventure for a good man some
would even dare to die</i>. For we reflect, that when we were yet
transgressors, and suffering under the infection of impiety, the Lord Christ
endured that death, which was inflicted on our behalf; and hence we learn the
depth of His loving-mercy, for for a just man it might be, that some might face
death, but He, through the excess of His love, welcomed the death which was in
behalf of sinners; as he also goes on to say, 8. <i>But God commendeth his love
towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us</i>. God
then makes manifest the greatness of His love towards us, in the death of
Christ having been undergone, not for such as had been just, but for such as
were yet transgressors. For we now have been justified by faith in Him, but,
when He undertook that death for us, we were still subject to every kind of
sin; the words, <i>in time</i>, mean, at the fit time, in due time, and this he
says also in his epistle to the Galatians, (iv. 4, 5.) &quot;<i>But when the
fulness of the time was come</i>, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made
under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive
the adoption of sons.&quot; 9. <i>Much more then, having now been justified by
His blood, shall we be saved from wrath through Him</i>. Having encountered
that accursed (see Gal. iii. 13) death for the ungodly and transgressors, it
is evident that He will free from the future punishment those, that believe in
Him; for that future (eternal) punishment is what he here calls wrath. 10. <i>For
if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of His Son,
much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved in His life</i>. If while
we were antagonists, and enemies, He thought fit to treat us with so great
consideration, as to give up His Son to die for us, how is it possible, now
that reconciliation has been effected, that we should not share in everlasting
life? And here again he calls the Lord Christ, <i>the Son</i>, who, the same,
is both God and man; it must be evident therefore, I apprehend, even to the
most determined heretics, as to which nature His passion took place.</p>

<p>11. <i>And not only so, but we joy also in God, through our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation</i>.
For not only do we expect immortal life, but even as to the present existence,
glory in having been brought near unto God, while we reflect upon the things
concerning the Lord Christ, who, being our mediator, has effected peace.</p>



<p>From hence he proceeds to explain the mystery of the dispensation,
and show the reasons of the incarnation, 12. <i>Wherefore, as by one man sin
entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, in
that all have sinned</i>. The Lord God having formed Adam, and dignified him
with reason, imposed on him one single law for the exercise of those rational
faculties; for indeed it was not meet that one who had received reason, and possessed
the power of discriminating between good and its opposite, should live without
any law at all. He, having been beguiled, transgressed the command. But, from
the first, the lawgiver had to the command affixed the threat of retribution,
and thus, <A NAME="p351"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|351</SPAN></A> falling under the sentence of death, he so begot Cain, Seth, and
the rest. All therefore, as having sprung from him, inherited a mortal nature.
Now such a nature has need of many things, food, and drink, and clothing, and
houses, and various arts, and the use of these oftentimes excites the passions
into excess, and excess begets sin; and therefore the holy apostle says, that
Adam having sinned, and become mortal through that sin, both descended to his
race, for <i>death</i> came upon all men, in that all have <i>sinned</i>, for
not on account of our first father's transgression, but for his own, each
receives the sentence of death.<A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A> 13. <i>For until the law sin was in the world,
but sin is not reckoned </i>(<i>such</i>)<i> where there is no law</i>. He
accuses not, as some suppose, those who lived before the law, but all alike;
for the <i>until the law</i> means, not until the commencement of, but until
the end of, the law; that is, while the law reigned sin had power, for where
there is no law, neither can there be transgression.</p>



<p>14. <i>But death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that
had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the type of
Him that would come after</i>. By <i>Moses</i> he means the law, as we also
find in the Gospels (Luke xvi. 29,) &quot;They have <i>Moses</i> and the
prophets;&quot; <A NAME="p352"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|352</SPAN></A> and so also the holy apostle speaks in the Second Epistle to the
Corinthians (iii. 15,) &quot; But even unto this day, when <i>Moses</i> is
read, the vail is upon their hearts,&quot; that is, the law. Death then, says
he, reigned from Adam until the manifestation of the Saviour, for then the law
received its end, &quot;for the law,&quot; says he, &quot;and the prophets,
prophesied until John; but from the days of John the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.&quot; (Matt. xi. 12, 13.)
And death, moreover, reigned over those also, who had not sinned after the likeness
of Adam's transgression, for although they had not transgressed that
particular commandment, they had nevertheless ventured on other sins. And he
calls Adam the <i>type</i> of Christ, for the latter he designates as <i>Him
that would come after</i>, on this account, that as Adam first, by his sin,
became subject to the sentence of death, and thus the whole race followed their
first parent, so the Lord Christ, having fulfilled the most perfect
righteousness, destroyed the power of death, and first rising from the dead
shall restore the whole race of man to life. And as he had called Adam the type
of Christ, he shows the pre-eminence (of the latter.) 15. <i>But not as the
offence, so also is the free gift</i>. And how then is this? <i>For if through
the offence of one, many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by
grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many</i>. As
regards punishment, says he, the Lord God preserved the strict law of justice,
and Adam, having sinned, and been given over to death, the whole race followed
him; how much more right then that, as regards God's loving-mercy, justice
should also be preserved, and all men share in the resurrection of our Lord
Christ! He here calls the Lord Christ a <i>man</i>, to show clearly the type in
Adam, that as there by one man (came) death, so here by one man the dissolution
of death. 16. <i>And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift; for the
judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto
justification</i>. The munificence of grace, says he, goes beyond the limits
of justice, for then, one having sinned, the whole race received punishment,
but now, all mankind having been unholy, and transgressors, it has brought, not
punishment but, the free gift of life.</p>



<p>17. <i>For if by one man's offences death reigned by one; much
more they which receive the fulness of grace, and of the gift, and of righteousness,
shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ</i>. If the transgression of
one man established the dominion of death, it is evident that they, which enjoy
the plenteous gifts of God, shall be conquerors over death, and share with
Christ in the imperishable kingdom and life eternal.18. <i>Therefore as
by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by
the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of
life</i>. Doubt not, says he, concerning what I have said, while looking to
Adam; for if those things be true, as indeed they are true, and when he had
sinned the whole race received the sentence of death; it is plain, that the
righteousness of the Saviour gains life to all men. And again he puts the same
thing in another form, varying his phrase, and again and again re-stating it,
in order the more clearly to open the mystery of the dispensation. 19. <i>For
as by one man s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one
shall many be made righteous</i>. With great nicety does he here, in the case
of those under Adam, and that of those under grace, adopt the word <A NAME="p353"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|353</SPAN></A> many, for indeed among the former we find some, who were superior
to the grosser sins, as Abe1, and Enoch, and Noah, and Melchisedek, and the
patriarchs, and even those who became illustrious under the law; and after (the
covenant of) grace there are many who embrace a sinful life.</p>



<p>Having thus shewn us, from what took place through Adam, the
reasons for the divine incarnation, he brings forward the objection<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> which
might arise, and offers a solution. The objection is with regard to the law,
which was given in the interim between Adam and the appearance of the Saviour;
wherefore the holy apostle says, 20. <i>But the law came in between, that the
offence might abound</i>. He means not, by <i>that it might</i>, that such was
its object; but uses the words according to his familiar mode of expression.<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
But what he is shewing is, that neither in time past did God leave men
neglected, but gave the law to the Jews, and by their means showed forth the
light of religion on the rest of the nations also. And aptly has he put <i>intervened</i>,
in that Christ was the end of the promise made to the patriarch; for &quot;in
thy seed,&quot; says He, &quot;shall all the nations of the earth be
blessed,&quot; and the law <i>intervened</i> between Abraham and Christ. And it
taught the more clearly how evil a thing sin was, while yet it was incompetent
to put a stop thereto, but only the more increased it, seeing that, in
proportion as more commandments were given, so many the more became the
violations of them. <i>But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound</i>.
It invalidated not, says he, the mercy of God, but rather displayed the
vastness of His loving-kindness. 21. <i>That as sin had reigned unto death,
even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus
Christ our Lord</i>. Here he finishes the argument, shewing that as sin,
begetting death, had reigned in our mortal bodies, exciting the passions to
excess; so grace, conveying to believers the justification which is of faith,
has her dominion also, one not coeval with that of sin, but eternal and
endless; for the former reigns over our bodies, but at their death ceases from
her power, &quot;for he who is dead,&quot; according to the holy apostle,
&quot;is freed from sin;&quot; while, after the resurrection, our bodies having
become imperishable, and immortal, grace will reign in them, sin having no
longer any place; for when the passions have ceased, there will be no room for
sin. And then again he proposes another objection arising from the subject, and
with ease resolves it. <A NAME="p407"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|407</SPAN></A> </p>



<h3 align=center>Chapter <SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C6"></A>VI.</SPAN>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>1. <i>What shall we say then? shall we continue in sin, that grace
may abound? God forbid</i>. By the reprobation of this, he shows its inconsistency,
but the question itself be put down, because of what had been just before said,
&quot;Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.&quot; Nor is he contented
with this bare condemnatory disavowal, but proceeds to treat the subject in
another way also:&#8212;2. <i>How shall we, that have died to sin, live any longer
therein</i>? And how have we died thereto? 3. <i>Know you not, brethren, that
as many of us as have been baptized into Jesus Christ have been baptized into
His death</i>? Thou hast renounced sin, and hast become dead to it, and buried
with Christ; how is it possible then that thou shouldst admit this same sin? 4.
<i>Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death, that like as Christ
was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should
walk in newness of life</i>. The very sacrament<A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A> of baptism has taught thee to
fly from sin, for baptism carries in it the representation of our Lord's death,
for in that thou hast communicated both in the death and in the resurrection of
Christ. It becomes thee therefore to lead a <i>new</i> life, as it were, and
one suited to Him in whose resurrection thou hast partaken. The divinity of
Christ is what he here calls <i>the glory of the Father</i>, for thus also in
another epistle he speaks, (Eph. i. 17,)<A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> &quot;That the God of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the <i>Father of glory . . . . .</i>&quot; and the Lord in the gospels (John ii. 19,) &quot;Destroy this temple, and in
three days <i>I</i> will raise it up again.&quot; Nay, and if heretics will not
receive this interpretation, neither so can they injure the glory of the
Only-begotten, for, even granting that it was the Father who raised Him up, as
man it was that He raised Him, for as man it was that He also endured the
passion. 5. <i>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His
death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection</i>. Since he had
called baptism, which places us in a state of salvation, a type of death, by
this change of name He plainly points out the resurrection, for whatever is
distinctly planted springs up again. 6. <i>Knowing this, that our old man has
been crucified with Him, that the body might be rendered inoperative as
regards sin, so as that we should no longer serve sin. Not our</i> <A NAME="p408"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|408</SPAN></A> nature, but our evil inclination, is what He here calls <i>the old
man</i>, and this he says has been <i>put to death in baptism</i>, that the
body may be idle as regards sin, for this it is which He means by <i>that the
body might be made to cease from sin, so that it should in no wise serve sin</i>.
And this He shows more plainly by another similitude:&#8212;7. <i>For he that is dead
is freed from sin</i>. For who ever yet saw one that was dead either invading
the marriage-bed of another, or imbruing his hands in bloodshed, or committing
any other of the catalogue of iniquities? 8. <i>For if we have died with Christ,
we believe we shall also live with Him</i>. It becomes us, therefore, also,
having been buried with Christ, to be dead indeed unto sin, but to await the
resurrection. 9. <i>Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead,
dieth no more: death hath no more dominion over him</i>. 10. <i>For in that he
died, he died unto sin once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God</i>.
Amply, by these words, has he proved his wish to make believers abstain from
sin. Once, says he, Christ died; and that He should a second time die were
impossible, for He now possesses an immortal body. On this account, therefore,
we all also enjoy one baptism; expect not then any second forgiveness by (means
of any second) baptism. He has indeed well said that He died unto sin, for He
was not subject to death, inasmuch as He had done no sin, but received death
for our sin. 11. <i>And thus indeed reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto
sin, but alive unto God, through Jesus Christ</i>. And do you, therefore,
display your bodies dead to the inworking of sin, but embrace the life which
is after Christ, by which you shall obtain the life eternal. To this advice it
behoves us all to take heed, flying from the snares of sin, and calling to our
aid Christ who has saved us; for, if called, He will appear, and extend to us
His own strength: in conjunction with whom, to the Father, with the thrice-holy
Spirit, belong glory and majesty, now and for ever, unto endless ages. Amen.</p>



<h2 align=center>Book III.</h2>



<p>12. <i>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye
should obey it in the lusts thereof</i>. A reign differs from a tyranny in
this, that a tyranny is exercised over those who unwillingly submit to it; a
reign, over subjects who are consenting thereto. He exhorts us therefore no
longer to agree to the government of sin, for the Lord in His incarnation has
overthrown its reign; and as one legislating for mere mortals, and such as
possess a body liable to passions, he enjoins things consistent with their
infirmities, and says, not Let not sin tyrannize, but, <i>let it not reign</i>;
for the former is its own property, the latter rests on our will; the motions
and tumult of the passions being engendered in us by nature, while the
performance of what are forbidden depends on our own volition. And he shows,
moreover, the short duration of the warfare by denominating the body <i>mortal</i>,
in that when it has undergone the termination of death the attack of the
passions ceases likewise. He exhorts us then, not to put a stop to the tyranny
of sin, but, not to obey it when intemperately inflaming the desires of the body.
13. <i>Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto
sin</i>. Having spoken of a <i>reign</i>, in strict keeping herewith, he
mentions its artillery also, and teaches us the way of victory, for the <i>weapons</i>
which <A NAME="p409"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|409</SPAN></A> sin uses against us are our own <i>members</i>. <i>But yield
yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead</i>. And, indeed,
just before he had said the very same thing&#8212; &quot;And so reckon ye also
yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God, through Jesus
Christ;&quot; that is, ye have been buried with Christ, and have risen again
with Him, wherefore ye are dead to sin, and aspire to another life. <i>And your
members, as instruments of righteousness, unto God</i>. He shows that the body
is not evil, but the work of a God of goodness, for it is competent to serve
God, if well and properly governed by the soul; wherefore it is the inclination
of our own free will to the worse that offers the members for weapons, as it
were, to sin; and again the love arising from our knowledge of good, which
prepares the members to obey the divine laws. For thus the tongue of the
musician, when he is in the right mind, offers up fitting melody to the God of
all, but when he is drunken and disordered, madly sends forth the horrid sounds
of impiety; and thus also it is both adorned by the words of truth, and
disgraced by falsehoods; and thus the eye likewise can look abroad both
modestly and lasciviously, both savagely and benevolently; and thus also the hand
both kills and pities; and, in short, all the members of the body become the
instruments of holiness when the Spirit is so minded, and of sin, on the
reverse, when it has embraced the governance of sin. But in another way also
does the holy apostle demonstrate the easiness of the victory: 14. <i>For sin
shall no longer have dominion over you</i>, says he. For nature no longer
fights singly, but has for her assistant the grace of the Spirit; for this he
adds, <i>for ye are not under the law, but under grace</i>. He shows that
before the coming of (the covenant of) grace, the law taught only what was to
be done, but afforded no help to those under it, while (the covenant of) grace,
in addition to the imposition of duties, extends assistance also, on which
account the legislative constitution of grace is also more complete than the
law, as removing the impediments by this succour. And here again he answers an
objection arising. 15. <i>What then, shall we sin because we are not under the
law, but under grace</i>? He notes this objection because of the gainsayers,
and first reprobates it, pointing out its absurdity, and says, <i>God forbid</i>,
and then more at length demonstrates the contrary. 16. <i>Know ye not that to
whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are whom ye obey,
whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness</i>? Whomsoever
ye choose to submit yourselves unto, his commands you are bound to comply with,
for it is not possible at the same time to obey two lords, but righteousness
and sin are diametrically opposed to each other; and this also the Lord says in
the holy gospels, (Matt. vi. 24,) &quot;No man can serve two masters.&quot; 17.
<i>But God be thanked that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from
the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you</i>. He both points out
the change in themselves, and exhibits the joy arising therefrom, giving
praise to God; for ye were, says he, the servants of sin, but by your own
voluntary choice you have shaken off its sovereignty, and embraced the divine
polity.<A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A> 18. <i>Having then been freed from sin, ye were made servants of
righteousness</i>. Ye have cast away the slavery of sin, and taken upon <A NAME="p410"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|410</SPAN></A> you the yoke of righteousness; it is not possible therefore that
bearing the latter you should yield to the commands of the former. 19. <i>I
speak after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of your flesh</i>. I
suit my exhortations to your nature, for I am well aware of the passions which
contend in a mortal body. <i>For as ye have yielded your members servants to
uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members
servants to righteousness, unto holiness</i>. By this also be shows that it is
not the (natural, see ver. 13,) body that deserves reprobation, but the disposition
that leads it astray. And he demands indeed from us nothing impossible, but
that what we did give to sin, the same we should afford to righteousness; and
to the former we subjected ourselves while it enjoined iniquity, the latter, if
we obey it, will bring us to holiness. 20. <i>For when ye were the servants of
sin, ye were free from righteousness</i>, for ye fulfilled its precepts only,
while as to the laws of righteousness ye received not them at all. And then
again, in another way, he exhibits the difference. 21. <i>What fruit had ye
then from those things</i>? Tell me yourselves the gains of sin; or rather it
were idle to ask, for in silence you confess its injury, for ye are covered
with shame, as he adds, <i>whereof ye are now ashamed</i>; for although any one
be barefaced indeed, he yet cannot but experience shame, when his enjoyment is
over. And he subjoins, in addition to this, the greater and more bitter fruit
of sin &#8212;<i>for the end of those things is death</i>. Death, he means not the
present, which is merely temporal, but that which is eternal. 22. <i>But now
having been freed from sin, and made servants of God, ye have your fruit unto
holiness, and the end everlasting life</i>. In these words he opposes God to
sin, holiness to shame, and life everlasting to everlasting death. 23. <i>For
the wages of sin is death</i>. As (according to the metaphor throughout
adopted, be had said that) it formerly reigned, and now tyrannizes, and he had
called its weapons our own badly-disposed members, consistently also does he
denominate the reward <i>wages</i>, for so he was in the habit of naming the
pay of soldiers; as in the epistle to the Corinthians, he says, (1 Cor. ix. 7,)
&quot;Who goeth a warfare at any time on his own <i>wages</i>?&quot; <i>But the
gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord</i>. Here he says,
not reward, but free gift, for eternal life is the gift of God; for though any
one should carry through the highest virtue, still those eternal blessings
could not justly be weighed as a requital for such present labours. Having said
these things to them that lived under (the covenant of) grace, respecting the
obligation lying on them to avoid sin, he again turns his discourse to the
comparison between the (covenant of) law and grace, and shows the strength of
the latter and the weakness of the former, and teaches that on the entrance of
the one, the other ceased. <A NAME="p480"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|480</SPAN></A> </p>

<h3 align="center"><i>&nbsp;</i>Chapter <SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C7"></A>VII.</SPAN>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>1. <i>Know you not brethren </i>(<i>for I speak to them that know
the law</i>) <i>how that the law hath dominion over a man, as long as he liveth</i>?
You well know, says he, you I mean who have been brought up in the law, that
the law has its authority over those who are yet alive; and he adduces an
example also in accordance with this proposition. 2. <i>For the woman which
hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband, so long as he liveth; but
if the husband be dead, she is made to cease from the law of her husband. And
then he shows this yet more clearly</i>: 3. <i>So then if, while her husband
liveth, she be married to another man, she is called an adulteress; but if her
husband be dead, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though
she be married to another man</i>. The law, says he, calls her an adulteress,
not who after the death of her husband is united to another, but, who while her
husband is yet alive, joins herself to any one else, for such an one it orders
to be punished as insolently rebelling against the law of matrimony; it is
evident, therefore, that when her husband has brought his life to an end, the
widow not illegally, but with the distinct permission of the law, may marry
another. Nor indeed was the holy apostle ignorant, that the law gave permission
to the living also to dissolve a marriage when it should be no longer
agreeable, but he was mindful of our Lord's assertion, which declared that
Moses gave them that law on account of the hardness of the heart of the Jews,
but that the law of nature had added no such terms, for one man, says he, and
one woman did God make, establishing the law concerning marriage in their very creation:
wherefore leaving this unnoticed, he passed on to the law as regarded the dead,
and subjoins, 4. <i>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law
by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to Him who is
raised from the dead</i>. It would have been indeed in strict consistency with
the example adduced, to have said, &quot;the law is dead,&quot; that is, has
ceased, but in consideration of <A NAME="p481"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|481</SPAN></A> the spiritual weakness of the Jews, for they greatly exalted the
law, and from a desire not to afford an opportunity of finding fault with it to
the heretics who denounced the Old Testament, he avoids saying that the law had
ceased, but declares that <i>we have become dead to the law</i> by baptism
which saveth us, and then rising again have been united, to Him who hath
Himself risen from the dead, that is Christ. And as he had called the faith
which is in the Lord a marriage and union, in strict keeping herewith does be
show the fruits also arising from marriage, <i>that we should bring forth fruit
unto God</i>, says he. What then is this fruit-bearing? That our members
become the instruments of righteousness. And most aptly does he show that the
law itself leads us to be joined to Christ, for it forbade not, says he, a
woman to be married to a second husband after the death of the first. And then
he goes on to point out the difference. 5. <i>For when we were in the flesh</i>,
that is, under the polity of the law, for the legislative ordinances concerning
the flesh, as of foods and drinks, of leprosy, and such like, are what he here
calls the <i>flesh; the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our
members</i>. He says not &quot;in&quot; the law but <i>by</i> the law, for it
does not itself bring about sin, but it condemns sin, while that, which was
good, sin uses for evil; neither indeed do our members themselves bring about
sin, but only by our members has the inclination of the soul to the worse
brought its operations to effect. And what then springs from hence? <i>To bring
forth fruit unto death</i>.</p>



<p>In these words he has taught us that before the coming of (the
covenant of) grace, while we were living under the polity of the law, the
attacks of sin to which we were subjected were the more powerful, in that the
law showed indeed what ought to be done, but offered no help to do it. 6. <i>But
now we are made to cease from the law</i>. He still continues in the same
cautious mode of expression, and says not, &quot;the law is made to
cease,&quot; but <i>we are made to cease from the law</i>, that is, it is
inoperative as regards ourselves, we are no longer under its polity. And how
are we made to cease from it? <i>Being dead to that wherewith we had been held</i>.
For when we were subjects of the law we came to baptism, and dying with Christ,
and with Him rising again, we were united to our Lawgiver, and no longer need
the polity of the law, for we have received the very grace itself of the
Spirit, as what follows proves, <i>that we should serve in newness of spirit,
and not in the oldness of the letter</i>. He here puts the <i>spirit</i> in
opposition to <i>letter</i>, and the <i>new </i>against the <i>old</i>, that by
the word <i>letter</i> he might point out the law, and by the <i>old</i> its
having come to a conclusion. For indeed by Jeremiah (xxxi. 31, 32) God says,
&quot;I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house
of Judah, not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the
day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt so that
the difference was shown even by the prophet; and on the appearance of the new
covenant, the old must yield. Having thus spoken, and foreseeing as one
honoured with the gifts of the Spirit, that some of the heretics would
understand this in derogation of the old covenant, and conceive that the old
law came from some other than the one same God, the holy apostle necessarily
states the objections and subjoins the answers to them. 7. <i>What shall we say
then</i>?<i> Is the law sin</i>? <A NAME="p482"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|482</SPAN></A> </p>



<p>He had in the former parts of this epistle laid down many
positions, which might have given an opportunity of finding fault with the law,
to such as were desirous of speaking evil of it, unless he had offered the
present solution of such questions, (as) &quot;the law entered in between that
the offence might abound;&quot; and &quot;the law worketh wrath;&quot; and
&quot;by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His
sight;&quot; and the like; wherefore, for the resolution of these very things
he proposes the objection. And first he shows that the interrogation is
profane, and adds the expression of disavowal, <i>God forbid</i>, and then he
teaches the utility of the law. <i>Nay but I should not have been aware of what
was sin, but by the law</i>. Not only, says he, is the law not the teacher of
sin, God forbid, but on the contrary it is the condemner of sin, for I should
not have known what was evil, unless it had shown me. <i>For I should not have
known that lust was, except the law had said Thou shall not lust</i>. The words
<i>I should not have been aware</i>, and <i>I should not have known</i>, are
not here indicative of a total ignorance, but mean this, that I received from
the law a knowledge more complete than the mere discrimination of nature. 8. <i>But
sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of
concupiscence</i>. In every way he endeavours to show that it was free from
blame, for having said that by the imposition of the law sins had been
increased, lest any one should suppose that the law had been the cause, he most
seasonably sets forth its way, that sin making use of the imposition of the
law as a mean for battle, beat down the weaker powers of judgment. <i>For
without the law sin were dead</i>, for where there is no law pointing out what
should be done, and forbidding What should not be done, sin has no place. And
he makes this evident by an example; 9. <i>For I was alive without the law once</i>,
for Adam before his transgression had no fear of death, <i>but when the
commandment came, sin revived, and I died</i>. For when God had imposed the commandment
respecting the trees, immediately the devil came to the woman in the serpent,
and uttered those deceitful speeches, and she being enticed, and beholding the
beauty of the fruit, was overcome by desire and broke the commandment. And with
Adam she immediately received the sentence, for he also had shared in that
food.</p>



<p>10. <i>And the commandment which was ordained to life I found to
be unto death</i>. In every way he vindicates the law, and the commandment, but
proves the evil of sin; for the commandment, says he, was the minister of life,
but the turning aside to evil begot death, wherefore he most properly says,
found, to show that the intention of the law, and the end brought about by sin,
were widely different things. 11. <i>For sin, taking occasion by the
commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me</i>. The same thing he had said
before, only in different words. 12. <i>Wherefore the law is holy, and the
commandment holy, and just and good</i>. It is the Mosaic which he here speaks
of as the law, and that given to Adam as the <i>commandment</i>. And the
reason why he honours the latter with the greater praises, is that it commonly
meets with the greater censures. For they who live in idle ease, and will not
undergo the labours of virtue, cry out even against God Himself, for imposing
this commandment. For if He were ignorant, say they, of what would happen, how
can He be God who foreknows not the future? but if while foreseeing the
transgression, He yet imposed the commandment, Himself is the cause of the
<A NAME="p483"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|483</SPAN></A> transgression! But such should be aware, that the power of
discriminating between good and its opposite is the property of those that are
gifted with reason, for the nature of the irrational creatures possesses no
such faculty of distinguishment of these things; for the wolf is ravenous, and
the lion feasts on its prey while scarce dead, and bears and leopards follow
in the same train; and they have no sense of sin,<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> nor a conscience to be
pricked at what has been done; while men, though no one be present at their
actions, are ashamed and afraid on account of what they have dared to commit,
for conscience supplies the accusation. How then were it possible that they who
possess such a nature, should yet live without any law at all? Wherefore God
enjoined the commandment, that man might thereby learn to understand his own
nature, and to fear his Lawgiver. And well indeed may we perceive the
loving-kindness of that Lawgiver, for He enjoined, not some law which was
difficult of observation, but one which could have been easily kept. He allowed
to him the enjoyment of all the trees, of one alone He forbade him the use; not
that He grudged him that one, for how could He do so, who had already given him
power over all? but in order to teach him the terms of submission, and to
render him well-affected towards his Creator, and afford a mean for the
exercise of his rational faculties. And if then, by not keeping the commandment
he came under sentence of death, this can be no cause for blame to the
Lawgiver, but to him who transgressed the law. For so neither, when a physician
orders his patient to abstain from cold drinks, does he do this because he
invidiously grudges them to him, but in order to bring about his health; and if
he not observing the injunction will take water, he draws the injury on himself,
but the physician is free from blame altogether. But indeed the Lord God has
treated with every possible consideration and kindness, both Adam himself and
all his race, and, to pass by all other, and come at once to the noblest
instance, for him, and his race, the only-begotten Word became incarnate, and
put an end to the power of death, which from him had received its beginning,
and promised the resurrection, and prepared the kingdom of heaven: so that He
both foreknew his transgression, and made ready before-hand the mean of remedy
to follow; wherefore the holy apostle calls the commandment holy, just, and
good; <i>holy</i>, as teaching what we ought to do; <i>just</i>, as rightly
pronouncing judgment on the transgressors; <i>good</i>, as appointing life to
such as observed it. And then again he states the objection that might arise,
13. <i>Did then that which is good become death unto me</i>? and again
according to his wont he denies it, God forbid, and shows us the cause of these
evils, <i>but sin, that it might appear to be </i>(indeed) <i>sin, in its
working death to me by that which is good</i>. There is an obscurity here,
arising from the extreme brevity made use of; what he means is this, that <i>by
that which is good</i>, to wit the law and commandment, <i>sin is made apparent
to me</i>, namely, as being bad and evil; and how is it so made apparent? <i>by</i>
its <i>working unto death</i>, for from the fruit I know the tree, and seeing
death I hate its parent; but of all this is the law the teacher; it is not then
the <A NAME="p484"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|484</SPAN></A> law, which thus instructs, that is evil, but sin, which brings
death; and it is the inclination of our own free will to the worse, that is the
author of sin. <i>That sin might by the commandment become exceeding sinful</i>.
For though nature points out sin, its excessive turpitude the law has more
clearly manifested. The expression <i>that it might become</i> is incomplete,
the word &quot;apparent&quot; being understood, for so also we explained it in
the preceding sentence, &quot;but sin, that it might be seen to be sin indeed
by its working out death to me by that which is good, that sin might by the
commandment become exceeding sinful,&quot; that is, that it might become by the
commandment &quot; apparent&quot; that sin is exceeding sinful, that is evil.
And then, like some skilful painter, he portrays the contest between nature and
sin. 14. <i>For we know that the law is spiritual</i>. Again be crowns the law
with praise, for what can be more holy than this designation? for it was
written, says he, by divine inspiration, being a partaker of this grace the
blessed Moses indited the law. <i>But I am carnal, sold under sin</i>. He
brings before us the man who lived before the coming (of the covenant) of
grace, beset by his passions, for by <i>carnal</i> he means one who had not yet
received the spiritual help (offered in that new covenant, see verse 5 ad fin.
and ch. vi. 14 ad fin. &amp;c.); but the <i>sold under sin</i> we shall
understand by comparing it with that passage of the prophet, (Isaiah 1. 1,)
&quot;For your iniquities have you sold yourselves.&quot; And the same thing
does he here say, I have delivered myself up to sin, and sold myself to it. <A NAME="p608"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|608</SPAN></A> </p>



<p>15. <i>For that which I do I know not</i>:
for he who is overcome by pleasure, and indeed he also who is intoxicated by
the passion of anger, has no clear perception of sin, but after such passion
has subsided receives a knowledge of the evil. <i>For what I would that I do
not, but what I hate that I do</i>. This is the perfection of the law, to point
out what is evil and implant a hatred of it in the soul. The words <i>what I
would not</i> and <i>what I hate</i> do not denote compulsion, but weakness;
for we sin not because driven thereto by some necessity or force, but being
beguiled by pleasure we fall into those things which yet we cannot but hate
and denounce as wicked. 16. <i>If then I do that which I would not, I content
unto the law that it is good</i>. For the very hatred I have for sin, I have
received from the law, wherefore I bear testimony to the law, and acknowledge
its excellence. 17. <i>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that
dwelleth in me</i>. This needs elucidation somewhat more at length. The body
then after the transgression of the commandment becoming mortal received
passions and appetites, since by these it is that our present state of
existence is carried on. For thus it needs desire, not only for the provision
thereby of food, but for the procreation of children also, and for
agriculture's sake, and the various other arts, none of which could exist were
desire altogether wanting. Thus it also contributes to our perseverance in
well-doing, for nothing but such an affection for and desire of virtue could
qualify us to bear its attendant difficulties. And so also does it work within
us the Divine love.</p>



<p>The proper measure of desire then is an auxiliary to good, but its
disorder brings forth intemperance, in that it leads us to lay snares against
the marriage-bed of others, and to covet what does not belong to us, and to
steal, and to break open tombs (in order to spoil the dead), and to commit
manslaughter, and become guilty of other the like crimes; wherefore has the God
of all added side by side to it (an uncalculating) impetuosity,<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A> that the
latter might repress the extravagance of the others, <A NAME="p609"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|609</SPAN></A> while itself also needing a check on its own excesses. As then we
dilate with what is too cold, that which is hot, and again correct what is too
cold by what is hot, even so has God our Creator, by implanting in us these two
passions directly opposed to each other, taught us to check each reciprocally
by the other. For over them He has placed the mind, like a charioteer over his
horses, and imposed the yoke of submission on them, enjoining both to bear it
evenly together;<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> if then it happen that desire springs forward beyond the
line, He bids her goad up impetuosity, that this rushing onward may again bring
the yoke straight; and, if that admit the overworkings of its own temper, again
in its turn He orders desire to be pressed forward, that it may correct the
excess of impetuosity. The mind then, if watchful and prudent, thus keeps
under and directs them, while if negligent, and letting the reins go, she
becomes the means of her horses breaking away, and is herself dragged onward,
and with them falls into pits and down precipices. This then is what the holy
apostle means by <i>now it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me</i>,
by sin intending the enslavement of the mind, and the usurpation of the
passions; and <i>he</i> then doeth it not, for he hates what is done, but this
usurpation of the passions is the author of the action.18. <i>For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, dwelleth
no good thing</i>. He speaks of the dominion
of the passions, which the mortality of the body introduced, and the indolence
of the mind has strengthened. <i>For to will is present with me, but how to
perform that which is good I find not</i>, for, as regards a willingness
towards that which is good, this I have received from the teaching of the law,
but at the same time, as regards action I am impotent from want of further
help. 19. <i>For the good that I would I do not, but the evil that I would not,
that I do</i>. 20. <i>Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it,
but sin that dwelleth in me</i>.</p>



<p>He makes the same assertion, only in a clearer manner. 21. <i>I
find then the law with me in wishing to do what is right</i>,&#8212;here we must put
a stop,&#8212; (<i>and yet</i>) <i>that evil is present to me</i>. Again he has
stated this obscurely through brevity: what he means is, that the law appears
to me to be good, for I approve all that it recommends, as being right and
excellent; and in unison with it I also love all good, and hate its opposite;
but nevertheless evil is ever at hand with me, that is, sin, by reason of my
possessing a mortal body, one subject to passions and appetites, as well as
through the indolence and weakness of the soul. And thence he proceeds to
describe more clearly the conflict between the mind and the passions. 22. <i>For
I delight in the law of God after the inward man</i>. By <i>the inward man</i>
he means the mind. 23. <i>But I see another law in my members warring against
the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is
in my members</i>. By <i>the law of sin</i> he means sin itself, and this works
within me by the passions of the body leaping about at pleasure, while the soul
is unable to restrain them, in consequence of the sluggishness fallen into at
first by her; she having cast off her own freedom, and allowed herself to be
subjected to them; <A NAME="p610"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|610</SPAN></A> while yet not the less does she, even though thus obeying them,
hate that servitude, and approve that (the law) which condemns it. Having thus
laid down all this, in order to show us what we were before receiving grace
(through the new covenant), and what we have become since that grace; and
personating, as it were, the character of those besieged by sin before grace
appeared; he now, as one in the midst of his enemies, taken captive and
compelled to obey, while perceiving help from no other quarter, groans
bitterly, and cries out, proving that the law could not succour him, and says,
24. <i>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?
I thank my God through Jesus Christ our Lord</i>. He calls it <i>a body of
death</i>, as being bom subject to death; that is, mortal, for the soul is
immortal. Christ alone, says he, has freed us from this bitter bondage, by
putting an end to death, and promising us immortality, and that life which is
without either labour or pain, and apart from warfare and sin; the full
enjoyment whereof we shall receive in the existence to come; while in the
present we are blessed with the grace of the thrice holy Spirit, and thereby
not only do we set ourselves against the passions, but by the possession of
such an Helper are enabled to triumph over them. And then he brings forward the
resolution of all that had been said, <i>So then I myself, the same person,
with the mind serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin</i>. <A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A></p>



<h3 align=center>Chapter <SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C8"></A>VIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>1. <i>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit</i>: for our
passions can no longer get the mastery over us without our own consent, now
that we have received the grace of the Spirit of God. 2. <i>For the law of the
spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death</i>.
As he had just before called sin &quot;the law of sin,&quot; so now does be
call the life-giving Spirit, <i>the law of the spirit of life</i>. His grace,
says he, by faith in Christ has bestowed on you a double freedom; for not only
has it overthrown the power of sin, but put an end also to the tyranny of
death, and he shows how He has thus overthrown it 3. <i>For what the law could
not do, in that it was weak through the flesh</i>. The law then was not evil,
but good, though impotent; and that weakness arose from its injunctions being
given to those encumbered with a mortal nature, for now by the thrice-holy
baptism we have received the pledge of immortality. <i>God sending His own Son
in the likeness of sinful fleshy and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh</i>.
He says not in the <i>likeness</i> of flesh, but in the likeness of <i>sinful</i>
flesh, for He received actually the human nature, but human sin he received
not; wherefore that which He thus assumed, he calls not the <i>likeness</i> of
flesh, but the likeness of <i>sinful</i> flesh, because though He had the same
nature with ourselves, He yet had not the same character or disposition. He
means, then, that the law having been unable to bring to effect its own design,
by reason of the weakness of those beneath its covenant, possessing as they
did a mortal nature, and one obnoxious to infirmities and passions; the
only-begotten <A NAME="p611"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|611</SPAN></A> Word of God, becoming incarnate, by that human flesh overthrew
sin, in having fulfilled all righteousness, and admitted no taint of sin; and
by enduring the death of sinners, as though Himself a sinner, manifested the
injustice of sin, in that it delivered up to death a body over which death had
no just claim. And this then both overthrew it and put an end to death; for in
thus submitting to death through the unjust sentence of sin, while not at all
obnoxious to it, in that He never committed sin, did He become the price of
redemption of those justly subjected unto death, as one free among the dead:
for so he also teaches in what follows, 4. <i>That the righteousness of the law
might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit</i>.
For He has paid, says he, our debt, and fulfilled that which the law aimed at:
and what then was this? to render them righteous that had received that law. If
then the dispensation of Christ Jesus has brought to effect the intention of
the law, the law deserves not blame, but praise.</p>



<p>And having thus touched upon the subject of righteousness, he goes
on to an exhortation to it, and having said, <i>who walk not after the flesh,</i>
<i>but after the Spirit</i>, adds, 5. <i>For they that are after the flesh, do
mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit, the things of
the Spirit</i>; and in like manner in another place, (Gal. v. 25,) &quot;If we
live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit,&quot; meaning here by <i>the
Spirit</i>, the grace of the Spirit, and teaching that he who follows it, both
thinks and does the things agreeable thereto, and he that is enslaved to the
flesh, that is, to the passions of the body, has deprived himself of his
freedom. 6. <i>For the inclination of the flesh is death</i>. He says not the
flesh, but <i>the inclination of the flesh</i>, that is, the breaking forth of
the passions, for the recompense of sinners is death; <i>but the inclination of
the Spirit is life and peace</i>, for he who lives after the Spirit gains peace
with God; 7. <i>Because the inclination of the flesh is enmity against God</i>.
Again he condemns the <i>inclination</i> of the flesh, that is, the tyranny of
the passions which he declares are at variance with God. <i>For they are not
subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be</i>; for how is it possible
that he who has admitted the tyranny of the passions, should embrace the
service of God, while yet choosing to serve sin? 8. <i>So then they that are in
the flesh cannot please God</i>. He does not bid us go out of the body, but be
freed from the inclination of the flesh, as is shown by what follows: 9. <i>But
ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God
dwell in you</i>. For it is evident that they who received these his
instructions were not devoid of the body itself, but what he means is, that
they were conquerors over the fleshly passions, and enjoyed the grace of the
thrice-holy Spirit resident within them; and so in a similar sense does our
Lord say that His disciples are &quot;not of the world,&quot; (John xv. 19,)
not that they came from elsewhere, but that they were dead to the world. <A NAME="p671"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|671</SPAN></A> </p>



<p><i>Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His</i>. As
he had said <i>if so be that</i>, which implies an alternative, he aptly
subjoins that he who is wanting in this grace, has no fellowship with Christ
And as this was enough to warn and alarm them that received this Epistle, he
proceeds again to re-assure them, 10. <i>And if Christ be in you, the body
indeed is dead, with regard to sin, but the spirit is life, as regards
righteousness</i>. He makes clear what had been ambiguous, and shows that it
was not the mere flesh itself that he is condemning, but sin; for he bids the <i>body
be dead to sin</i>, that is not to commit sin; and the soul is what he here
speaks of as the <i>spirit</i>, in its having become already spiritual; here he
enjoins to follow after <i>righteousness</i>, whose <A NAME="p672"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|672</SPAN></A> exceedingly desirable fruit is life. 11. <i>But if the Spirit of Him
that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ from
the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in
you</i>. He invigorates them by hope of the future, and inspires them with
willing readiness, sufficient for present contests; for ere long, says be, your
bodies will be immortal, and superior to the passions that now molest them; and
this will He do, the same, the (rod of all, who now so liberally bestows on us
the earnest of the Spirit. And He has given us also a pledge of this
resurrection, in the resurrection of Christ. And he teaches by all this, the
unity of nature in the Godhead, for he calls the thrice-holy Spirit, the Spirit
of the <i>Father</i> and of the <i>Son</i>; not that, as the infamous heretics
say, He was created of the Father by the Son,<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> but that He is of one substance
with the Father and the Son, and proceeds from the Father,<A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> according to the
teaching of the gospels. His grace it is, that is extended by Christ to such as
are worthy. And he continues showing how we ought to triumph over the fleshly
passions.
12. <i>Therefore we are debtors, not to the flesh, to
live after the flesh</i>, for having received
salvation of Christ Jesus, and been made partakers of the grace of the Spirit,
to Him we owe the debt of service. 13. <i>For if ye live after the flesh ye
shall die; after the flesh</i>, that is, following the passions of the flesh:
the death he means is that which is eternal; <i>but if ye through the Spirit do
put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live</i>. This superiority has
(the covenant of) grace over (that of) the law, that the latter points out what
is right; the former has the grace of the Spirit in addition, as an helpmate.
And here indeed the holy apostle, foreseeing the corruptions of Marcion,<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
Valentine, and Manes, uses the greatest accuracy of expression in his
instructions, saying not, <i>put to death</i> the body, but <i>the deeds of the
body</i>, that is, the desires of the flesh, the burstings forth of the
passions, for ye have for an assistant the grace of the Spirit, and the fruit
of victory is life. 14. <i>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they
are the sons of God</i>, for they who live under the Spirit obtain the
privilege of adoption; and here he strikes at the Jews, teaching them not to
think too highly of themselves, forasmuch as that they also had been called
sons, for they are wanting in the glory of the thrice-holy Spirit, being aliens
from grace.</p>



<p>15. <i>For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to
fear, but ye have received the spirit of adoption</i>. Again, he compares (the
covenants of) grace and the law, and calls the institutions of the latter,
bondage, while at the same time showing that it was written by the grace of the
Spirit. Not, therefore, the thrice-holy Spirit itself does he here call <i>the
spirit of bondage</i>, but the imposition of the law as effected by that holy
Spirit; for had be by <i>the spirit of bondage</i> meant the thrice- holy
Spirit itself, then truly must there have been another Spirit, of adoption; but
not so is it, for the thrice-holy Spirit is One, while different and varying
are His gifts; &quot;for to one is given by the Spirit <A NAME="p673"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|673</SPAN></A> the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same
Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit and so forth. And having shown that
in truth we have received the privilege of adoption, he subjoins, <i>whereby
we cry, Abba, Father</i>. For when we offer up to the Lord the prayer of the
initiated,<A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A> we are bidden to address Him as our Father, and we say, &quot;Our
Father which art in heaven and he has added the word, Abba, to point out the
confidence wherewith we call upon Him, for so little children, using the
greater boldness towards their parents, in that they have not as yet a clear
knowledge of the difference between them and themselves, the oftener and
oftener go on lisping out the same word towards them; and so in like manner we,
by reason of His unspeakable kindness, and immeasurable goodness, call the
Maker of all <i>our Father</i>, as we are commanded, while yet we are
unconscious how great is the difference between Him and ourselves, not
understanding our own selves clearly, and of His nature being altogether
ignorant.<A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A>&nbsp; 16. <i>For the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that
we are the children of God</i>. By <i>the Spirit</i> he means the Holy Ghost
himself, by <i>our spirit</i>, the grace (or spirit of adoption) given to us,
for both are here expressed by the same common word, and what he means is, that
we put forth this prayer, (thus claiming sonship therein) as led by the
teaching of the Spirit, and in so doing then we cannot be blameworthy, in that
we do it according to the divine law. 17. <i>And if children, then heirs</i>.
Nor was it enough that we should have been freed from bondage and enjoyed the
grace of liberty, but moreover have we been blessed with the privilege of the
adoption; nay, and not only are we called sons, but <i>heirs</i> also of God,
and joint heirs with Christ, for so he subjoins, <i>heirs of God, and joint
heirs with Christ</i>. Since not every son becomes the heir of his father, well
has the holy apostle joined the heirship with the sonship; and since frequently
even a servant receives some portion from his master, and yet is not left an
equal partner with the child itself, it was necessary, in order to point out
the ineffable magnitude of the divine love, that he should subjoin, <i>joint
heirs with Christ,&#8212;if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also
glorified together</i>. For not all who have been blessed by baptism, which
places us in a state of salvation, will enjoy these good things, but they, who
in addition thereto, have undergone their share of suffering with their Saviour.<A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>&nbsp;
And this he subjoins not without a distinct object, but for the support of
those to whom his letters were addressed; for they were subjected to the
attacks of temptations of all sorts, being beaten, tortured, and <A NAME="p674"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|674</SPAN></A> imprisoned, and exposed to a thousand kinds of death; wherefore he
sends them comforting words, supporting them by the future, and exhorting them
to bear the present with fortitude. 18. <i>For I reckon that the sufferings of
this present time are not worthy to he compared with the glory which shall be
revealed in us</i>. The crowns exceed the contests; the reward cannot be put in
the same scale with the afflictions; small is the affliction, but vast the
looked for gain; wherefore he calls the things thus hoped for, not payment, but
<i>glory</i>. 19. <i>For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for
the manifestation of the sons of God</i>. Perceive ye not, says he, the heaven,
the earth, the sea, the air, the sun, the moon, the whole visible creation, and
besides these, such as are invisible&#8212;angels, archangels, powers, dominions,
principalities? all these are waiting for your full perfection. 20. <i>For the
creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of Him who
hath subjected the same in hope</i>. Corruption is what he here speaks of as
vanity, for so he teaches presently, &quot;because that the creature itself
also shall be delivered from the bondage of <i>corruption</i>.&quot; And he
declares that the whole visible creation had obtained a mortal nature, because
the Maker of all had foreseen Adam's transgression, and the sentence of death,
which would be passed on him. For neither was it fit nor right, that what was
created for him should possess an incorruption, and yet himself, for whose
sake all these were made, be mortal, and a prey to passions and sufferings;
but the rather, by the resurrection receiving immortality, they in like manner
inherit incorruption. Wherefore he says that the visible creation waits for
such a change of things, for it was made changeable not of its own accord, but
in submission to the decree of the Creator, and beholding the care exhibited in
our behalf has a hope of such change, that itself also, the creation, shall be
freed from the slavery of corruption; to which mutability of the universe the
holy David also witnesses, when, mentioning the heaven and the earth he adds,
(Ps. cii. 26,) &quot;they shall perish, but Thou remain.&quot; 21. <i>Because
the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption,
into the glorious liberty of the children of God</i>. For when these latter
appear such as now they are called, and in their immortality are manifested to
be the sons of God, the former also will obtain a total release from
corruption. And all this he says, not meaning that the visible creation really
was gifted with reason, but by a prosopopoeia, as was common with the prophets,
so that one represents the pines as groaning, and another the woods as rejoicing,
and the mountains leaping, and the rivers exulting.</p>



<p>22. <i>For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth
in pain together until now</i>. Here he includes the invisible creation also,
for <i>the whole creation</i>, says he. But for the clearer understanding of
the passage, I must bring to remembrance what the gospels state, for there the
Lord declared, (Luke xv. 10.) that &quot;even the angels in heaven rejoice over
one sinner that repenteth;&quot; if then they joy over penitent sinners, then
must they also of a truth be cast down on beholding our transgressions. 23. <i>And
not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first- fruits of the Spirit,
even we ourselves groan within ourselves</i>. And what wonder if creation is so
affected on our account? for even ourselves who have already received many
pledges of the future, and above all others <A NAME="p675"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|675</SPAN></A> the grace of the Spirit, groan in our longings after freedom; as
what follows shows that he means, <i>waiting for the adoption, to wit, the
redemption of our body</i>. He had said, indeed, that we have received the
spirit of adoption; but without infringement thereof, he here shows us more
precisely that now we have obtained the name, but then shall be made partakers
of the full reality, when our bodies shall have been released from corruption,
and have put on immortality; while by the word <i>first- fruits</i>, he points
out that in the future life, we shall receive a far larger measure of the grace
of the Spirit; since if what is now offered is called <i>first-fruits</i>, and
earnest, manifest is it that that shall far exceed it in greatness. 24. <i>For
we are saved by hope</i>, for not yet have we attained unto the resurrection,
but having received the promise are comforted by our hopes; <i>but hope that is
seen is not hope; for what a man seeth, how doth he yet hope for</i>? 25. <i>But
if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</i> Be
not cast down, says he, while looking on (present) distresses, for we have
brought you no false promises, in that we said you must yet awhile wait, ere
you should enjoy these good things, but good things thus expected are not seen
with the bodily eyes, since if seen they would cease to be expected, while if
expected, we should be content in confidence to wait for them, and never throw
away the anchor of hope. And he shows that in addition to all this, there is
also another source of help given, 26. <i>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our
infirmities</i>, we have a sufficient assistance in the grace of the Spirit, <i>for
we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit</i> <i>itself
maketh intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered</i>. Ask not,
says he, to be delivered from affliction, for ye know not what is profitable to
you, as does God your Governor. Resign yourselves into His hands, who holds the
helm of all things; for He, though you should ask nothing, but groan only as
moved by the Spirit dwelling in you, wisely orders every thing relating to you,
and will grant that which shall prove to your advantage; as he subjoins, 27. <i>For
He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because it
maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God</i>. By <i>the
Spirit</i> here he means not the Holy Ghost himself, but the grace given to the
faithful: for stirred up by this we pray the more earnestly, and with sighings
inexpressible by words implore God our Saviour. And this the holy apostle
writes from what himself had experienced, for he himself not once only or
twice, but even thrice, had besought release from his own trials, and
beseeching had failed of obtaining his prayer; for he heard in reply, (2 Con
xii. 8, 9,) &quot; My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made
perfect in weakness,&quot; and having learned this, he welcomed what he had
before sought to be delivered from, and says, &quot; most gladly therefore will
I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon
me.&quot; <A NAME="p734"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|734</SPAN></A> </p>



<p>28. <i>And we know that all things work together for good to them
that love God, to them who are called in accordance with </i>(<i>their own</i>)
<i>disposition</i>.<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> They <i>work</i> not together with all, but with those <i>that
love Him</i>, nor simply work with them, but work with them <i>for good</i>,
for if any ask for what would not be profitable to him, he fails of his
petition, because it is to his advantage not to gain it. And with the fittest
accuracy of expression does he join the <i>disposition</i> with the <i>call</i>,
for the call is not irrespective,<A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> but to those who possess this disposition;
wherefore He <A NAME="p735"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|735</SPAN></A> said to the apostle in Corinth, (Acts xviii. 9,10,) &quot;speak
and hold not thy peace, for I have much people in this city and forbade him to
preach the word in Mysia (ch. xvi. 6, 7); and as to Asia, at first restrained,
and afterwards commanded him to do it; wherefore he also said to him in
Jerusalem, (ch. xxii. 18,) &quot;make haste and get thee quickly out of
Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony;&quot; and wherefore he
here also says, <i>to those that are called in accordance with </i>(<i>their
own</i>)<i> disposition</i>, agreeably to what follows. 39. <i>For whom He had
foreknown, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son,
that He might be the first-born among many brethren</i>; for He did not
irrespectively<A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A> predestine, but predestined in his foreknowledge of them. And
speaking with the strictest accuracy of expression, he says not <i>conformed</i>
to His Son, but <i>to the image of His Son</i>; and this he has even more
plainly put in the Epistle to the Philippians (ch. iii. 20), where, having said
that &quot;our citizenship is in heaven, from whence also we look for the
Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ,&quot; he adds, &quot;Who shall change our vile
body, that it may be conformed to His glorious body.&quot; For our body will
not be made to resemble His divinity, but His glorified body,&#8212;and so here also
he calls those who now obtained the privilege<A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A> of the call conformed to <i>the
image</i> of His Son, that is, to the body of His Son; for the divine nature
being invisible, and the body visible, by the body as an <i>image</i> (or
shadow) is He adored; <i>that He might be the first-born among many brethren</i>;
and this the truth of the doctrine testifies, for it is as man that He is
called the first-born, as God being the Only-begotten, seeing that as God He
has not brethren, but as man designates as brethren them which believe. Of
these He is the firstborn, being yet no other than the Only-begotten; but He,
the same, both Only-begotten and firstborn. 30. <i>Moreover whom He did
predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified;
and whom He justified, them He also glorified</i>. Those whose (suitable) disposition
he had foreknown, those in the beginning He predestinated; and predestinating,
also called; and calling, justified by baptism; and justifying, glorified by
designating them sons, and endowing them with the grace of the Holy Spirit. But
let no one say that such foreknowledge is the cause of these things; for
foreknowledge made them not <A NAME="p736"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|736</SPAN></A> such as they are, but God as God, foresaw from of old all that
would be. For so neither if seeing a violent horse seizing the bit in its
teeth, and not heeding its rider, I should predict that nearing a precipice it
would fall over it, and the event were to happen as I said, should I have cast
the horse down that precipice, but merely have foretold what was itself about
to take place, while using the evidence of the fierceness of the horse himself
as my guide. But (and so likewise) the God of all, from of old knows all things
as God, not that He imposes on any one a necessity for his establishment in
virtue, or on another for his performance of vice; for if He exercised force
towards either, He could not with justice praise and reward the former, or
adjudge punishment to the latter. If then God be just, as indeed He is just, He
exhorts indeed to what is right, and denounces its opposite; He approves the
doers of good, and avenges Himself on those who from their own will embrace
wickedness.&nbsp; 31. <i>What shall we then say to these things? If God he for us,
who can be against us</i>? Having God as our ally, shall we be afraid of men?
He comprehends all things at once under the word <i>who</i>; whether kings, or
generals, or people, or their leaders; the whole world at once. And then he
brings forward the crowning blessing of blessings. 32. <i>He that spared not
His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also
freely give us all things</i>? He has given us the greater, and shall He not
give also the less? His own Son has He bestowed, and will He deprive us of
what we have gained? But here we must remember, that the Person of the Son is
(but) one; for the human nature was delivered up in our behalf by the divinity;
for (so) &quot;the bread,&quot; says He, (John vi. 31,) &quot;that I will give
is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world;&quot; and (ch. x.
18,) &quot;I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it again.&quot;
33. <i>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that
justifieth. </i>34. <i>Who is he (then) that condemneth</i>?<A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A> Having said that
while God helps, who can injure us? he adds, that God, having rendered us justified,
who can condemn? <i>Christ it is that died, yea rather that is risen again, who
is ever at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us</i>. What
more than all this seek ye? in our behalf the Lord Christ died, and having
risen again sits by the Father; nor even thus has He ceased His care for us,
but pointing to the first-fruits which He took from us,<A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A> and showing its
immaculate purity to the Father, by it He asks for salvation to ourselves. And
this indeed he says as regards the humanity, for as God He asks not, but
(Himself) grants. Nay, and even if the heretics should declare, that so the Son
does as regards His divinity, neither so could they prove His glory to be the
less. For let us suppose two kings to be equal in honour, and to have the same
authority, and when some deputy or general has offended against both, the one
of these having earliest received the prayer of the culprit to beg of the
partner of his kingdom to admit him to reconciliation, does this at all
diminish the dignity, of him that makes this request? By no means. But in the present
case we cannot grant even so much as this, <A NAME="p737"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|737</SPAN></A> for whatsoever seems good to the Son, pleases the Father also, and
the will of both is the same. The passage therefore is figuratively expressed
by the apostle, through his desire to set forth the greatness of (Christ's)
zeal and watchfulness for us. 35. <i>Who shall separate us from the love of
Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
nakedness, or peril, or the sword</i>? 36. <i>As it is written</i> (Ps. xliv.
22,) <i>For Thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep
for the slaughter</i>. The witness adduced is exactly correspondent to the
subject in hand, for it was spoken in the persons of those who had the same
object,<A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A> for the thrice-holy Spirit wrote this psalm by the inspired David,
concerning the admirable Maccabees. 37. <i>Nay, in all these things we are more
than conquerors through Him that loved us</i>. Opposing the love which God
bears us to all these things, we rise superior to afflictions; for we reckon
that it were most absurd for our Lord Christ to have undergone death for
sinners, and yet ourselves not most readily to embrace martyrdom for Him. 38. <i>For
I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come</i>, 39. <i>Nor height, nor
depth, nor any other such creation, could be able to separate us from the love
of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord</i>. Having weighed the whole
creation at once against the love of God, and added to such as are visible,
such as are perceptible only by the mind&#8212;angels, and powers, and dominions; and
to the present, hoped for, blessings; as well as threatened punishments also;
for by <i>depth</i>, as I apprehend, he signifies hell, and by <i>height</i>
the kingdom (of heaven); and moreover everlasting life and eternal death; and
seeing that even then this scale is lightest in the reckoning, he seeks for
somewhat else to be cast in; and finding nothing, he frames into his account
another such and as varied an universe; and neither so does he find all these
together fit to be weighed against the love of God. For it behoves us, says he,
not to love Him on account of His promises of blessings, but to desire them on
His. For (so) neither if a man be sincerely well affected towards one who is
rich, does he love him for the abundance of his wealth; but from his very
affection towards him, loves also the possessions belonging to him; and in like
manner the holy apostle declares, I would not choose to inherit the kingdom of
heaven, and all visible and invisible creation, and as many such again twice or
thrice multiplied, apart from the love of God; but rather were any one to lay
before me present and future distresses, present and eternal death, and the
most protracted punishment in hell, together with the love of Him, readily and
welcomely would I choose these in preference to the former splendid and
glorious and unspeakable objects, devoid of love to Him. Which therefore that
ourselves may also possess, let us both pray and strive, so that following in the
footsteps of the apostles, we may be made sharers thereby in the (eternal)
habitations of the apostles, through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus
Christ; with whom, to the Father, together with the thrice-holy Spirit, belong
glory and majesty, now and ever, unto endless ages. Amen. <A NAME="p738"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|738</SPAN></A> </p>
<h2 align=center>Book IV.</h2>



<p>That the incarnation of our God and Saviour both was necessary,
and was productive of unspeakable blessings to believers, the holy apostle has
clearly shown. For he has proved the Jews to be obnoxious to the greater
condemnation by reason of the imposition of the law, and all others to be
transgressors of the law of nature; and having set forth the threat of
punishment, he has subjoined the gifts of the grace in the gospel (covenant),
and pointed out the salvation offered through faith; while, at the same time,
lest the Jews should be offended, imagining the law censured; or the heretics,
hostile to the ancient covenant, gain an opportunity of accusation against the
law by the comparison thus instituted, he has necessarily exhibited the
usefulness of the law, and honoured it with many praises. And as, again, the
Jews, bringing forward the patriarch Abraham, and the promises made by God to
him, endeavoured to prove that the preaching of the apostles, being extended to
the Gentiles beyond the divine promise, was contrary to these, he is constrained
to treat of these objections also; and most wisely does he answer them, by
adducing scripture testimonies, and ancient examples, applicable to the case,
and demonstrating plainly the truth of the divine promises. Being about then to
denounce the infidelity of the Jews, he first displays the love he bore them,
and says,</p>



<h3 align=center>Chapter <SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C9"></A>IX.</SPAN>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>1. <i>I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also
bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost</i>. He proves that what he was about to
say should be free from all falsehood, and dignified with perfect truth, for be
calls the grace of the Holy Spirit to witness with his conscience; in every way
persuading them not to disbelieve his account. 2. <i>That I have great
heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart</i>. The composition of the sentence
is incomplete, for it should have been added that the continual sorrow was
caused by the rejection, or infidelity of the Jews; but through caution he
omits these distinct words, and is content to teach in the sequel that he so
meant. For thus he speaks: 3. <i>For I could pray to be myself anathema from
Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh</i>. The word <i>anathema</i><A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
has two significations, for that which is consecrated to God is called an
anathema, and that which is separated from Him has the same name, and this
second meaning the holy apostle has taught us in the Epistle to the
Corinthians (1 Cor. xvi. 22), &quot;If any man love not our Lord Jesus Christ,
let him be anathema&quot;&#8212;the first being explained even by common custom, for
so we designate whatever is offered to God an anathema&#8212;and the God of all
things Himself, in commanding the town of Jericho to be made an anathema
(Joshua vi. 17). Here then the blessed apostle uses it in its second meaning,
to manifest the feelings he entertained towards his brother Jews, and he says
not I could desire, but I could <i>pray</i> to be separated from Christ,
provided that they who are my kindred in the flesh, being united to Him, should
reap salvation; and most aptly does he introduce the&nbsp; &quot;even I <i>myself</i>&quot;
&nbsp;&nbsp;recalling to their recollection what he <A NAME="p739"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|739</SPAN></A> had just before stated of his love to Christ, and as it were
saying, that I, whom &quot;neither life, nor death, nor things present, nor
things to come, nor any other such creation, could separate from the love of
God which is in Christ Jesus,&quot; would gladly be alienated from Him, for the
sake of the salvation of the Jews. But it is evident that he speaks not this as
preferring them to the Saviour, but as indicating his love and anxiety for
them, being most desirous that all should submit themselves, and joyfully
receive the saving gospel. And to persuade them of the truth of what he says,
he points out both their former high descent and eminence, and the riches of
the divine gifts conferred on them, and says, 4. <i>Who are Israelites?</i> For
most celebrated was this name, imposed by God Himself on their forefather,
(Gen. xxxv. 10) and transmitted as an heirloom to his descendants; <i>To whom
pertaineth the adoption</i>. And this name also they had obtained, for
&quot;Israel,&quot; says he, &quot;is My son, my firstborn&quot; (Exod iv. 22);
<i>And the glory</i>, for they had been illustrious through miracles; <i>And
the covenants</i>, not the old only, but the new also had He promised to bestow
on them, &quot;for I will make,&quot; says He, &quot;a new covenant with the
house of Israel, not according to the covenant I made with their fathers&quot;
(Jer. xxxi. 31, 32), but this they themselves were not willing to accept; <i>And
the giving of the law</i>, for to them had He given the Mosaic law; <i>And the
service of God</i>, for, honouring them above other nations, to them He had
taught the ritual ministrations of the law; <i>And the promises,</i> both those
made by God to their fathers and those promulged by the prophets.<i>&nbsp;</i></p>

that, when Adam had transgressed the commandment, the race should follow the
progenitor?</p>

transgression, they committed nevertheless other sins, and on that account have
been made sharers in the death.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Ortho</i>. But then, not sinners only, but the just also,
and patriarchs, and prophets, and apostles, and such as signalized themselves
by various kinds of virtue, have fallen under the bondage of death !</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Eran</i>. For how was it possible, that they should
remain immortal, who sprang from mortal parents? For it was after his sin, and
the divine sentence, when he was under the power of death, that Adam knew his
wife, and became a father. Having become then, himself; mortal, it was of
mortals that he was the parent; justly then do all follow their progenitor in
having received a mortal nature.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Ortho</i>. Excellently well have you pointed out the
cause of our sharing in the death; and the same must you grant of the
resurrection; for the remedy must be suitable to the disease; for as, the
founder of the race having been condemned, the whole race itself became
condemned also, so, the Saviour having broken the curse, the race thus enjoyed
freedom. And as, Adam having descended to Hades, all who partook of his nature
followed him, so, Christ the Lord having risen, the whole race of man shall share in that resurrection .... Behold then the case of
Christ, compared with that of Adam, the remedy with the disease, the antidote
with the wound, the riches of righteousness with sin, the blessing with the
curse, remission with condemnation, the observance with the transgression, life
with death, the Kingdom with Hades, Christ with Adam, Man with man.&quot;

here with the <span class="Greek">&#x1F01;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03C4;&#x03C9;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x1F76; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F71;&#x03B8;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span> 
of v. 19, the <span class="Greek">&#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x1F73;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> of v. 15, the
&quot;condemned&quot; above, and with 3 Kings i. 21. 2 Kings xii. 13. LXX.; and
Matt. ix. 2, 6, sin for its punishment. &quot;How then did death enter in and
reign? By the sin of one. And what means the 'in that all have sinned?' He
having fallen, all, though they ate not of the tree, in him became
mortal.&quot;&#8212;Chrysostom. Hom.&nbsp; <i>in loco</i>.</p>

<p>By comparison of these passages, as well as of what is said in v.
21 respecting sin and excess, the general view of our author would seem to be,
&quot;As on the one hand, by the entrance through Adam of sin bringing death in
its train, and as its consequence, all men became subject to both these evils;
though some in a greater and some in a lesser degree to the former, which
indeed act and react on one another, so that not only by the primary fall have
we become heirs of mortality, but through our own individual sins justify that
sentence; even so, on the other, by our Lord have all been gifted with a
renewed power and spirit of righteousness, and life hereafter, though all do
not duly or equally take advantage thereof.&quot;&#8212;E. B.</p>





<p><A NAME="17"></A>17.&nbsp;* Namely, as it would seem, &quot;if then we need the incarnation
of Christ for our justification, of what use was the law, was it not given for
that very purpose? Nay, it has its uses indeed, in affording instruction; but
the end therefrom resulting was, that your sins, as committed against it, were
the greater and more numerous.&quot; </p>

the exposition of this verse. &quot;The expression, 'The God of our Lord Jesus
Christ,' he has here used with a distinction, calling Him on the one hand the
God, and on the other, the Father of the same Saviour; His God as regards His
manhood, His Father as regards His godhead; for it is His divine nature that He
here speaks of as glory. And thus also in the Epistle to the Hebrews (i. 3,)
who having the brightness of His glory ..... that is, of His divine nature. And
thus also the holy Ezekiel (i. 26) says, &quot; This was the likeness of the
glory of the Lord.' For since it is altogether impossible for men to know the
divine nature, they represent it as glory, giving that name thereto, from the
worship and glory due to it.&quot;</p>

boldly call them habitually by that name, even so we, as unacquainted with our
Heavenly Parent, address Him. The whole explanation is, however, differently
given in another MS. of our author's. &quot;It belongs to little children to
call their parents by this same word, Abba, and they who had been blessed with
the adoption of sons in baptism, were little children in this present life,
waiting for the more complete and true sonship in the world to come; wherefore
he subjoins, Abba, Father, both as pointing out the expected perfection, and as
indicating their present state, in which, like infants, they had not yet
received their full enjoyment of all good things.&quot;&#8212;E. B.</p>

verse, literally, ''has comprehended.&quot; 34. Literally, &quot;having
said&quot; . . . &quot;he has added,&quot; &amp;c.; the advantage, and almost
necessity, of which alteration, will be seen plainly in those passages, where,
