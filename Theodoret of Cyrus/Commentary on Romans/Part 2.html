<A NAME="p30"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|30</SPAN></A><p>5. Whose are the fathers, the renowned, the celebrated, of whom
God was called the God (Exod. iii. 15); and then in the last place he adduces
the greatest of the blessings, <i>And of whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ
came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</i> And, indeed, the
addition of the <i>concerning the flesh</i> had been enough to evidence the
divinity of the Lord Christ, yet, as in the opening of the epistle having said,
&quot;who was of the seed of David according to the flesh,&quot; he subjoined,
&quot;and was declared to be the Son of God with power,&quot; so here also
after the <i>concerning the flesh</i>, he adds, <i>who is over all, God blessed
for ever</i>; both exhibiting thereby the difference of the natures, and
teaching how just reason he had for his lamentation, since while of them
according to the flesh was He who was God over all, they had fallen from their
height, and become aliens from that relationship. And herein he imitates the
female mourners, who introduce into their funeral songs the beauty of the
person, and the flower of the age, and the illustriousness of the ancestry,
and the wealth, and the power, of the deceased over whom they lament. Having
then thus displayed the love he bore the <A NAME="p31"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|31</SPAN></A> Jews, he then begins his proposed design; 6. <i>Not as though the
word of God hath taken none effect</i>. I indeed, says he, not only could
desire, but could also even pray, to he separated from Christ, if it were possible
that by this separation of mine the Jews should gain the blessings held out,
but nevertheless should they still prove gainsayers, and refuse to receive
salvation, the promises made to the fathers would still remain true. How then? <i>For
they are not all Israel, which are of Israel.</i> For God seeks not the
relationship of nature, but of virtue; and then he teaches this yet more
plainly; 7. <i>Neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all
children</i>, that is of God, as he shows just below, &#8212;<i>But in Isaac shall
thy seed be called</i>; and having thus stated the promise of God, he now
explains it, and renders the saying clear by his exposition thereof. 8. <i>That
is, not they which are the children of the flesh are the children of God, but
the children of the promise are counted for the seed. </i>By <i>the children of
the flesh</i>, he means those that were horn after the ordinary course of
nature, but of the promise, those that were given by grace. 9. For this is the
word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son. For
nature having failed, he was constituted a father by the divine bounty; and
this shows that Ishmael also was a son to Abraham&#8212;aye, and his firstborn son;
and wherefore then boastest thou, O Jew, of being alone called the seed of
Abraham? But if thou dost imagine that he was rejected from the relationship,
as being on one side a bondsman, then thinkest thou not rightly, for Scripture
is wont to calculate descent not from the mother's, but the father's side. And
so the holy Apostle might have brought forward the children sprung from
Keturah, and shown that they also, though born of a free woman, yet were not
reckoned as the seed of Abraham; and easy had it been for him to have pointed
out the twelve sons of Jacob, born of different mothers, four of them being
bondsmen on one side, and yet all called Israel, and receiving no injury from
the slavery of their mothers; but contenting himself with fewer instances, all
this he has omitted, and beats them down by the ample evidence left. For having
mentioned that which had been said by God to Abraham, that <i>in Isaac shall
thy seed be called</i>, he shows that neither were the whole of his race
partakers of this blessing, seeing that of his own sons the one inherited the
privilege, and the other failed of it; for so he subjoins, 10. <i>And not only
this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac</i>:
11. <i>For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good, or
evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works,
but of Him that calleth</i>, 12. <i>It was said unto her, that the elder shall
serve the younger.</i> If thou thinkest, says he, that, on account of (his
birth from) Sarah, Isaac was preferred before Ishmael, and Abraham's other
children whom he had by Keturah, what wilt thou say to the case of Rebecca?
For here were there the same father and the same mother, and the same one single
conception, the children being twins; for this is what he means by <i>having
conceived by one</i>, that is conceived both at the same time; but the one
nevertheless was beloved of God, and the other unworthy the divine regard; and
God waited not for the evidence of events, but while yet they were in the womb
predicted the difference between them; and He predicted it from foreknowing
their dispositions, for election is not <A NAME="p32"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|32</SPAN></A> arbitrary, but in accordance to the disposition of men;<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> and then
he adduces the testimony of the prophet, (Mal. i. 3,) 13. <i>As it is written,
Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated</i>. He heeds not, therefore, the
(bare descent of) nature, but virtue only is it that He requires; for this he
confirms by many instances. </p>



<p>14.
<i>What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness
with God? God forbid</i>. The divine decision,
says he, has nothing unjust in it, but is graced with perfect equity. And this
indeed, though having it in his power to point out and teach clearly, that it
is not the custom with God to pay attention to bare birth, but that He looks
for the best disposition, as well as to remind them that oftentimes they had
been delivered up to many enemies, without being at all spared for the sake of
their forefathers, seeing that they imitated not their virtue; and that the
whole nation had been allowed to be taken captive by the Babylonians, while
Abimelech, on the other hand, though a slave and an Ethiopian, had been saved
through his piety;<A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> he yet refrains from so doing, as not wishing too much to
cast them down; but shows instead that the divine dispensations exceed the
reckonings of man, and while many commit iniquity, yet not all are made to
suffer vengeance for it; for so in the wilderness the greater part worshipped,
for God, the image of the calf, yet not of all was punishment exacted, but some
being made to suffer, others by those sufferings of their's were reformed; and
so in avenging himself on Pharaoh, He brought by him great benefit to many; and
these instances, accordingly, the holy Apostle places before them; and thus he
speaks, 15. <i>For he saith to Moses,</i> (Exod. xxxiii. 10,) <i>I will have
mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have
compassion</i>. These words God spake concerning the making of the calf. And it
was necessary that he should mention Moses's name here, in order to show the
trustworthiness of what he was alleging, by the testimony of Him who spoke, and
him who heard; and then he draws the conclusion, 16. <i>So then it is not of
him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy</i>.
And he brings not yet the resolution of all this, but continues still the whole
question by the addition of what follows, 17. <i>For the Scripture saith unto
Pharaoh</i>, (Exod. ix. 10,) <i>Even for this same purpose have I raised thee
up, that I might show My power in thee, and that My name might be declared
throughout all the earth</i>. And then again he adds as a deduction, 18. <i>Therefore
hath he mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth</i>.
Unquestionable, says he, are these scriptures, for what I advance is collected
from thence, and from thence only. Thou hast heard God Himself declaring,
&quot;I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion
on whom I will have compassion,&quot; and His again are the things spoken
concerning Pharaoh. He, passing by Ishmael and the children by Keturah, chose
Isaac; and He again preferred Jacob to Esau, although both received their being <A NAME="p33"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|33</SPAN></A> at the same time, in the same womb; why wonderest thou then, if he
hath exactly so done now also, and received those among you who have believed,
and rejected those that will not admit that light? But this indeed he does not
yet lay down, but continues still adding to the difficulties of the subject,
and says, 19. <i>Thou wilt say then unto me, why doth he yet find fault? for
who hath resisted his will?</i> For, if &quot;He hath mercy on whom He will,
and whom He will hardeneth,&quot; man's disposition must depend on His will
(say you): and, if so, He cannot with justice inflict punishment on the
offenders, for it is not possible for any to resist whatever he thinks fit.
Having thus increased the difficulties of the subject by the variety of doubts,
and proposed all the objections arising from it, he subjoins, 20. <i>Nay but, O
man, who art thou, that repliest against God?</i> Since thou hast asked, says
he, &quot;who has resisted His will,&quot; tell me <i>what thou art</i>; art
thou not <i>a man</i>? How then dost thou <i>reply against</i>, and
over-curiously inquirest into the divine dispensations? for if thou wert not a
free agent, nor couldest choose by thine own free will what thou wouldest do,
but wert enslaved to the compulsion of the divine will, thou wouldest, like
the inanimate creation, have been silent, and acquiesced in His dispensations;
but since thou art dignified by reason, (therefore it is that) thou both sayest
and doest what thou thyself pleasest, and lovest not what has been done, but inquirest
into the causes of the divine dispensations. <i>Shall the thing formed say to
him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?</i> 21. <i>Hath not the potter
power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and
another unto dishonour?</i> Look at the clay of the potter, which is devoid of
rational discrimination; it answers not against its maker, but although set
apart for the structure of some <i>base vessel</i>, it receives in silence what
is done; but thou opposest and findest fault; therefore art thou not bound by
physical necessity, nor transgressest against thine own inclination, but
voluntarily embracest vice, and of thine own free choice undergoest the
difficulties of virtue. Right, therefore, and just is the sentence of the God
of all things, since with equity does he punish sinners as daring so to act of
their own will. And in justice also is His loving-kindness, in that when He
receives from us an opportunity, He extends His mercy to us. Some, however,
interpret the <i>Nay, but O man, who art thou that repliest against God?</i> as
spoken in rebuke; for so, say they, having first chidden those who are impertinently
curious about divine matters, and shown their meanness, for <i>man's</i> nature
differs not from the <i>clay</i>, does he proceed to the reply; and the reply
is this&#8212;22. <i>What then if?</i> Here we must place a stop, for he means, if
thou art desirous to know this, namely, why, when the majority sin, some of
them He punishes, and some through their means He benefits; and when many
pursue virtue, some of them He renders illustrious, and to some by them sets
forth the hopes of the future; hear what follows: <i>God willing to show His
wrath, and to make His power known, endured with much long-suffering the
vessels of wrath fitted to destruction, </i>23. <i>And that He might make known
the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared
unto glory; </i>24.
<i>Even us whom He hath called, not of the Jews only,
but also of the Gentiles.</i> God, says he,
was not the author of Pharaoh's wickedness, but exercised long-suffering
towards him as He is wont, but he conceived <A NAME="p34"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|34</SPAN></A> that long-suffering weakness, and through it increased his own
obstinacy; while at the same time the Governor of all things, in His wisdom
both justly inflicted punishment on him, and from his very wickedness drew a
preventive medicine to the rest. And thus, as physicians do not themselves make
vipers, but from them prepare drugs profitable to men, so God preferred that
Pharaoh should not suffer punishment, but, inasmuch as he had fallen into so
great brutishness, brought on him retributions of every kind, and manifested at
the same time His own power to all men; wherefore He says, &quot;even for this
same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show My power in thee, and
that My name might be declared throughout all the earth the <i>I have raised
thee up</i> meaning, I have permitted thee to obtain the throne, and while able
to prevent, prevented thee not, foreseeing the advantage that would thence
arise to others. And those whom he calls <i>vessels of wrath fitted to
destruction</i>, are they, who, by their own free will, have become so, for the
same thing also has he written to Timothy, (2 Tim. ii. 20) &quot;But in a great
house there are not only vessels of gold, and of silver, but also of wood, and
of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour;&quot; and, teaching how
every one becomes the one or the other of his own free will, he subjoined,
&quot;if a man, therefore, purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto
honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good
work;&quot; and to the Corinthians, in like manner, he writes (1 Cor. iii.
12), &quot;Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious
stones, wood, hay, stubble,&quot; &#8212;clearly teaching the free agency of man. So
here does he call those who are worthy of the divine loving-kindness, <i>vessels
of mercy</i>. And the <i>hath before prepared unto glory</i> displays the
divine foreknowledge, for so had he also said before, &quot;for whom He had
foreknown He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His
Son;&quot; for the object of the apostle is to prove, that the God of all
things alone knows who are worthy of salvation, while among men not a soul. And
having stated that <i>He hath called us not of the Jews only, but also of the
Gentiles</i>, he confirms the representation by the testimony of scripture, and
says, 25. <i>As he saith also in Osee</i> (ch. ii. 23, and i. 10), <i>I will
call them My people, which were not My people, and her beloved, which was not
beloved.</i> 26. <i>And it shall come to pass that in the place where it was
said unto them, ye are not My people; there shall they be called the children
of the living God</i>. And this God spake not of the Gentiles, but of the Jews
themselves; for having commanded Hosea to marry an harlot, and indeed even an
adulteress, thus did He order the children born from her to be called, the one <i>not
a people</i> (Loammi), and the other <i>not beloved</i> (Loruhamah) (ch. i. 9,
6), foretelling what should happen to the Jews; while at the same time He
promised them good things again, that the <i>not people should be called a
people</i>, and the <i>not beloved, beloved</i>. Observe therefore, says he,
that even you have not always enjoyed the same things, but at one time have
been reckoned <i>a people</i>, and then <i>not a people</i>, and then <i>a
people</i> again; and at one time <i>beloved</i>, and then <i>not beloved</i>,
and then <i>beloved</i> again. Nothing then improbable has taken place at
present, for you have been cast off in due consistency with all this; but and
so if yet you again will it, you shall be reckoned <i>a people</i>, <i>and
beloved</i>; for so also the Gentiles who were not a people, now are <A NAME="p35"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|35</SPAN></A> reckoned a people. And he adduces another witness also to this
account:
27. <i>Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though
the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant
(only) shall be saved.</i> 28. <i>For a short
word will the Lord make upon the earth</i> (ch. x. 22, 23). Most opportunely
has he brought forward this evidence, to show that, of old, the God of all
foresaw both those who had attached themselves to the faith, and those who had
sunk beneath the disease of infidelity. For as the Jews alleged that but few of
them had accepted the gospel, and all the rest had turned away from it as a
deception, he proves that all this had long ago been predicted, and that
although they should exceed the power of numbers in multitude, and equal the
sand of the sea, not all, but such (only) as were furnished with faith, should
obtain salvation. For faith is what he calls the <i>short word</i>, because
what the law taught in many commandments, while yet unable to afford complete
salvation, that confession in Christ has accomplished, while engendering faith.
And this is <i>short</i>, and needs not multiplied periods, being evidenced by
the disposition of the heart,<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> and published by the tongue. 29. <i>And as
Esaias had said before</i> (ch. i. 9), <i>Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left
us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrah</i>. Those
whom above he spoke of as a &quot;remnant,&quot; the same he here calls <i>a
seed</i>, through whom the prophet declares that the Jews suffered not the fate
of Sodom and Gomorrah, for they had undergone a total destruction. Having thus
taught that the God of all things looks not to the mere relationship of birth,
but seeks for a community of faith, he shows yet more clearly by what means
the Jews had fallen from their ancestral excellence, and the Gentiles on the
other hand had obtained salvation. 30. <i>What shall we say then?</i> We must
read this interrogatively, putting a stop here: and then what follows as the
answer. <i>That the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness, have
attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith</i>. 31. <i>But
Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained unto
the law of righteousness</i>. Know, says he, that faith is the cause of these
blessings to the Gentiles, for it has rendered them meet to receive the
righteousness which is of grace, them who formerly wandered about in error, and
neither possessed, nor even wished to seek after, righteousness; while Israel,
on the other hand, although possessing the law, and following after the
righteousness which is of the law, hath failed of the mark, and not obtained
righteousness. And then, again, interrogatively, 32. <i>Wherefore?</i> the
reason of this, says he, do you desire to know? <i>Because they sought it not
by faith, but as it were by the works of the law.</i> They imagined that the
living under the law was sufficient to secure righteousness to them, and they
despised faith; wherefore they neither obtained the gifts of faith, nor gained
the righteousness arising from living under its covenant. And then he teaches
through what cause they enjoyed not the blessings of faith; <i>For they
stumbled at that stumbling-stone.</i> 33. <i>As it is written</i> (Isa. viii.
28), <i>Behold I lay in Sion a stumbling-stone and rock of offence; and
whosoever believeth on Him shall not be ashamed</i>. They are wont to stumble
who turn their attention elsewhere, and do not choose to look at their path.
This had been <A NAME="p36"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|36</SPAN></A> the case with the Jews. For, being intent on the veriest minutiae<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
of the law, they chose not to see the <i>stone</i> foretold by the prophets,
although they had distinctly predicted, that <i>whosoever trusted in Him</i>
should obtain the greatest blessings; for this is what he means by <i>shall not
be ashamed</i>, such as hope, and then fail in their expectations being
ashamed. Having thus gently touched them, again he exhibits the feelings he
entertained towards them, lost his arguments should assume the appearance of
arising from hostility, for he has kept the heavier censures for the last. <A NAME="p151"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|151</SPAN></A> </p>
<h3 align=center>Chapter <SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C10"></A>X.</SPAN>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>1. <i>Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is,
that they might he saved.</i> An ardent wish is what he here calls a desire,
for I ardently wish, says he, and <i>pray, that they may obtain salvation</i>. 2. <i>For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but
not according to knowledge</i>. He mingles
his censure with praise, hiding as it were the hook beneath a bait, that the
benefit of what he says might be <A NAME="p152"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|152</SPAN></A> accepted by them. 3. <i>For they being ignorant of God's
righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not
submitted themselves to the righteousness of God</i>. Their unreasonable
adherence to the law is what he here calls <i>their own righteousness</i>, for
they are zealous still to observe it, though it has now come to an end; and
that which is of grace, through faith, what he speaks of as <i>the
righteousness of God</i>; for so he goes on to say, 4. <i>For Christ is the end
of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth</i>. For faith in the
Lord is not contrary to the law, but most agreeable therewith, seeing that the
law itself has directed us to the Lord Christ. he, then, that trusts in Christ,
fulfils the intention of the law. And well again does he say, <i>to every one
that believeth</i>, for the whole race of mankind has been comprehended, so
that whether it be Greek or barbarian, if he believe, he shall obtain
salvation. And then he again sets forth the difference between the law and
grace, and introduces Moses the lawgiver, as the teacher of both; 5. <i>For
Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which
doeth those things shall live by them</i>. Whosoever has observed all things
enjoined by the law, has life as the reward of such obedience, but any one
transgression entails punishment.</p>



<p>6. <i>But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this
wise</i>; (Deut. xxx. 12,) that is, but concerning the righteousness which is
of faith, not Moses himself, but the God of all, through Moses, speaks thus, <i>Say
not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down
from above;</i> 7. <i>Or who shall descend into the deep? that is, to bring up
Christ again from the dead.</i> 8. <i>But what saith it? The word is nigh thee,
even in thy mouth and in thy heart.</i> These things the God of all spake
indeed concerning the law, teaching the Jews, that without labour on their own
part they had received the knowledge of what they ought to do, and needed
neither an ascent into heaven, nor a descent into Hades. <i>The word is nigh
thee</i>, for the knowledge of what thou shouldest do has been given unto thee;
but the holy apostle has transferred them to this account of faith, teaching
us that we should not over- curiously inquire into the dispensation in Christ
Jesus, or question that the only-begotten Son of God did become incarnate, and
having endured the passion, brought in the resurrection; but by faith reap the
salvation (offered). <i>For the word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy
heart;</i> and then he adds, <i>that is, the word of faith, which we preach</i>.
What Moses once said of the injunctions of the law, that we now say of faith:
9. <i>That if thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be
saved.</i> 10. <i>For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with
the mouth confession is made unto salvation</i>. For both are necessary, a
sound and firm faith, and a confession uttered with boldness; that both the
heart may be adorned with a certain persuasion of faith, and the tongue
dignified with a fearless proclamation of the truth. And then again he adduces
the testimony of Scripture. 11. <i>For the Scripture saith,</i> (Isa. xxviii.
10,) <i>Whosoever believeth on Him shall not be ashamed: and he explains the
whosoever,</i> 12. <i>For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek;
for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him.</i> 13. <i>For</i>
(Joel iii. 5,) <i>whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
saved.</i> The salvation of men is what he here <A NAME="p153"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|153</SPAN></A> calls <i>the riches of God</i>, for he well knew the
loving-kindness of the Lord; and most aptly does he suit his testimonies to the
heart, and to the tongue; to <i>the heart</i>, the <i>whosoever believeth on
Him shall not he ashamed</i>; to <i>the tongue</i>, the <i>whosoever shall call
upon the name of the Lord shall be saved</i>. And then he shows that the Jews
had voluntarily deprived themselves of salvation, by not choosing to receive
the gospel offered, while yet he puts not forth this proof nakedly, but brings
about the argument in a different way. 14. <i>How then shall they call on Him
in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in Him of whom they
have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</i> 15. <i>And how shall they preach, except they be sent?</i> First, says he, must a person <i>believe</i>, and then <i>call</i>
upon God; but it is impossible for any one <i>to believe</i> who <i>has not</i>
enjoyed instruction, and this no one can obtain without there being <i>teachers</i>,
and these again <i>commission constitutes</i>. Having laid down these
positions as it were in vindication of the Jews, by them he increases the blame
lying on them. And that which is first, (in order of time) namely, the <i>sending
forth of preachers</i>, he puts last, as being about to show, that of old all
this had been foretold; for it would have been in the common course to have
set forth this before saying the rest, it being necessary first that preachers
be appointed,<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> then that they should preach, then that men should hear their
preaching, and lastly believe. Therefore he adduces the prophecy of Isaiah,
(lii. 7,) and says, <i>How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the
gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things</i>! for the Lord bade
His apostles, when entering into a house to say, &quot;Peace be to this
house&quot; (Luke x. 5), for they were proclaiming the divine reconciliation,
and bringing glad tidings of the enjoyment of good things. The <i>feet</i> of
such then he calls <i>beautiful</i>, as running a goodly course; as washed by
the hands of the Lord Himself. And having thus brought forward the evidence
concerning the preachers, he says interrogatively, 16. <i>But they have not all
obeyed the gospel</i>? and then again in reply, <i>Esaias saith</i>, (liii. 1,)
<i>Lord, who hath believed our report</i>? Nor has Scripture been silent on
this point either, but of old God predicted all this by Isaiah; and then as
drawing his conclusion, 17. <i>So then faith cometh</i> <i>by hearing, and
hearing by the word of God</i>; wherefore, whosoever disbelieves, disbelieves
the divine oracles, and whosoever believes, receiving the divine words, brings
forth faith as the fruit of his hearing. </p>



<p>18.
<i>But, I say, have they not heard</i>? And this again is to be read <A NAME="p154"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|154</SPAN></A> interrogatively, and then as the answer, <i>Yes, verily, their
sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world</i>.<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
For how was it possible that the Jews should not have heard, when the nations
spread over the whole earth had heard? For to them first the preachers of the
truth brought their tidings, for so the Lord Himself enjoined them, (Matt. x.
6,) &quot;But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel and in the
Acts of the Apostles, (ch. xiii. 40,) &quot;It was necessary that the word of
God should first have been spoken to you.&quot; And the holy apostle continues
in the same form of argument, making his positions clearer by question and
answer, for so again we must read interrogatively, 19. <i>But, I say, did not Israel know</i>? and then what follows as the reply, <i>First, Moses
saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a
foolish nation I will anger you</i> (Deut. xxxii. 21). We, it is, whom he
called foolish, pointing out the folly we laboured under before our conversion
to the faith, for so also the holy apostle speaks, (Tit. iii. .3,) &quot;for we
ourselves also were sometime foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers
lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one
another.&quot; By this God grievously vexed the Jews, for neither the
captivity, nor the dispersion, nor the destruction of the temple, so much
distresses them, as do the religion and eminence<A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A> of the Gentiles. 20. <i>But
Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought Me not, I was
made manifest unto them that asked not after Me</i> (lxv. 11). He shows at once
the prophecy of the revelation of divine knowledge to the Gentiles, and the
bloodthirstings of the Jews, as the expression is very bold testifies; he
feared not, says he, the mad and murdering Jews, but with great boldness
predicted the salvation of the Gentiles, and foretold the infidelity of the
Jews: as what follows shows, 21. <i>But to Israel he saith, All day long I have
stretched forth My hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. All day long</i>
means without ceasing, for so Symmachus and Aquila interpret the <i>every day</i>.
Having thus pointed out that the inspired prophets both condemned the Jews, and
foreshowed the faith of the Gentiles, he seems indeed in what follows to bring
comfort to them, while in truth adding fresh censures on the disbelievers.</p>



<h3 align=center>Chapter <SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C11"></A>XI.</SPAN>&nbsp;</h3>





<p>1.
<i>I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God
forbid</i>. And then while able to adduce
proof of this from many other quarters, and bring forward the three thousand
who believed in Jerusalem, (Acts ii. 41,) and the many myriads of whom the
great James spake, (Acts xxi. 20,) and those of the Jews spread over the face
of the land who had accepted the gospel, instead of all these he instances
himself; and says, <i>For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of
the tribe of Benjamin</i>. 2. <i>God hath not cast away His people, which he
foreknew</i>. For if He had cast them off, I also had been one of the
condemned, seeing that I also have sprung from that root, and glory in Abraham
as <A NAME="p155"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|155</SPAN></A> my forefather, and Benjamin as the head of my tribe, and boast
myself in the name of Israel. And well has he added the <i>which he foreknew</i>,
that is, those that are worthy of the divine knowledge, having welcomed the
light of faith; for so he presently after shows, <i>Wot ye not what the
Scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel</i>
(1 Kings xix. 14). 3. <i>Lord, they have killed Thy prophets, and digged down
Thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life?</i> 4. <i>But what saith the answer of God unto him</i>? (v. 13,) <i>I have reserved to Myself seven thousand men,
who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal</i>. And at that time also,
says he, were there many of Israel, and all were called Israel, and yet the God
of all things designated Himself the God of seven thousand (only), and all the
rest He rejected; for I have left unto Myself, said He, <i>seven thousand men
who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal</i>; and this indeed the
prophet knew not, but imagined that in himself alone was preserved what
remained of true piety. No new nor inconceivable thing then is it, if you also
know not those among you who have fixed their faith in the Saviour, whom the
God of all things acknowledges as His <i>people</i>. And most opportunely does
he bring forward the great Elias making this accusation against them, that not
only had they slain the prophets, but even overthrown the altars from their
foundations; for granting, says he, that they were evilly-disposed towards the
prophets, as denouncing bitter things against them, what had they to allege
against the divine altars? Rather then by such daring impieties did they
manifest that their hatred was against the God thereof. And here the holy
apostle, leaving these scripture testimonies, resumes the thread of his own
discourse, and says, 5. <i>Even so then at this present time also there is a
remnant according to the election of grace. </i>6. <i>And if by grace, then is
it no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works,
then is it no more grace, otherwise work is no more work</i>. As at that time,
says he, among countless myriads, seven thousand only were left who were free
from impiety, even so now also have the greater number disbelieved, and the
smaller are they who have believed and enjoyed the divine <i>grace</i>, for it
is not the polity of the law that has justified them, which is what is here
meant by <i>of works</i>, but the grace of God has saved them; wherefore also
salvation itself is called <i>grace</i>, because it proceeds from the divine
loving-kindness; and this also he said in speaking concerning the patriarch
Abraham, (ch. iv. 4,) &quot;but to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned
of grace, but of debt.&quot; 7. <i>What then?</i> Here we must place a stop,
for it is put interrogatively, that is, what shall we say to this? and then the
rest as the reply, <i>Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but
the election hath obtained it, and the rest were hardened</i>. By <i>the
election</i> he signifies those that had believed; and what he means is this,
Israel by his adherence to the law has failed of the mark, for now contrary to
the (spirit of the) law, he still observes the law, and reaps no righteousness,
but such among them as have believed have obtained it, but <i>the rest were
hardened</i>, that is, their infidelity has yet more hardened their heart; and
he shows that this also was foretold from of old; 8. <i>As it is written</i>,
(Isa. vi. 10, xxix. 10,) &quot;<i>God hath </i><A NAME="p156"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|156</SPAN></A>
<i>given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see,
and ears that they should not hear unto this day</i>.&quot;
<i>Gave them, </i>as &quot;gave them up,&quot; (i. 24,) that is, permitted them
(to fall into), for God did not incline them to disbelief, for how were it
possible for Him to have inflicted infidelity on them, and Himself demanded
vengeance for the same? And this the prophet has yet more clearly shown, (ch.
vi. 10, LXX., as also so cited Matt. xiii. 15, Acts xxviii. 27,) &quot;for this
people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their
eyes have they closed.&quot; Not another then has blinded them, but themselves
have closed their eyes, and have not chosen to see the light. And by <i>the
spirit of slumber</i>, he means a fixed and obdurate mind; that as he who enjoys
a sound and healthy sleep is open to no change for the worse, so he who has
surrendered himself up entirely to evil, admits no alteration for the better.
9. <i>And David saith</i>, (Ps. lxviii. 22,) <i>Let their table be made a
snare, and a trap, and a stumbling-block, and a recompense unto them</i>; 10. <i>Let
their eyes be darkened that they may not see, and bow down their back alway</i>.
By the word <i>table</i> he speaks of their luxurious living, which he
prophesied would be exchanged for the reverse. 11. I say then, <i>Have they
stumbled that they should fall? God forbid, but rather through their fall
salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy</i>. For
to them first, such as believed among them brought the saving gospel, and when
they set themselves against it, and refused to receive their teaching, then to
the Gentiles did they offer the divine gospel; but they that believed obtained
salvation. And this was suited to prick in heart the gainsayers among the Jews,
and excite them to emulation, and so gain for them a participation in that
salvation, for those that have been last they see made first. <A NAME="p363"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|363</SPAN></A> </p>



<p>12. <i>Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the
diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulness</i>? <A NAME="p364"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|364</SPAN></A> For if, when the greater number disbelieved, those that were
converted among them brought the riches of the divine knowledge to the
Gentiles, most manifest is it, that if all believed, they would become the
means of yet greater blessings to all mankind, for all would the more readily
believe, when these no longer opposed, but joined with us instead in preaching,
the truth. Thence he turns his exhortations to those among the Gentiles who had
believed, and counsels them to entertain a chastened view of themselves;
aiming at once at a double point, on the one hand to pull down all
self-sufficiency on their part, and lead them to fear; and on the other, to
bring the Jews to a participation of their ancestral inheritance; and thus he
begins, 13. <i>For I speak unto you, Gentiles; inasmuch indeed as I am the
apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office,</i> 14. <i>If by any means I
may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and may save some of them</i>.
Since God sent me forth as the minister of the Gentiles, necessarily do I
labour after the salvation of the Gentiles, and direct my discourses in their
behalf, and point out the holy prophets of old predicting these things; and
this, that so I may excite the Jews to rivalry, and induce some of them to
share in that salvation; for by <i>his flesh</i> he means the Jews, as those
that in spirit were distant, and related to him only by the affinity of
kindred, 15. <i>For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the
world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</i> For if,
says he, on their disbelief the Gentiles were received in, and freed from their
former ignorance, manifest is it, that if all these were willing to believe,
nothing else would then remain to be accomplished, but the resurrection of the
dead;<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> for so the Lord also said, &quot;and this gospel of the kingdom shall
be preached unto all nations for a witness unto them, and then shall the end
come,&quot; (Matt. xxiv. 14). And all this we must recollect the holy apostle
says, from a desire to suit his matter exactly to the subject in hand, and
teach humility to those among the Gentiles that had believed, hold out the
offer yet to the disbelieving among the Jews, and point out the salvation that
would arise from their change of mind; as what follows teaches yet more
clearly, 16. <i>For if the first- fruit be holy, the lump is also holy; and if
the root be holy, so are the branches</i>. 17. <i>And if some of the branches
be broken off, and thou being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among them,
and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</i> 18. <i>Boast
not thyself against the branches</i>. By the <i>first-fruit</i> he means the
Lord Christ in his human nature; by <i>the root</i>, the patriarch Abraham; by <i>the
branches of the olive</i>, the Jewish people as sprung from thence; and by <i>the
richness of the olive</i>, the doctrines of religion. He admonishes those
among the Gentiles who believed, not to be puffed up against the disbelieving
Jews; for these are they whom he speaks of as branches broken off. Observe
rather, says he, that you, born of another race, have been grafted into this,
and have received of the richness of the holy root. <i>But if thou boast, thou
bearest not the root, but the root thee;</i> and consider this also, that the
root bears thee, not thou the root, and thou <A NAME="p365"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|365</SPAN></A> needest it, not it thee. 19. <i>Thou wilt say then, The branches
were broken off, that I might be grafted in.</i> 20. <i>Well, because of
unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high-minded,
but fear.</i> Infidelity has rendered them aliens from the root, and faith has
connected thee with the root, and made thee to share in its richness; it
behoves thee therefore not to become self-sufficient, but to fear and
tremble.&#8212;Wherefore? 21. <i>For if God spared not the natural branches, take
heed lest He also spare not thee</i>. For if the connexion of nature profited
them not at all, because they retained not the same character and disposition,
much more thou, if thou preservest not that grace, shalt become an alien from
the root. 22. <i>Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them
which fell, severity; but towards thee, goodness, if thou continue in His
goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off</i>. Behold now how God has cut
them off, because they followed not the faith of their forefathers, and how He
has conferred on thee the blessing of his loving-kindness, and made thee to
share in a root not appertaining to thee, from which thou wilt be altogether
severed again, if thou keepest not the gift bestowed on thee. 23. <i>And they
also, if they abide not in unbelief shall be grafted in.</i> For it becomes the
righteousness of God, both to sever again from the root thee, who contrary to
hope wert blessed with the privilege of that root, if thou thereafter preserve
not the grace given; and to join them again to it, if they renounce their
infidelity. And aptly does he use the words <i>grafted in</i> as regards them
also, infidelity having altogether severed them from, and faith exactly, as in
the case of the Gentiles, connecting them with, the root. For God is able to
graft them in again. By mentioning the power of God, he shows the ease with
which this would be done; and gives an instance, not one removed far from them,
and of ancient times, but one which comes home, and was recent, for he calls
themselves as witnesses to this; and says, 24. <i>For if thou wert cut out of
the olive tree, which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature
into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which be the natural
branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</i> If thou, being a wild
olive&#8212;for thou hadst not the law tending thee, nor the prophets, watering, and
pruning, and taking all needful care about thee,&#8212;hast been detached from unholy
ancestors and relations, and made a partaker in the faith of Abraham, and boastest
in him as thy father and ancestor, not by the natural course of the law, but by
the divine loving-kindness; much more probable and natural must it be, that
they, on believing, should be united again to their own root. And all this, as
I before remarked, he says in order to teach humility to the Gentile converts,
and exhort to salvation the disbelievers among the Jews; and with this agrees
what follows, 25. <i>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of
this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits.</i>A <i>mystery</i> is a
thing not known to all, but to those only who are entrusted with it. What he
means then is, that I wish you to understand the mystery I am aware of as
regards these things, that you may <A NAME="p366"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|366</SPAN></A> not over-estimate your own spiritual knowledge, and hence be
puffed up with self-sufficiency. And what is the mystery? <i>That blindness in
part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in, and
so all Israel shall be saved</i>. He puts the <i>in part</i>, to show that not
all had disbelieved, for many even among them had believed; and he bids them
not despair of the salvation of the rest. For when the Gentile nation shall
have received the gospel, then they also shall believe, the great Elias having
come<A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A> and brought instruction in the faith to them, for so the Lord also said
in the holy gospels (Matt. xvii. 1), &quot;Elias cometh and shall restore all
things and he adds also the testimony of the prophet (Isa. lix. 20,) 26. <i>As
it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer, and shall turn away
ungodliness from Jacob;</i> 27. <i>For this is My
covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins</i>. If the polity of the law gives forgiveness of sins, that
it is, which the speech of the prophet predicted; but if the law punishes those
that transgress it, and the Jews ever lay under the accusation of such transgression,
it is plain that the sentence points out the forgiveness which arises from
baptism. And by <i>all Israel</i>, he means such as believe, whether they were
of the Jews, as having a natural descent from Israel, or of the Gentiles, as
connected with him by the relationship of faith.28. <i>As concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes:
but as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers' sakes</i>. When I look to you, with whose instruction I am
entrusted, I consider them as <i>enemies</i> and hateful, as doing all in their
power to <i>your</i> injury; but when I turn to their <i>forefathers</i>, and
reflect how God chose them from among the whole earth, on <i>their account</i>
I love even these. 29. <i>For the gifts and calling of God are without
repentance</i>. All this he says as an incitement to the Jews; for that the
blessings which God gives he again resumes, when He sees those that have
received them infected with ingratitude, Saul is a proof, who, having enjoyed
spiritual<A HREF="#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A> grace, was afterwards deprived thereof; and Solomon in like manner,
who, having obtained peace through the divine loving-kindness, after his
transgression was stripped of that grace;<A HREF="#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> and indeed the Jews themselves,
who, ever having enjoyed the fostering care of the prophets, at that present
time had been bereaved of this guardianship. And the same he had also, just
before threatened to the believers among the Gentiles, &quot;if thou
continue,&quot; says he, &quot;in His goodness; otherwise thou also shalt be
cut off.&quot; 30. <i>For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have
now obtained mercy through their unbelief,</i> 31. <i>Even so have these also
now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy</i>. Remember
indeed how for so long a period all of you lived in sin, and yet the merciful
Lord looked not to that lengthened and bitter ungodliness, but blessed with his
unspeakable loving-kindness such as were willing to receive it, and when these
(the Jews) would not believe, called you in their room; nothing inconsistent
then were it, that these also, who now gainsay, should be accepted of God
whenever willing to believe, and so inherit the divine loving-kindness. And the
<i>that</i> he here again uses in <A NAME="p367"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|367</SPAN></A> the idiom and sense familiar to him,<A HREF="#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A> for they did not therefore
disbelieve, in order that they might find mercy, but they disbelieved because
of the hardness of their hearts, and will find mercy by turning to a change of
mind. 32. <i>For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that He might have mercy
upon all. Concluded</i> he puts for convicted. For he convicted the Gentiles,
as having both received natural judgment, and had the creation teaching them
the knowledge of God, and yet from neither the one nor the other having derived
benefit; and He convicted the Jews likewise, as having enjoyed yet more
instruction, in that in addition to nature and the creation, they had received
the prophets also teaching what was right, and so become obnoxious to the
heavier vengeance; while at the same time both these and those, thus deserving
total destruction, has He blessed with the privilege of salvation, provided
only they were willing to believe. Having thus fully gone through these things,
and contemplating the profundity of the divine lovingkindness, and how
incomprehensible is His wisdom, he cries out, 33. <i>O the depth of the riches,
and of the wisdom, and of the knowledge of God!</i> For of old, and from the
beginning, has He foreknown all these things, and foreknowing has wisely
disposed, and in that dispensation manifested the riches of His
loving-kindness. <i>How unsearchable are his judgments, and His ways past
finding out!</i> The scheme of the divine economy surpasses man's
understanding; nor even by the invisible powers is the providence of the God of
all things fully reached unto. 34. <i>For who hath known the mind of the Lord,
or who hath been His counsellor?</i> 35. <i>Or who hath first given to Him, and
it shall be recompensed unto him again?</i> These three he puts us answering to
the former three, the &quot;riches,&quot; and the &quot;wisdom,&quot; and the
&quot;knowledge:'' the <i>who hath known the mind of the Lord</i>, to the
knowledge; the <i>who hath been His counsellor</i>, to the wisdom; and the <i>who
hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again</i>, to the
riches. For so immense are the riches of His goodness, that both to them that
were not, has He given existence, and on such as are, of His free grace
bestowed well- being.<A HREF="#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A> And not as really due to us for any thing we have <i>first
given</i>, but of His own free kindness does He confer His blessings, although
in mercy condescending to call each such free gift, the <i>repayment</i> of ourselves.
36. <i>For of Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things: to whom be glory
for ever. Amen.</i> For He created all things, and He continues governing all
that He thus created. To Him we ought to look, confessing our gratitude for all
we already have enjoyed, and begging for His future providence; and to Him we
ought to offer up also the praise and honour due.&#8212; Now in the words above, the
holy apostle shows that he recognised not any difference between the
expressions <i>of whom</i> and <i>through whom</i>,<A HREF="#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A> as though the former, as
indicating some <A NAME="p368"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|368</SPAN></A> superiority, belonged to the Father; and the latter, as implying
some inferiority, were suited to the Son. For he applies both of them to the
same Person; whom if, on the one hand, the Arians and Eunomians say is the
Father, they will find the <i>through whom</i> joined to the <i>of whom</i>;
and if, on the other, they refer it to the Son, they will see then the <i>of
whom</i> connected to the <i>through whom</i>. If then the <i>of whom</i> implies
any superiority, and the <i>through whom</i> any inferiority, and yet both are
spoken of the same Person, He must in all reason be considered greater than
Himself, on account of the <i>of whom</i>, and less than Himself on account of
the <i>through whom</i>. Let us then, leaving such (arguers) for the present,
magnify our Creator and Saviour, to whom belongs glory for ever and ever. Amen. <A NAME="p617"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|617</SPAN></A> </p>
<h2 align=center>Book
V.</h2>



<p>The knowledge of the nature of God, and faith, and right
affections towards Him, are the sum and true foundation of all good; for what
the eye is to the body, that faith and the knowledge of divine matters are to
the soul. But then she needs also at the same time practical virtue, as the eye
does hands and feet, and the other members of the body.</p>

<p>Wherefore, the holy apostle adds moral instructions also to his
doctrinal course, in order to promote in us the most perfect virtue, for
through the Romans does he afford this advantage to all mankind: and thus he
opens the subject.</p>



<h3 align=center>Chapter <SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C12"></A>XII.</SPAN>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>1. <i>I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God</i>.
He lays down laws, and sinking authority puts forth his instructions with
intreaties, reminding them of the divine loving-kindness, of which he had
before spoken so much at length; and what then dost thou beseech? <i>that ye
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is
your reasonable service</i>. And already before had he exhorted to make
&quot;their members instruments of righteousness, and yield themselves to <A NAME="p618"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|618</SPAN></A> God as those that are alive from the dead,&quot; (ch. vi. 13;) and
here he bids these become also a <i>sacrifice</i>, and calls it a <i>living</i>
sacrifice, for it is not to be slain that he commands the body,<A HREF="#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> but to become
dead to sin, and not be open to its action; and such sacrifice he speaks of as <i>holy</i>,
<i>reasonable</i>, and <i>acceptable</i>, as contrasting it with the oblation
of irrational animals, and showing that with this the Lord is pleased. For by
ail the prophets, as one may say, he finds fault with the sacrifices of beasts,
while he enjoins this; for &quot;sacrifice,&quot; says he, &quot;unto God the sacrifice
of praise,&quot; and &quot;the sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me.&quot; Ps.
1. (LXX. li. 14, 23; and see also Isa. i. 11-18,) and a thousand other such
passages are to be found in the Holy Scriptures. 2. <i>And follow not the
fashions</i><A HREF="#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A><i> of this world</i>. He speaks of the things of this present world,
such as wealth, and power, and other like pomps, by fashions, future things
being substances, as alone permanent and satisfying; for so in another place
also, (1 Cor. vii. 31,) &quot;for the fashion of this world passeth away.&quot;
For many from the height of abundance have fallen into the extremest poverty,
and others sprung from the lowest parents become entrusted with the noblest
offices of authority; and some again who elevated an haughty brow, and enlarged
themselves in pride, conceiving themselves superior to everybody, being
suddenly carried off, have become ill-savoured dust. The holy apostle therefore
desires us not to gape after these things, nor to love the fashion of this
world, but to seek those things which advance the life eternal. <i>But be ye
transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good,
and acceptable, and perfect will of God</i>. He exhorts here those also who
were inclining to the worse to return again to the better, as the word <i>transformed</i>
shews. And he teaches how great is the difference between virtue and mere
present objects, by calling them <i>fashions</i>, but virtue a <i>form</i>, for
a <i>form</i> indicates actually existing objects, but a <i>fashion</i> that
which quickly melts away. And he points out the freedom of will which the soul
possesses, by commanding it both to <i>renew the mind</i>, and to discriminate
the better from the worse; for these things are what he says serve God; and he
marks out what these are; and first of all he denounces arrogance, and enjoins
humility.
3. <i>For I say. through the grace given unto me, to
every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought
to think, but to think as accords with sobriety</i>. And not himself does he declare thus enjoins, but the
grace of the Spirit through him, for its instrument, says he, I am; and by the
word <i>sobriety</i> here, he designates the healthy state of the mind, to
teach us that arrogance is the sickness of the intellect; and herein, indeed,
he imitates his own Master; for so the Lord in the holy gospels (Matt. v. 3)
pronounced the first blessing on such as were given to humility.
&quot;Blessed,&quot; says he, &quot;are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven.&quot; And these instructions he lays on all, both rich and
poor, both servants and masters, both men and women, as the words <i>to every
one that is among you</i> testify; and he gives the proper measures of our
self-opinion, <i>according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith</i>.
Grace it is which he here calls faith, because that <A NAME="p619"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|619</SPAN></A> by faith comes the gift of grace; and according to the proportion
of a man's faith are the gifts of grace supplied; and he commands each to
regulate his own self-estimate by the grace allotted to him. 4. <i>For as we
have many members in out body, and all members have not the same office;</i> 5.
<i>So we being many are one body in Christ, and every one members one of
another</i>. The illustration is exactly suited to such an exhortation
concerning brotherly love; for as each of the members is not useful to itself
alone, but contributes its benefits to the common whole, so, therefore, it
becomes him who has been blessed with any grace from above, clearly to
understand that he has received that gift for the common advantage; for
believers are one body, and each of us fulfils the office of a member; 6. <i>Having
gifts, differing according to the grace that is given to us</i>. Thus are we to
understand this, we are members of each other, having gifts differing according
to the grace given to us; and yet, although thus differing, they are
nevertheless bestowed by the divine grace for the common good. <i>Whether
prophecy according to the proportion of faith</i>; 7. <i>Or ministry that he
should wait on ministering, or as a teacher on teaching</i>; 8. <i>Or as an
exhorter, on exhortation</i>. According to the faith of each does the Giver of
all good proportion the grace. And by <i>prophecy</i> he means not only the
foreknowledge of the future, but the understanding hidden things also;<A HREF="#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A> and by <i>ministry</i>
the office of preaching the gospel; by <i>teaching</i> the instructing in the
divine doctrines; by <i>exhortation</i> the inciting to virtue. <i>He that
giveth, let him do it with singleness of heart</i>; not seeking after the good
opinion of others, but supplying the wants of him that needs; nor calculating
with himself whether he has sufficient by him or not, but trusting in God, and
so affording assistance liberally; <i>he that ruleth, with diligence; he that
showeth mercy, with cheerfulness</i>. 9. <i>Let love be without simulation</i>.
He bids all things be done with earnestness. And the <i>oversight</i> he
orders to be exercised with zeal, that it he not the name without the thing;
and to <i>shewing bounty</i> he joins joy, in order to point out the gain that
arises from communicating to others; seeing that they who gain are wont to
rejoice; for so also he says in his epistle to the Corinthians (2 Ep. ix. 7);
&quot;not grudgingly or of necessity, for God loveth a cheerful giver;&quot;
and love He commands to be genuine and sincere, and repudiates the mask of
pretence. <i>Abhorring that which is evil, clinging to that which is good</i>.
Again he says not simply to fly from the former, and follow after the latter,
but exhorts us exceedingly to hate sin, and to the performance of good deeds
bids us closely be connected, our affections serving thereto as it were a
cement. 10. <i>Being kindly affectioned one to another in brotherly love; in
honour preferring one another.</i> Have your regard warm, and such as becomes
brethren towards each other; and let each yield the first places to his
neighbour, for this is a proof of true and perfect love. 11. <i>Not slothful in
ardour:</i> shewing forth a ready promptness towards what is good, and
altogether casting away indolence. <i>Fervent in spirit.</i> By <i>spirit</i>
he means the spiritual grace given, and to this, as fuel to the fire, he commands
us to bring alacrity as its subject-matter; as he says also in another place
(1 Thess. v. 19); &quot;Quench not the Spirit;&quot; for the Spirit is <A NAME="p620"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|620</SPAN></A> quenched
in such as are unworthy of such grace: for, not having the eye of their
understanding clear;<A HREF="#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A> they take not in that beam; even as with the corporeally
blind light itself becomes darkness, and in mid-day they are bound by the
blackness of night. Wherefore he bid us be <i>fervent in spirit</i>, and
possess a warm desire concerning heavenly things; as he also subjoins, <i>serving
the Lord</i>. 12. <i>Rejoicing in hope, patient</i><A HREF="#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A><i> in tribulation, continuing
instant in prayer</i>. For he who is fervent in spirit, both readily obeys his
Master, and waits for the enjoyment of the blessings looked for, and rises
superior to the temptations that befall him, arming himself with steadfastness
against their attacks, and ever calling the divine grace to his assistance; as
he also subjoins, <i>continuing instant in prayer</i>, that is, incessantly
doing so; 13. <i>Communicating with the necessities of the saints.</i><A HREF="#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
Having mentioned <i>communication</i> he exhorts to liberality; for who would
not choose to impart of his wealth, thereby to become a sharer in good deeds? <A HREF="#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
for so also did he say in his Epistle to the Corinthians, &quot;that your
abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a
supply for your want.&quot; <i>Given to hospitality.</i> The <i>guests</i> he
means are not the saints only, but such also as have come from any quarter
whatsoever, and need entertainment, whom he commands us to take care of. 14. <i>Bless
them which persecute you; bless and curse not.</i> This was a law of our
Lord's, for the Lord enjoined it to the holy Apostles, (Matt. v. 44.) 15. <i>Rejoice
with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep</i>; 16. <i>Being of
the same mind one toward another</i>. Share with each other both in afflictions
and their opposite, for the former is the part of sympathy, and the latter of
friendship unsullied by envy. <i>Minding not high things, but condescending to
men of low estate</i>. Again he banishes the arrogance of haughtiness, and
bids the high come down to the low. <i>Be not wise in your own conceits</i>;
that is, be not satisfied with your own judgments, but take the counsels also
of others. 17. <i>Recompensing to no man evil for evil</i>; and this indeed is
an excellence belonging to virtue in its highest state of perfection, and
approaching near to a total emancipation from the passions. <i>Providing things
honest in the sight of all men</i>; and he says also elsewhere, &quot;Give none
offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of
God.&quot; (1 Cor. x. 32.) 18. <i>If it be possible, as much as lieth in you,
live peaceably with all men</i>. Most accurately does he express himself here,
in making the addition of the <i>if it be possible</i>, and the <i>as far as
lieth in you</i>; let nothing, says he, be done on your part, but try every
means for peace. And this is in strict consequence from what he had before
said, for what feeling of hostility can he entertain, who &quot;blesses him
that persecutes,'' and avenges not himself on him that injures him? 19. <i>Avenging
not yourselves, dearly beloved, </i><A NAME="p621"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|621</SPAN></A>
<i>but
rather give ye place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is Mine, I will
repay, saith the Lord</i>. (Deut. xxxii. 3.).) 20. <i>Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed
him; if he thirst, give him drink; for in so doing thou shall heap coals of
fire on his head</i>. Having pointed out the Judge, and shown his just
judgments, for so the <i>Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, saith the Lord</i>,
signifies, he bids us generously bear all the injuries offered to us, repaying
with the reverse those that do evil to us, and ministering to the wants of
those that hate us. For these things weave a crown to such as thus meekly and
patiently endure,<A HREF="#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A> while they increase the punishment of the injurers. Not
indeed that we are to suppose (that he means) that on this account we are to
minister to our enemies, in order that they may suffer the heavier retribution
hereafter, for the holy Apostle thus speaks from a wish to repress the anger of
the injured party, not from a desire by (his) good to increase (the other's)
evil. For that it is such a patient endurance which he inculcates, what follows shews; <i>Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good</i>. For to revenge
oneself proves defeat, while the returning good for evil is manifest victory.
Having thus disciplined (their) morals, he exhorts them also to render to those
in authority the honour due; for he foresaw, as one who had plenteously
received of the grace of the thrice holy Spirit, how some, led rather by
self-arrogance than any holy zeal for religion, would despise their earthly
rulers, as conceiving themselves far superior to them by reason of their
(better spiritual) knowledge.<A HREF="#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A> And especially does he do this, that he may blot
out the opinion prevalent concerning them; for they were falsely represented as
destroyers of the common laws; and some said, (Acts xvii. 6,) &quot;These that
have turned the world upside down are come hither also;&quot; and others that
they were introducing &quot;new customs&quot; (Acts x. 20); wherefore he
thought it worth while to lay down his injunctions on this point also. <A NAME="p684"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|684</SPAN></A> </p>

<p>1. <i>Let
every soul be subject unto the higher powers</i>. Whether a man be a priest, or
a bishop, or profess a monastic life, let him be subject to those who are
invested with authority; evidently if it be consistent with duty to God, for
any opposition to the divine laws leaves us not the power of obeying our
rulers. <i>For there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of
God</i>. And these come from the providence of God; for He, consulting the
general well-being, ordained some to govern, and some to be governed, imposing
the fear of the magistrate to serve as a bridle on evil doers. But we must
observe, that it is the ordinance of ruling and being ruled, which the holy
Apostle derives from the providence of God, and not (so much) the elevation of
this or that specific individual to power; for it is not (so much) the sway of
the unjust, but the constitution of the office itself which is of God's
appointment. And yet, when kindly-disposed towards any, He gives them rulers
who respect and keep justice, for &quot;I will give them,&quot; says He,
&quot;pastors according to Mine heart, which shall feed them with
knowledge&quot; (Jer. iii. 15); and again, &quot;I will give your judges as at
the first, and your counsellors as at the beginning&quot; (Isa. i. 26); and
when again desirous to chastise transgressors, He suffers them to be governed
by evil governors also; for &quot;I will place over them,&quot; says He,
&quot;children to be their princes, and scoffers shall rule over them&quot;
(Isa. iii. 4); but it is time to return to the rest of the exposition. 2. <i>Whosoever,
therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God</i>. He fitly
deters them. <i>And they that resist shall receive to themselves judgment</i>;
that is, will become obnoxious to punishment. And then he points out also the
use of government. 3. <i>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the
evil</i>; for they chastise those that live in wickedness. <i>Wilt thou then
not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shall have praise
of the same;</i> 4. <i>For he is the minister of God to thee for good.</i> He
shews that he is worthy of all respect in calling him <i>the minister of God</i>;
and he exhorts also to the performance of good deeds, in saying that rulers are
<i>applauders of good. But if thou do that which is evil be afraid; for he
beareth not the sword in vain; for he is the minister of God, a revenger to
execute wrath upon him that doeth evil</i>. If thou lovest what is good, honour
then the government which enjoins these same things; but if thou pursuest the
reverse fear then its judgment, for it is <i>appointed of God</i> for the
punishment of <i>the evil</i>. 5. <i>Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not
only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake</i>. By <i>wrath</i> he means
punishment; and on both grounds he <A NAME="p685"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|685</SPAN></A> bids
us be obedient, both from fear of punishment, and that we may fulfil what is
our duty; for this is what he means by <i>conscience' sake</i>. 6. <i>For, for
this cause pay ye tribute also; for they are God's ministers attending
continually upon this very thing</i>. For while thou art asleep he is bearing
about him the common care; and while thou sittest at home, he is meeting the
war which brings thee peace. 7. <i>Render therefore to all their dues; tribute
to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to
whom honour</i>. By <i>tribute</i> he means the taxes arising from land, but by
<i>custom</i> the excise or duty from merchandise; nor are these only what he
calls <i>dues</i>, but <i>fear</i> and <i>honour</i> also; for these are owing
from the ruled to the rulers. 8. <i>Owe no man any thing, but to love one
another</i>. Not that we are not to pay the debt of love, for this we ought to
discharge before any thing else, but that we should increase it by that
payment; for such discharge augments the debt, in that it makes love the warmer;
<i>for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.</i> How, and in what
manner? 9. <i>For this, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not kill,
thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other
commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, thou shalt love
thy neighbour as thyself</i>. For he who is kindly disposed towards any one,
kills not him whom he thus loves, commits not adultery with his wife, steals
not any thing belonging to the object of his affectionate regard, nor does any
other thing which might give him pain; for so he subjoins, 10. <i>Love worketh
no ill to his neighbour</i>; and then drawing his conclusion, <i>therefore love
is the fulfilling of the law.</i> And so also the Lord, being asked which was
the first commandment, mentioned the first, and joined the second to it, (Mark
xii. 30,) &quot;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy
neighbour as thyself and shews that in the former is established perfect
theoretical, and in the second perfect practical virtue; and so, in like
manner, the holy Apostle, <i>therefore love is the fulfilling of the law</i>;
and then he goes on to say, 11. <i>And that, knowing the time, that now it is
high time for us to awake out of sleep</i>; that is, especially as this is not
a time for sleep, but for arousing ourselves from slumber; <i>for now is our
salvation nearer than when we believed</i>; for each day we draw nearer to the
coming of the Lord (in judgment.) 12. <i>The night is far spent, the day is at
hand.</i> By night he means the season of ignorance;<A HREF="#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> by <i>the day</i> the
time since the appearance of the Lord among us. For the Sun of righteousness
having arisen, has enlightened the whole world with the rays of divine
knowledge. <i>Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put
on the armour of light</i>. By <i>darkness</i> he means ignorance; and by <i>the
works of darkness</i> evil actions; and knowledge is what he calls <i>light</i>;
and the performance of good deeds <i>the armour of light</i>. 13. <i>Let us
walk honestly, as in the day.</i> By natural things he sets forth spiritual,
for so they that embrace a life of sin commit such sin in the night, while in
the day time they put on the appearance of orderly conduct. He intends, then,
that the night having as it were passed away, and ignorance ceased, we should
depart from evil deeds. And what these are he goes on to specify. <i>Not in
lasciviousness, and drunkenness; not in chambering and wantonness; not in
strife and envying.</i> For in their feasts some were <A NAME="p686"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|686</SPAN></A> wont to act lewdly, and defile their tongues with obscene songs,
all of which drunkenness provokes, as it is also the parent of wantonness, and
the teacher of strife and quarrelsomeness. 14. <i>But put ye on the Lord Jesus
Christ</i>. Not that they should receive another baptism, but consider the 
garment wherewith they were already clothed.<A HREF="#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A> <i>And make not provision for the
flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof</i>. Here he stops the mouths of those
heretics who condemned the flesh itself,<A HREF="#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> for he denounces not care for the
body, but forbids luxurious indulgence and intemperance; saying not, make no
provision for the body, but make it not <i>for the lusts</i>; that is, prepare
it not by luxurious living to play the wanton. Having thus in its turn fully
spoken of practical virtue, he now returns again to doctrinal instruction. And
here it is first necessary to explain the scope of the Apostle's arguments,
that the exposition of what he says may be more clearly understood. The Gentile
believers, then, embraced the polity prescribed by the gospel; while many of
the Jews who had become proselytes to the gospel, persisted still in submission
to the institutions of the law, keeping still to the observation of particular
days, and partaking of such food (only) as the law directed. Hence a disunion
arose, and indeed positive quarrels, these latter condemning the Gentile
believers for their indiscriminate use of all foods, and the former despising
them in their turn on account of their extreme and superfluous adherence to the
law. To correct all this, therefore, the holy Apostle offers such admonitions
as are suited to both parties; and first he exhorts the Gentile believers to
brotherly love. <A NAME="p729"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|729</SPAN></A> </p>
<h3 align=center>Chapter <SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C14"></A>XIV.</SPAN>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>1. <i>Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not into
distinctions of opinions</i>.<A HREF="#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A> By <i>weak</i> he means him who was yet a slave
to legal observances. 2. <i>For one believeth that he may eat all things</i>;
that is, the Gentile convert; <i>another, who is weak, eateth herbs</i>. Some
declare that the Jewish proselytes, in order to cast shame on the Gentile
converts, abstained not only from swine's flesh, but even from all animal food,
under the pretext of self-restraint and temperance; whence the holy Apostle
says, <i>he who is weak eateth herbs</i>; for not having a perfect faith,<A HREF="#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A> he
thought that he would be defiled by such kind of food. 3. <i>Let not him that
eateth despise him that eateth not</i>. For the Gentile converts despised the
Jewish, as not possessing a sound faith, and as on this account being unwilling
to partake of such kind of food. <i>And let not him that eateth not judge him
that eateth</i>. And the Jewish indeed condemned the Gentile converts,
esteeming their indiscriminate use of every kind of food transgression. <i>For
God hath received him</i>; that is, the Gentile convert; and he goes on in his
rebuke of the Jew: 4. <i>Who art thou that judgest another's servant? to his
own master he standeth or falleth</i>. Every servant while living is a source
of profit to his own Master, and on death again brings him loss; and this man
then the Lord of all things has bought, having given His own blood as the price
of his purchase; and having said &quot;to his own Master he standeth or
falleth,&quot; he necessarily adds, <i>Yea, he shall be holden up</i>; and
establishes what he says by the power of God, <i>for God is able to make him
stand</i>. Having spoken thus much concerning foods, he transfers his discourse
to the matter of days.&nbsp; 5. <i>One man esteemeth one day above another: another
esteemeth every day alike, (for this purpose.)</i> For some abstained from the
meats forbidden by the law <i>at all times</i>, and some on <i>particular days</i>
(only). <i>Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind</i>. He lays not
this down as a principle of universal application; for neither does he so bid us
reckon as regards the doctrines of religion, seeing that he passes an anathema
on those that permit themselves to preach contrary to the truth, (Gal. i. 9:)
&quot;For if any one preach unto you,&quot; says he, &quot;any other gospel
than that ye have received, let him he accursed.&quot; Concerning foods, then,
only is it that he allows this power to each man's own mind. For so indeed this
custom remains in the churches even to the present day, and one man embraces
abstinence, and another without scruple takes of all kinds of food, and neither
does the former condemn the latter, nor the latter find fault with the former,
but mutually glory in <A NAME="p730"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|730</SPAN></A> the law of concord. 6. <i>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it
unto the Lord; </i> <A HREF="#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A><i> and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard
it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that
eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</i> He says this
in condescension to us, <A HREF="#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> in order to produce peace and harmony in the church.
The God of all, says he, knows the intention, both of those that eat, and of
those that eat not, and he attends not to the bare deed, but inquires into the
design of what is done. 7. <i>For none of us liveth to himself, and none of us
dieth to himself. </i>8. <i>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord, and
whether we die, we die unto the Lord; whether we live, therefore, or die, we
are the Lord's</i>. We are not our own lords; we have been bought with a price;
and while living, therefore, we are <i>the Lord's</i>, and when dead we are
the Lord's; that is, neither art thou his master, nor is he thine; for One we
all have for our Lord. 9. <i>For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and
revived, that He might he Lord, both of the dead and the living</i>. He is the
Master of all, who for our sakes gave Himself up to death, who destroyed the
power of death, and has promised salvation to us all. To Him, then, are we
subject, as from Him having received life. 10. <i>But why dost thou judge thy
brother?</i> this he says to the Jew; <i>for we shall all stand before the
judgment-seat of Christ</i>. And then he also establishes what he says on the
testimony of Scripture: 11. <i>For it is written,</i> (see Isa. xliii. 10; xlv.
21, 23; xliv. 6, 8, &amp;c.,) <i>As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall
bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God</i>. He is our judge, He is
our sentencer; at that tribunal of His we must stand. And indeed this witness
of the prophet proves the completeness of the divinity of the Only-begotten. <A HREF="#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
For having said by the prophet, &quot;I am God before all ages, and I am first,
and I am afterwards, and even unto eternity I am God, and before Me there was
no God formed, neither shall there be after Me, and beside Me there is none,
and a just God and a Saviour there is none beside Me,&quot; then He adds,
&quot;By Myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, that unto Me every knee shall
bow, and every tongue confess to God.&quot; But let us proceed on to what
remains of our interpretation. 12. <i>So then every one of us shall give
account of himself to God</i>. Having pointed out the tribunal of the Lord,
most consistently does he exhort them not to judge one another, but to await
that judgment; for so he again subjoins, 13. <i>Let us not therefore judge one
another any more; but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block, or
an occasion to fall, in his brother's way</i>. Here he directs his rebukes to
the Gentile converts, who condescended not to the infirmities of the Jewish
proselytes, but esteemed the indifferent use of all kinds of food as the height
of virtue and the warmth of zeal. And first, then, he teaches that none of
these things is really impure and unclean; and thus he speaks: 14. <i>I know
and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that in Him there </i><A NAME="p731"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|731</SPAN></A>
<i>is nothing unclean</i>. It was necessary, by
reason of the infirmity of the Jews, that he should add the expression <i>in
the Lord Jesus</i>; for it was that they might not say, Who art thou that
legislatest in contradiction of Moses? that he brings forward the Lord of
Moses; showing that He had put an end to the observances of the law, and
permitted us not to consider any food unclean; for the <i>in Him</i> signifies
in His institutions in the gospel; for Himself also said to the blessed Peter,
&quot;What God hath cleansed that call not thou unclean.&quot; (Acts x. 15.) <i>But
to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean</i>. But if
a man <i>conceiving</i> such food <i>to be unclean</i>, yet partakes therein,
it <i>becomes unclean</i>; not by reason of its own nature, but on account of
the opinion of him that thus partakes of it. Having thus distinguished as to
these things, he again censures the Gentile converts, who bore<A HREF="#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> not the infirmities
of the Jews. 15. <i>But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest
thou not charitably</i>. He increases the accusation (by that of want) of
charity, to expose him that thus acted; and then even more fully points out the
folly of such conduct. <i>Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died</i>.
For him the Lord Christ endured death, while thou art not willing by a mere
abstinence in food to gain life for him, but by indulgence contrivest death.
16. <i>Let not then your good be evil spoken of</i>. Again, the accusation is
made in conjunction with praise, for faith he calls a <i>good thing</i>. I
commend, says he, thy faith, but I would not that it become the cause of injury
and <i>reproach</i>. 17. <i>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but
righteousness, and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost</i>. For imagine not that
this is the perfection of excellence, and what will procure <i>the kingdom of
heaven</i>; for what procures that is true <i>righteousness</i>, and concord,
and zeal as to <i>peace</i>, and love, from which springs joy, as to God. 18. <i>For
he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of
men</i>. For these things the God of all both requires of us, and they also
bring advantage to men. Nor must we fail to observe, that he declares the <i>serving
Christ</i> is <i>acceptable to the God of all</i>. If, then, the serving Christ
be pleasing to God, so also truly to honour Christ must be pleasing to Him;
wherefore likewise to speak evil of Christ, and to attempt to lower His dignity,
must be offensive to the God of all. 19. <i>Let us therefore follow after the
things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another</i>. It
behoves us therefore above all to value a profitable concord, and to do all for
the mutual advantage of each other. <i>For meat destroy not the work of God</i>.
The believing on Him is what our Lord called <i>the work of God</i>; for
&quot;this,&quot; says He, &quot;is <i>the work of God</i>, that ye believe on
Him whom He hath sent,&quot; (John vi. 29). Since then it was probable that
some of the Jews would fall away from the faith, not enduring the reproaches of
the Gentile believers, aptly does he say, for meat destroy not the work of God.
And again, that the Jewish proselytes might not hence gain a pretext for
insisting on the observance of the law, he provides against this also, and
says, 20. <i>All things indeed are pure</i>; none, says he, of these foods is
unclean by its own nature, <i>but it is evil to that man who eateth with
offence</i>; but to thee, <A NAME="p732"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|732</SPAN></A> nevertheless, indulgence therein brings injury, because thou neglectest
thy neighbour's interests, and seest him suffer with contempt. 21. <i>It is
good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother
stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak</i>. And not as regards flesh alone,
but wine also, I bid thee never to indulge in either, if this really work any
harm to thy neighbour. 22. <i>Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God</i>.
In the full exercise of faith thou keepest the law (of Christian liberty in the
gospel, v. 14, and Gal. v. 1, &amp;c.) Great is the possession, worthy of
praise the excellence, but let it not be to the detriment of thy neighbour. <i>Happy
is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth</i>. The
expression insinuates that the Gentile converts were in the habit of
compelling the Jews to partake of those things they were averse to; he teaches
therefore that the believer<A HREF="#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A> indeed derives no injury from the use of them,
but that he who eats, while yet making a distinction, partakes in such as
unclean, wherefore he pronounces him happy that <i>judges not himself</i>;
that is, who makes no such difference (in his own mind); and so he subjoins, in
explanation,
23. <i>But he that maketh a distinction is condemned
if he eat</i>; and he shews the reason, <i>because
he eateth not of faith; but whatsoever is not of faith is sin</i>. For he who 
believes harmlessly partakes, but he who eats with any such distinction passes 
sentence on himself. And that he may prove himself enjoining what is agreeable 
to God, he offers up a fervent prayer in their behalf; <A HREF="#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A> <i>Now to Him that is
of power to stablish you</i>; and after what manner to stablish? <i>according
to my gospel</i>; and what is his gospel? <i>and the preaching of Jesus Christ</i>;
and pointing out the antiquity of that preaching, he adds, <i>according to the revelation
of the mystery</i>; for not now is the mystery framed, but now is it made
known, having been long concealed; for so he goes on to say, <i>which was kept
secret since the world began</i>; and then he brings forward also the witnesses
of this preaching, <i>but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the
prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God</i>; for what He
had darkly foreshown in the prophets, these things has the Maker of all ages
now clearly displayed; and what is the fruit of this preaching? <i>for the
obedience of faith</i>, for it behoves them that hear to believe what is
preached; and who are they? <i>made known to all nations</i>. Thus it is to be
understood, <i>according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, made
known to all nations</i>. <i>To God only wise, through Christ Jesus, to whom be
glory for ever, Amen.</i> Having set forth the mystery of the dispensation, of
old indeed fore-appointed, and then predicted in the prophets, and afterwards
become manifest indeed, he magnifies the wisdom of God, and utters forth a
doxology suitable thereto. But if the heretics should assert that God (the
Father) is here called <i>the alone wise</i>, let them know that the Lord
Christ is not only so called <i>wise</i>, but wisdom itself. (Prov. iii. 19,
&amp;c.) And if indeed they think it right to deprive the Son of this name of <i>wise</i>,
so neither let them call Him immortal, for the same Apostle says of God,
&quot;who alone hath <A NAME="p733"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|733</SPAN></A> immorlity.&quot; (1 Tim. vi. 16).<A HREF="#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A> But leaving such to their own folly,
let us proceed onwards in our course. Having then thus offered up these
supplications for them, the holy Apostle adds exhortations, giving praise to
the Gentile converts, and designating them as <i>strong</i>, by reason of their
faith.</p>



<h3 align=center>Chapter <SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C15"></A>XV.</SPAN>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>1. <i>We then that are strong ought to hear the infirmities of the
weak, and not to please ourselves.</i> 2. <i>Let every one of us please his
neighbour, for his good to edification</i>:&#8212;I know that thou art brought to completeness,
and that faith has made thee <i>strong</i>, but I exhort thee to extend a hand
to him that is <i>weak</i>, and not to seek thine own (comfort or convenience)
alone, but to consult also the advantage of thy neighbour; and he says not
merely to <i>please thy neighbour</i>, but <i>for his good to edification</i>,
since it is very possible to please a neighbour both to his and our own injury;
and then the example, 3. <i>For even Christ pleased not himself, but as it is
written</i> (Ps. lxix. 9), &quot;<i>The reproaches of them that reproached
Thee fell on Me</i>.'' For even the Lord Himself sought not his own
(convenience), but for our salvation gave Himself up to death. For we heard Him
in his passion praying, and saying (Matt. xxvi. 39), &quot;O My Father, if it
be possible, let this cup pass from Me, nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou
wilt and he bore also the blasphemies of the Jews, and those which they had
formerly brought upon His Father by their wicked lives,<A HREF="#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A> the same they uttered
against Him; on which account it is that he here cites that testimony of the
prophet. 4. <i>For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for
our learning, that we through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures might
have hope</i>. God, providing for our advantage, has both afforded us a written
rule of doctrine, and also preserved in written history the accounts of the
saints. 5. <i>Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be
like-minded one towards another according to Christ Jesus</i>. Again by the
addition of the <i>according to Christ Jesus</i> he shews that he does not
indiscriminately beg for a concord of any kind for them, but the <i>concord of
godliness</i>: and speaking of <i>patience</i> and <i>comfort</i>, he joins
therewith the mention of <i>love</i>; that adorned therewith they might bear
the imperfections of their neighbour, and by mutual counsel and <i>comfort</i>
lead him on to completeness. 6. <i>That with one mind and one mouth ye may
glorify God. even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</i>. He calls God <i>our
God</i>, but <i>our Lord Jesus Christ's Father</i>, for He who is the <i>God </i>of<i>
us</i> all, is <i>His Father</i>. 7. <i>Wherefore receive ye one another, as
Christ also received us, to the glory of God</i>. And indeed the Lord Christ
loved us not as being holy, but receiving us while sinners so justified; we
ought therefore ourselves also to bear the weakness of our brethren, and do all
to forward their salvation. And seeing that the Jewish proselytes put forward
the circumcision of our Lord, asserting that even Himself also had embraced the
polity of the law, the holy Apostle thought it worth while to write what was
fitting on this subject <A NAME="p734"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|734</SPAN></A> also; and he says, 8. <i>Now I say that Jesus Christ was a
minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made
unto the Father</i>; 9. <i>And that the Gentiles might glorify God for His
mercy</i>. The God of all things promised to Abraham that in his seed He would
bless all nations; and the patriarch himself and all his race received the sign
of circumcision; it behoved therefore Him also, who is called &quot;his seed
after the flesh,&quot; and who shed forth the blessing on the Gentiles, to bear
the sign of his kindred, that the truth of the divine promise might be clearly
manifested, and the Gentiles receiving that grace might magnify Him, from whom
the loving-kindness has flowed to them. And then he adduces scriptural
testimonies, shewing that the salvation of the Gentiles had been predicted of
old; <i>As it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the
Gentiles, and sing unto Thy name</i> (Ps. xviii. 49). 10. <i>And again it
saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people</i>, (Deut. xxxii. 13). 11. <i>And
again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles, and laud Him, all ye people</i>. (Ps.
cxvii. 1). 12. <i>And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and
He that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles, in Him shall the Gentiles trust</i>.
Now these testimonies he cites in order to teach the Jewish converts not to be
offended at the salvation of the Gentiles, but believe the prophecies
concerning them. And again he implores a blessing on them, exhibiting the
fatherly affection he bore to them. 13. <i>Now the God of hope fill you with
all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power
of the Holy Ghost</i>. He had already above said, in the part of this Epistle
which we have expounded, that &quot;hope which is seen is not hope&quot;' (ch.
viii. 24); wherefore also he calls God <i>the God of hope</i>, as having of old
given to the Gentiles the hope of the blessing, and now established that
promise by deeds; and this is a pledge of the blessings yet hoped for; for He
who promised those things, and then fulfilled them, will altogether fulfil also
what He has now promised to us. And he bids us not only hope, <i>but abound in
hope</i>, that is, hope sincerely, and expect to behold the blessings that we
hope for; and this (confidence) he says <i>the grace of the spirit affords</i>.
Having thus recommended these things, and invoked a blessing on them, he goes
on to accord praise to them, by this leading them onward to yet greater
goodness; 14. <i>And I myself also am persuaded of you, brethren, that ye also
are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others</i>.
I know, says he, that ye need not instruction; for ye both possess sufficiently
ample <i>knowledge</i>, and abound in <i>good</i> of every kind, so as even to
extend to others also every fitting exhortation. 15. <i>Nevertheless, brethren,
I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind,
because of the grace that is given to me of God</i>. He displays at the same
time the modesty of his own mind in saying he <i>made bold to teach them</i>;
and exhibits this <i>grace given to him</i>, in teaching that he writes in
subservience to it. And what grace then is this given to thee? 16. <i>That I
should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel
of God</i>.&nbsp;
I have been appointed the teacher of the Gentiles,
this is the ministry I present to the Lord Christ; and what is the gain arising
from thence? <i>That the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being
sanctified by the Holy Ghost</i>. I readily undergo any labour that the
Gentiles may be established in the faith. I obtain the grace of the Spirit, for
by the <A NAME="p735"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|735</SPAN></A> <i>ministry</i> he means preaching, and by the <i>acceptable offering</i> a
sincere and genuine faith. I have done nothing then out of place,<A HREF="#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A> says he, if
I have at all written somewhat <i>more boldly</i>, and rebuked them that
offend. 17. <i>I have therefore whereof I may glory in Jesus Christ, in those
things which pertain to God</i>. And then he points out the character of that
glorying; 18. <i>For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which
Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed</i>.
19. <i>By the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God</i>.
My boasting is not in mine own labours, but in the gift bestowed on me by the
Lord Christ. For he has given me the grace of the thrice-holy Spirit, to the
working of signs and wonders; so that by these means the Gentiles have been
rescued unto life, and received the light of divine knowledge. And he shews
also to how large a portion of the Gentiles he had preached; <i>so that from
Jerusalem and in a circle unto Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of
Christ</i>. For I have tended not those nations lying in the direct line only,
but traversing also in a circle have fully supplied with the doctrines of the
gospel the eastern regions also, and those about Pontus, together with portions
of Asia and Thrace; for this is what the words <i>in a circle</i> indicate. 20.
<i>Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named,
lest I should build upon another man's foundation</i>, 21. <i>But as it is
written</i>, (Isa. lii. 15), <i>To whom He was not spoken of they shall see;
and they that have not heard shall understand</i>. This shews the diligent
earnestness of his zeal in labouring, in that taking in hand the fields that as
yet had been uncultivated, he ploughed them up, and sowed, and converted them
into fruitful corn fields, and brought its due fulfilment to the prophecy. 22. <i>For
which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you</i>. For my
engagement among these others has prevented my presence among yourselves. 23. <i>But
now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many
years to come unto you</i>, 24. <i>Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I
will come to you; for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my
way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company</i>. He
gives two reasons for his coming to them&#8212;that the rest had been preached unto,
no nation remaining among which the doctrines of the gospel had not been heard;
and his own love towards them. For the former hindrances having ceased, his
longing after them excited him to the journey; and he declares that this his
affection had been long antecedent to his actual coming, for for <i>these many
years</i>, says he, <i>have I earnestly desired to see you</i>; and he tells
them before-hand that he will not only see them, but <i>take in Spain</i> also;
and that they may not hence conceive that his visit to them was merely by the
way,<A HREF="#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A> he adds, and <i>by you to be brought on my way thitherward, if first I be
somewhat filled with your company</i>; for you are they whom I first wish to
see, and after you them. 25. <i>But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto
the saints</i>. By <i>ministering</i> he means the distribution of a pecuniary
collection; and he mentions also the senders thereof; 26. <i>For they of
Macedonia and Achaia have been benevolently</i> <A NAME="p736"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|736</SPAN></A>
<i>inclined to make a communication to the poor saints which are at
Jerusalem</i>. It was indeed under a previously-arranged agreement to this
effect with the blessed Apostles, Peter I mean, and James, and John, that the
divinely-appointed Barnabas and Paul undertook the teaching of the Gentiles,
promising to exhort the converts among the Gentiles to minister to the wants
of the faithful in Judaea; and this he clearly teaches in his epistle to the
Galatians (ii. 9, 10), for &quot;Peter,'' says he, &quot;and James, and John,
who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship,
that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision, only they
would that we should remember the poor, the same which I also was forward to
do.&quot; This it is he here also speaks of, praising the zeal of Macedonia and
Achaia; and this he calls both a <i>benevolence</i> and a <i>debt</i>; 27. <i>They
are benevolently inclined verily, and their debtors they are</i>; and whence
arose this debt? <i>For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their
spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things</i>.
To them, says he, appertained the Patriarchs as their forefathers; to them the
promises were made; their prophets it was who prophesied the blessings now
common to both; of them according to His human nature was the Lord Christ; of
them the Apostles the teachers of the whole world; through them have the gifts
of the Spirit been shed abroad; it is right then that they who have imparted
of the greater, should in return receive of the lesser; wherefore also he above
calls the contribution of money a <i>communication</i>, and again afterwards a <i>ministry</i>;
by the expression <i>communication</i> shewing it to be a repayment, and by
that of <i>ministry</i> a tribute due. 28. <i>When therefore I have performed
this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain</i>.
Having sealed <i>to them</i> this fruit, to the Macedonians and Achaians he
means; for I offer the things sent, to the right hand of God through the hands
of the saints, and it will keep them sale and uninjured.<A HREF="#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A> 29. <i>But I know
that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the
gospel of Christ</i>. By <i>the fulness</i> of the blessing of the gospel he
means, the dangers for the gospel's sake which he underwent at Jerusalem;<A HREF="#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A> as
what follows evinces, 30. <i>I beseech you, therefore, brethren, for the Lord
Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together
with me in your prayers to God for me</i>; 31. <i>That I may be delivered from
them which do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for
Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints</i>. With what praise worthy of it
could any crown this blessed, aye, thrice blessed, brow? For first he both knew
what would happen, and foretels it, for so he spoke to the elders of Ephesus at
Miletus, &quot;that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, that bonds and
afflictions await me&quot; (Acts xx. 2:5); and when Agabus also predicted the
same things, and all were weeping and endeavouring to detain him, the holy man
cried out, &quot;What, mean ye to weep and break mine heart? for I am ready not
to be bound only, but also to die for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;
(Acts xxi. 13); and here he predicted that he would <A NAME="p737"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|737</SPAN></A> see both the Romans and Spaniards; and he adds that he would even
come&quot;in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of
Christ.&quot; And then, as fully contemplating the madness of the Jews, he begs
also for their prayers not only as respected the disbelievers, but the
believers also; for neither were they affectionately disposed towards him,
because esteeming him a violator of the law;<A HREF="#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A> on which account he added, <i>and
that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints</i>.
With a thousand labours had he collected these offerings, using every argument
of exhortation with the disciples thereto, and yet he fears concerning those
who should receive them, lest their dislike to himself should have greater weight
with them than their own wants. 32. <i>That I may come unto you with joy by the
will of God, and may with you be refreshed</i>. Not even what is good does he
wish to obtain, unless it be in accordance with <i>the will of God</i>. 33. <i>Now
the God of peace be with you all, Amen.</i> Not without cause does he here
speak of God, as <i>the God of peace</i>; but both as himself needing it, by
reason at once of those that openly opposed him and those that regarded him
with suspicion; and as imploring it for them, on account of the differences
they had between themselves, respecting legal observances.</p>



<h3 align=center>Chapter <SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C16"></A>XVI.</SPAN>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>1. <i>I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, which is a servant of
the church which is at Cenchrea</i>, 2. <i>That ye receive her in the Lord as
becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need
of you, for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also</i>. 3. <i>Greet
Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus</i>. Cenchrea is a very large
village of Corinth. Well then may we admire the power of the gospel, in that in
so short a time it had filled with true godliness not the towns only but even
the villages also; and so great was the body of the church at Cenchrea, as to
have a woman acting as deaconess; <A HREF="#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A> and her a celebrated and illustrious
person; for so largely did she abound in good works as to have obtained praises
like the above from the tongue of an apostle; <i>for she has been a succourer</i>,
says he, <i>of many, and of myself also</i>, by <i>succour</i> meaning, as I
conceive, hospitality and kind attention. And he repays her with far greater
honours in return; for she, it seems, received him into one house, and for a
short time; that, it is plain, which he spent at Corinth; while he has opened
the whole world to her, and in every land and sea is that woman become celebrated,
so that not the Romans only and the Greeks have known her, but even every
barbarian nation. And yet she next mentioned has surpassed even her, for
Priscilla, or Prisca, for both names are to be found in the Bible, and Aquila,
he calls <i>fellow-helpers</i>; and he adds the <i>in Christ Jesus</i>, lest
any one should imagine that he alluded to a community of employment, seeing
that they also were tent-makers; <A NAME="p738"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|738</SPAN></A> and he mentions also another trial (undergone by them on his
account) of the greatest kind; 4. <i>Who have for my life laid down their own
necks</i>.<A HREF="#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A> And to his private he subjoins the public (debt to them) <i>unto
whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles</i>; and
he commemorates also another praiseworthy virtue on their part, for he salutes,
5. <i>Likewise the church that is in their house</i>. The expression shews the
greatness of their piety, for they instructed, it appears, all their household
in the highest virtue, and gladly performed within their walls all the sacred
rites of religion; <A HREF="#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A> and of these the holy Luke also takes notice, and shews
how they led Apollos to the truth. (Acts xviii. 20). <i>Salute my well-beloved
Epenetus, who is the first fruits of Achaia unto Christ</i>. For he was the
first, it seems, of the whole nation that believed, on which account it was
that he here receives the appellation of <i>the first fruits</i>. <i>Greet
Mary, who bestowed much labour on us</i>. Another woman, again, crowned for her
individual labours. 7. <i>Salute Andronicus and Junia my kinsmen, and my
fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the Apostles, who also were in Christ
before me</i>. Many at once are the encomia here; and first that they had been
partakers in the dangers of the holy Paul, for he calls them <i>fellow-prisoners</i>
as having shared with him in his sufferings; and next he says that they are <i>of
note</i>, not among the disciples, but the teachers; nor among ordinary
teachers, but the <i>Apostles</i>;<A HREF="#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A> and he extols them also on account of the
date of their faith, for he says, who were in Christ before me, for I myself
was called subsequently to them; and I (Theodoret) am every where amazed at
the humble-mindedness of the divine Apostle (lit. head.) 8. <i>Greet Amplias,
my beloved in the Lord</i>. Nor is this slight praise, for it is <i>in the Lord</i>
that he calls him beloved; and this is demonstrative of his excellences. 9. <i>Salute
Urbanus our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved</i>. With even yet greater
praises does he honour Urbanus, for he calls him a helper both in the
preaching, and in the labours and sufferings, for Christ's sake. 10. <i>Salute
Apelles proved in Christ</i>. A testimony of the highest virtue, for to have no
alloy of dross is the summit of excellences. 11. <i>Salute them which are of
Arislobulus's household, and Herodion my kinsman, and those of the household of
Narcissus</i>. It is evident that they were believing families; but of those of
Narcissus he says, <i>who are in the Lord</i>, as there being, forsooth, some
who had not yet become so. 12. <i>Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in
the Lord</i>. Again, from their labours come the crown; and that labour the
words shew to have been one either of hospitality or fasting, or other such
virtue. <i>Salute Persis the beloved which laboured much in the Lord</i>.
Ampler is her praise, for her zeal in labouring was ampler. 13. <i>Salute Rufus
chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine</i>. And most enviable also is this
encomium, for many are called but few chosen; <A HREF="#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A> and his mother he praises as
adorned <A NAME="p739"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|739</SPAN></A> with many noble acts of virtue, for not otherwise could she have
been deemed worthy of being called the mother of Paul; for of Rufus indeed
nature made her the mother, but of the holy Paul respect for her virtue. 14. <i>Salute
Asyncritus, Phlegon, Thermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with
them</i>. This was another society of the faithful worthy of Paul's greeting.
15. <i>Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympus, and
all the saints which are with them</i>. And these again living together, on
account of the virtue they possessed obtained the Apostle's salutation. Having
thus greeted these by name, he then bids them all salute each other, for, 16. <i>Salute
one another</i>, says he, <i>with an holy kiss</i>. For, as being absent he
could not himself salute<A HREF="#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A> them, he does it through them, enjoining them to
salute <i>one another</i>, and to salute with an holy kiss, chaste, modest,
sincere, and true, and void of all deceit. <i>All the churches of Christ salute
you</i>. From the whole world, so to speak, he salutes the Empress of the
world. 17. <i>Now I beseech you, brethren, to mark them which cause divisions
and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them</i>.
He alludes in these words to the evil advocates of the law, whose precepts he
bids them to avoid, while praising the teaching of the chief of the Apostles;
for the expression causing such <i>contrary to the doctrine which ye have
learned</i> is that of one who greatly admires the doctrine they had already
obtained. 18. <i>For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but
their own belly</i>. And from hence it is plain that it is of the Jews that he
is thus speaking, for he is perpetually condemning their gluttony, and so 
elsewhere he says, &quot;whose God is their belly.&quot;<A HREF="#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A> <i>And by good words
and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple</i>. By fair speeches he
means praise (flattery); and he hints that some had already been seduced by
them, for they <i>deceive</i>, says he, <i>the hearts of the simple</i>; not
depravity of disposition indeed, but <i>simplicity</i> does he allege as the
cause. And then again he excites them with praises, 19. <i>For your obedience
is come abroad unto all men</i>, that you gladly received the apostolic 
doctrines.<A HREF="#49"><SUP>49</SUP></A></p>

<p><i>I am glad therefore</i>, says he, <i>on your behalf</i>;
and yet while praising he still continues to instruct, <i>but yet I would have
you wise unto that which is good, and harmless concerning evil</i>. And this
rule also the Lord gave to the Apostles, saying, &quot;Be ye wise as serpents
and harmless as doves.&quot; <A NAME="p740"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|740</SPAN></A> And this saying of our Lord signifies, that we
are to put away from us the snares brought in by our enemies, and least of all
to revenge ourselves on those that injure us. 20. <i>And the God of
peace shall bruise Satan under your
feet shortly.</i> Since he had commanded them
to be on their guard against their enemies, most opportunely does he beseech
God to confound the teacher of all snares, and cast him beneath the feet of the
believers. <i>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</i> Having pointed out the enemy, he next points out
the Helper, for they that have obtained the divine grace possess that which is
invincible. 21. <i>Timotheus my work-fellow, and Lucius and
Jason, and Sosipater my kinsmen salute you.</i> The first has the glory of a participation in works, the others
relationship; but the fellow-worker is far more honourable than the relation;
and this is the same Timothy whom in Lystra he circumcised (Acts xvi. 3), and
to whom he wrote those two epistles. And of Jason also the history of the Acts
makes mention (ch. xvii.) 22. <i>I Tertius, who wrote this epistle,
salute you in the Lord.</i> And he also was
one of those who had been thought worthy to enjoy the instructions of the Apostle,
wherefore receiving the outpourings of his holy spirit through the tongue he
was commanded to commit them to paper. 23.<i>Gaius mine host, and of the whole
church, saluteth you.</i> And this also is the
greatest testimony of praise, to have opened one's house to the nurselings of the faith, and together
with all others to have ministered even to the very teachers of the whole
world; for by <i>host </i>he means
entertainer.<A HREF="#50"><SUP>50</SUP></A> And he was a Corinthian, as the holy Apostle also teaches us in
his epistle to the Corinthians, &quot;I thank my God,&quot; says he, &quot;that
I baptized none of you but Crispus and Gaius.&quot; (ch. i. 14). <i>Erastus
the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.</i> He calls him not the <i>treasurer</i> of the church, but <i>of the city,</i> as one fully entrusted with some charge; and he
makes mention of him who in the epistle to Timothy, thus speaking, (2 Ep. iv.
20), &quot;Erastus abode at Corinth, but Trophimus have I left at Miletum
sick.&quot; 21. <i>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all,
Amen. </i>Again he imparts to them the
spiritual benediction, and surrounds them with the grace of the Lord as with a
wall of adamant, for this he made the beginning of his epistle, and this he
places as its end. In this grace let us also become partakers, that we may rise
superior to all snares; that by it enlightened we may without turning aside
tread the strait road, and following in the Apostolic footsteps be deemed
worthy to behold the teacher himself, and by his means <A HREF="#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A> enjoy the favour of
the Lord, and obtain the promised blessing, through the grace and loving-kindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ; with whom, to the Father, together with the
thrice-holy Spirit, belong glory and majesty, now and ever, and unto endless
ages. Amen.</p>
