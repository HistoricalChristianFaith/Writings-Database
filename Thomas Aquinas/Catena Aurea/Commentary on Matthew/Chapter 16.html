  . As the Lord sent the multitudes away after the miracle of the five
        loaves, so also now, not on foot, but by boat, that the multitudes may not follow Him; And he sent away the

  . This Magedan is the country opposite Gerasa, and is interpreted ‘fruits,’ or
        ‘a messenger.’ It signifies a garden, of which it is said, A garden enclosed, a fountain sealed, (Song of Sol.
        4:12.) wherein the fruits of virtues grow, and where the name of the Lord is announced. It teaches us that
        preachers having ministered the word to the multitude ought to be refreshed themselves with the fruits of the
        virtues within the chamber of their own heart. It follows; And there come unto him Pharisees and Sadducees
        tempting him, and desired him to shew them a sign from heaven.

  . Wondrous blindness of the Pharisees and Sadducees! They asked a sign from
        heaven, as though the things they now saw were not signs. John shews what sign it was they desired; for he
        relates, that after the feeding with the five loaves, the multitudes came to the Lord and said, What sign doest
        thou, that we may see it and believe on thee? Our fathers did eat manna in the desert, as it is written, He gave
        them bread to eat from heaven. (John 6:30.) Therefore when they say here, Shew us a sign from heaven, they mean,
        Cause that it rain manna for one or two days, that the whole people may eat, as was done for a long time in the
        desert. He looking into their thoughts as God, and knowing that even if a sign from heaven should be shewed them
        they would not believe, would not give them the sign for which they asked, as it follows, But he answered and
        said unto them, When the evening is come, ye say, It will be fair weather; for the sky is red, &amp;c.

  . This is not found in most copies of the Greek textp. But the sense is clear,
        that fair and rainy days may be foretold by the condition and harmony of the elements. But the Scribes and
        Pharisees who seemed to be doctors of the Law could not discern the Saviour’s coming by the predictions of the
        Prophets.

  . (Quæst. Ev. i. 20.) We might also understand this saying, When it is
        evening, ye say, It mill be fair weather, for the sky is red, in this way, By the blood of Christ’s passion at
        His first coming, indulgence of sin is given. And in the morning, It will be foul weather to-day, for the sky is
        red and lowring; that is, at His second coming He will come with fire before Him.

  . Otherwise; The sky is red and lowring; that is, the Apostles suffer after the
        resurrection, by which ye may know that I shall judge hereafter; for if I spare not the good who are mine from
        present suffering, I shall not spare others hereafter; Ye can therefore discern the face of the sky, but the
        signs of the times ye cannot.

  . The signs of the times He means of His own coming, or passion, to which the
        evening redness of the heavens may be likened; and the tribulation which shall be before His coming, to which
        the morning redness with the lowring sky may be compared.

  . As then in the sky there is one sign of fair weather, and another of
        rain, so ought ye to think concerning me; now, in this My first coming, there is need of these signs which are
        done in the earth; but those which are done in heaven are reserved for the time of the second coming. Now I come
        as a physician, then as a judge; now I come in secret, then with much pomp, when the powers of the heavens shall
        be shaken. But now is not the time of these signs, now have I come to die, and to suffer humiliations; as it
        follows, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be given it, but the
        sign of Jonas the prophet.

  . (ubi sup.) This Matthew has already given; whence we may store up for our
        information, that the Lord spoke the same things many times, that where there are contradictions which cannot be
        explained, it may be understood that the same sayings were uttered on two different occasions.

        heaven, such as they sought for, though many signs are given on the earth; but only to the generation of such as

  . Herein the Apostles are admonished not to be partakers in the doctrine of the
        Jews; for the works of the Law were established to produce faith, and to prefigure the things that were to
        follow; and they on whose times truth itself had chanced should look for no further types of truth; lest the
        teaching of the Pharisees, which knew not of Christ, should stay the effect of Gospel truth.

  . For he that takes heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, does
        not observe the precepts of the Law and of the letter, and neglects the traditions of men that he may do the
        commandments of God. This is the leaven of which the Apostle speaks, A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
        (1 Cor. 5:6.) By every means also we should avoid that leaven which Marcion, Valentinus, and all the heretics
        had. For the nature of leaven is such, that when mixed with flour, that which seemed a little increases to a
        large quantity, and brings the whole mixture to its own flavour. Thus heretical doctrine if it have cast but a
        small spark into your breast, in a short time a mighty flame is raised, and drives the whole temper of the man
        along with it.

  . Why did He not say plainly, Take heed of the doctrine of the Pharisees?
        Because He would remind them of those things that had been done in the multiplication of the loaves, knowing
        them to be forgetful. To have given them this charge at once bluntly would have seemed unreasonable; but to find
        fault with them on occasion furnished by themselves prepared the way for the charge; therefore it is that the
        Evangelist brings forward their thoughts; But they thought within themselves, saying, It is because we have
        taken no bread.

        they entered into the boat, and came into the parts of Magedan? There they hear that they ought to take heed of

        did He not reprove them, when they said, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness? for that seemed
        a more fitting occasion. He did not blame them at that time that He might not seem to be by that urged on to do
        miracles, and He was unwilling to find fault with them before the people. Also there was more reason in the
        charge, when after two miracles of multiplication of loaves, they had anxiety about food. Observe with what
        mildness He rebukes them; He makes an excuse in answer Himself, saying, Do ye not yet understand, nor remember

        and the seven loaves, the five thousand and the four thousand, who were fed in the desert. For if the leaven of
        the Pharisees and Sadducees signified not earthly food, but corrupt traditions and heretical dogmas, why should
        not the food with which the people of God is nourished signify the true and uncorrupt doctrine?

        disciples, and how it roused their sluggish spirit, hear what says the Evangelist; Then they understood how that
        he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and the Sadducees; yet He
        had not interpreted this to them. This instruction of the Lord them drew them away from Jewish observances, and
        made them attentive instead of careless, and raised them out of their little faith, that whenever they should
        seem to have but little provision of bread they should have no fear about food, but should despise all those
        things.

        men’s opinion respecting Himself, we are not to think that He made confession of Himself; for that which He
        asked for was something concealed, to which the faith of believers ought to extend itself. We must hold that
        form of confession, that we so mention the Son of God as not to forget the Son of Man, for the one without the

        and blood could not reveal, was revealed by the grace of the Holy Spirit. By his confession then he obtains a
        title, which should signify that he had received a revelation from the Holy Spirit, whose son he shall also be
        called; for Barjonas in our tongue signifies The son of a dove. Others take it in the simple sense, that Peter
        is the son of Johnq, according to that question in another place, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? (John

        the Christ is less than to know Him; and so suppose that when they were sent to preach they believed that Jesus
        was the Christ, and afterwards as they made progress they knew Him to be so. Or must we answer thus; That then
        the Apostles had the beginnings of a knowledge of Christ, and knew some little concerning Him; and that they
        made progress afterwards in the knowledge of Him, so that they were able to receive the knowledge of Christ
        revealed by the Father, as Peter, who is here blessed, not only for that he says, Thou art the Christ, but much

        born of the Father, there had been no need of revelation; nor would he have been worthy of this blessing for
        confessing Christ to be one of many adopted sons; for before this they who were with Him in the ship had said,
        Truly thou art the Son of God. (John 1:49.) Nathanael also said, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God. Yet were not
        these blessed because they did not confess such sonship as does Peter here, but thought Him one among many, not
        in the true sense a son; or, if chief above all, yet not the substance of the Father. But see how the Father
        reveals the Son, and the Son the Father; from none other comes it to confess the Son than of the Father, and
        from none other to confess the Father than of the Son; so that from this place even it is manifest that the Son
        is of the same substance, and to be worshipped together with the Father. Christ then proceeds to shew that many

        which they saw so shewn as this representation in words shewed to the disciples the mystery of the passion and
        resurrection of Christ. At that time, indeed, He only began to shew them, and afterwards when they were more
        able to receive it, He shewed them more fully; for all that Jesus began to do, that He accomplished. He must
        needs go to Jerusalem, to be put to death indeed in the Jerusalem which is below, but to rise again and reign in
        the heavenly Jerusalem. But when Christ rose again, and others were risen with Him, they no longer sought the

        the elders of the earthly Jerusalem, that He may be glorified by those heavenly elders who receive His mercies.

        as is commonly thought, the same; to Peter it is said, Get thee behind me, Satan; that is, follow me, thou that
        art contrary to my will; to the Devil it is said, Go thy way, Satan, understanding not ‘behind me,’ but ‘into
        everlasting fire.’ He said therefore to Peter, Get thee behind me, as to one who through ignorance was ceasing
        to walk after Christ. And He called him Satan, as one, who through ignorance had somewhat contrary to God. But
        he is blessed to whom Christ turns, even though He turn in order to rebuke him. But why said He to Peter, Thou
        art an offence unto me, (Ps. 119:165.) when in the Psalm it is said, Great peace have they that love thy law,
        and there is no offence to them? It must be answered, that not only is Jesus not offended, but neither is any
        man who is perfect in the love of God; and yet he who does or speaks any thing of the nature of an offence, may
        be an offence even to one who is incapable of being offended. Or he may hold every disciple that sinneth as an
        offence, as Paul speaks, Who is offended, and I burn not?. (2 Cor. 11:29.)

  . (Hom. lv.) Peter had said, Be it far from thee, Lord, this shall not be
        unto thee; and had been answered, Get thee behind me, Satan; but the Lord was not satisfied with this rebuke,
        but over and above desired to shew the impropriety of those things which Peter had said, and the fruit of His
        own passion; whence it is added, Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man will to come after me, let him
        deny
  <span>
   himself, and take up his cross, and follow me; as much as to say, You say unto me, Be it far
            from thee; but I say unto you, that not only is it harmful for you to hinder Me from My Passion, but
            yourself will not be able to be saved unless you suffer and die, and renounce your life always. And note,
            that He does not speak of it as compulsory, for He does not say, Though ye will not yet must ye suffer this,
            but, If any man will. By saying this He rather attracted them; for he who leaves his auditor at liberty,
            attracts him the more; whereas he that uses violence oftentimes hinders him. And He proposes this doctrine,
            not to His disciples only, but in common to the whole world, saying, If any man will, that is, if woman, if
            man, if king, if free, if slave; there are three things mentioned; let him deny himself, take up his cross,
            and follow me.

        draw near to Him who is above him. But if we leave ourselves, whither shall we go out of ourselves? Or if we
        have forsaken ourselves, who is it then that goes? Indeed, we are one thing when fallen by sin, another thing as
        we were made by nature. It is therefore then that we leave and deny ourselves, when we avoid that which we were
        of old, and strive towards that to which we are called in newness.

        is he would have us deny our body, and whether it be beaten or afflicted in any other way, not to spare it. For
        this is to spare. So parents do then most spare their children when they hand them over to tutors, bidding them
        not to spare them. And that you should not think that this denial of self extends only to words or affronts, he
        shews to what degree we should deny ourselves, namely, to death the most shameful, even that of the cross; this

        virtues are beset with faults, we must declare that vainglory sometimes attends abstinence of flesh, for the
        emaciated body and pale countenance betray this high virtue to the praise of the world. Compassion again is
        sometimes attended by a false affection, which is hereby led to be consenting unto sin; to shut out these, He

        life spares his life, fearing to die, and supposing that his life is ended with this death; he seeking in this
        way to save his life, shall lose it, estranging it from life eternal. But if any, despising the present life,
        shall contend for the truth unto death, he shall lose his life as far as this present life is concerned, but
        forasmuch as he loses it for Christ, he shall the more save it for life eternal. Otherwise thus; if any
        understand what is true salvation, and desire to obtain it for the salvation of his own life, he by denying
        himself loses his life as to the enjoyments of the flesh, but saves it by works of piety. He shews by saying.
        For he that will, that this passage must be connected in sense with that which went before. If then we
        understand the first, Let him deny himself, of the death of the body, we must take this that follows of death
        only; but if we understand the first of mortifying the propensities of the flesh, then, to lose his life,
        signifies to give up carnal pleasures.

        shall save, opposing saving to losing, that none should hence conclude that there was any equality between the
        losing on one side, and the saving on the other, He adds, What does it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole
        world, but suffer the loss of his soul? As though He had said, Say not that he who escapes the dangers which
        threaten him for Christ’s sake, saves his soul, that is, his temporal life; but add to his temporal life the
        whole world, and what of all these things will profit a man if his soul perishes for ever? Suppose you should
        see all your servants in joy, and yourself placed in the greatest evils, what profit would you reap from being

        in His commands; in time of persecution the life is to be laid down; but in time of peace, those earthly lusts

  . Morally; To those who are nearly brought to the faith, the Word of God wears
        the form of a servant; but to those that are perfect, He comes in the glory of the Father. His angels are the
        words of the Prophets, which it is not possible to comprehend spiritually, until the word of Christ has been
        first spiritually comprehended, and then will their words be seen in like majesty with His. Then will He give of
        His own glory to every man according to his deeds; for the better each man is in his deeds, so much the more
        spiritually does he understand Christ and His Prophets. They that stand where Jesus stands, are they that have
        the foundations of their souls rested upon Jesus; of whom such as stood firmest are said not to taste death till
        they see the Word of God; which comes in His kingdom when they see that excellence of God which they cannot see
        while they are involved in divers sins, which is to taste death, forasmuch as the soul that sinneth, dies. For
        as life, and the living bread, is He that came down from heaven, so His enemy death is the bread of death. And
        of these breads there are some that eat but a little, just tasting them, while some eat more abundantly. They
        that sin neither often, nor greatly, these only taste death; they that have partaken more perfectly of spiritual
        virtue do not taste it only, but feed ever on the living bread. That He says, Until they see, does not fix any
        time at which shall be done what had not been done before, but mentions just what is necessary; for he that once
        sees Him in His glory, shall after that by no means taste death.
