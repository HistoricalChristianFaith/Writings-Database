<a name="1"></a>1. p. 429 n.1&nbsp; The
Books of
the Maccabees
are most useful
in explaining the difficulties which arise in the interpretation of chapters 7th, 8th, and 11th of

Daniel, and especially that part which refers to the 'little horn,' (Dan.
vii. 8,) by which the sanctuary was profaned. This 'horn' was Antiochus, whose evil deeds, alluded to by Daniel, are so clearly described in

the 1st and 2nd Books of the Maccabees, that the very time and the numher
of
the days mentioned by Daniel are found to coincide with the facts
of history.

<p><a name="2"></a>2. p. 430 n. 1&nbsp; See the Life of Eusebius prefixed to Bohn's
edition
of his Ecclesiastical History, pp. xxv. and xxvi. The following is the estimate of his character as given by
Fleury. 'Though the doctrine of Eusebius of Caesarea might be excused, it is hard to justify his conduct. He is marked from the beginning among the bishops who took
Arius under their protection against Alexander of Alexandria. In his Ecclesiastical History he does not say a word of this famous dispute (the Arian controversy); and that it may not be said that he ended his History where it began, he speaks nothing plainly of it in his Life of Constantine, saying only in general terms, that there was a division in the church, principally in Egypt, without ever explaining the cause of it; and it might seem, according to him, that in the council of
Nicaea no other important question was treated
of
than that of Easter. In relating the laws of Constantine against heretics, he makes no mention of that which condemned the writings of
Arius
to
be burnt. Speaking of the council of Tyre, he says not a word of the process of St.
Athanasius, who was the subject of it. This affected silence gives better
authority to those among the ancients who have accused him of Arianism, than to those who would justify him from it. Acacius also, his disciple and successor in the see of
Caesarea, became afterwards one of the chiefs of the Arians.' Fleury, Eccl.
Hist. b. xii. ch. 6.

<p><a name="4"></a>4. p. 431 n. 2&nbsp; The learned Gothofred is of opinion that 'Baucalis'
was not the
name of the presbyter, but that he
was
named
Arius, and attached to a
church in Alexandria called Baucalis. He is not mentioned by
any
other
writer.

</p>
<p><a name="6"></a>6. p. 431 n. 4&nbsp; Fleury states that
Arius was not only a priest, but had
also charge of the church called Baucalis at Alexandria. He had aimed
at
the
episcopal
dignity, and could not bear that Alexander should be preferred before him. Finding nothing that he could blame in Alexander's conduct,
Arius
sought to cavil at his doctrine, and the following opportunity occurred.

Alexander, speaking of the Holy Trinity in the presence of the priests and
others of the clergy, maintained that there was a Unity in the Trinity. Arius pretended that this assertion was
an
introduction of the heresy of Sabellius, and ran into the contrary extreme; for disputing with too much wrath, he said that if the Father begot the Son, he who was begotten must have had a beginning of his being;
from
which it follows that there was a
time when
the Son was not, and consequently that he is derived from
nothing. He added that the Son of God is God's creature and work,
capable of virtue and vice by his own free will, with some other consequences of the erroneous principles which he laid down. This doctrine was new and unheard of till then. On the other side, Alexander taught with the whole church that the Son of God is the same in dignity and substance with the Father. (Book
x. chap. 28.)

<p><font class="f18"><a name="10"></a>10. p. 432 n. 3&nbsp; </font>As his force was smaller than that of
Maxentius, he thought that he required sonic superior assistance, and considered to what deity
he should address himself. He reflected that the emperors who in his tithe were zealous for idolatry had perished miserably, and that his father Constantius, who during his life had reverenced the only Supreme God, had received visible tokens of his protection. He therefore
determined to adhere to this great God, and instantly began to beseech him to stretch his favourable hand over him. The emperor Constantine prayed
this with the greatest earnestness, when about noon, the sun beginning to decline, as he traversed the country with some of his forces, he saw in the sky above the sun a cross of light, with an inscription to this effect, 'By
this thou shalt conquer.'

Constantine's thoughts were employed the rest of the day on this miracle, considering what could be the meaning of it. At night, while he was asleep, Jesus Christ appeared to him with
the same sign that lie had seen in the sky, and ordered him to make a representation of
it, and to make use of it in battle against his enemies  This was the fashion of it, a long pole
like a pike, covered with gold, traversed by another in the form of a cross: at
the upper end there was fastened a garland of gold and precious stones, enclosing the symbol of the name
of
Christ, namely the two first letters of the word in Greek, viz. X
and P. On the cross stick hung a small square standard of very rich stuff, being

purple and gold tissue set <FONT CLASS=f26>
with
jewels. On the top of these colours
below the sacred monogram were the images of the emnperor and his two </FONT><font class="f19">sons </font>wrought in gold. The form of the standard was not new, but it
was called by the new name of Labarum. The emperor caused banners of the same fashion to be made for all his troops, and he himself wore
upon his helmet the cross, or rather the monogram of the word Christ: his soldiers wore it on their shields, and the coins and medals of Christian emperors are full of it.

Concerning Urphilas, or Ulphilas, as others call this bishop of the
Goths, and the
conversion of the Goths to
the Christian faith, see Socrates, Eccl. Hist. b. iv. ch.
34; Sozomen, Eccl. Hist. b. vi. ch.
37; Theodoret, Eccl. Hist. b. iv. ch. 37.
</p>
<p><a name="20"></a>20. p. 436 n. 1&nbsp; <FONT CLASS=f26>This is not to be wondered at, considering that
Urphilas adopted the
Arian heresy.
<FONT CLASS=f26>
'Being arrived at
Constantinople on this embassy,' (is</FONT>Fleury,) 'he conferred with the chiefs of the Arians;
and
whether he </FONT>hoped to succeed in his negotiation by their credit,
or whether he was really convinced by their persuasions, he came over to them; and
this was the reason why the Goths likewise fell into Arianism, and afterwards spread it all over
the East. Till this time they had followed the apostolical doctrine which they had at first received, amid even at that time
they did not wholly forsake it. For they by whom they were seduced persuaded them that
the dispute between the Catholics
and
the Arians </FONT><font class="f9">was</font><FONT CLASS=f9>
only about words which did not alter the fundamental points of doctrine. Thus, in the
time of Theodoret, (Eccl. Hist. b. iv. ch. 37,) the Goths did indeed confess that
the Father was greater than the Son; still, however, they
did
not say that the Son was a creature, although they communicated with those that said so The Gospel is still extant, as
translated into their language by Urphilas.' Fleury, Eccl. Hist. b.
xvii. ch. 36.

Eccl. Hist. b. i. ch. 23.
</p>
<p><a name="22"></a>22. p. 437 n. 2&nbsp; Philostorgius always calls him by this name. St. Gregory of Nyssa, on the other hand, calls him a
Blemmyan.. It is suggested, however, by Talesius, that this name may be but another name for the Moors or
Aethiopians. Some think that lie was called the 'Indian,' not because he was born
there, or even of Indian extraction, but because he was sent by Constantine as ambassador to the Indians or
Aethiopians.</p>
<p><a name="23"></a>23. p. 437 n. 3&nbsp; This is certainly true of
Theophilus; he was consecrated a bishop by the Arian party, who ascribed to him the gift of miracles. See below,

<p><FONT CLASS=f26><a name="37"></a>37. p. 442 n. 1&nbsp; Photius does well in censuring
Philostorgius for this assertion, which, it need hardly be added, is a gross falsehood; for it is forbidden by
the Christian religion to offer sacrifice to any created being, and much more to
the statue of one. It is probable however, as Valesius observes, and as asserted by&nbsp;
Theodoret, (Eccl. Hist. b. i. ch.
34,)
<FONT CLASS=f26>
that lamps and wax candles were lit before the statue, and that prayers were offered there

Suidas concerning Auxentius, at the end
of
this volume. We may observe that this step of the Arian party was taken out of opposition to
Athanasius and his friends, for the latter had recently sent Frumentius as bishop to the
Auxumitae, as Socrates, Sozomen, and Rufinus testify. The Arians took care also to engage
the secular power on their own side, by obtaining from the emperor letters to the chiefs of the
Auxumitae, urging the expulsion of Frumentius from their country, as
we
learn from Athanasius in his Apology.

about A. D. 337, and soon after sent among them. See above note on

Cone.) is, that upon the death of his father in a staff of insolvency, he became slave to a woman; and having recovered his liberty, by what means is not known, he applied himself to the trade of a common tinker, and gained his livelihood by mending brass vessels. He adds that on one occasion he was punished by the magistrates for giving back a bracelet or collar of brass gilded over to a lady who had intrusted to him a gold one to mend. Being obliged on oath to renounce his trade for this deceit, he put himself under an empiric named Sopolus, and having found an Armenian simple enough to believe him to be really skilful, he got from him abundance of money, with which he set up as a physician. He is said afterwards to have composed 300 Syllogisms against the doctrine of the Holy Trinity. See Fleury, Eccl. Hist. b. xii. ch. 47.

<a name="61"></a>61. <sup>p.455 n.1</sup> This Paulinus is mentioned by Eusebius, Eccl. Hist. b. x. ch. 1. The reader will do well to consult the valuable annotations of Valesius on the passage. This Paulinus, who was afterwards translated from Tyre to Antioch, is to be carefully distinguished from another Paulinus, bishop of the same see after the death of Philogonius, a little previous to the council of Nicaea, of whom Valesius gives a lengthened detail in his Annotations to Sozomen. The learned Cave, however, denies that the former Paulinus was ever bishop of Antioch, and asserts that the passage cited by Valesius from the tenth book of Eusebius, need be understood to imply that he was ever bishop of Antioch; and if so, the fact rests on the authority of Philostorgius alone.

But when peace was restored, after the death of Julian, they transmitted their letter to Eudoxius and the other bishops, but took no pains to carry matters into effect. Accordingly Aetius and Eunomius, who happened to be at Constantinople at the time, perceiving the indolence of Euzoius, sent Theophilus the Indian to Antioch with the special design of urging Eudoxius to help matters forward, and to put the sentence of the synod into execution; or, if not, of engaging him as leader of Aetius's faction there.

<SUP>2</SUP> This date is confirmed by the testimony of Ammianus Marcellinus. Valentinian the younger, then, was born A. D. 371. This Valentinian, son of the elder Valentinian, is not to be confounded with another Valentinian, the son of Valens.

<SUP>1</SUP> Philostorgius is mistaken here. Theodosius was proclaimed emperor at Sirmium, but it was in Macedonia that he met and routed the Goths after his promotion to the purple. Philostorgius is right in asserting that he was already emperor at the time that he gained this victory; though the contrary is asserted by Theodoret, Eccl. Hist. b. v. ch. 5. Having put the barbarians to flight, Theodosius came to Constantinople, and immediately restored the churches to the orthodox party, towards the close of the year A. D.<I> </I>380. <I>Gothofred.</I>

<SUP>2</SUP> See Fleury's Eccl. Hist. b. xvii. ch. 23. He published an edict in favour of the Arians in the following terms : &quot;We give leave to all those to assemble whose opinions are conformable to the exposition of faith which was subscribed to under Constantius in the council of Rimini by the bishops of the whole Roman empire assembled, even by those who are now against it, and which was confirmed at Constantinople. Those, likewise, shall be at liberty to assemble to whom we have given leave, that is to say, the Catholics: but let them know that if they cause any disturbance in opposition to our statute, they shall be punished with death as authors of sedition, disturbers of the peace of the church, and as guilty of high treason. Those, likewise, shall be subject to the same punishment, who attempt openly or in private to make any resistance against this present decree.'' Fleury, Eccl. Hist. b. xviii. ch. 43. It would seem that the young emperor was deservedly popular : he is said to have been beloved by all men, and to have profited much by the instruction and example of Theodosius. He had a complete mastery over his passions and appetites, young as he was; and no one, during his reign, was in fear of false accusation or unjust trials. He died beloved by the Romans and respected by the barbarians.
