<blockquote>
  <p><b>I. THE LIFE OF GREGORY OF NYSSA</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>READERS to whom the subject is unfamiliar, should be quite clear in their
minds from the outset as to the distinction between the three Gregories who
played an important part in the Church history of Asia Minor.</p>
<p>(1) <i>Gregory Thaumaturgus (i. e. </i>&quot;Worker of Wonders&quot;).<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A></p>
<p>He was born of heathen parents at Neo-Caesarea in Pontus ; having gone to
Palestine for his education, he came under the influence of Origen, then living
at Caesarea, and was converted to Christianity. He became bishop of his native
city in 240, and carried out the work of evangelising the district most
thoroughly. Basil, brother of Gregory of <A NAME="p6"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|6</SPAN></A>
Nyssa, was brought up on the family estate at Annesi, near Neo-Caesarea, by his
grandmother Macrina, who used to repeat to him the very words used by Gregory
Thaumaturgus.<sup><A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> </sup>Gregory of Nyssa wrote the
life of Gregory Thaumaturgus, and to the latter's influence may be ascribed the
strong element of Origenism in his writings. Through the same channel Origen's
teaching reached Basil and Gregory of Nazianzus, who during their stay at their
monastery in Pontus compiled the <i>Philocalia, </i>or collection of choice
passages from Origen.</p>
<p>(2) <i>Gregory of Nazianzus </i>was the friend and contemporary of Basil at
the University of Athens, in the pioneer monastery in Pontus, and later on as
brother bishop. Soon after Basil became bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia in 370
he forced his friend to accept the see of Sasima, a dusty village where the post
changed horses. In 379 he went to Constantinople as orthodox bishop; his sermons
preached there have become famous. He died about 390. <A NAME="p7"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|7</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) <i>Gregory of Nyssa </i>was the younger brother of Basil and author of
the present book. A brief sketch of his life must now be given.</p>
<p>He came of a race of landed proprietors, who had estates in Cappadocia and
Pontus and had won honourable distinction by their steadfast devotion to the
faith under persecution. His parents, Basil and Emmelia, had ten children, of
whom four sons and five daughters survived infancy. The eldest child, Macrina,
is the subject of this biography; the other four daughters all made satisfactory
marriages. St. Basil the Great was the eldest son. Next to him came Naucratius,
who was killed on a hunting expedition in Pontus. Gregory and Peter, the two
youngest sons, became bishops eventually of Nyssa and Sebaste. It would be
difficult to find in the whole of Church history a family so uniformly
brilliant.</p>
<p>Gregory was born about 335, probably at Caesarea. Apparently he showed no
special promise as a boy, nor did he share Basil's educational advantages. See
p. 51 of <A NAME="p8"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|8</SPAN></A> this book, where Macrina,
speaking of his fame, says: &quot;You that have little or no equipment within
yourself for such success.&quot; His first serious religious impressions seem to
have dated from a service at the chapel of the Forty Martyrs. As he slept in an
arbour near the chapel he dreamed that the martyrs beat him with rods. When he
awoke, he was filled with remorse, and soon afterwards became a Reader. But
presently, much to the disgust of Gregory of Nazianzus, he deserted his post in
order to become a professor of rhetoric.<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A></p>
<p>About this time he married a lady named Theosebeia, if this is the true
interpretation of some difficult passages. But his growing seriousness, and the
example of his brothers and sister, led him before long to espouse the ascetic
life and become a member of the monastery in Pontus, where he spent some quiet
and studious years. Indeed, he was by nature far better fitted to be a student
than a man of affairs. A striking example of the <A NAME="p9"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|9</SPAN></A>
simplicity of his character is afforded by the methods he adopted in order to
heal a quarrel between his brother Basil and their uncle Gregory. He actually
forged a letter purporting to come from the latter and asking for a
reconciliation. In Basil's 58th Epistle may be read the crushing rebuke
administered by the elder brother.</p>
<p>In 370 Basil had become bishop and metropolitan of Caesarea. He found the
post one of great difficulty, especially in view of the opposition of some of
his suffragans. In 372, wishing to strengthen his position by surrounding
himself with men whom he could trust, he forced his friend Gregory to accept the
bishopric of Sasima, and his brother that of Nyssa. We need not recount in
detail the troubles that pursued Gregory during his episcopate. He was deposed
and banished in 376, but was recalled on the death of the Emperor Valens in 378.</p>
<p>On January 1, 379, Basil died; in September of the same year Gregory attended
a Council at Antioch, after which he determined to visit his sister Macrina in
the monastery at Annesi. <A NAME="p10"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|10</SPAN></A> The visit
is described at length in the present book. When the funeral ceremonies were
over, he returned to his diocese, only to find a sad state of confusion. Having
introduced a certain measure of order, he set out on his travels once more, and
visited Babylon with a view of reforming the Church there. After this he went to
the holy places of Palestine, where nothing but disillusionment awaited him. In
381 he was present at the Council of Constantinople, and on several subsequent
occasions we find him at that city. His death occurred about 395.</p>
<p>Gregory of Nyssa is a figure of great importance in the history of Christian
doctrine and the eventual triumph of Nicene orthodoxy. For a sketch of his
doctrinal system the reader is referred to J. H. Srawley's edition <i>of The
Catechetical Oration, </i>uniform with the present volume.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>II. THE LIFE OF ST. MACRINA</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gregory's account of his sister's life is couched in the form of a letter
addressed to <A NAME="p11"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|11</SPAN></A> the monk Olympius, who
had been with him at the Council of Antioch.</p>
<p>There is as yet no critical edition of this part of Gregory's works, and it
has been necessary to use the text given in Migne's <i>Patrologia Graeca, </i>XLVI,
pp. 960 ff.<A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A></p>
<p>The absence of a good text is a serious drawback in a theological treatise
where much depends on niceties of language, but in the present case the
narrative is so straightforward that no special inconvenience arises. With very
few exceptions there is little margin for doubt as to the meaning of the Greek.
To reproduce it satisfactorily in English is another matter. In the opening
pages of his letter Gregory indulges his well-known rhetorical tendency so
freely that it is difficult to find suitable equivalents in English for all the
synonyms which he employs. Accordingly in a few places a synonym that adds
nothing to the sense has been omitted in the present translation. Occasionally a
sentence has been <A NAME="p12"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|12</SPAN></A> recast with some
freedom, in order to make a readable narrative for the English reader.</p>
<p>But when Gregory gets to grips with his subject and describes his arrival at
the monastery, the narrative becomes so clear and straightforward as to present
no difficulties to the translator. A literal version of the artless and
beautiful tale is all that is needed. That Gregory's style should undergo so
remarkable a transformation at this point is a convincing proof that he is
giving a true account of actual facts, written down shortly after their
occurrence.</p>
<p>It is surprising that a story of antiquity, so charmingly told and full of
human interest, should have attracted so little attention. Hitherto it has not
been accessible to any but scholars. The Latin version in Migne is a useful
guide to the meaning of the Greek, but cannot be relied on, as in places it is
merely a paraphrase. Had the story been written in the Greek of the fourth
century B.C. instead of that of the fourth century A.D., it would probably have
been one of the world's classics. <A NAME="p13"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|13</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No attempt has been made to break up the matter into numbered sections; this
will be the task of a future critical editor. But the pages of Migne arc given
in the margin, and a number of paragraph headings provided for the convenience
of the reader.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>III. THE MONASTERIES OF PONTUS</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mother-land of monasticism was Egypt. The movement there assumed two main
forms, the eremitic and the coenobitic.</p>
<p>St. Antony (<i>c. </i>250-c. 350) was the pioneer of the former, the devotees
of which led solitary lives in their cells, either quite independently, or
grouped around some central church, as at Nitria or Scete. In some cases there
was a considerable amount of organisation, but the solitary or eremitic life
lived in common was always quite different from the true common life.</p>
<p>Pachomius <i>(c. </i>290-346) was the originator of ccenobitism, which was
first put into practice at his monastery of Tabennisi.</p>
<p>In 357-8 Basil visited Egypt and returned <A NAME="p14"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|14</SPAN></A>
home, resolved to initiate the Pachomian mode of life in his own country.
Eustathius of Sebaste was already working on the same lines, and the unorganised
ascetic life in the world, to which Gregory of Nazianzus refers in his works,
had paved the way for monasticism proper. Basil called his friend Gregory to
fulfil a promise made in student days at Athens and join him in the ascetic
life. This Gregory eventually did, though he was unable at first to pay more
than a brief visit. Basil chose for his experiment a spot of much natural beauty
on the banks of the Iris. At Annesi, on the opposite side of the river, his
mother Emmelia and sister Macrina were living on the family estate. Basil put
himself at the head of a community of men likeminded with himself, while
Macrina, as described in the present book, began to organise a monastery on her
side of the river. Basil took Pachomius' coenobium at Tabennisi for his model,
with certain modifications suggested by his own original and practical mind.</p>
<p>In the <i>Life of St. Macrina </i>we find a double <A NAME="p15"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|15</SPAN></A>
monastery, the men presided over by Peter, the women by Macrina. This seems to
have been a natural development of the earlier ascetic family life to which
Macrina had drawn her mother after the death of Naucratius. We do not know to
what extent it conformed to the regulations for double monasteries prescribed by
Basil in his <i>Rules. </i>It is not clear whether Basil's monastery on the far
side of the Iris was still existing when Gregory visited Macrina. It may be
surmised that, when Basil became bishop of Caesarea and Peter reached man's
estate, the brethren were transferred to the opposite bank and came under the
joint rule of Macrina and Peter.</p>
<p>The subject of the Basilian coenobia and their place in the history of
monasticism has been worked out in two recent monographs, <i>St. Basil and his
Rule </i>(Oxford, 1912), by E. F. Morison, and <i>St. Basil the Great: a Study
in Monasticism </i>(Cambridge, 1913), by the present writer. Through the Latin
version of Rufinus Basil's <i>Rules </i>became known in the West and influenced
St. Benedict. <A NAME="p16"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|16</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <i>Life of St. Macrina </i>throws a light on the arrangements of a double
monastery in primitive times, and supplements the account given in the Pachomian
and Basilian <i>Rules. </i>This subject has not yet been worked out with any
completeness, so far as the writer is aware. It is not clear what influence, if
any, Rufinus' version of Basil's <i>Rules </i>had upon the origin of double
monasteries in Ireland and elsewhere. Perhaps the system arose independently in
different lands and centuries under similar conditions of primitive enthusiasm.
Reference may be made to a paper by Sir William Hope, <i>The Gilbertian Priory
of Watton </i>(London, 1901, reprinted from <i>The Archaeological Journal, </i>LVIII,
No. 229). The rules governing the relations of monks and nuns in this priory
bear so close a resemblance to those found in St. Basil, that the student will
probably not be far wrong if he assumes that the plan of the buildings as
sketched by Dr. Hope in his monograph fairly represents the topography of the
scenes described in Gregory's <i>Life </i>of his sister.</p>
