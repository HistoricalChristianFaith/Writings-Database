<p align="center">[TO THE MONK OLYMPIUS] [960A]</p>
<p align="center">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>THE form of this volume, if one may judge from its heading, is apparently
epistolary, but its bulk exceeds that of a letter, extending as it does to the
length of a book. My apology must be that the subject on which you bade me write
is greater than can be compressed within the limits of a letter.</p>
<p>I am sure you do not forget our meeting, when, on my way to Jerusalem in
pursuance of a vow, in order to sec the relics of the Lord's sojourning in the
flesh on the actual spots,<A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A> I ran across you in the
city of Antioch; and you must remember all the different talks we enjoyed, for
it was not likely that our meeting would be a silent one, when your wit provided
so many subjects for conversation. As often happens at such times, the <A NAME="p18"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|18</SPAN></A>
[960B] talk flowed on until we came to discuss the life of some famous person.
In this case it was a woman who provided us with our subject; if indeed she
should be styled woman, for I do not know whether it is fitting to designate her
by her sex, who so surpassed her sex. Our account of her was not based on the
narrative of others, but our talk was an accurate description of what we had
learned by personal experience, nor did it need to be authenticated by
strangers. Nor even was the virgin referred to unknown to our family circle, to
make it necessary to learn the wonders of her life through others, but she came
from the same parents as ourselves, being, so to speak, an offering of
first-fruits, since she was the earliest born of my mother's womb. As then you
have decided that the story of her noble career is worth telling, to prevent
such a life being unknown to our time, and the record of a woman who raised
[960C] herself by &quot;philosophy&quot; <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A> to the
greatest <A NAME="p19"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|19</SPAN></A> height of human virtue
passing into the shades of useless oblivion, I thought it well to obey you, and
in a few words, as best I can, to tell her story in unstudied and simple style.</p>
<p align="center">MACRINA'S PARENTS</p>
<p>The virgin's name was Macrina; she was so called by her parents after a
famous Macrina some time before in the family, our father's mother, who had
confessed Christ [962A] like a good athlete in the time of the persecutions.
This indeed was her name to the outside world, the one used by her friends. But
another name had been given her privately, as the result of a vision before she
was born into the world. For indeed her mother was so virtuous that she was
guided <A NAME="p20"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|20</SPAN></A> on all occasions by the
divine will. In particular she loved the pure and unstained mode of life so much
that she was unwilling to be married. But since she had lost both her parents,
and was in the very flower of her youthful beauty, and the fame of her good
looks was attracting many suitors, and there was a danger that, if she were not
mated to some one willingly, she might suffer some [962B] unwished-for violent
fate, seeing that some men, inflamed by her beauty, were ready to abduct her----on
this account she chose for her husband a man who was known and approved for the
gravity of his conduct, and so gained a protector of her life.</p>
<p align="center">THE BIRTH OF MACRINA</p>
<p>At her first confinement she became the mother of Macrina. When the due time
came for her pangs to be ended by delivery, she fell asleep and seemed to be
carrying in her hands that which was still in her womb. And some one in form and
raiment more splendid than a human being appeared and <A NAME="p21"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|21</SPAN></A>
addressed the child she was carrying by the name of Thecla, that Thecla, I mean,
who is so famous among the virgins.<A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A> After doing
this and testifying to it three times, he departed from her sight and gave her
easy delivery, so that at that moment she awoke from sleep and saw her dream
realised. Now this name was used only in secret. But it [962C] seems to me that
the apparition spoke not so much to guide the mother to a right choice of name,
as to forecast the life of the young child, and to indicate by the name that she
would follow her namesake's mode of life.</p>
<p align="center">MACRINA'S CHILDHOOD</p>
<p>Well, the child was reared. Although she had her own nurse, yet as a rule her
mother did the nursing with her own hands. After passing the stage of infancy,
she showed herself apt in acquiring childish <A NAME="p22"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|22</SPAN></A>
accomplishments, and her natural powers were shown in every study to which her
parents' judgment directed her. The education of the child was her mother's
task; she did not, however, employ the usual worldly method of education, which
makes a practice of using poetry as a [962D] means of training the early years
of the child. For she considered it disgraceful and quite unsuitable, that a
tender and plastic nature should be taught either those tragic passions of
womanhood which afforded poets their suggestions and plots, or the indecencies
of comedy, to be, so to speak, denied with unseemly tales of &quot;the
harem.&quot; <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A><i> </i>But such parts of inspired
Scripture as you would think were incomprehensible to young children were the
subject of the girl's studies; in particular the Wisdom of Solomon, and those
parts of it especially which have an ethical bearing. Nor was she ignorant of
any part of the Psalter, but at stated times she recited every part of it. When
she rose from bed, or engaged in household duties, or rested, [964A] or partook
of food, or retired from table, when <A NAME="p23"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|23</SPAN></A>
she went to bed or rose in the night for prayer, the Psalter was her constant
companion, like a good fellow-traveller that never deserted her.</p>
<p align="center">HER BETROTHAL</p>
<p>Filling her time with these and the like occupations, and attaining besides a
considerable proficiency in wool-work, the growing girl reached her twelfth
year, the age when the bloom of adolescence begins to appear. In which
connection it is noteworthy that the girl's beauty could not be concealed in
spite of efforts to hide it. Nor in all the countryside, so it seems, was there
anything so marvellous as her beauty in comparison with that of others. So fair
was she that even painters' hands could not do justice to her [964B] comeliness;
the art that contrives all things and essays the greatest tasks, so as even to
model in imitation the figures of the heavenly bodies, could not accurately
reproduce the loveliness of her form. In consequence a great swarm of suitors
seeking her in marriage crowded round her parents. But her father----<A NAME="p24"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|24</SPAN></A>
a shrewd man with a reputation for forming right decisions----picked out from
the rest a young man related to the family, who was just leaving school, of good
birth and remarkable steadiness, and decided to betroth his daughter to him, as
soon as she was old enough. Meantime he aroused great hopes, and he offered to
his future father-in-law his fame in public speaking, as it were one of the
bridegroom's gifts; for he displayed the [964C] power of his eloquence in
forensic contests on behalf of the wronged.</p>
<p align="center">DEATH OF THE YOUNG MAN</p>
<p>But Envy cut off these bright hopes by snatching away the poor lad from life.
Now Macrina was not ignorant of her &quot;father's schemes. But when the plan
formed for her was shattered by the young man's death, she said her father's
intention was equivalent to a marriage, and resolved to remain single
henceforward, just as if the intention had become accomplished fact. And indeed
her determination was more steadfast than could <A NAME="p25"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|25</SPAN></A>
have been expected from her age. For when her parents brought proposals of
marriage to her, as often happened owing to the number of suitors that came
attracted by the fame of her beauty, she would say that it was absurd and
unlawful not to be faithful to the marriage that had been arranged for her by
her father, but to be compelled to consider another; since in the nature of
things there was but one marriage, as there is one birth and one death. She
persisted that the man who had been linked to her by her [964D] parents'
arrangement was not dead, but that she considered him who lived to God, thanks
to the hope of the resurrection, to be absent only, not dead; it was wrong not
to keep faith with the bridegroom who was away.</p>
<p align="center">MACRINA RESOLVES NEVER TO LEAVE HER MOTHER</p>
<p>With such words repelling those who tried to talk her over, she settled on
one safeguard of her good resolution, in a resolve not to be separated from her
mother even for a moment <A NAME="p26"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|26</SPAN></A> of time. So
that her mother would often say that she had carried the rest of her children in
her womb for a definite time, but that Macrina she bore always, since in a sense
she ever carried her about. But the daughter's companionship was not a burden to
her mother, nor profitless. For the attentions received from her daughter were
worth those [966A] of many maidservants, and the benefits were mutual. For the
mother looked after the girl's soul, and the girl looked after her mother's
body, and in all respects fulfilled the required services, even going so far as
to prepare meals for her mother with her own hands. Not that she made this her
chief business. But after she had anointed her hands by the performance of
religious duties---- for she deemed that zeal for this was consistent with the
principles of her life----in the time that was left she prepared food for her
mother by her own toil. And not only this, but she helped her mother to bear her
burden of responsibilities. For she had four sons and five daughters, and paid
taxes to three different governors, since her property was <A NAME="p27"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|27</SPAN></A>
scattered in as many districts. [966 B] In consequence her mother was distracted
with various anxieties, for her father had by this time departed this life. In
all these matters she shared her mother's toils, dividing her cares with her,
and lightening her heavy load of sorrows. At one and the same time, thanks to
her mother's guardianship, she was keeping her own life blameless, so that her
mother's eye both directed and witnessed all she did; and also by her own life
she instructed her mother greatly, leading her to the same mark, that of
philosophy I mean, and gradually drawing her on to the immaterial and more
perfect life.</p>
<p align="center">BASIL RETURNS FROM THE UNIVERSITY</p>
<p>When the mother had arranged excellent marriages for the other sisters, such
as was best in each case, Macrina's brother, the great Basil, returned after his
long period of [966C] education, already a practised rhetorician. He was puffed
up beyond measure with the pride of oratory and looked down on the <A NAME="p28"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|28</SPAN></A>
local dignitaries, excelling in his own estimation all the men of leading and
position. Nevertheless Macrina took him in hand, and with such speed did she
draw him also toward the mark of philosophy that he forsook the glories of this
world and despised fame gained by speaking, and deserted it for this busy life
where one toils with one's hands. His renunciation of property was complete,
lest anything should impede the life of virtue. But, indeed, his life and the
subsequent acts, by which he became renowned throughout the world and put into
the shade all those who have won renown for their virtue, would [966D] need a
long description and much time. But I must divert my tale to its appointed task.</p>
<p>Now that all the distractions of the material life had been removed, Macrina
persuaded her mother to give up her ordinary life and all showy style of living
and the services of domestics to which she had been accustomed before, and bring
her point of view down to that of the masses, and to share the life of the
maids, treating all her slave girls and menials <A NAME="p29"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|29</SPAN></A>
as if they were sisters and belonged to the same rank as herself.</p>
<p>But at this point I should like to insert a short parenthesis in my narrative
and not to pass over unrelated such a matter as the following, in which the
lofty character of the maiden is displayed.</p>
<p align="center">THE STORY OF NAUCRATIUS</p>
<p>The second of the four brothers, Naucratius by name, who came next after the
great Basil, excelled the rest in natural endowments and physical beauty, in
strength, speed and ability to turn his hand to anything. When [968A] he had
reached his twenty-first year, and had given such demonstration of his studies
by speaking in public, that the whole audience in the theatre was thrilled, he
was led by a divine providence to despise all that was already in his grasp, and
drawn by an irresistible impulse went off to a life of solitude and poverty. He
took nothing with him but himself, save that one of the servants named
Chrysapius followed him, because of the <A NAME="p30"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|30</SPAN></A>
affection he had towards his master and the intention he had formed to lead the
same life. So he lived by himself, having found a solitary spot on the banks of
the Iris----a river flowing through the midst of Pontus. It rises actually in
Armenia, passes through our parts, and discharges its stream into the [968 B]
Black Sea. By it the young man found a place with a luxuriant growth of trees
and a hill nestling under the mass of the overhanging mountain. There he lived
far removed from the noises of the city and the distractions that surround the
lives both of the soldier and the pleader in the law courts. Having thus freed
himself from the din of cares that impedes man's higher life, with his own hands
he looked after some old people who were living in poverty and feebleness,
considering it appropriate to his mode of life to make such a work his care. So
the generous youth would go on fishing expeditions, and since he was expert in
every form of sport, he provided food to his grateful clients by this means. And
at the same time by such exercises he was taming his own manhood. <A NAME="p31"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|31</SPAN></A>
Besides this, he also gladly obeyed his mother's wishes whenever she issued a
command. And so in these two ways he guided his life, [968 C] subduing his
youthful nature by toils and caring assiduously for his mother, and thus keeping
the divine commands he was travelling home to God.</p>
<p>In this manner he completed the fifth year of his life as a philosopher, by
which he made his mother happy, both by the way in which he adorned his own life
by continence, and by the devotion of all his powers to do the will of her that
bore him.</p>
<p align="center">THE TRAGIC DEATH OF NAUCRATIUS</p>
<p>Then there fell on the mother a grievous and tragic affliction, contrived, I
think, by the Adversary, which brought trouble and mourning upon all the family.
For he was snatched suddenly away from life. No previous sickness had prepared
them for the blow, nor did any of the usual and well-known mischances bring
death upon the young man. [968D] Having started out on one of the expeditions, <A NAME="p32"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|32</SPAN></A>
by which he provided necessaries for the old men under his care, he was brought
back home dead, together with Chrysapius who shared his life. His mother was far
away, three days distant from the scene of the tragedy. Some one came to her
telling the bad news. Perfect though she was in every department of virtue, yet
nature dominated her as it does others. For she collapsed, and in a moment lost
both breath and speech, since her reason failed her under the disaster, and she
was thrown to the ground by the assault of the evil tidings, like some noble
athlete hit by an unexpected blow.</p>
<p align="center">MACRINA THE ONE SUPPORT OF<i> </i>HER MOTHER</p>
<p>And now the virtue of the great Macrina was displayed. Facing the disaster in
a [970A] rational spirit, she both preserved herself from collapse, and becoming
the prop of her mother's weakness, raised her up from the abyss of grief, and by
her own steadfastness and imperturbability taught her mother's soul to be brave.
In consequence, her mother <A NAME="p33"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|33</SPAN></A> was not
overwhelmed by the affliction, nor did she behave in any ignoble and womanish
way, so as to cry out at the calamity, or tear her dress, or lament over the
trouble, or strike up funeral chants with mournful melodies. On the contrary she
resisted the impulses of nature, and quieted herself both by such reflections as
occurred to her spontaneously, and those that were applied by her daughter to
cure the ill. For then was the nobility of Macrina's soul most of all
conspicuous; since [970B] natural affection was making her suffer as well. For
it was a brother, and a favourite brother, who had been snatched away by such a
manner of death. Nevertheless, conquering nature, she so sustained her mother by
her arguments that she, too, rose superior to her sorrow. Besides which, the
moral elevation always maintained by Macrina's life gave her mother the
opportunity of rejoicing over the blessings she enjoyed rather than grieving
over those that were missing. <A NAME="p34"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|34</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">MOTHER AND DAUGHTER MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS IN THE ASCETIC LIFE</p>
<p>When the cares of bringing up a family and the anxieties of their education
and settling in life had come to an end, and the property----a frequent cause of
worldliness---- had been for the most part divided among the children, then, as
I said above, the life of the virgin became her mother's guide and led her on to
this philosophic and spiritual [970C] manner of life. And weaning her from all
accustomed luxuries, Macrina drew her on to adopt her own standard of humility.
She induced her to live on a footing of equality with the staff of maids, so as
to share with them in the same food, the same kind of bed, and in all the
necessaries of life, without any regard to differences of rank. Such was the
manner of their life, so great the height of their philosophy, and so holy their
conduct day and night, as to make verbal description inadequate. For just as
souls freed from the body by death are saved from the cares of this life, so was
their life far removed from <A NAME="p35"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|35</SPAN></A> all
earthly follies and ordered with a view of imitating the angelic life. For no
anger or [970D] jealousy, no hatred or pride, was observed in their midst, nor
anything else of this nature, since they had cast away all vain desires for
honour and glory, all vanity, arrogance and the like. Continence was their
luxury, and obscurity their glory. Poverty, and the casting away of all material
superfluities like dust from their bodies, was their wealth. In fact, of all the
things after which men eagerly pursue in this life, there were none with which
they could not easily dispense.<A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A> Nothing was left
but the care of divine things and the unceasing round of prayer and endless
hymnody, co-extensive with time itself, practised by night and day. So that to
them this meant work, and work so called was rest. What human words could make
you [972A] realise such a life as this, a life on the borderline between human
and spiritual nature? For that nature should be free from human weaknesses is
more than can be expected <A NAME="p36"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|36</SPAN></A> from
mankind. But these women fell short of the angelic and immaterial nature only in
so far as they appeared in bodily form, and were contained within a human frame,
and were dependent upon the organs of sense. Perhaps some might even dare to say
that the difference was not to their disadvantage. Since living in the body and
yet after the likeness of the immaterial beings, they were not bowed down by the
weight of the body, but their life was exalted to the skies and [972B] they
walked on high in company with the powers of heaven.</p>
<p>The period covered by this mode of life was no short one, and with the lapse
of time their successes increased, as their philosophy continually grew purer
with the discovery of new blessings.</p>
<p align="center">PETER, THE YOUNGEST BROTHER</p>
<p>Macrina was helped most of all in achieving this great aim of her life by her
own brother Peter. With him the mother's pangs ceased, for he was the latest
born of the family. At <A NAME="p37"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|37</SPAN></A> one and the
same time he received the names of son and orphan, for as he entered this life
his father passed away from it. But the eldest of the family, the subject of our
story, took him soon after birth from the nurse's breast and reared him herself
and educated [972C] him on a lofty system of training, practising him from
infancy in holy studies, so as not to give his soul leisure to turn to vain
things. Thus having become all things to the lad---- father, teacher, tutor,
mother, giver of all good advice----she produced such results that before the
age of boyhood had passed, when he was yet a stripling in the first bloom of
tender youth, he aspired to the high mark of philosophy. And, thanks to his
natural endowments, he was clever in every art that involves hand-work, so that
without any guidance he achieved a completely accurate knowledge of everything
that ordinary people learn by time and trouble. Scorning to occupy [972D] his
time with worldly studies, and having in nature a sufficient instructor in all
good knowledge, and always looking to his sister as the model of all good, he
advanced to such <A NAME="p38"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|38</SPAN></A>&nbsp; a height of
virtue that in his subsequent life he seemed in no whit inferior to the great
Basil. But at this time he was all in all to his sister and mother, co-operating
with them in the pursuit of the angelic life. Once when a severe famine had
occurred and crowds from all quarters were frequenting the retreat where they
lived, drawn by the fame of their benevolence, Peter's kindness supplied such an
abundance of food that the desert seemed a city by reason of the number of
visitors.</p>
<p align="center">DEATH OF THE MOTHER</p>
<p>[974A] It was about this time that the mother died, honoured by all, and went
to God, yielding up her life in the arms of her two children. It is worth while
to give the words of blessing which she used over her children, mentioning each
of the absent ones in loving remembrance, so that no single one was deprived of
the blessing, and commending especially to God in her prayers those who were
present with her.</p>
<p>For as these two sat by her on each side of <A NAME="p39"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|39</SPAN></A>
the bed, she touched them with her hands, and uttered these prayers to God with
her dying words----</p>
<p>&quot;To Thee, O Lord, I give the fruit of my womb as both first-fruits and
tenths. For this my eldest is the first-fruits and this my last-born is the
tenth. Each is sanctified to Thee by the Law, and they are votive offerings to
Thee. Therefore let Thy sanctification [974B] descend on this my first and this
my tenth.&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke she indicated by gestures her daughter and son. Then, having
ceased to bless, she ceased to live, having first bidden her children lay her
body in their father's grave. But they, having fulfilled the command, clave to
philosophy with still loftier resolve, even striving against their own life and
eclipsing their previous record by their subsequent successes.</p>
<p align="center">BASIL DIES AFTER A NOBLE CAREER</p>
<p>Meanwhile Basil, the famous saint, had been elected bishop <sup>1</sup> of
the great church of Caesarea. <A NAME="p40"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|40</SPAN></A> He
advanced Peter to the sacred order of the priesthood, consecrating him in person
with mystic ceremonial. And in this way a further advance in the direction of
dignity [974C] and sanctity was made in their life, now that philosophy was
enriched by the priesthood.</p>
<p>Eight years after this, the world-renowned Basil departed from men to live
with God, to the common grief of his native land and the whole world. Now when
Macrina heard the news of the calamity in her distant retreat, she was
distressed indeed in soul at so great a loss----for how could she not be
distressed at a calamity, which was felt even by the enemies of the truth?----but
just as they say that the testing of gold takes place in several furnaces, so
that if any impurity escapes the first furnace, it may be separated in the
second, and again in the last one all admixture of dross may be purged away----consequently
it is the most accurate testing of pure gold if having gone through every
furnace it shows no refuse. So it happened also in her case. When her noble
character had been tested by these different accessions of trouble, in every <A NAME="p41"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|41</SPAN></A>
respect the metal of her soul was proved to be unadulterated and undefiled. The
first test was the loss of the one brother, the second the parting from her
mother, the third was when the common glory of the family, great Basil, was
removed from human life. So she remained, like an invincible athlete in no wise
broken by the assault of troubles.</p>
<p align="center">GREGORY RESOLVES TO VISIT HIS SISTER.</p>
<p>It was the ninth month or a little longer after this disaster, and a synod of
bishops was gathered at Antioch, in which we also took part. And when we broke
up, each to go home before the year was over, then I, [976A] Gregory, felt a
desire to visit Macrina. For a long time had elapsed during which visits were
prevented by the distraction of the troubles which I underwent, being constantly
driven out from my own country by the leaders of heresy. And when I came to
reckon the intervening time during which the troubles had prevented us meeting
face <A NAME="p42"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|42</SPAN></A> to face, no less than eight
years, or very nearly that period, seemed to have elapsed.</p>
<p>Now when I had accomplished most of the journey and was one day's journey
distant, a vision appeared to me in a dream and filled me with anxious
anticipations of the future. I seemed to be carrying martyrs' relics in my
hands; a light came from them, such as [976B] comes from a clear mirror when it
is put facing the sun, so that my eyes were blinded by the brilliance of the
rays. The same vision recurred three times that night. I could not clearly
understand the riddle of the dream, but I saw trouble for my soul, and I watched
carefully so as to judge the vision by events.</p>
<p>When I approached the retreat in which Macrina led her angelic and heavenly
life, first of all I asked one of the servants about my brother, whether he were
at home. He told us that he had gone out four days ago now, and I understood,
which indeed was the case, that he had gone to meet us by another way. Then I
asked after the great lady. He said she was very ill, and I was the more eager
to hurry on and complete the remainder <A NAME="p43"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|43</SPAN></A>
of the journey, for a certain anxiety and premonitory fear of what was coining
stole [976C] in and disquieted me.</p>
<p align="center">GREGORY COMES TO THE MONASTERY AND FINDS MACRINA ON HER DEATH
BED</p>
<p>But when I came to the actual place, rumour had already announced my arrival
to the brotherhood. Then the whole company of the men came streaming out to meet
us from their apartments. For it was their custom to honour friends by meeting
them. But the band of virgins on the women's side modestly waited in the church
for us to arrive. But when the prayers and the blessing were over, and the
women, after reverently inclining their head for the blessing, retired to their
own apartments, none of them were left with us. I guessed the explanation, that
the abbess was not with them. A man led me to the house in which was my great
sister, and [976D] opened the door. Then I entered that holy dwelling. I found
her already terribly afflicted with weakness. She was lying not on a bed <A NAME="p44"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|44</SPAN></A>
or couch, but on the floor; a sack had been spread on a board, and another board
propped up her head, so contrived as to act as a pillow, supporting the sinews
of the neck in slanting fashion, and holding up the neck comfortably. Now when
she saw me near the door she raised herself on her elbow but could not come to
meet me, her strength being already drained by fever. But by putting her hands
on the floor and leaning over from the pallet as far as she could, she showed
the respect [978A] due to my rank. I ran to her and embraced her prostrate form,
and raising her, again restored her to her usual position. Then she lifted her
hand to God and said----</p>
<p>&quot;This favour also Thou hast granted me, O God, and hast not deprived me
of my desire, because Thou hast stirred up Thy servant to visit Thy
handmaid.&quot;</p>
<p>Lest she should vex my soul she stilled her groans and made great efforts to
hide, if possible, the difficulty of her breathing. And in every way she tried
to be cheerful, both taking the lead herself in friendly talk, and giving us an
opportunity by asking <A NAME="p45"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|45</SPAN></A> questions.
When in the course of conversation mention was made of the great Basil, my soul
was saddened and my face fell dejectedly. But so far was she from sharing in my
affliction [978B] that, treating the mention of the saint as an occasion for yet
loftier philosophy, she discussed various subjects, inquiring into human affairs
and revealing in her conversation the divine purpose concealed in disasters.
Besides this, she discussed the future life,<A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A> as if
inspired by the Holy Spirit, so that it almost seemed as if my soul were lifted
by the help of her words away from mortal nature and placed within the heavenly
sanctuary. And just as we learn in the story of Job that the saint was tormented
in every part of his body with discharges owing to the corruption of his wounds,
yet did not allow the pain [978C] to affect his reasoning power, but in spite of
the pains in the body did not relax his activities nor interrupt the lofty
sentiments of his discourse----similarly did I see in the case of this <A NAME="p46"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|46</SPAN></A>
great woman. Fever was drying up her strength and driving her on to death, yet
she refreshed her body as it were with dew, and thus kept her mind unimpeded in
the contemplation of heavenly things, in no way injured by her terrible
weakness. And if my narrative were not extending to an unconscionable length I
would tell everything in order, how she was uplifted as she discoursed to us on
the nature of the soul and explained the reason of life in the flesh, and why
man was made, and how he was mortal, and the origin of death and the nature of
the journey from death to life again. In all of [978D] which she told her tale
clearly and consecutively as if inspired by the power of the Holy Spirit, and
the even flow of her language was like a fountain whose water streams down
uninterruptedly.</p>
<p align="center">SHE SENDS GREGORY AWAY TO REST HIMSELF</p>
<p>When our conversation was finished, she said----</p>
<p>&quot;It is time, brother, for you to rest your <A NAME="p47"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|47</SPAN></A>
body awhile, since it is wearied with the great toil of your journey.&quot;</p>
<p>And though I found it a great and genuine rest to see her and hear her noble
words, yet since she wanted it so much, that I might in every particular seem to
obey my mistress, I found a pretty arbour prepared for me in one of the
neighbouring gardens, and rested under the shade of the trailing vines. But it
was impossible to have any feelings of [980A] enjoyment when my soul within me
was constrained by gloomy anticipations, for the secret of the vision of my
dream seemed to be now revealed to me by what I had seen. For the image I had
seen was indeed true---- the relics of a holy martyr which had been dead in sin,
but now were resplendent with the indwelling power of the Spirit. I explained
this to one of those who had heard me tell the dream before.</p>
<p>We were, as one might guess, in a dejected state, expecting sad tidings, when
Macrina, somehow or other divining our condition of mind, sent to us a messenger
with more cheerful news, and bade us be of good cheer <A NAME="p48"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|48</SPAN></A>
and have better hope for her, for she was feeling a change for the better. Now
this was not said to deceive, but the message was [980B] actually true, though
we did not know it at the time. For in very truth, just as a runner who has
passed his adversary and already drawn near to the end of the stadium, as he
approaches the judge's seat and sees the crown of victory, rejoices inwardly as
if he had already attained his object and announces his victory to his
sympathisers among the spectators----in such a frame of mind did she, too, tell
us to cherish better hopes for her, for she was already looking to the prize of
her heavenly calling, and all but uttering the apostle's words:
&quot;Henceforward is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the
righteous Judge shall give me,&quot; for &quot;I have fought the good fight, I
have finished the course, I have kept the faith.&quot;</p>
<p>Accordingly, feeling happy at the good [980C] news, we began to enjoy the
sights that lay before us. For they were very varied and the arrangements gave
much pleasure, since <A NAME="p49"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|49</SPAN></A> the great lady
was careful even of these trifles.</p>
<p align="center">GREGORY RETURNS TO MACRINA, WHO RECALLS THE EVENTS OF HER
CHILDHOOD</p>
<p>But when we saw her again, for she did not allow us to spend time by
ourselves in idleness, she began to recall her past life, beginning with
childhood, and describing it all in order as in a history. She recounted as much
as she could remember of the life of our parents, and the events that took place
both before and after my birth. But her aim throughout was gratitude towards
God, for she described our parents' life not so much from the point of view of
the reputation they enjoyed in the eyes of contemporaries on account of their
riches, as an example of the divine blessing. My father's parents had their
goods confiscated for confessing Christ. Our maternal [980D] grandfather was
slain by the imperial wrath, and all his possessions were transferred to other
masters. Nevertheless their life abounded so in faith that no one was named <A NAME="p50"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|50</SPAN></A>
above them in those times. And moreover, after their substance had been divided
into nine parts according to the number of the children, the share of each was
so increased by God's blessing, that the income of each of the children exceeded
the prosperity of the parents. But when it came to Macrina herself she kept
nothing of the things assigned to her in the equal division between brothers and
sisters, but all her share was given into the priest's hands according to the
divine command. [982A] Moreover her life became such by God's help that her
hands never ceased to work according to the commandment. Never did she even look
for help to any human being, nor did human charity give her the opportunity of a
comfortable existence. Never were petitioners turned away, yet never did she
appeal for help, but God secretly blessed the little seeds of her good works
till they grew into a mighty fruit.</p>
<p>As I told my own trouble and all that I had been through, first my exile at
the hands of the Emperor Valens on account of the faith, and then the confusion
in the Church <A NAME="p51"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|51</SPAN></A> that summoned me to
conflicts and trials, my great sister said----</p>
<p>&quot;Will you not cease to be insensible to the divine blessings? Will you
not remedy the ingratitude of your soul? Will you not compare your position with
that of your [982B] parents'? And yet, as regards worldly things, we make our
boast of being well born and thinking we come of a noble family. Our father was
greatly esteemed as a young man for his learning; in fact his fame was
established throughout the law courts of the province. Subsequently, though he
excelled all others in rhetoric, his reputation did not extend beyond Pontus.
But he was satisfied with fame in his own hand.</p>
<p>&quot;But you,&quot; she said, &quot;are renowned in cities and peoples and
nations. Churches summon you as an ally and director, and do you not see the
grace of God in it all? Do you fail to recognise the cause of such great
blessings, that it is your parents' prayers that are lifting you up on high, you
that have little or no equipment within yourself for such success?&quot; <A NAME="p52"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|52</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[982C] Thus she spoke, and I longed for the length of the day to be further
extended, that she might never cease delighting our cars with sweetness. But the
voice of the choir was summoning us to the evening service, and sending me to
church, the great one retired once more to God in prayer. And thus she spent the
night.</p>
<p align="center">THE EVENTS OF THE NEXT DAY: MACRINA'S LAST HOURS</p>
<p>But when day came it was clear to me from what I saw that the coming day was
the utmost limit of her life in the flesh, since the fever had consumed all her
innate strength. But she, considering the weakness of our minds, was contriving
how to divert us from our sorrowful anticipations, and once more with those
beautiful words of hers poured out what was left of her suffering soul with
[982D] short and difficult breathing. Many, indeed, and varied, were the
emotions of my heart at what I saw. For nature herself was afflicting me and
making me sad; as was only <A NAME="p53"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|53</SPAN></A> to be
expected, since I could no longer hope ever to hear such a voice again. Nor as
yet was I reconciled to the thought of losing the common glory of our family,
but my mind, as it were inspired by the spectacle, supposed that she would
actually rise superior to the common lot. For that she did not even in her last
breath find anything strange in the hope of the Resurrection, nor even shrink at
the departure from this life, but with lofty mind continued to discuss up to her
last breath the convictions she had formed from the beginning about this life----all
this seemed to me more than human. Rather did it seem as if some angel had taken
human form with a sort of incarnation, to whom it was nothing [984A] strange
that the mind should remain undisturbed, since he had no kinship or likeness
with this life of flesh, and so the flesh did not draw the mind to think on its
afflictions. Therefore <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A><i> </i>I think she revealed
to the bystanders that divine and pure love of the invisible bridegroom, which
she kept hidden <A NAME="p54"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|54</SPAN></A> and nourished in the
secret places of the soul, and she published abroad the secret disposition of
her heart----her hurrying towards Him Whom she desired, that she might speedily
be with Him, loosed from the chains of the body. For in very truth her course
was directed towards virtue, and nothing else could divert her attention.</p>
<p align="center">MACRINA'S DYING PRAYER</p>
<p>[984B] Most of the day had now passed, and the sun was declining towards the
West. Her eagerness did not diminish, but as she approached her end, as if she
discerned the beauty of the Bridegroom more clearly, she hastened towards the
Beloved with the greater eagerness. Such thoughts as these did she utter, no
longer to us who were present, but to Him in person on Whom she gazed fixedly.
Her couch had been turned towards the East; and, ceasing to converse with us,
she spoke henceforward to God in prayer, making supplication with her hands and
whispering with a low voice, so that we could <A NAME="p55"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|55</SPAN></A>
just hear what was said. Such was the prayer; we need not doubt that it reached
[984C] God and that she, too, was hearing His voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Thou, O Lord, hast freed us from the fear of death. Thou hast made the
end of this life the beginning to us of true life. Thou for a season restest our
bodies in sleep and awakest them again at the last trump. Thou givest our earth,
which Thou hast fashioned with Thy hands, to the earth to keep in safety. One
day Thou wilt take again what Thou hast given, transfiguring with immortality
and grace our mortal and unsightly remains. Thou hast saved us from the curse
and from sin, having become both for our sakes. Thou hast broken the heads of
the dragon who had seized us with his jaws, in the yawning gulf of disobedience.
Thou hast shown us the way of resurrection, having broken the gates of .hell,
and brought to nought him who had the power of death----the devil. Thou hast
given a sign to those that fear Thee in the symbol of the Holy Cross, [984D] to
destroy the adversary and save our life. <A NAME="p56"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|56</SPAN></A>
O God eternal, to Whom I have been attached from my mother's womb, Whom my soul
has loved with all its strength, to Whom I have dedicated both my flesh and my
soul from my youth up until now----do Thou give me an angel of light to conduct
me to the place of refreshment, where is the water of rest, in the bosom of the
holy Fathers. Thou that didst break the flaming sword and didst restore to
Paradise the man that was crucified with Thee and implored Thy mercies, remember
me, too, in Thy kingdom; because I, too, was crucified with Thee, having nailed
my flesh to the cross for fear of Thee, and of Thy judgments have I been afraid.
Let not the terrible chasm separate me from Thy elect. Nor let [986A] the
Slanderer stand against me in the way; nor let my sin be found before Thy eyes,
if in anything I have sinned in word or deed or thought, led astray by the
weakness of our nature. O Thou Who hast power on earth to forgive sins, forgive
me, that I may be refreshed and may be found before Thee when I put off my body,
without defilement on my soul. But may my soul be received <A NAME="p57"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|57</SPAN></A>
into Thy hands spotless and undefiled, as an offering before Thee.&quot;</p>
<p>As she said these words she sealed her eyes and mouth and heart with the
cross. And gradually her tongue dried up with the fever, she could articulate
her words no longer, and her voice died away, and only by the trembling of her
lips and the motion of her hands did we recognise that she was praying.</p>
<p>Meanwhile evening had come and a lamp [986B] was brought in. All at once she
opened the orb of her eyes and looked towards the light, clearly wanting to
repeat the thanksgiving sung at the Lighting of the Lamps. But her voice failed
and she fulfilled her intention in the heart and by moving her hands, while her
lips stirred in sympathy with her inward desire. But when she had finished the
thanksgiving, and her hand brought to her face to make the Sign had signified
the end of the prayer, she drew a great deep breath and closed her life and her
prayer together. <A NAME="p58"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|58</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">GREGORY PERFORMS THE LAST OFFICES</p>
<p>And now that she was breathless and still, remembering the command that she
had given at our first meeting, telling me she wished her hands laid on her
eyes, and the accustomed [986C] offices done for the body by me, I brought her
hands, all numb with the disease, on to her holy face, only that I might not
seem to neglect her bidding. For her eyes needed none to compose them, being
covered gracefully by the lids, just as happens in natural sleep; the lips were
suitably closed and the hands laid reverently on the breast, and the whole body
had automatically fallen into the right position, and in no way needed the help
of the layers-out.</p>
<p align="center">THE SISTERS' LAMENT FOR THEIR ABBESS</p>
<p>Now my mind was becoming unnerved in two ways, from the sight that met my
gaze, and the sad wailing of the virgins that sounded in my ears. So far they
had remained [986D] quiet and suppressed their grief, restraining <A NAME="p59"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|59</SPAN></A>
their impulse to mourn for fear of her, as if they dreaded her rebuke even when
her voice was silent, lest in any way a sound should break forth from them
contrary to her command and their mistress be grieved in consequence. But when
they could no longer subdue their anguish in silence, and grief like some inward
fire was smouldering in their hearts, all at once a bitter and irrepressible cry
broke out; so that my reason no longer remained calm, but a flood of emotion,
like a watercourse in spate, swept it away, and so, neglecting my duties, I gave
myself up to lamentation. Indeed, the cause for the maidens' weeping seemed to
me just and [988A] reasonable. For they were not bewailing the loss of human
companionship and guidance, nor any other such thing as men grieve over when
disaster comes. But it seemed as if they had been torn away from their hope in
God and the salvation of their souls, and so they cried and bewailed in this
manner----</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;The light of our eyes has gone out,&nbsp;<br>
  The light that guided our souls has been taken away. <A NAME="p60"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|60</SPAN></A>&nbsp;<br>
  The safety of our life is destroyed,&nbsp;<br>
  The seal of immortality is removed,&nbsp;<br>
  The bond of restraint has been taken away,<br>
  The support of the weak has been broken,&nbsp;<br>
  The healing of the sick removed.&nbsp;<br>
  In thy presence the night became to us as day,<br>
  Illumined with pure life,&nbsp;<br>
  But now even our day will be turned to gloom.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saddest of all in their grief were those who [988B] called on her as mother
and nurse. These were they whom she picked up, exposed by the roadside in the
time of famine. She had nursed and reared them, and led them to the pure and
stainless life.</p>
<p>But when, as it were from the sleep, I recovered my thoughts, I looked
towards that holy face and it seemed as if it rebuked me for the confusion of
the noisy mourners. So I called to the sisters with a loud voice----</p>
<p>&quot;Look at her, and remember her commands, by which she trained you to be
orderly and decent in everything. One occasion for <A NAME="p61"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|61</SPAN></A>
tears did this divine soul ordain for us, recommending us to weep at the time of
prayer. Which now we may do, by turning the lamentations into psalmody in the
same strain.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">VESTIANA COMES TO HELP GREGORY [988C]</p>
<p>I had to shout in order to be heard above the noise of the mourners. Then I
besought them to go away for awhile to the neighbouring house, but asked that
some of those whose services she used to welcome when she was alive should stay
behind.</p>
<p>Among these was a lady of gentle birth, who had been famous in youth for
wealth, good family, physical beauty and every other distinction. She had
married a man of high rank and lived with him a short time. Then, with her body
still young, she was released from marriage, and chose the great Macrina as
protector and guardian of her widowhood, and spent her time mostly with the
virgins, learning from them the life of virtue. <A NAME="p62"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|62</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lady's name was Vestiana, and her [988D] father was one of those who
composed the council of senators. To her I said that there could be no objection
now, at any rate, to putting finer clothing on the body and adorning that pure
and stainless form with fair linen clothes. But she said one ought to learn what
the saint had thought proper in these matters. For it was not right that
anything at all should be done by us contrary to what she would have wished. But
just what was dear and pleasing to God, would be her desire also.</p>
<p>Now there was a lady called Lampadia, leader of the band of sisters, a
deaconess in rank. She declared that she knew Macrina's [990A] wishes in the
matter of burial exactly. When I asked her about them (for she happened to be
present at our deliberations), she said with tears----</p>
<p>&quot;The saint resolved that a pure life should be her adornment, that this
should deck her body in life and her grave in death. But so far as clothes to
adorn the body go, she procured none when she was alive, nor did she <A NAME="p63"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|63</SPAN></A>
store them for the present purpose. So that not even if we want it will there be
anything more than what we have here, since no preparation is made for this
need.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it not possible,&quot; said I, &quot;to find in the store-cupboard
anything to make a fitting funeral?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Store-cupboard indeed!&quot; said she; &quot;you have in front of you
all her treasure. There is the cloak, there is the head-covering, there the
well-worn shoes on the feet. This is all her wealth, these are her riches. There
is nothing stored away in secret places beyond what you see, or put away safely
in boxes or bedroom. She knew of one store-house [990B] alone for her wealth,
the treasure in heaven. There she had stored her all, nothing was left on
earth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Suppose,&quot; said I, &quot;I were to bring some of the things I have
got ready for the funeral, should I be doing anything of which she would not
have approved?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think,&quot; said she, &quot;that this would be against her
wish. For had she been living, she would have accepted such honour from <A NAME="p64"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|64</SPAN></A>
you on two grounds----your priesthood which she always prized so dear, and your
relationship, for she would not have repudiated what came to her from her
brother. This was why she gave commands that your hands were to prepare her body
for burial.</p>
<p align="center">THEY FIND ON THE BODY MAEKS OF MACRINA'S SANCTITY</p>
<p>When we had decided on this, and it was necessary for that sacred body to be
robed in linen, we divided the work and applied ourselves to our different
tasks. I ordered one of my men to bring the robe. But Vestiana [990C]
above-mentioned was decking that holy head with her own hands, when she put her
hand on the neck.</p>
<p>&quot;See,&quot; she said, looking at me, &quot;what sort of an ornament has
hung on the saint's neck!&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke, she loosened the fastener behind, then stretched out her hand
and showed us the representation of a cross of iron and a ring of the same
material, both of <A NAME="p65"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|65</SPAN></A> which were
fastened by a slender thread and rested continually on the heart.</p>
<p>&quot; Let us share the treasure,&quot; I said. &quot; You have the
phylactery of the cross, I will be content with inheriting the ring&quot; ----for
the cross had been traced on the seal of this too. [990D] Looking at it, the
lady said to me again---- &quot;You have made no mistake in choosing this
treasure; for the ring is hollow in the hoop, and in it has been hidden a
particle of the Cross of Life,<A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> and so the mark on
the seal above shows what is hidden below.&quot;</p>
<p>But when it was time that the pure body should be wrapped in its robes, the
command of the great departed one made it necessary for me to undertake the
ministry; but the sister who shared with me that great inheritance was present
and joined in the work. <A NAME="p66"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|66</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Do not let the great wonders accomplished by the saint pass by
unnoticed,&quot;she remarked, laying bare part of the breast.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean? &quot;I said.</p>
<p>[992A] &quot;Do you see,&quot;she said, &quot;this small faint mark below the
neck? &quot;It was like a scar made by a small needle. As she spoke she brought
the lamp near to the place she was showing me.</p>
<p>&quot;What is there surprising,&quot; I said, &quot;if the body has been
branded with some faint mark in this place?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This,&quot; she replied, &quot;has been left on the body as a token of
God's powerful help. For there grew once in this place a cruel disease, and
there was a danger either that the tumour should require an operation, or that
the complaint should become quite incurable, if it should spread to the
neighbourhood of the heart. Her mother implored her often and begged her to
receive the attention of a doctor, since the medical art, she [992B] said, was
sent from God for the saving of men. But she judged it worse than the pain, to
uncover any part of the body to a stranger's <A NAME="p67"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|67</SPAN></A>
eyes. So when evening came, after waiting on her mother as usual with her own
hands, she went inside the sanctuary and besought the God of healing all night
long. A stream of tears fell from her eyes on to the ground, and she used the
mud made by the tears as a remedy for her ailment. Then when her mother felt
despondent and again urged her to allow the doctor to come, she said it would
suffice for the cure of her disease if her mother would make the holy seal on
the place with her own hand. But when the mother put her hand within her bosom,
to make the sign of the cross on the part, the sign worked and the tumour
disappeared.</p>
<p>&quot;But this,&quot; said she, &quot;is the tiny trace of it; it appeared
then in place of the frightful [992C] sore and remained until the end, that it
might be, as I imagine, a memorial of the divine visitation, an occasion and
reminder of perpetual thanksgiving to God.&quot;</p>
<p>When our work came to an end and the body had been decked with the best we
had on the spot, the deaconess spoke again, maintaining that it was not fitting
that she should be seen <A NAME="p68"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|68</SPAN></A> by the eyes
of the virgins robed like a bride. &quot;But I have,&quot;she said, &quot;laid
by one of your mother's dark-coloured robes which I think would do well laid
over her, that this holy beauty be not decked out with the unnecessary splendour
of clothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Her counsel prevailed, and the robe was laid upon the body. But she was
resplendent [992D] even in the dark robe, divine power having added, as I think,
this final grace to the body, so that, as in the vision of my dream, rays
actually seemed to shine forth from her beauty.</p>
<p align="center">THE ALL-NIGHT VIGIL: A CROWD OF VISITORS ARRIVES</p>
<p>But while we were thus employed and the virgins' voices singing psalms
mingled with the lamentations were filling the place, somehow the news had
quickly spread throughout the whole neighbourhood, and all the people that lived
near were streaming towards the place, so that the entrance hall could no longer
hold the concourse.</p>
<p>When the all-night vigil for her, accompanied <A NAME="p69"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|69</SPAN></A>
by hymn-singing, as in the case of martyrs' festivals, was finished, and the
dawn came, the multitude of men and women that had flocked in from all the
neighbouring country were interrupting the psalms with wailings. But I, sick at
heart though I was owing to the calamity, was yet contriving, so far as was
possible with what we had, that no suitable [994A] accompaniment of such a
funeral should be omitted.</p>
<p align="center">GREGORY MAKES THE FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS</p>
<p>I divided the visitors according to sex, and put the crowds of women with the
band of virgins, while the men folk I put in the ranks of the monks. I arranged
that the psalms should be sung by both sexes in rhythmical and harmonious
fashion, as in chorus singing, so that all the voices should blend suitably. But
since the day was progressing, and the entire space of the retreat was getting
crowded with the multitude of arrivals, the bishop of that district (Araxius by
name, who had <A NAME="p70"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|70</SPAN></A> come with the entire
complement of his priests) ordered the funeral procession to start slowly;
[994B] for there was a long way to go, and the crowd seemed likely to impede
brisk movement. At the same time as he gave this order he summoned to him all
present who shared with him in the priesthood, that the body might be borne by
them.</p>
<p>When this had been settled and his directions were being carried out, I got
under the bed and called Araxius to the other side; two other distinguished
priests took the hinder part of the bed. Then I went forward, slowly as was to
be expected, our progress being but gradual. For the people thronged round the
bed and all were insatiable to see that holy sight, so that it was not easy for
us to complete our journey. On either side we were flanked by a considerable
number of [994C] deacons and servants, escorting the bier in order, all holding
wax tapers.</p>
<p>The whole thing resembled a mystic procession, and from beginning to end the
voices blended in singing psalms, that, for example, that comes in the Hymn of
the Three Children. <A NAME="p71"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|71</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seven or eight stades intervened between the Retreat and the abode of the
Holy Martyrs, in which also the bodies of our parents were laid. With difficulty
did we accomplish the journey in the best part of a day, for the crowds that
came with us and those that were constantly joining us did not allow our
progress to be what we wished.</p>
<p align="center">ARRIVAL AT THE CHURCH: THE BURIAL. SERVICE</p>
<p>But when we got inside the church we laid down the bed and turned first to
prayer. But our prayer was the signal for the people's lamentations to start
again. For when the voice of psalmody was still, and the virgins gazed on that
holy face, and the grave of our parents was already being opened, in which it
had been decided that Macrina should be [994D] laid, a woman cried out
impulsively that after this hour we should see that divine face no more. Then
the rest of the virgins cried out the same, and a disorderly confusion disturbed
the orderly and solemn chanting <A NAME="p72"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|72</SPAN></A> of
psalms, all being upset at the wailing of the virgins. With difficulty did we
succeed in procuring silence by our gesture, and the precentor taking the lead
and intoning the accustomed prayers of the Church, the people composed
themselves at last to prayer.</p>
<p align="center">[996A] THE FAMILY GRAVE IS OPENED</p>
<p>When the prayer had come to its due close, fear entered my mind of
transgressing the divine command, which forbids us to uncover the shame of
father or mother. &quot;And how,&quot; said I, &quot;shall I escape such
condemnation if I gaze at the common shame of human nature made manifest in the
bodies of my parents? Since they are all decayed and dissolved, as must be
expected, and turned into foul and repulsive shapelessness.&quot;</p>
<p>As I thought of these things and the anger of Noah against his son was
striking fear into me, the story of Noah advised me what was to be done. Before
the lid of the grave was lifted sufficiently to reveal the bodies to our gaze,
they were covered by a pure linen cloth <A NAME="p73"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|73</SPAN></A>
stretched across from each end. And now that [996B] the bodies were hidden under
the cloth, we---- myself, that is, and the afore-mentioned bishop of the
district----took up that holy body from the bed and laid it down by the side of
the mother, thus fulfilling the common prayer of both. For both were with one
voice asking God for this boon all their lives long, that their bodies should be
mingled with one another after death, and that their comradeship in life should
not even in death be broken.</p>
<p align="center">THE FUNERAL OVER, GREGORY RETURNS HOME</p>
<p>But when we had completed all the accustomed funeral rites, and it became
necessary to return home, I first threw myself on the grave and embraced the
dust, and then I started on my way back, downcast and tearful, pondering over
the greatness of my loss.</p>
<p>On my way I met a distinguished soldier who had a military command in a
little city of Pontus named Sebastopolis, and dwelt [996C] there with his
subordinates. He met me in friendly fashion when I reached the town, <A NAME="p74"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|74</SPAN></A>
and was greatly disturbed to hear of the calamity, for he was linked to us by
ties both of relationship and friendship. He told me a story of a marvellous
episode in her life, which I shall incorporate into my history and then close my
tale. When we had ceased our tears and had entered into conversation, he said to
me----</p>
<p>&quot;Learn what manner of goodness has been taken away from human
life.&quot;</p>
<p>With this prelude he began his narrative.</p>
<p align="center">THE SOLDIER'S STORY</p>
<p>&quot;My wife and I once had an earnest desire to pay a visit to the school
of virtue. For so I think the place ought to be called, in which that blessed
soul had her abode. Now there [996D] lived with us also our little daughter, who
had been left with an affliction of the eye after an infectious illness. And her
appearance was hideous and pitiable, the membrane round the eye being enlarged
and whitish from the complaint. But when we came inside that divine abode, my
wife and I separated in our <A NAME="p75"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|75</SPAN></A> visit to
those seekers after philosophy according to our sex. I went to the men's
department, presided over by Peter, your brother; while my wife went to the
women's side and conversed with the saint. And when a suitable interval had
elapsed, we considered it time to depart from the Retreat, and already our
preparations were being made for this, but kind protests were raised from both
sides equally. Your brother was urging me to stay [998A] and partake of the
philosophers' table; and the blessed lady would not let my wife go, but holding
our little girl in her bosom, said she would not give her up before she had
prepared a meal for them and had entertained them with the riches of philosophy.
And kissing the child, as was natural, and putting her lips to her eyes, she saw
the complaint of the pupil and said----</p>
<p>&quot;'If you grant me this favour and share our meal, I will give you in
return a reward not unworthy of such an honour.'</p>
<p>&quot;'What is that? ' said the child's mother.</p>
<p>&quot;'I have a drug,' said the great lady, 'which is powerful to cure eye
complaints.' <A NAME="p76"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|76</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;And then news was brought me from the women's apartments, telling me of
this promise, and we gladly remained, thinking little of the pressing necessity
of starting on our journey.</p>
<p>[998B] &quot;But when the feast came to an end and we had said the prayer,
great Peter waiting on us with his own hands and cheering us, and when holy
Macrina had dismissed my wife with all courtesy, then at last we went home
together with glad and cheerful hearts, telling one another as we journeyed what
had befallen us. I described to her what had happened in the men's room, both
what I had heard and seen. She told every detail as in a history, and thought
nothing ought to be left out, even the smallest points. She told everything in
order, keeping the sequence of the narrative. [998C] When she came to the point
at which the promise was made to cure the child's eyes, she broke off her tale.</p>
<p>&quot;'Oh, what have we done?' she cried.</p>
<p>'How could we have neglected the promise, that salve-cure that the lady said
she would give?' <A NAME="p77"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|77</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I was vexed at the carelessness, and bade some one run back quickly to
fetch it. Just as this was being done, the child, who was in her nurse's arms,
looked at her mother, and the mother looked at the child eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;'Stop,' she said, 'being vexed at the carelessness,'----she cried aloud
with joy and fright. 'For, see! Nothing of what was promised us is lacking! She
has indeed given her the true drug which cures disease; it is the healing that
comes from prayer. She has both given it and it has already proved efficacious,
and nothing is left of the affliction [998D] of the eye. It is all purged away
by that divine drug.'</p>
<p>&quot;And as she said this, she took up the child and laid her in my arms.
And I understood the marvels of the Gospel that hitherto had been incredible to
me and said----</p>
<p>&quot;'What is there surprising in the blind recovering their sight by the
hand of God, when now His handmaiden, accomplishing those cures by faith in Him,
has worked a thing not much inferior to those miracles?'&quot;</p>
<p>Such was his story; it was interrupted by <A NAME="p78"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|78</SPAN></A>
sobs, and tears choked his utterance, So much for the soldier and his tale.</p>
<p align="center">CONCLUSION</p>
<p>I do not think it advisable to add to my narrative all the similar things
that we heard from those who lived with her and knew her life accurately. For
most men judge what is [1000A] credible in the way of a tale by the measure of
their own experience. But what exceeds the capacity of the hearer, men receive
with insult and suspicion of falsehood, as remote from truth. Consequently I
omit that extraordinary agricultural operation in the famine time, how that the
corn for the relief of need, though constantly distributed, suffered no
perceptible diminution, remaining always in bulk the same as before it was
distributed to the needs of the suppliants. And after this there are happenings
still more surprising, of which I might tell. Healings of diseases, and castings
out of demons, and true predictions of the future. All are believed to be true,
even <A NAME="p79"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|79</SPAN></A> though apparently incredible,
by those who have investigated them accurately.</p>
<p>But by the carnally minded they are judged outside the possible. Those, I
mean, who do not know that according to the proportion of faith so is given the
distribution of spiritual gifts, little to those of little faith, much to those
[1000B] who have plenty of &quot;sea-room&quot; <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A><i>
</i>in their religion.</p>
<p>And so, lest the unbeliever should be injured by being led to disbelieve the
gifts of God, I have abstained from a consecutive narrative of these sublime
wonders, thinking it sufficient to conclude my life of Macrina with what has
been already said.</p>

<p><A NAME="#2"></A>2.&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> The use of the word
&quot;philosophy&quot; to designate Christianity is common in the writings of
the fourth century, and may perhaps be traced back to Origen's synthesis of the
Gospel and philosophy. It is employed in a twofold sense, of the Christian
religion generally and of asceticism in particular. Cf. Greg. Naz., <i>Or., </i>VII,
9 (describing the asceticism of his brother Cresarius): &quot;As philosophy is
the greatest, so is it the most difficult, of professions, which can be taken in
hand by but few, and only by those who have been called forth by the divine
magnanimity.&quot; See a careful note in Boulenger, <i>Gregoire de Nazianze,
Discours fun&egrave;bres </i>(Paris, 1908), p. lvi.</p>
