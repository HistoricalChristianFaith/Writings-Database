<h3 align="center">PREFACE.</h3>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>I.</SPAN>&nbsp;The Chronicle of
Joshua (Yeshua or Jesus) the Stylite has been long known to historians in the
abridged Latin translation of Joseph Simon Assemani, which occupies pp. 262-283
of the first volume of his <i>Bibliotheca Orientalis; </i>and it is generally
acknowledged to be one of the most valuable authorities for the period with
which it deals <A HREF="#1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>. The first complete edition of the
Syriac text did not, however, appear till 1876, when it was edited for the
German Oriental Society, with a French translation and many useful notes <A HREF="#2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>,
by the well known orientalist the Abbe P. Martin, to whose industry scholars are
indebted for various important Syriac publications.</p>
<p>That this <i>editio princeps </i>should be faulty in many respects was
unavoidable, partly from the fact that the editor had only a single not very
clearly written manuscript for the basis of his text, and partly because
circumstances prevented him from re-collating his copy with the original before
putting it to press. It was reviewed by Professor Noeldeke of Strassburg in the <i>Zeitschrift
der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft, </i>Bd xxx, pp. 351-8, where he
proposed many excellent emendations. Having read the book through several times
with pupils, I sent <A NAME="pvi"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|vi</SPAN></A> to Professor
Noeldeke a further list of corrections, shortly before the publication of his
Syriac Grammar in 1880, and we exchanged several letters on the subject. Since
then another friend, Professor Ignazio Guidi of Rome, has most kindly supplied
me with a fresh collation of the entire work; and I am thus enabled to lay a
tolerably correct text before the reader, without having much recourse to
conjectural emendation. If I have not described certain readings of my text as
corrections made by this or that scholar, it is because I have ascertained,
thanks to Guidi's unwearying kindness, that they are the actual readings of the
original manuscript. ... I have never altered the actual readings of the
manuscript, so far as I am aware, without giving due warning thereof in the
notes. I have, however, taken the liberty, with the view of facilitating the
task of the reader, of adding a considerable number of diacritical points,
especially in the verbal forms. From the interpunction of the manuscript, on the
other hand, I have but rarely deviated, and then only when it seemed to me to be
absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>In my translation I have striven to be as literal as the difference between
the two idioms will allow. My method is first to translate as closely as I can,
and then to try if I can improve the form of expression in any way without the
sacrifice of truthfulness to the original. I also endeavour to preserve a
somewhat antiquated and Biblical style, as being peculiarly adapted to the
rendering into English of Oriental works, whether poetical or historical. The
Old Testament and the Kor'an, <A NAME="pvii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|vii</SPAN></A>
which are, of course, in many ways strikingly similar in their diction, can both
be easily made ridiculous by turning them into our modern vernacular,
particularly if we vulgarize with malice prepense.</p>
<p>In my version I have sometimes expressed the sense of a conjectural
emendation rather than of the manuscript reading. The comparison of the Syriac
text and the critical notes will readily show the attentive reader when this is
the case. Words which I have found it necessary to add for the sake of the
English form of expression, or of greater clearness, I have commonly put within
parentheses ( ); but where an actual lacuna in the text is supplied by
conjecture, I have employed brackets [ ].</p>
<p>Of the notes I think it necessary to say no more than that they are intended
chiefly for non-orientalists and for those who are beginning their oriental
studies. It seemed to me to be quite superfluous to repeat the historical
information contained in the copious annotations of Assemani and of the Abbe
Martin. In matters relating to the topography of Edessa and its district I have
had recourse to my friend Professor G. Hoffmann of Kiel, who is probably the
best acquainted of living orientalists with the geography of Mesopotamia and the
adjacent countries. A comprehensive work on the subject from his hand would be a
boon to all scholars. The plan of Edessa is taken from Carsten Niebuhr's <i>Voyage
en Arabie, et en d'autres Pays circonvoisins, traduit de l'Allemand, </i>1780,
t. ii, p. 330, with additions and alterations suggested by Professor Hoffmann.
As for the rough map of the seat of war, it is only reproduced from an ordinary
atlas.</p>
<p>I have endeavoured, for the convenience of readers, to conform my edition in
externals, as far as possible, to that of the Abbe Martin; and I would therefore
have gladly adopted his numeration of the chapters, but found it to be
impossible. In the first place, I had to strike out his seventh chapter, which <A NAME="pviii"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|viii</SPAN></A>
is merely the final note of a scribe of much later date. This reduces the number
of chapters by one from VIII (now VII) to XCI (now XC). But, in the second
place, I had to unite his chapters XCI and XCII, the lacuna on p. 75 of his
edition being imaginary. Consequently the number of chapters from here to the
end is reduced by two, and Martin's ch. XCIII is in my edition XCI.</p>
<p><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>II.</SPAN>&nbsp;We owe the
preservation of the short Chronicle of Joshua the Stylite to the care of a later
historian, Dionysius of Tell-Mahre <A HREF="#3"><SUP>3</SUP></A>, patriarch of
the Jacobites (ob. A. Gr. 1156, A.D. 845) <A HREF="#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>, who
incorporated it with his own larger work, which deserves to be made accessible
to students of history without further delay <A HREF="#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>. The
solitary manuscript of this work which has come down to our times is preserved
in the Vatican Library <A HREF="#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>. It is in great part
palimpsest, the underlying text being Coptic. According to Assemani, <i>Bibl.
Orient, </i>t. ii, pp. 98, 99, it was written in the Nitrian desert when Moses
of Nisibis was abbot of the convent of S. Mary Deipara, that is to say, between
A.D. 907 and 944 (see my <i>Catalogue of Syriac MSS. in the British Museum,
General Index, </i>p. 1310); but in his <i>Catal. Codd. Manuscriptorum Biblioth.
Apostol. Vaticanae, </i>t. iii, p. 328, no. CLXII, he asserts that it was one of
those volumes which Moses of Nisibis brought back with him to the Nitrian
Convent in 932, after his visit to Baghdad and his journey through Mesopotamia <A HREF="#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>.
<A NAME="pix"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|ix</SPAN></A>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of Joshua we know little more than what he has himself thought fit to tell
us. He wrote his Chronicle at the request of one Sergius, the abbot of a convent
in the district of Edessa (ch. I), to whom he repeatedly addresses himself in
the course of it. The last date which occurs in it is 28th November A.D. 506 (ch.
C); and considering the tone of the final chapter, I have thought myself
justified in assigning the composition of the work to that winter and the
earlier part of the following year, which is also Noeldeke's opinion (<i>Zeitschrift
d. D. M. G., </i>Bd xxx, p. 352) <A HREF="#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A>. A more recent
copyist, who supplied a lacuna in the manuscript of Dionysius <A HREF="#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>,
adds some details regarding Joshua as follows (see Martin's edition, p. 8).</p>
<p>&quot;Pray for the wretched Elisha, from the convent of Zuknin (near Amid),
who wrote this leaf, that he may find grace like the thief on the right hand.
Amen and Amen. May the <A NAME="px"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|x</SPAN></A> mercy of the
great God and our Redeemer Jesus Christ be upon the priest Mar Yeshua (Joshua)
the stylite, from the convent of Zuknin, who wrote this Chronicle of the evil
times that are past, and of the calamities and troubles which the (Persian)
tyrant wrought among men.&quot;</p>
