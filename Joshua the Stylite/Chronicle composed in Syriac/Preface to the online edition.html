(1882).&nbsp; Preface to the online edition</b></p>
<hr>

<p>Wright's classic edition and translation of the Chronicle of Joshua the
Stylite needs little introduction.&nbsp; Often reprinted, it is a classic of
Oriental scholarship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Wright tells us in his introduction, the text survived embedded in the
surviving Chronicle of Dionysius of Tell-Mahre (or pseudo-Dionysius of Tell-Mahre
as we must now call him).&nbsp; Joshua's work forms part I of that text.&nbsp;
The single manuscript of this work is preserved in the Vatican library,
shelfmark Vat. Syr. 162.&nbsp; It contains 173 folios, and was brought there in
1715 by J. S. Assemani. He obtained it from the monastery of Deir al-Suryani
(St. Mary Deipara) in the Nitrian desert in Egypt, together with other
manuscripts which form the core of the Vatican collection.&nbsp; The remainder
of that library -- or nearly so -- was bought by Archdeacon Henry Tattam a
century later and forms the core of the rich collection in the British Library,
which the management of that institution keeps determinedly offline and for
microfilms of which it charges such unaffordable sums.&nbsp; Among these
manuscripts are the missing folios of Vat. Syr. 162, which are today British
Library Ms. Add. 14665, folios 1-7.&nbsp; Most of the manuscript is a
palimpsest, 123 of the Vatican and all the London folios being from a Greek
manuscript of the Old Testament written in the 7th-8th century.</p>
<p>The Syriac text of our Chronicle was written in the 9th century, possibly
early in the century, in Zuqnin, as the colophon on f.66v given by Wright makes
clear.&nbsp; It was taken to Egypt in 926-932 by the Archimandrite Moses of
Nisibis who collected 250 manuscripts from Syria and Mesopotamia and transported
them to Egypt.&nbsp; A copy of fol.44-152 of the Vatican ms. was made in 1867 by
Paulin Martin, the first editor, which is now in the Bibliotheque Nationale (ms.
Syr. 284, 285).&nbsp; This is valuable because the Vatican manuscript has
deteriorated since then, and is now illegible in passages copied by Martin.</p>
<p>Part III of the Chronicle of Pseudo-Dionysius of Tell-Mahre (also known as
the Chronicle of Zuqnin) has been translated into English by Witold Witakowski,
and published by Liverpool University Press in 1996 as Translated Texts for
Historians volume 22 (ISBN 0-85323-760-3, available from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0853237603/tertullianpro-20">Amazon.com</a>
and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0853237603/thetertulli0d-21">Amazon.co.uk</a>
for $25).&nbsp; The notes on the manuscript
given above have been abbreviated from this.&nbsp; He also lists translations in
other modern languages that exist for parts I, II and IV of Ps.Dionysius.</p>

<p>I have found it necessary to make a few changes in making this text available
online.&nbsp; All the Syriac text has been omitted, the index, and most of the
footnotes as these are mainly concerned with details of the Syriac.&nbsp; The
Syriac text is in the West Syriac script (Serto) and unfortunately I lack the
ability to transcribe even a letter of this.&nbsp; I have also omitted any
inline Greek or other unnecessary reference to the original language.&nbsp; So
for instance the word 'general' when referring to the Persians is usually
followed by '(<i>marzeban</i>)': this I have omitted.</p>

<p>Because I was obliged to interfere so much with the text, I have felt able to
interfere a little more, and make two further changes.&nbsp; Wright translated
the Syriac word for 'Romans' as 'Greeks'.&nbsp; While this might be reasonable
five or six centuries later, in 500 AD the word certainly means 'Romans'.&nbsp;
I have therefore replaced the word 'Greeks' with 'Romans' wherever it appears.</p>
<p>The other change is a first for this site: I have modernised the translation.
This has involved removing the thee's and thou's, and minor changes of that
kind.</p>
<p>The text is very useful for the war between the Romans and Persians in
the time of Anastasius I, written in the region of Edessa.&nbsp; A more modern
translation does exist, but I hope that making this one available online will
encourage more interest in this period, and indeed in what Syriac sources have
to tell us.</p>

    Richard Burgess in LT-ANTIQ adds: &quot;Parts three and four have also been translated
    [into English] ... [the volume] contains notes as well as a complete collation of Chabot's
    edition with the two surviving manuscripts in the Vatican and the BL. This collation provides not only corrections to Chabot's text but also
    provides additional material that would normally appear in an apparatus criticus but was missed by Chabot.&quot;
