<h2 id='tocuniq3'>Prologus.</h2>

The Apostle Paul appointed Titus as bishop; and therefore he advises him to be diligent in the ecclesiastical ordination: that is, to discern those who present themselves as worthy with a certain pretense in order to obtain a higher position; and also to rebuke the heretics who promote circumcision.

<h2 id='tocuniq4'>Caput I.</h2>



<h2 id='tocuniq5'>(Vers. 1-4.)</h2>

(Vers. 1-4.) Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledgment of the truth which accords with godliness, in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began, but has in due time manifested His word through preaching, which was committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior; To Titus, my true son in our common faith. Grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. The decree declares the gift from God, which He had promised before the ages and has now been revealed at the time of the Savior in the preaching of the Apostles; for thus He had promised. He also says that it has been entrusted to him, in order to make known to the Gentiles the predestined mercy of God; so that even Titus, his true son, that is, according to the Gospel (for this is true, which is eternal), diligently preaches the grace of God and peace, so that they may become at peace with God and the Father by receiving the gift; for all things are from Him, and through Christ Jesus our Savior, for He Himself has delivered us from death.


<h2 id='tocuniq6'>(Vers. 5-11.)</h2>

(Vers. 5-11.) For this reason I left you in Crete, that you might put in order what remained, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you: if any man is above reproach, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of dissipation or rebellion. For the overseer must be above reproach as God’s steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not fond of sordid gain, but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, just, devout, self-controlled, holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict. For there are indeed many who are disobedient, empty talkers and deceivers, particularly those of the circumcision party. They must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach for the sake of dishonest gain. One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith, not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth. To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled. They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work. For indeed, those who were Christians in name only were not pure; for they wanted to both honor the Law and honor Christ. He says these things about those who were destroying households with their corrupt teaching. For they were eager for shameful gains in two ways; namely, they did these things in order to please the Jews, from whom they hoped to receive expenses, so that they could profit financially and physically. These were their profits, just as the Lord says to the Jews: You travel over land and sea to make a single proselyte (Matthew 23:15). He calls these two shameful gains; because he who teaches under the name of God, not for the sake of devotion, but for profit, is a shameful seeker of gain: likewise also he who wants to acquire something through circumcision. Therefore, elsewhere it says: And their glory is in their shame (Philippians 3:19).

<h2 id='tocuniq7'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>

(Verse 12, 13.) A certain one among them, who was their own prophet, said: 'Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.' This testimony is true. A certain one from the Cretans, who was improved through the teaching of the Lord, expressed what should be thought about the uneducated Cretans, that they were both evil and lazy, wanting to eat. For they desired to be nourished by wickedness, who, although they are of no benefit, are eager to harm. Therefore, it is a twofold evil. These were the Cretans; hence he calls him a prophet, but in the case of the Cretans. For he asserts that he spoke truly to them as a prophet; for it is impossible for a prophet to lie.

<h2 id='tocuniq8'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) For this reason, argue with them harshly, that they may be sound in the faith, not paying attention to Jewish fables and the commandments of men who turn away from the truth. Instruct them to rebuke those people, that they may be converted and follow what is just and worthy of God's law, turning away from Jewish fables. For in the Law, they find justification before God, even more so in the commandments of men! For whatever is opposed to the truth is a human invention; for they are ignorant of the power of the Scriptures and the inner meaning of the words of the Law, they follow the appearance, not the taste. Therefore, myths are said to tell stories, not truth; for they think that one should never deviate from what Moses handed down, such as concerning foods, or unions, or new moons, or the blood of a weasel, or a house unclean for seven days; whereas their leaders, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were justified and called friends of God without these things; and the prophet Ezekiel testifies that they received precepts and commands that were not good because they profaned the law of God and his justifications, in which they could not be justified. And so the Lord says to the Jews: Because of the hardness of your heart Moses wrote these things (Mark 10:5). Hence it is that Peter the apostle also says: Why do you impose a yoke upon the necks of the brethren, which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear (Acts 15:10)? For if they had been useful, they would have been given when the Law was given on the tablets; but because after so many signs and wonders, and the Law being given, they were found disrespectful, distrustful, and stiff-necked, they received such great and burdensome commandments in which they could not breathe. From this it happened that both the good labored with the wicked, to receive their reward. Therefore these things were given for vengeance, so that at the time when the promise of God arrived, the mercy of God would relax everything that He had previously forbidden. The Jews, not understanding this, remain under the yoke, and willingly bind themselves with these chains; and therefore he warns them to turn away from these things and be admonished.

<h2 id='tocuniq9'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) Indeed, all things are clean to the pure: but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is clean; but both their mind and conscience are defiled. These people signify those who know and understand the reasons why certain things are prohibited and later allowed. For if it is written in Genesis that everything God created is good (Genesis 1:31), there is no doubt that they are also clean. But those who do not understand are unclean; for they are accusers of Scripture. For if good deeds are read, why are they forbidden as if they were accursed? If they are not accursed, because they are good; they are known to be forbidden because of the hardness of the heart, because they are considered unworthy to benefit from all of God's creation. For those who are seen to be prohibited from better things, their mind and conscience are corrupted; because they accuse the creature of God in order to excuse themselves.

<h2 id='tocuniq10'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16.) They profess to know God, but they deny Him by their deeds; since they are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work. Although this statement applies to all heretics, it is specifically referring to the Jews who claim to know only the God of Abraham, but deny Him by their actions, as the Lord says: 'If you were children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham' (John 8:39). Therefore, how can they claim to know the God of Abraham when they are ignorant of His mystery and faith, not following the works of the Gospel, but disturbing others with their observance of the law, circumcision, and other practices, behaving impiously and without reverence? These are the works that do not know God.

<h2 id='tocuniq11'>Caput II.</h2>



<h2 id='tocuniq12'>(Vers. 1)</h2>

(Version 1) But you, speak the things that befit sound doctrine. This is the knowledge of God, which is called sound doctrine; for the doctrine of God is saving.

<h2 id='tocuniq13'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(V. 2.) The elders should be sober, serious, prudent, sound in faith, love, and patience. He shows who they should be of sound doctrine, in order to indicate that those who are less sober, less serious, unbelieving, lacking in charity, impatient, and disciples of unsound doctrine. By their works, God is not known, nor is his righteousness.

<h2 id='tocuniq14'>(Vers. 3, 4, 5.)</h2>

(Verses 3, 4, 5.) An old woman likewise, in a dignified manner, not slanderous, not enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good, so that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be wise, pure, homemakers, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be blasphemed. The elders are to be such that they are an example of good conduct to the younger ones, so that if they have unbelieving husbands, they may be won over by their behavior without a word, as they observe the purity and reverence of their lives.


<h2 id='tocuniq15'>(Vers. 6, 7, 8.)</h2>

(Verses 6, 7, 8.) Likewise, exhort the younger to be self-controlled, presenting yourself as a model of good works in all things, in teaching, in integrity, in seriousness, sound speech that is beyond reproach, so that those who oppose us may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say about us. Because young people tend to exceed the bounds, or rather, are more prone to stumble, they are therefore commanded to be contained by wholesome restraints, so that they may be governed by the unrestrained divine laws. He insists that in order for something not to be difficult or challenging, there should be a teacher; that the teacher should demonstrate how the things he teaches are done; that those who are ignorant and enemies of the faith may be ashamed, seeing that he proves with actions that what he teaches with words is true.

<h2 id='tocuniq16'>(Vers. 9, 10,)</h2>

(Verse 9, 10,) Servants to be obedient to their masters in all things, well-pleasing, not answering back, not pilfering, but showing all good faith, that they may adorn the doctrine of our Savior God in all things. For the doctrine of the Lord is to be adorned with good works and faith; for then is the doctrine pleasing, if he who professes it does not make it hateful by denying it in his actions, but lovely and true; for what is true cannot be unseemly. When, therefore, the words are fulfilled by subsequent actions, they are shown to be true, and by this means, honorable. Then masters can not only not prohibit their servants from faith, but also rejoice; because they see that their faith also benefits themselves. For no one who keeps the faith of God can be unfaithful to men.

<h2 id='tocuniq17'>(Vers. 11, 12.)</h2>

(Vers. 11, 12.) For the grace of God our Savior has appeared to all people, teaching us to renounce impiety and worldly desires, and to live temperately, justly, and devoutly in this age. He says that the gift of God has appeared to people through Christ, that is, the truth of the one God manifested in Christ, so that we may profess the Creator in the unity of the Trinity: something that was previously hidden from the human race, but now has been revealed through God's mercy. By avoiding the darkness of error, which is ignorance and impiety of the world, let us be found as pious ones who acknowledge God as the Father of all, confessing Him in the truth that the Gospel of His Son teaches. And in order to receive the reward of this, let us do good works. For how can those who only proclaim the Father have any hope if they do not also profess the Son in the same truth? Similarly, the hope of this person is in vain who only has a profession of faith without good works.

<h2 id='tocuniq18'>(Vers. 13, 14, 15.)</h2>

(Verses 13, 14, 15.) We await the blessed hope and the coming of the glory of our blessed God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good works. This is said to be the blessed hope of believers, because they await the coming of the glory of the great God, which will be revealed by Christ, the judge, in whom the power and glory of God the Father will be seen, so that they may obtain the reward of their faith. For Christ indeed redeemed us in order that, following a pure life, filled with good works, we may be heirs of the kingdom of God. Speak these things and exhort and rebuke with full authority. Let no one despise you.

<h2 id='tocuniq19'>Caput III.</h2>



<h2 id='tocuniq20'>(Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Ver. 1, 2.) Admonish them to be subject to the principalities and powers, to obey their commands, to be prepared for every good work. He warns of the salvation of believers, so that when they are accused, they may know for whose benefit they are being attacked: so that they may not take it harshly, being certain that they are being corrected for their own well-being: and so that they may be slow to do evil, but ready for good, not ignorant of what each one must repay.

<h2 id='tocuniq21'>(Vers. 2.)</h2>

(Ver. 2.) Do not blaspheme anyone, be non-argumentative; but be modest, showing all meekness to all people. Christians want to appear humble to all people; for in this way they can be called faithful to the hope of the future.

<h2 id='tocuniq22'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3) Once we were foolish and disobedient, wandering, serving various desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, detestable, hating one another. These blessings that unbelief does not have, it recalls them as given to Christians; so that shining in all righteousness, they may be made manifest as worshippers of God. For while once foolish, now they seem to be of sound judgment in all things, and God is praised in them.


<h2 id='tocuniq23'>(Vers. 4-7.)</h2>

(Verses 4-7.) But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. This good that seems to flourish among Christians originates from the root of divine piety; for God, through his mercy, saved us by Christ, by whose grace we are born again and receive the Holy Spirit abundantly, so that we may rely on good works, with his help in all things, in order to attain the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven through them. Therefore, we should serve Him with all devotion and obey His commandments, because whatever is beautiful in us, He paints with spiritual features.

<h2 id='tocuniq24'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>

(Verse 8.) Faithful saying: and I want you to affirm these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works. These things are good and beneficial for people. There is nothing so evident, because mercy and kindness are good for the present and useful for the future; and here in this, there is praise, and on the day of judgment, a crown. For everyone who believes in God must strive for mercy, by which they live. So, in order to be concerned for these things, the leader of the people is admonished.


<h2 id='tocuniq25'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>

(Verse 9.) But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. He calls these foolish questions, which have no effect on salvation, nor contribute any expertise to usefulness. By these words, he denotes the doctrines of many heretics. Although all things that are not true are to be called foolish, yet there is one who introduces fabulous things, and another who cunningly presents a matter full of poison, as Arius and Photinus do. However, fabulous is not a law, but a heresy, as it pertains to the time of the Jews when some of them claimed a prerogative of the origins of the patriarchs, which arose from marriages, although there is no merit in this before God. Indeed, some considered the baptism of pitchers and other vessels, and the blood of a weasel to be greatly purged (Leviticus 11:29). And because Moses' burial was hidden, so as not to be disturbed by the magicians, if it were true, the burial of other saints should also have been hidden. And because Solomon built the temple with the help of demons, in which a vast multitude labored, what is more fabulous than that?


<h2 id='tocuniq26'>(Vers. 10, 11.)</h2>

(Verses 10, 11.) Avoid the heretical man after the first correction, knowing that he is perverse in this way, and condemned by his own self. These are the heretics who attack the Law of the Law through words; for they establish their own meaning to the words of the Law, so that they may commend the wickedness of their own mind by the authority of the Law. For they know that impiety carries great weight under the authority of the Law, they create deception under its name; so that because an evil thing cannot be acceptable in itself, it may be commended by the goodness of its name. Therefore, he says that men of this kind should be admonished once, so that, being admonished more frequently, they may become more practiced in evil. However, he seems to compel those whom he often admonishes, so that they may become more eager for the destruction of many: therefore, they are to be dismissed, so that they may become more negligent and perhaps perish alone.

<h2 id='tocuniq27'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12.) When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make haste to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. After I have sent this letter, I also want to see you for personal reasons, and to strengthen you further in the ecclesiastical discipline.

<h2 id='tocuniq28'>(Vers. 13, 14.)</h2>

(Vers. 13, 14.) Send ahead Zenas the lawyer and Apollo diligently, so that nothing is lacking to them; but let them also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses, so that they may not be unfruitful. Both of these men are distinguished in wisdom and deeds; and therefore, he commands that necessary expenses be given to them by those who have believed, so that they may be refreshed; for it was fitting that those who imparted spiritual things should not lack material things for themselves. Although he calls Zenas the lawyer, Apollo was also proficient in the Scriptures: But because Zenas had belonged to this profession in the Synagogue, he is called by that name.


<h2 id='tocuniq29'>(Vers. 15.)</h2>

(Verse 15.) All those who are with me greet you. By way of abbreviation, they all signify their greeting together. Greet those who love us in the faith. He desires that they should seem worthy of his greeting who love him faithfully with the affection of our Lord Jesus Christ. The grace of God be with all of you. Now he greets all the brothers and the household of Titus in general.
