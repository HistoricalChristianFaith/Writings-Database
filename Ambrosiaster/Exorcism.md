Almighty Lord, Word of God the Father, Christ Jesus, God and Lord of all creatures, who gave your holy apostles the power to tread upon serpents and scorpions: who among other marvelous things commanded, 'Cast out the devils' (cf. Matthew 10:8); by whose power Satan fell like lightning from heaven: I humbly pray to your name with fear and trembling, that you, with unworthy me, having been granted forgiveness of all sins, may deign to give me confidence and opportunity; that, fortified by the power of your arm, I may faithfully and securely approach this cruel dragon. I adjure you, therefore, every unclean spirit, every phantom, every attack of Satan, in the power of the name of Christ, who, after the baptism in the Jordan, was led into the desert, and there conquered you; so that you, whom He formed from the clay of the earth for the glory of His name, may cease your assault, and tremble not at the frailty of a wretched human being, but at the image of the almighty God. Yield, therefore, to God, who reduced you to servitude in His humiliated servant Job; yield to God, who plunged you and your host into the abyss in Pharaoh, and his army, through His servant Moses; yield to God, who destroyed you in Beel through His servant Daniel, and prostrated you in the dragon; yield to God, who expelled you with spiritual songs through His most faithful servant David from Saul the king; yield to God, who condemned you in Judas the traitor. For he now torments you with divine lashes, in whose presence you trembled and cried out with your legions: What have we to do with you, Jesus son of David? Have you come to torment us before the time? (Matthew 8:29) He presses you with eternal flames, who at the end of time will say to the wicked: Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. (Matthew 25:41) For you and your angels, the never-ending worm awaits, for you and your angels the unquenchable fire is prepared; for you, cursed one, are the prince of murder, the author of incest, the head of sacrilege, the master of the worst arts, the teacher of heretics, the inventor of all obscenities. Go forth, therefore, impious one, go forth, wicked one, go forth with all your deception; for God desired man to be His temple. But why do you delay any longer? Give honor to God the Father almighty, before whom every knee bows: give place to Christ Jesus, who shed His blood for man; give place to the Holy Spirit, who made you known through His blessed apostle Peter in Simon, who condemned your deception in Ananias and Sapphira, who struck you in King Herod for not giving honor to God, who poured out the darkness of blindness upon you through His apostle Paul in the wicked magician, and through the same commanded you to depart from the Pythoness by His word. Depart now, depart deceiver; for the desert is your dwelling, the serpent is your habitation. Humble yourself, prostrate yourself: now is not the time for delay. Behold, the Lord and master approaches, swiftly the fire will blaze before him, and he will ignite his enemies all around. If you deceive man, you cannot mock the Lord. He casts you out, to whose eyes nothing is hidden; he expels you, to whose power all things are subject; he excludes you, who has prepared eternal Gehenna for you and your angels, from whose mouth will come a two-edged sword, who is coming in the Holy Spirit to judge the world by fire, amen.
