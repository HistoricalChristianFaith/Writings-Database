<h2 id='tocuniq3'>Prologue</h2>
In order that he may exhort others to growth in faith by the example of these, namely the Thessalonians, he praises them for remaining in the received grace and for having grown in the pursuit of better things in order to obtain the rewards of progress. He encourages them to strive for perfection, so that the dignity sought by their virtues may provoke others. For they had embraced the spirit of such great faith that they endured the persecutions inflicted on them for the name of Christ with devoted hearts, even the persecutions brought upon them by their fellow citizens, the Macedonians, in hope of what is to come. So that he may express their merit and his joy from their progress in letters, he writes to them as follows:
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq4'>Chapter I.</h2>
<h2 id='tocuniq5'>(Vers. 1.)</h2>
(Version 1.) Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ: grace to you and peace. Indeed, the names of three bishops are mentioned in the letter, but the thoughts and words are those of the Apostle alone. For, because they rejoice together in their progress, the letter is written to the people with the consent of the Apostle, wishing them peace and grace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq6'>(Vers. 2, 3.)</h2>
(Vers. 2, 3.) We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers, constantly remembering your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father. For all good things are from God, therefore they first give thanks to Him for their progress, who has deemed it worthy not only to give his gift to people under sin, but to adopt them as his children, at the same time assisting them in enduring all destruction, so that they may become more worthy. Therefore, they say that they remember these things in their speeches because they were increasing in the work of faith in the other churches, in order to complete the work that had been started by the will of God. They were eager in the pursuit of love, patience, and the hope of the coming of the Lord, which is before God, who deigned to incarnate his Son for the salvation of humanity. For it is pleasing to God if progress is made in Christ.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq7'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>
(Verse 4, 5.) Knowing, beloved brothers chosen by God, your election; because our Gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much fullness, as you know what kind of people we were among you for your sake. They indicate that they were humble among them, so that they would give them a form of gentleness, not because they lacked the great things that would encourage them to faith, because the strength of the gospel teachings provided the power of signs and wonders, in the Holy Spirit, that is, not in illusion, but in the truth of fullness, so that no need would lack assistance; but abundant grace would appear in both teaching and conduct, and in the healing of the sick; so that the perfect work of the Holy Spirit would appear in the churches of the Thessalonians, so that they would rejoice in the gift of God, who deigned to make them participants in the promise of Abraham.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq8'>(Vers. 6, 7.)</h2>
(Vers. 6, 7.) And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, receiving the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit, so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. For you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews, who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and displease God and oppose all mankind by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved - so as always to fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them at last! (1 Thessalonians 2:14-16) Being mindful of this thing, they rejoiced in the hope of the promise in their distress. Therefore, there is great exhortation for progress, when he says that both Christ and the apostles made themselves similar to provide an example to the rest of the believers in those places where their fame spread.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq9'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>
(Verse 8.) For from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out, so that we have no need to say anything. For they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, that is Jesus, who rescues us from the wrath to come.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq10'>(Vers. 9, 10.)</h2>
(Verse 9, 10.) So that we do not need to speak about ourselves. They themselves announce about us, about the kind of entrance we had to you: and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the coming wrath. They say that they have spread the fame of their entrance and their conduct with the preaching of the Gospel, so that it is not necessary to speak of it; for it is superfluous to speak of things that are well-known. For the news of the apostles' arrival had spread to all the surrounding areas. And those who had received them with devotion eagerly shared the message with others. They had become more receptive to everything they had heard from the apostles, and thus abandoned their dead idols. They now eagerly awaited the arrival of Christ from heaven, whom they had heard had died for the sake of human salvation and had risen victorious over death. They believed that he had ascended, with his flesh, into heaven in a cloud, which served to confound the worldly wise. These individuals, who consider worldly matters, believe that the weight of the flesh prevents it from being raised up to heaven. By this affection, the Holy Spirit is made so that the wise of the world may be put to shame.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq11'>Chapter II.</h2>
<h2 id='tocuniq12'>(Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>
(Vers. 1, 2.) For you yourselves know, brothers, that our coming to you was not in vain. But after we had already suffered and been treated with contempt in Philippi, as you know, we had the boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in the midst of great opposition. The affliction that he now mentions (Acts 16:16 and following) he suffered in Philippi with Silas because of the spirit of divination that a girl had, which has already been mentioned in its proper place. He who did not yield to pressures, but was found to be stronger, while he dares to preach and does not fear to speak, certainly in hope of the promised reward; so that even these may be secure in persecutions, rejoicing because of the future reward. Therefore, this is said to be the sign of a devoted and faithful preacher, if in distress he does not fear to speak the word of God, signifying thereby the empty one who suffers present fear of preaching. For he who is secure in the hope that has been promised does not yield in order to be crowned.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq13'>(Vers. 3, 4.)</h2>
(Vers. 3, 4.) For our exhortation is not based on deceit, or impurity, or idolatry, but as we have been approved by God; in order to be entrusted with the Gospel, we speak, not to please people, but God, who examines our hearts. This is why he speaks against false apostles, who preach with deceit and deception, not sent by God, in order to deceive the nations into serving the law of works. But this person, who is chosen and sent, proves himself through many actions; for he is found stronger in times of distress, and blameless in his conduct; so that there would be nothing in him that appears unworthy of God, with accompanying signs. For some were preaching Christ for the sake of gain, serving the favor of men; because they were more lenient in arguing, since they had no authority, and in tribulation they were weak; because their words were not from the heart, but in deceit. For everyone who does something without hope, succumbs when tribulation arises.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq14'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>
(Verse 5.) For we have never conducted ourselves in flattery, as you know, nor in opportunity for greed. God is witness. Now he reveals what he has already signified, when he says: Not in opportunity for greed, giving God as witness, because he did this from the heart, not in hypocrisy, as if despising little things so that perhaps more would be offered. Therefore, it is fitting for them as well, knowing and approving that no one was deceived; for the false apostles desired to be given the appearance of greed, so that by the opportunity itself, while they see true apostles receiving all things brought, they could themselves plunder simpler men without envy.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq15'>(Vers. 6, 7.)</h2>
(Verses 6, 7.) Neither seeking glory from men, nor from you, nor from others; although we could have asserted our authority as Christ's apostles among you. It burdens the pseudo-apostles to the extent that they deny themselves, even though they were entitled to receive honor from those who had neither ability nor shame, yet demanded honor for themselves; for they wanted to be commended themselves rather than the doctrine of God. However, the apostle who sought glory not for the present but for the future, made himself humble so that the preaching of God may be exalted.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq16'>(Vers. 8.)</h2>
(Verse 8.) But we were little children among you, as if a nurse cherishes her own children; so desiring you, we desire to impart to you not only the Gospel of God, but also our own souls; for you have become very dear to us. He shows so much affection towards them (which, because it is true, he wants to be proven not only by words but also by actions; for there can be deception in words), that, provoked by these exhortations, the apostles have their entire being in love.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq17'>(Vers. 9.)</h2>
(Verse 9.) For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: we worked night and day so as not to burden any of you. This is what he says in the Acts of the Apostles: 'All that was necessary for me and those with me, these hands have provided.' And in another letter he says, 'Whoever does not work should not eat.' And he says this against false apostles, who pretended to be preachers while living in idleness and indulging in food. So, in order to give an example of how Christian life should be governed and to benefit others, he dedicated himself to human labor, overshadowing the false apostles. Furthermore, those who engage in labor turn away from evil thoughts, occupying their minds and guarding against dangers.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq18'>(Vers. 10, 11, 12.)</h2>
(Verses 10, 11, 12.) We preached to you the Gospel of God. You are witnesses, as is God Himself, of how holy and righteous and blameless we were among you who believed. You know how we treated each one of you, like a father caring for his own children, urging, comforting, and urging you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who called you into His kingdom and glory. These things are evident, for they remind them of how they believed when we preached to them, and of the experiences they had with us, and the commands we gave them, so that they may be worthy of God who called them from earth to heaven, that He may raise their joy.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq19'>(Vers. 13.)</h2>
(Verse 13) Therefore, we also give thanks to God without ceasing, because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it truly is, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe. We give thanks to God, who has opened their understanding to receive His gospel. For the glory of those who preach is when those who hear readily believe; for they received the word with such devotion that they proved themselves to have understood that it is the teaching of God.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq20'>(Vers. 14, 15, 16.)</h2>
(Vers. 14, 15, 16.) For, brethren, ye have become imitators of the churches of God which are in Judaea in Christ Jesus: for ye also suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews; who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove out us, and pleased not God, and are contrary to all men; forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always. But the wrath of God came upon them at the uttermost. He complains about the impiety and credulity of the distrustful Jews, who are not only enemies of their own salvation, but also of others, prohibiting them from believing and being saved, from the beginning of being parricides; for they should have spared the common Lord, who did not spare his own subjects and superiors: so that their sins may be filled up, to such an extent that they may never deserve to obtain mercy. Therefore, he says that the Thessalonians suffered the same things from their fellow citizens, imitating the patience of the saints and of our Lord Jesus Christ. He introduces the Jews as the authors of this crime, so that it may be recognized how much glory those are worthy of who suffer for the name of the Lord, and what vengeance is prepared for the hostile and unbelieving.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq21'>(Vers. 17, 18.)</h2>
(Vers. 17, 18.) But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire. Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us. Being separated from them through bodily absence, not in affection; for love cannot be divided nor separated: but they say that they desire to see their face for greater instruction. In fact, in divine matters, articles are lacking to comprehend what can be said; for a day is not sufficient to write down what can be expressed in one hour; and let me not say that there are certain mystical aspects of our religion that, due to sensual desires, should not be easily made public in order to avoid scandal. For not all things should be said to everyone, but words should be moderated according to the understanding of each individual, differently for the inexperienced and differently for the learned. Therefore, the presence of the body is required; for in this way the truth of charity is perfected. Although charity is not divided, the absence of the body creates longing: ultimately, the will is fulfilled by a kiss and embrace of souls. Satan, who also reached out his hands to the apostles, claimed to be an obstacle to this matter; so that the reason for truth would not be revealed to men. For he ignited the minds of the treacherous, so that they would detain them with beatings and chains; so that they would not speak the word of God. For the elders of the Jews said to the apostles, 'Did we not strictly command you not to speak in the name of Jesus to those men?' (Acts 5:40). But because what is not from God cannot stand, the obstacles of Satan are dissolved.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq22'>(Vers. 19, 20.)</h2>
(Verse 19, 20.) For what is our hope or joy or crown of glory? Are you not before our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming? For you are our glory and joy. It is evident that the perfection of disciples is the joy and crown of the teacher. For these are the ones who will bear the fruit of their labor; for the fruit of the teacher is the obedient disciple, whose good conduct benefits the teacher, and the fruit of the disciple is the labor that they produce. For the labor of the disciple in good work gives a crown to the master, with Christ as the judge.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq23'>Chapter III.</h2>
<h2 id='tocuniq24'>(Vers. 1-4.)</h2>
(Vers. 1-4.) Therefore, no longer able to endure, we decided it was best to be left alone in Athens: and we sent our brother Timotheus, a minister of God in the Gospel of Christ, to establish you and to encourage you concerning your faith, so that no one would be disturbed by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are appointed to this task. For even while we were with you, we predicted that we would suffer affliction, as it has happened, and you know. He expressed the causes mentioned above. Therefore, they wanted to be present among them in order to strengthen their spirits; so that none of them would suffer scandal from the pressures of the apostles, who performed such great signs but were sometimes weakened; thus humiliated, they were subjected to beatings and chains. In order to excuse this matter, Timothy, a suitable teacher, was sent, who would show that the merits of Christians increase from here if they give thanks for suffering for the name of the Lord, from whom they expect the reward for this matter, and at the same time pour out prayers to God, that they may be steadfast. They had predicted that they would undergo such persecution, in order to demonstrate through their knowledge of this matter that they could escape and avoid these injustices, but because there is great hope in them, therefore he says that they willingly endure the inflicted ones.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq25'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>
(Verse 5) Therefore, even I, not tolerating it any longer, sent to know your faith; lest by any means the tempter have tempted you, and our labor be in vain.  For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor be in vain. That is why he says this, concerning certain ones, who could be deceived by the cunning of Satan; for in every group there is a strong part and a weak part, for whom he was concerned, lest he should lose the fruit of their faith. And because he could no longer bear not knowing what was happening with them, he sent Timothy, a bishop appointed by him, so that he could have certainty.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq26'>(Vers. 6, 7, 8.)</h2>
(Verses 6, 7, 8.) Now when Timothy came to us from you and brought us news of your faith and love and reported that you always have good memories of us, longing to see us as we also long to see you, therefore we have been comforted, brothers, in you, in all our distress and affliction, through your faith; for now we really live, if you stand firm in the Lord. He explains why he writes to them in a joyful tone; for when the messenger arrived and the Apostle learned of their firm devotion in faith and love, he was delighted by their unity and writes to them, confident in the fruit of their faith and good conduct.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq27'>(Vers. 9, 10.)</h2>
(Verses 9, 10.) For what thanks can we render to God for you, in return for all the joy with which we rejoice on your account before our God, night and day, praying exceedingly, that we may see your face and supply what is lacking in your faith? There is nothing so worthy that it can suffice as a compensation for the salvation of the Gentiles that has been acquired. And since they had advanced in the perseverance of faith and the action of a better life, he desires more and more to see them, so that they may learn those things that pertain to the perfection of a thousand, namely the sacraments of spiritual things, which should not be easily made public; so that they may know who and how immense is He whom they hoped for as their judge. For it is one thing to accept the faith, and another to interpret the faith; for one is a discussion about the nature of the Father and the Son, and another about the persons. The Father is uncreated, but the Son is created: as far as the persons are concerned, they appear to be different, since there is an individual unity of nature; for unity is not in the person, but in the substance. However, the Holy Spirit should not be considered different; for He is considered the third. Therefore, whoever is not in doubt about the second person, also admits the third.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq28'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>
(Verse 11.) But may God himself, our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, guide our way to you. He requests that his journey be arranged in proper order, first by God the Father, for everything is from him; then by the Lord Jesus Christ, through whom everything exists. May the power and providence of the Father and the Son commend his arrival, and may it be pleasing to those who hear him, and may the obstacles of the devil be overcome in order to guide his journey.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq29'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>
(Vers. 12, 13.) May the Lord multiply you and make love abound among you and towards all, just as it does towards us in you, to strengthen your hearts in blameless holiness before God our Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints. He desires to multiply their joy, in which He rejoices over them, and to have it overflow to all good works. He wants to find even more in them when He comes, worthy of praise, than what He had heard from Timothy. He wants them to be found blameless with the saints in the love of God the Father, and at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, when He begins to judge each one on His tribunal. He calls God because of the terror of His majesty: but He calls Him Father because of the goodness by which He deigns to adopt believers as His children, which will be manifested in the coming of the Lord.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq30'>Chapter IV.</h2>
<h2 id='tocuniq31'>(Vers. 1.)</h2>
(Verse 1.) Therefore, brethren, we beg and beseech you in the Lord Jesus, that as you have received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more. This is what I said above, that he wants them to increase in good works according to the apostolic commandments, to accumulate their joy.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq32'>(Vers. 2-6.)</h2>
(Verse 2-6.) For you know what precepts I have given you through our Lord Jesus. For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from fornication; that each one of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor, not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles who do not know God; and that no one overstep and defraud his brother in any matter, because the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as we have forewarned you and testified. Although he praises them throughout the entire letter, he warns them not to be led astray by any deceit and not to seek revenge, which they have learned is the punishment of evils. Knowing that this pleases God, if they keep their bodies undefiled and behave sincerely with their brothers, so that they are not found to be like the Gentiles and thus be rejected from the name of adoption.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq33'>(Vers. 7, 8.)</h2>
(Vers. 7, 8.) For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness. Therefore, whoever rejects these things does not reject man, but God, who has also given us his Holy Spirit. To emphasize this, he adds the person of God, saying: He does not reject man who disregards the commandments, but God. He says that God has given us the Holy Spirit so that we may live holy lives; for the Holy Spirit does not reside in a body that is subject to sin (Wisdom 1:4).
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq34'>(Vers. 9, 10.)</h2>
(Verses 9, 10.) However, concerning brotherly love, we do not have a need to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another (John 15:17). For indeed, you do this toward all the brothers throughout Macedonia. Although he praises them for doing this, he also admonishes them to do it more fervently; for he indicates that those who are taught by God himself should be more ready in brotherly love. For because of His great love, God had mercy on us, and having become imitators of Him, we have shown ourselves rightfully adopted by God as His children.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq35'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>
(Verse 11) But we urge you, brothers, to abound more and to strive to be quiet and to mind your own business and work with your hands, as we instructed you. So that you may walk properly before outsiders and be dependent on no one. Again, he urges the same, that you excel in good deeds and work diligently. For this is pleasing to God and he reminds us of this frequently. For the path of righteousness must be followed in order to come to mercy by right. Those who are of lesser means should labor with their hands. By their very intention, they should be lifted from common restlessness and wrong thinking, so that their discipline may also be praised by unbelievers and they may be provoked to faith.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq36'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>
(Verses 12, 13.) But we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus. It is clear, because if the resurrection of the dead is believed to be future, those who go forth with the sign of the cross should not be mourned. Truly, those who pass from here into Gehenna are the ones who should be mourned, so that they may learn that what they refused to believe is true. But the faithful will rise again to glory, so that those who in this world were considered foolish because of their faith may be seen as prudent; for they have provided for themselves glory. These are the ones who, through Jesus, that is, going out in the hope of this faith, will be brought with him in his coming; so that they may be seen by men. Yet, even though he himself prevents mourning over the departure of the deceased, he himself says elsewhere: 'I should not have sadness' (Philip. 2:27). But now it is explained in its proper place.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq37'>(Vers. 14-17.)</h2>
(Verse 14-17.) For we say this to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord Himself, with a word of command, with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. Therefore console yourselves with each other in these words. The sense of the Lord reveals Himself, when He says: We tell you this by the order of the Lord. For He explains in what manner the future will be, by the command of Judge Christ, with the holy Spirit revealing; so that through this hope, those who have sent ahead their beloved ones may not grieve, learning that in the coming of the Lord, the first to rise will be those who die in Christ. For Christ Himself, by the will of the Father, as the first angel of the heavenly host, as is contained in the Apocalypse of John the Apostle (Rev. XII, 7 et seq.), will descend from heaven to wage war in the name of God against the antichrist. And when he is destroyed, by his command the dead will rise. This is therefore to descend in the trumpet of God, to wage war in the name of God; for as He Himself said to Joshua the son of Nun (Joshua V, 14), He is the leader and prince of the army of the Lord, for which He is called the archangel. But when the voice of God descends in the trumpet, he is God; for both Scriptures contain this, just as in Exodus we read that an angel appeared to Moses in a flame, and immediately we recognize that God himself is in what is below, that is, the Son of God, the same Scriptures saying: And Moses approached, and said, I turn away, for I cannot look upon the face of God (Exod. III, 6). Therefore, he is God, because the Son of God is true God; and he is the leader and prince, because he is the head of all, for through him are all things. Therefore, with the first who rise again, who died in Christ, then we who are alive will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ in the air; so that all may come with the Lord to battle, and he may see those whom he had killed, alive; because just as the clouds are obedient to the Lord, so too are those whom he has deemed worthy to call his brothers. And thus, we will always be with the Lord; for in that sudden rapture, death will come and the soul, as if through sleep, will be restored in an instant. For when they are taken away, they will die; so that when they come to the Lord, they may receive the souls in the presence of the Lord; because they cannot be dead with God. Therefore, comfort one another with these words. With this hope, they encourage each other to console those who still mourned the departure of their loved ones, according to the pagan custom.

<h2 id='tocuniq39'>(Vers. 1, 2, 3.)</h2>
(Verse 1, 2, 3.) But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, there is no need for me to write to you; for you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. When people say, 'Peace and security,' then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. This is what the Lord spoke about in the Gospel, saying: 'Be watchful, for you do not know the hour when your Lord will come' (Mark 13:32). And again: If anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ,' or 'There he is,' do not believe it (Matthew 24:23). For immediately and unexpectedly he will appear, shining like lightning flashes from east to west, bringing with him the army of God the Father for the destruction of the antichrist and his followers. For when the wicked have been secure in the kingdom of the devil and have killed the saints, namely, Enoch and Elijah, they will rejoice in victory, exchanging gifts with one another, as the Apocalypse says (Revelation 11:7 and following). Then sudden destruction will come upon them. For Christ, in his coming, will destroy all of them; so that the holy ones, seeing that they have escaped, may glorify.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq40'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>
(Verse. 4, 5.) But you, brothers, are not in darkness, so that that day may overtake you like a thief; for all of you are children of light and children of the day: you are not of the night nor of darkness. In darkness signifies ignorance and falsehood, but in the day signifies knowledge and truth. Therefore, he says that Christians are not in darkness, but the Gentiles or unbelieving Jews are children of darkness; because they are worshippers of falsehood. Therefore, it signifies that the faithful should be secure; because they do not ignore the coming of the Lord, but anxiously await for Him to come. However, those who are ignorant and doubting about Him, He will suddenly catch them unawares and destroy them.

<h2 id='tocuniq41'>(Vers. 6-11.)</h2>
(Verse 6-11.) Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation. For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him. Therefore, exhort one another and build each other up, as you are already doing. It is clear what he is saying; he reminds us not to act carelessly in the name of the Savior: therefore, we must fortify ourselves with three defenses, namely, faith, hope, and charity. For while faith remains, it stirs up hope; but hope is necessarily restless about the promise and does not sleep; charity, on the other hand, offers devotion to God, for it admits nothing contrary. Therefore, the Lord Jesus died for us and rose again, so that whether we are awake, that is, alive, or whether we are asleep, that is, dead, we may live together with him in eternal life. This is what he said above, that the faithful, both the dead and the living, will be taken to meet the Lord in his coming, and will always live with him. He teaches us to meditate on this and to build each other up in this understanding.

<h2 id='tocuniq42'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>
(Vers. 12, 13.) But we ask you, brothers, to recognize those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. This is what he says in another letter (I Tim. 5:17) about honoring the elders with double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching. For it is possible that he who suffers poverty may feel reluctant to engage in the exercise that benefits the listeners. For what profit is it to have honor without fruit: or what great thing is it to offer carnal things to Him who bestows spiritual things? For just as riches beget negligence of salvation, so poverty, while seeking to be satiated, turns away from justice. Hence Solomon does not seek to become excessively rich; nor does he seek to become destitute. (Prov. XXX, 8). Nevertheless, this should be done in charity; so that the honor of the priest may be not so much from fear, but from love; so that it may also benefit Him who carries it out. For what is not done willingly does not lead to the desired result; although it may benefit the one taking action in the present, it will be of no advantage to the one giving in the future. And because disagreement generates many evils, it encourages them to be peaceful.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq43'>(Vers. 14-17.)</h2>
(Verses 14-17.) But we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all. See that no one repays evil for evil to anyone, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone. Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you all. For it is necessary that some in the community be unruly, some timid, that is, fearful, and some weak in faith; therefore, he exhorts those who are level-headed and courageous, and founded in faith, with prayer, to assist them, so that they may be able to make progress, bearing with them; lest if a repayment of evils is made, they become worse. Therefore, nothing else but good should be pursued, not only in the case of brothers, but also in the case of everyone. For through good works, unbelievers can be drawn to faith, from which one may always rejoice in the Lord, that is, in what is good. Prayer must be constant; for diligent prayers prompt the judge's mind to grant mercy. Indeed, in all good actions, thanks must be given to God, who has granted this teaching in Christ Jesus our Lord.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq44'>(Vers. 18-22.)</h2>
(Verse 18-22.) Do not extinguish the Spirit. Do not despise prophecies. Test everything; hold fast to what is good; abstain from every form of evil. This is said so that someone speaking by the Spirit may not be easily silenced (for their fervent speaking is silenced by contradictory words), lest those who do not understand say offensive things against the Holy Spirit and sin out of ignorance. And it is not right for someone revealing scripture-like teachings not to be listened to patiently, but all words should be examined and judged; lest they reject the grace given to a brother when they resist and oppose it. Therefore, everything that is said should be examined; and whatever is spoken in a sober and good manner should be retained. For whatever agrees with the words of the apostles and the Lord himself should be considered well spoken and retained; but those things that seem to be opposed to the faith should be avoided. For the spirit of the world often deceptively speaks good things as if by imitation, and intermixes evil among them, so that through those things which are good, evil may be carried along and accepted; because the words of one spirit are thought to be the same, they are not distinguished from each other: but through what is allowed, the illicit is praised by the authority of a name, not by the reason of virtue. For under the name of the apostles and the Lord himself they teach and preach unspeakable and adverse things; and therefore they admonish that all things should be examined, because the words of the Lord cannot be different. Hence also is from where the epistle of the apostle John:"Do not believe every spirit," he says, "but test the spirits whether they are from God" (1 John 4:1), because if someone may say many good things, but in something that is contrary to faith, it is known that he is not the Holy Spirit. For no error can be found in the Holy Spirit. However, through the exercise of speech, there are certain spiritual things and certain carnal things; because every error is attributed to the flesh, or certainly, a clever commentary invents good through a certain deception; to insert evil into these, as I mentioned above: just as in the case of Montanus, and Priscilla, and Maximilla, the prophets of the Phrygians, the spirit of the world simulated good by a certain imitation; so that through many plausible and even true things, it would lie that it is the Holy Spirit.
<br><br><br><h2 id='tocuniq45'>(Vers. 23.)</h2>
(Verse 23) But may the God of peace sanctify you completely, so that your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. God of peace is Christ; for He says: My peace I give to you, my peace I leave with you (John 14:27). Indeed, since everything that the Father has belongs to the Son, the Apostle wishes to sanctify us through Him; so that He may illuminate us with the piety of His mercy, and direct all our actions towards perfection, so that the spirit given to us may be blameless. For then is a person whole, if we strive for a good life, having a pure soul and a blameless body, so that the whole person may be perfect. For the body can be pure, and the soul can be tainted by evil thoughts; therefore, it is said that the spirit in a person must be pure. But if a wicked life or thought intervenes, the spirit will not be whole; for it abandons a person who is subject to sin. For when the soul and body are in disagreement, even though the body is without sensation, they become alienated from it and, as if losing them, the spirit will not be whole; for it is given to a person that it may remain in him and be as if the head thereof. Therefore, he will not be whole; for when a man departs from him, he loses the parts that the Holy Spirit despises.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq46'>(Vers. 24, 25.)</h2>
(Verses 24, 25.) For God is faithful, who has called you, who will also do it. Brothers, pray for us. He speaks of God's faithfulness in His promises, so that they may confidently seek their reward. And because those who live rightly according to the Gospel can easily obtain what they ask for, he encourages them to pray for themselves; for many easily obtain what they desire.
<br><br>
<h2 id='tocuniq47'>(Vers. 26.)</h2>
(Verse 26.) Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. Holy kisses are in Christian greeting, the rest are carnal; for whatever is done without Christ is carnal, and therefore also mortal. For whoever despises the author of life is in death.

<h2 id='tocuniq48'>(Vers. 27.)</h2>
(Verse 27.) I adjure you in the name of the Lord, that this letter be read to all the brothers. It obliges them to be diligent in reading the letter to all the brothers, so that they may know both their praises and their admonitions; by which they may be made perfect.

(Verse 28) The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Thus he desires them to progress in good works, so that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ may remain in them forever.
