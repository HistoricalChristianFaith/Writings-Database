<h2 id='tocuniq3'>Prologue</h2>

Since in the first letter to the Thessalonians, among other things, he also wrote about the coming of the Lord and the resurrection of the saints, he now writes another letter to them, in which he indicates, although obscurely (for he could not write openly), the abolition of the Roman kingdom, the appearance and condemnation of the Antichrist, and the disturbance of some brethren.

<h2 id='tocuniq4'>Chapter I.</h2>



<h2 id='tocuniq5'>(Vers. 1-3.)</h2>

(Verses 1-3.) Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. He writes to them with solemn words; for the beginning of the discourse is contained in the head of the letter: and these three, by whose names it is written, are the same as in the first letter (1 Thessalonians 1:1).

We must always give thanks to God for you, brothers, as is fitting, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing. Therefore we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions that you are enduring. This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering. (Joan. XIII, 34.)

<h2 id='tocuniq6'>(Vers. 4, 5.)</h2>

(Verses 4, 5.) So that we ourselves boast of you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure; Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer: Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day. For the very pressures themselves are examples of future merits in those who suffer, leading to glory; but in those who persecute, leading to destruction.

<h2 id='tocuniq7'>(Vers. 6-9.)</h2>

(Verse 6-9) For it is just before God to repay with affliction those who oppress you, and to grant rest to you who are afflicted, along with us, at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, separated from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might. Since he said that the example of God's just judgment appears both for the good and for the wicked, therefore he followed by saying: Since it is just before God to render to each one according to his works. What is more just than for those who oppress the righteous in this world and make them suffer persecution, to suffer the same things in the future that they do: while they themselves rest with the other saints, who, coming out of great tribulation, will receive the eternal kingdom in the coming of the Lord from heaven; when he begins to come with his heavenly army and with fire to give vengeance to the pagans, who do not know that God the Father is Jesus Christ; and to the Jews, who, though claiming to know God, do not believe in the Gospel of Christ, which the Father God gave to them, in order to hand it down to his servants? May the presence of the Lord and the glory of his majesty consume them like a fire, so that they may pay the deserved punishment of eternal destruction, always enduring but never completely failing, so that the punishment itself may always in some way generate them, by which they are consumed.

<h2 id='tocuniq8'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10) When he comes to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at in all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed. It contains a double meaning; for he will come to punish the wicked and to glorify the good. For he himself will appear glorious and marvelous to those who believe, following the example and faith of the apostles, when they are crowned, and the Gospel testifies to them on the day of the Lord. However, he will appear severe to the unbelievers, when they begin to be confined by eternal punishments. For the glory of the disciples is the crown, and its truth is the punishment of the unbelievers; because what was preached was not believed.

<h2 id='tocuniq9'>(Vers. 11, 12.)</h2>

(Verse 11,12) In which we also pray always for you, that our God may count you worthy of His calling, and fulfill every desire for goodness and the work of faith with power, so that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. He adds joy and prayers, that because they are devoted, God may be pleased to help them, so that they may complete the work begun to the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ; so that the perseverance of the disciples may be a testimony to the master for His glory. The authority of a teacher is in the trust of the students, when they make themselves more worthy in gratitude received.

<h2 id='tocuniq10'>Chapter II.</h2>



<h2 id='tocuniq11'>(Vers. 1-4.)</h2>

(Verse 1-4.) But we request you, brothers, in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering to Him, not to easily be shaken from your mind, nor to be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as if coming from us, as though the day of the Lord has come. Let no one deceive you in any way, because unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he sits in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God. He begs them not to lightly and easily receive the opinion of the impending arrival of the Lord, as if it were certain; and he gives such commands, that even if someone were to speak as if inspired by the Spirit, they should not be believed; nor should assent be given if something were written in a treatise or letter, perhaps written in the name of the apostles. For deceivers often fabricate a letter under the name of some famous man, in order to commend by the authority of the name that which could not be accepted on its own merits. For this reason, lest they be found unwary because of the disturbance itself, able to be led astray into adoring the devil, who will boast of this in order that, appearing under the name of the Savior and deceiving the saints, he may desire to be adored, to deceive believers in Christ. But in order that the most shameless Satan may not have the opportunity or occasion for deceiving that he thinks he has, he has marked the time and signs of the advent of the Lord, because the Lord will not come before the downfall of the Roman empire occurs, and Antichrist appears, who will kill the saints, even though Roman liberty has been restored, under his own name however. Knowing that the Lord is coming to repress them, he will usurp His name for himself; and in order to appear that his kingdom is true, he will attract with him those who shall perish together with him; so that in the house of the Lord, in the seat of Christ, he may sit and assert himself as God, not as the Son of God. Wherefore in the Gospel to the Jews the Lord says: I came in my Father's name, and ye received me not; if another comes in his own name, him ye will receive (John 5:43). Therefore, from circumcision, it is to be hoped that he will come, circumcised, so that there may be trust for the Jews to believe in him. Therefore, when the Apostle writes to the Thessalonians, he instructs that all should be cautious in such matters.

<h2 id='tocuniq12'>(Vers. 5, 6.)</h2>

(Verse 5, 6.) Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I told you these things? And now you know what is restraining, that he may be revealed in his own time. For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only He who now restrains will do so until He is taken out of the way. And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming.


<h2 id='tocuniq13'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7) For the mystery of iniquity is already at work, only that he who now holds back may hold back until he is taken out of the way. The mystery of iniquity began with Nero, who, encouraged by his father the devil, killed the apostles with a zeal for idols, up until Diocletian and finally Julian, who, with a certain art and cunning, could not complete the started persecution because it had not been allowed from above. Satan uses these ministers to deceive men under the guise of a multitude of gods, as long as the Roman kingdom, that is what he says: Until he is taken out of the way.


<h2 id='tocuniq14'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Ver. 8, 9.) And then that wicked one shall be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall kill with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: him, whose coming is according to the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Antichrist will appear, as it has been mentioned. For in the last times, knowing that the devil is nearing his destruction, and with the Roman Empire falling, he will be sent down from heaven, cast down to the earth (as it has been stated in the Apocalypse of the Apostle John). He will deceive and seduce people, performing certain signs of power, by the permission of the just God, in order to make himself be worshipped as if he were God. For he will imitate God, so that just as the Son of God, born or made man, demonstrated his divinity through signs and wonders, so Satan will appear in man, showing himself as God through the virtues of lies, as has been said. This is the revelation of the mystery of iniquity; for when the Antichrist appears, it will be known that he is like their God, whom the common people previously worshipped as gods by his command, of whom he will be the first or highest, which he will make credible through the virtues of signs. Therefore, he indeed spoke falsehoods of miracles, because he wants to be believed through signs which are not real, in order to deceive those whom he is about to deceive. This is why it was foretold to the saints, so that they may know what to beware of.

<h2 id='tocuniq15'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Ver. 10.) And in every deception of iniquity for those who perish: because they did not receive the love of truth, that they might be saved. To them he says that the deception of iniquity of his wonders is advancing, who are about to perish; because they have rejected the charity of truth, through which they could have been saved, as the apostles preached, they are delivered to the devil; for they do not want to be saved, they are abandoned by God.

<h2 id='tocuniq16'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11) And for this reason God will send them the operation of error, so that they may believe falsehood; so that all those who did not believe the truth but consented to iniquity may be judged. The operation of error is to place faith in falsehoods, so that those who did not want to acknowledge the clarity of light would think that darkness should be called light; so that the enemies of truth, who are inclined towards wickedness, may be condemned without contradiction, while the supporters of iniquity.


<h2 id='tocuniq17'>(Vers. 12, 13.)</h2>

(Ver. 12, 13.) But we must always give thanks to God for you, beloved brethren of the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation, through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth. He called you to this through our gospel, that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. At this place, the foreknowledge of God resounds, because He knows the minds of all before their birth; and He is not unaware of those who will believe. Therefore, from the beginning, he knows that these faithful ones will be, who, by believing, make an increase of faith, not a detriment; for, being sanctified through the faith of the truth of the Gospel of the Son of God, they are acquired for an increase of the glory of the body of Christ, as he also says in another epistle: that all things may grow unto the increase of God (Colossians 2:19). For whoever, having deserted the devil, take refuge in the faith of Christ, makes an increase for God in the body of Christ, which they had previously caused a detriment.


<h2 id='tocuniq18'>(Vers. 14.)</h2>

(Verse 14.) Therefore, brothers, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you have learned, whether by word or by our letter. In order that the foreknowledge of God may remain for their salvation, he warns them to stand and persevere in the tradition of the Gospel; so that they may be diligent, lest they become sluggish in the works of God, and not fulfill what they have begun. For in this way, they will know how to believe and be able to remain, if they are constantly urged by frequent admonition.


<h2 id='tocuniq19'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Vers. 15, 16.) But our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who has loved us and has given us eternal consolation and good hope in grace; may he comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word. For the Father and the Son are one power, one divinity and substance, therefore he did not hesitate to first mention our Lord Jesus Christ, then God our Father by his dignity, not by the truth of their nature: who loved us so much that he gave his Son for us (John 3:16), God for men, the Lord for servants, the true Son for the adopted; so that his death may be our life, and his resurrection our justification, and his second coming our rest of life, and glory forever; so that this hope may be the consolation of present troubles, through which they may be established and grow in good works and doctrine.


<h2 id='tocuniq20'>Chapter III.</h2>



<h2 id='tocuniq21'>(Vers. 1, 2.)</h2>

(Verse 1, 2.) Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run swiftly and be glorified, just as it is with you, and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for not all have faith. Furthermore, he exhorts to pray that God may deign to direct his doctrine with tireless course and pour it forth through the mouth of his Apostle into the ears of the hearers, and that he may restrain and calm the seditions of evil men who distrust the truth, and that the confidence of speaking may increase to the Apostle for his fruit and the conversion of many.


<h2 id='tocuniq22'>(Vers. 3.)</h2>

(Verse 3.) But God, who is faithful, will establish them and guard them from evil. For God has promised his assistance to the faithful and good people in times of need, to confirm them. However, they were eager for both faith and good works, therefore God is called faithful in his promises, because his providence was around them.

<h2 id='tocuniq23'>(Vers. 4.)</h2>

(Verse 4.) But we trust in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will do the things which we command. In order that he may deserve to be entrusted with the entire defense of God, he does not doubt that those things which he commanded them in the name of the Lord will be done by them and will come to pass.

<h2 id='tocuniq24'>(Vers. 5.)</h2>

(Verse 5.) But may the Lord direct your hearts in the love of God and the patience of Christ. This is what he desires for them from God, which he has no doubt can be granted; that in the love of God their hearts may be strengthened to await the coming of the Lord, so that, with the world condemned, his coming may be desired, who has conquered the world.

<h2 id='tocuniq25'>(Vers. 6.)</h2>

(Verse 6.) But we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from any brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition that they received from us. For not all obey the message, but they follow their own will and advice. Therefore, we instruct them to separate from them, so that they may come to realize their error.

<h2 id='tocuniq26'>(Vers. 7, 8, 9.)</h2>

(Vers. 7, 8, 9.) For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we did not live disorderly among you, nor did we eat anyone's bread for free; but in labor and toil, working night and day, so that we would not be a burden to any of you. Not because we did not have the right, but in order to give ourselves as an example for you to imitate. For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone is unwilling to work, he shall not eat! For it would not be reprehensible if he received bread from those who provided spiritual nourishment to their souls, which also gave immortality with glory to their bodies. Then indeed freedom can be exercised, if one does not subject oneself to the stomach or money, content with one's own bread; especially since it is more beneficial to praise, if, when it is allowed, and there is the opportunity to take, one abstains: such a person can benefit the listeners; for they will have reverence for this strictness, and they cannot disregard the things that are commanded by him.


<h2 id='tocuniq27'>(Vers. 10.)</h2>

(Verse 10.) For when we were with you, we commanded you that if anyone is not willing to work, neither should he eat. He not only taught with words, but also encouraged and acted accordingly; for a suitable teacher is one who fulfills with actions what he teaches with words. For only then do those who are learning know that what they hear is truly so, if they do not see it being neglected by the teacher. Although the things taught are not unknown to be clearly true, if they begin to be neglected by the teacher, it will be difficult for the listeners to progress: for actions persuade more than words. Therefore, those who make progress in both work and understanding, despite negligent teachers, should be rewarded with great prizes. Thus, the purpose was for those of average or humble status in the common people to learn the extent to which they were not losing their freedom. Hence, Solomon also says: Rarely, he says, put your foot toward your friend, lest he become weary of you when he is satisfied (Prov. XXV, 17). For the one who frequently gathers at someone else's table, being devoted to idleness, must flatter the one who feeds him; whereas our religion calls people to freedom. Therefore, if anyone refuses to eat, let them abstain from work; but because no one can live without food, let them devote themselves to the work of laboring, so that living according to their own discretion, they may be able to find favor with God.

<h2 id='tocuniq28'>(Vers. 11.)</h2>

(Verse 11.) For we have heard that some among you walk disorderly, not working at all, but meddling in the affairs of others. And we urge such people to be quiet and to mind their own business, and to work with their own hands, so that they may walk properly and be in need of nothing. But those who desire to be idle and waste their time, they do so in order to find opportunities to enter the homes of the rich, walking in deceitfulness and carefully observing the words and actions of others, knowing what they want to hear, so that they may be gladly received and sought after. This behavior is greatly contrary to the teachings of the Lord; for their god is their appetite, and they diligently provide for their necessary but filthy desires.


<h2 id='tocuniq29'>(Vers. 12.)</h2>

(Verse 12) So we ask and encourage those who have this kind of life in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and earn their own food. In order to persuade them more easily, he urges them by invoking the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to obey what is beneficial for them.

<h2 id='tocuniq30'>(Vers. 13, 14, 15.)</h2>

(Verses 13, 14, 15.) But as for you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good. If anyone does not obey our word in this letter, take note of that person and have nothing to do with him, so that he may be ashamed. Do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother. For this reason, he instructed each one to eat his own bread, so that no one would take advantage of the situation and show lack of kindness and compassion. Therefore, he immediately adds: But as for you, brothers, do not grow weary of doing good. For he does not come for reproach, who is compassionate and generous; but he who, although able to bear labor, wishes to spend his life in idleness. If his authority is not corrected by letters, this person should be noted, and it is commanded not to associate with him; so that he, who is avoided by everyone, may subject himself to the teachings of the Apostle. However, this is to be done without anger and insults, so that he may be patiently avoided; yet, if circumstances require speaking with him, he should be reminded to allow himself to be corrected, and not to disregard the teachings of the Apostle any further: also, familiarity with him should not be maintained as long as he remains disobedient. For if one is provoked to anger by insults, they will become worse; for they will be incited to contention and will begin to defend their mistake, then later be ashamed to correct themselves; lest they seem to first excuse and then confess.

<h2 id='tocuniq31'>(Vers. 16.)</h2>

(Verse 16) But God himself, the God of peace, grant you peace always in every place. The Lord be with you all. Always, with a good wish, he accompanies them, like dearest children, always desiring to remain in peace with them, which is the guide to eternal life. For the Lord has promised to be with those who are peaceable.

<h2 id='tocuniq32'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17.) The greeting is in my own hand—Paul’s. This is my signature in every letter; this is how I write.

<h2 id='tocuniq33'>(Vers. 18.)</h2>

(Verse 18.) The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. This greeting is written by the hand of the Apostle, wishing that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ may be with them. Amen.
