<h2 id='tocuniq3'>Prologue</h2>

Philemon was not endowed with the dignity of ecclesiastical ordination, but he was an honorable man, one from the common people. For this reason, Onesimus, his servant and friend, writes him a letter; so that he may not only forgive him, but also give thanks to God; because he received him in such a way that he does not consider him a slave, but a most beloved brother.

<h2 id='tocuniq4'>Chapter I.</h2>



<h2 id='tocuniq5'>(Vers. 1, 2, 3.)</h2>

(Vers. 1, 2, 3.) Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved brother, and fellow laborer, and to the beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. In order to make the letter's authority from himself, he began by acknowledging his wrongdoing. Just as being bound is a disgrace because of sin, so on the contrary, for Christ to endure the chains of imprisonment is the greatest glory. For at the time he sent this letter, he was in custody. However, although Philemon was not a cleric, he nevertheless participated in the needs of the Church out of devotion, hence he says that he is a participant in these labors. For there are indeed many who, although worthy, excuse themselves, judging themselves unworthy of such a ministry; hence they appear truly worthy.

<h2 id='tocuniq6'>(Vers. 4, 5, 6.)</h2>

(Verses 4, 5, 6.) I thank my God, always making mention of you in my prayers, hearing about your faith and love which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints; so that the sharing of your faith may become effective by the knowledge of every good thing which is in us for Christ's sake. I have great joy and encouragement because of your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you to do the right thing, yet for love's sake I appeal to youâ€”since I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus. However, the Apostle says that he adds this through prayers, so that his work is done with understanding of goodness; that is, he operates with such a mind that he expects the reward of this thing in the future.

<h2 id='tocuniq7'>(Vers. 7.)</h2>

(Verse 7.) For I had great joy and consolation on account of your love; because the hearts of the saints have found rest through you, brother. It is evident that he expresses himself as being joyful because he was ministering to the needs of the saints: from which he rejoices even more, being certain that he was obeying his commands, whom he knows to be superior.

<h2 id='tocuniq8'>(Vers. 8, 9.)</h2>

(Ver. 8, 9.) Therefore, having great confidence in Christ to command you, as it pertains to the matter; yet for love's sake I rather beseech you, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. As much as reason required, it was fitting to command a disciple as a master by the authority of the apostolic faith: but because Philemon was a good man, he entices him through affection to obedience, as if he were a companion in age, and a prisoner of Jesus Christ, that is, bound by the affairs of the Lord, or subject to his name in chains, just as the apostles themselves were. For indeed, there were Judas and Silas, who were leaders among the brothers, being from the common people, they had committed themselves to the Lord's work (Acts 15:22 and following); so that they could work together with the apostles for the sake of faith in God. Hence, Silas is found to be a partner in the apostle's labors.

<h2 id='tocuniq9'>(Vers. 10-14.)</h2>

(Verses 10-14.) I beseech you, for my son whom I have begotten in chains, Onesimus, formerly useless to you but now useful to both you and me, whom I have sent back to you. But I urge you to receive him as I would receive my own heart. I wanted to keep him with me, so that he might serve me on your behalf while I am in chains for the sake of the gospel. But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your kindness would not be out of necessity but voluntary. It is not a great thing to humble oneself when one is lowly, but it is commendable for a noble man to humble himself. Therefore, the Apostle asks him, to whom he has the authority to command, to be in all things a model for the advancement of merits. Therefore, when Onesimus, a fugitive, returned to seek divine assistance, the Apostle baptized him while he was in custody in the city of Rome, seeing the hope of usefulness in him. He commends him in such a way that he indicates his suitability to serve in secular as well as divine duties, having been transformed from useless to useful.

<h2 id='tocuniq10'>(Vers. 15, 16.)</h2>

(Verse 15, 16.) Perhaps he therefore departed for a while, so that you might receive him forever: not now as a slave, but beloved brother, especially to me; how much more to you both in the flesh and in the Lord? Onesimus, having offended his own master, fled on a long journey to the Apostle; to show that he did not depart for the purpose of being guilty of a crime, but so that, with sins forgiven, he might return useful to such an extent that he would not only become equal to his master in merits, but also a brother to the master himself. And so that Philemon may not suffer any disdain of pride, as is usual, as if the master were against the servant, he humbles himself when he calls him his brother both in the flesh and in the Lord; so that with the removal of the cause of human condition, because we are all descended from one Adam, we may recognize ourselves as brothers: especially when faith comes in the middle, which cuts off all pride.

<h2 id='tocuniq11'>(Vers. 17.)</h2>

(Verse 17) So if you consider me as a partner, receive him as you would receive me. He shows such concern for Onesimus that he says Philemon, whom he praises above, should consider him as his own companion if he welcomes him as he would welcome an apostle. This is what Solomon said: A wise servant will have free people serving him (Eccles. 10:28). This saying is meant to scare Philemon, so that he may at least take him in for this reason if he cannot be swayed by love.


<h2 id='tocuniq12'>(Vers. 18, 19.)</h2>

(Vers. 18, 19.) If, however, something has hurt you, or he is a debtor, impute this to me. Now he undermines the excuse of anger, lest perhaps he would complain that he was hurt by him in such a way that it would not seem fitting to forgive him. But if it were so, he says it must be imputed to himself, through whom the heirs of the kingdom of heaven will be in the future, who have sinned before.

<h2 id='tocuniq13'>(Vers. 19.)</h2>

(Verse 19) I, Paul, have written with my own hand, I will repay; to say nothing of the fact that you owe me your very self. If any offense has been committed, Onesimus has testified that he is fully capable of making amends; so that he may make satisfaction on his behalf. And speaking the truth, he raises himself up and says that he demands less from him than is proven to be owed. For he is compelled to make satisfaction as a servant; because he burdens himself with the debt.

<h2 id='tocuniq14'>(Vers. 20, 21.)</h2>

(Verse 20, 21.) So, brother, may I enjoy you in the Lord, refresh my heart in Christ. Having confidence in your obedience, I have written to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. I am now being affectionate, so that his obedience may be voluntary, in order to bear fruit. For by doing so, he provokes him to do more than is demanded of him; it often happens that when one sees themselves being thought highly of, they present themselves as even better.

<h2 id='tocuniq15'>(Vers. 22.)</h2>

(Verse 22.) But at the same time, prepare for me a lodging; for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you. To make him more anxious and obedient, it is indicated that he will come; for those who are absent are usually despised. And the reason why the Apostle does not consider himself unworthy to be here yet, who has always suffered weariness and dangers, murders, persecutions, and chains, and whose rest was only in Christ alone? But for the progress of the believers, and to confound the enemies of the cross of Christ, he offered his own flesh to sufferings, in order to obtain crowns of immortality for his soul and body.


<h2 id='tocuniq16'>(Vers. 23, 24.)</h2>

(Verse 23, 24) Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you. Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers, also send their greetings. They all send their greetings and testify to their share in his glory.

<h2 id='tocuniq17'>(Vers. 25.)</h2>

(Verse 25.) The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, amen. This is the subscription of the Apostle confirming the sent letter.
