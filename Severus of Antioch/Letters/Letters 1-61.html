<p>We also have in the God-inspired Scripture supplies of humility, and 508-12.
no lack of arguments to bring us down and help us to keep silence. If you, as if
you were about to go up to Mt. Sinai, shrink from writing 'to such a man'
(referring to me), and think fit to use David's words which he says to those who
were urging him to take Saul's daughter in marriage, &laquo;Is it a small thing in
your eyes that I should be son-in-law to the king?&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#4"><SUP>4</SUP></A>, while I am a
poor man and inglorious, I also, when required to make answer to your question,
make use of these words: &laquo;I am not a prophet, nor the son of prophets, but I am
a shepherd, and a scraper of sycamore fruit&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#5"><SUP>5</SUP></A>, if it is not too much
for me to say even this: for I am not worthy to tell the righteousnesses of God,
and to take his covenant in <A NAME="p4"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|4</SPAN></A> my mouth<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#6"><SUP>6</SUP></A>. However, since the time of the present struggles does
not allow silence, I accept an honourable defeat from you, and turn to the
question. And in this I defeat you, since I show that you do not practise
humility in a philosophic spirit<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#7"><SUP>7</SUP></A>. As to your statement that the holy
old men called bold speech<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#8"><SUP>8</SUP></A> fire or warmth, I say this, that we must
not use this method of speaking without discrimination, but there are occasions
for using it and circumstances to which to apply it. Our Lord in the Gospels in
many parables teaches us in the case of spiritual petitions to knock without
ceasing and display a praiseworthy audacity. And the saying of the Proverbs also
instructs us that 'there is shame which brings sin, and there is shame which
brings glory and grace'<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#9"><SUP>9</SUP></A>. Know then, mighty man, (for I now return to
make answer) that for us to anathematize those who speak of properties of
natures (I mean the Godhead and the manhood of which the one Christ consists) is
not permissible. Flesh does not renounce its existence as flesh, even if it has
become God's flesh, nor has the Word departed from his nature, even if he has
been hypostatically united to flesh which possesses a rational and intelligent
soul: but the difference also is <A NAME="p5"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|5</SPAN></A> preserved, and the propriety in the form of natural characteristics of the
natures of which Emmanuel consists, since the flesh was not converted into the
nature of the Word, nor was the Word changed into flesh. We mean in the matter
of natural characteristics, and not that those which were naturally united are
singly and individually separated and divided from one another: this is the
assertion of those who cleave our one Lord Jesus Christ into two natures. For,
since the union in hypostasis is acknowledged, it follows that those which were
united are not separated from one another; but there is one Son, and one nature
of God the Word incarnate himself, as the holy Cyril also says in the work
against Diodorus: &laquo;Let him know therefore that the body which was born at
Bethlehem, even if it is not the same as the Word from God and the Father (I
mean in natural characteristics), yet nevertheless became his, not anyone else's
separate from the Son: and there is recognised to be one Son and Christ and Lord
and Word who took flesh&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#10"><SUP>10</SUP></A>. Those therefore who confess one
incarnate nature of God the Word, and do not confuse the elements of which he
consists, recognise also the propriety of those that were joined in union (and a
property is that which <A NAME="p6"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|6</SPAN></A> exists in the form of a manifestation of natural differences), and not that
we should ascribe the acts of the manhood only to the human nature, and impute
again those of the Godhead separately to God the Word, but they recognise the
difference only, not admitting a division: for the principle of union does not
admit of division. Hear what the holy and wise doctor Cyril says in the second
volume<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#11"><SUP>11</SUP></A> of the work against the blasphemies of Nestorius: &laquo;For
between Godhead and manhood I also allow that there is great distinction and
distance. For the things which have been named on the principle of manner of
existence are clearly different, and in no point like one another. But, when the
mystery in Christ is introduced among us, the principle of union is not
oblivious of difference&quot;, but rejects division, not by mixing or
commingling the natures with one another, but that, after the Word of God has
partaken of flesh and blood, he is even so understood and named as one Son&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#12"><SUP>12</SUP></A>.
But, if Emmanuel is one, consisting of Godhead and manhood which have a perfect
existence according to their own principle, and the hypostatic union without
confusion shows the difference of those which have been joined in one in
dispensatory union, but rejects division, both the elements <A NAME="p7"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|7</SPAN></A>
which naturally belong to the manhood have come to belong to the very Godhead
of the Word, and those which belong to the Word himself have come to belong to
the very manhood which he hypostatically united to him. On this subject we will
again adduce the sacred words of Cyril. In the <i>prosphonetikon </i>to the
religious king Theodosius he spoke as follows: &laquo;As therefore it came to belong
to the humanity to be the Only one, because it had been united to the Word in a
dispensatory union, so it came to belong to the Word to be 'the first-born among
many brethren'<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#13"><SUP>13</SUP></A>, because of the union with flesh&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#14"><SUP>14</SUP></A>.
Gregory the Theologian<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#15"><SUP>15</SUP></A> also in the letter to Gledonius wrote words
which agree with him as follows: &laquo;As the natures are mingled, so also are the
appellations; and they run into one another on the principle of coalescence&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#16"><SUP>16</SUP></A>.
Do not let the term 'mingle' disturb you: for he used it very clearly and
without danger<sup>5</sup> with the intention of denoting the primary union:
for, where there is a union of something incorporeal with a body, no danger<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#17"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
anywhere arises from mingling. For this is manifestly a quality of fluid bodies,
to be confounded together by intertwining, and, so to speak, come out of their
nature. We therefore anathematize not <A NAME="p8"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|8</SPAN></A> those who confess the properties of the natures of which the one Christ
consists, but those who separate the properties, and apportion them to each
nature apart. When the one Christ has once been divided (and he is divided by
the fact that they speak of two natures after the union), with the natures which
have been cut asunder into a duality and separated into a distinct diversity go
the operations and properties which are the offspring of this division, as the
words of Leo's impious letter state in what he said: &laquo;For each of the forms
effects in partnership with the other that which belongs to itself, the Word
doing that which belongs to the Word, and the body performing the things which
belong to the body&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#18"><SUP>18</SUP></A>. Against these things it is well to set the
much-honoured words of the holy Cyril which refute impiety. In the Scholion
about the coal he speaks as follows: &laquo;Nevertheless we may see in the coal as in
a figure that God the Word was united to the manhood, but has not cast off being
that which he is, but rather changed what had been assumed or united into his
glory and operation. For, as fire when it takes hold of wood and is introduced
into it, prevails over it, and does <A NAME="p9"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|9</SPAN></A> not make it cease being wood, but rather changes it into the appearance and
force of fire, and performs all its own acts in it, and is already reckoned as
one with it, so understand in the case of Christ also. For, since God was
ineffably united with manhood, he has preserved it as what we say it is, and he
himself also has remained what he was. But, after he has once been united, he is
reckoned as one with it, appropriating its qualities to himself, but he himself
also carried on the operation of his nature in it&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#19"><SUP>19</SUP></A>. If
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#20"><SUP>20</SUP></A> then the Word changed the manhood which he had hypostatically united to him, not
into his nature, for he remained that which he was, but into his glory and
operation, and things which manifestly belong to the flesh have come to belong
to the Word himself, how shall we allow that each of the forms performs its own
acts? But we must anathematize those who confine the one Christ in two natures
and say that each of the natures performs its own acts. Between the things
performed and done by the one Christ the difference is great. Some of them are
acts befitting the divinity, while others are human. For example, to walk and
travel in bodily form upon <A NAME="p10"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|10</SPAN></A> the earth is without contention human; but to bestow on those who are maimed
in the feet and cannot walk upon the ground at all the power of walking like
sound persons is God-befitting. Yet the one Word incarnate performed the latter
and the former, and the one nature did not perform the one, and the other the
other; nor, because the things performed are different, shall we on this account
rightly define two natures or forms as operating. Again the Tome of Leo says: &laquo;For
each of the natures preserves its own property without diminution&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#21"><SUP>21</SUP></A>,
distributing the properties to the two natures severally, as one who divides the
one and only Christ into two natures. For the property of the natures of which
Emmanuel consists, which is shown in the natural characteristics, continues
constant and fixed, as the holy Cyril also says in the second letter to
Succensus: &laquo;But, while each of them both remains and is perceived in the
property which is. by nature, according to the principle which has just been
enunciated by us, the ineffable and incomprehensible union has shown us one
nature of the Son, yet, as I have said, an incarnate nature&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#22"><SUP>22</SUP></A>. But
God the Word did not permit his flesh in all things to undergo the passions
proper to it, in order that its <A NAME="p11"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|11</SPAN></A> property might be preserved undiminished, as the impious disputer said. For
observe what the wise doctor Cyril says, in answer to the objections made by
Theodoret, in the defence of the tenth anathema: &laquo;When the lowness arising from
the exinanition seems hard to you, wonder greatly at the love of the Son toward
us. For, what you say is a mean thing, this he did voluntarily for your sake. He
wept in human fashion, that he might take away your weeping. He feared by
dispensation, inasmuch as he sometimes permitted his flesh to undergo the
passions proper to it, that he might make us valiant&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#23"><SUP>23</SUP></A>. If he
sometimes permitted his flesh by dispensation to undergo the passions proper to
it, he did not preserve its property undiminished: for in many instances it is
seen not to have undergone the things which manifestly belong to its nature; for
it was united to the Word, the Maker of nature. The Word therefore who had
become incarnate walked upon the sea, and after his death under the wound of the
lance caused a stream of salvation to well forth from his side: again, after the
Resurrection, he came in while the doors were shut, and appeared to the
disciples in the house; whom he also allowed to touch him, showing that his
flesh was tangible and solid, and of one essence<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#24"><SUP>24</SUP></A> with us, and was
also <A NAME="p12"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|12</SPAN></A> superior to corruption; and thereby he subverted the theory of phantasy. It
belongs therefore to those who part the one Christ into two natures and dissolve
the unity to say, &laquo;For each of the natures preserves its property unimpaired&raquo;.
But those who believe that, after God the Word had been hypostatically united to
flesh that possessed an intelligent soul, he performed all his own acts in it,
and changed it not into his nature (far be it!), but into his glory and
operation, no longer seek the things that manifestly belong to the flesh without
diminution, to which flesh the things that manifestly belong by nature to the
Godhead have come to belong by reason of the union. But, if they senselessly
divide it from God the Word by speaking of two natures after the union, it then
walks in its own ways following its nature, and preserves its properties
undiminished on the principle of the impious men. But these things are not so
(how could they be?), but indeed very different: for union rejects division, as
the holy Cyril said: &laquo;For, though it is said that he hungered and thirsted, and
slept and grew weary after a journey, and wept and feared, these things did not
happen to him just as they do to us in accordance with compulsory ordinances of
nature; but he <A NAME="p13"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|13</SPAN></A> himself voluntarily permitted his flesh to walk according to the laws of
nature, for he sometimes allowed it even to undergo its own passions&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#25"><SUP>25</SUP></A>.
For from Cyril's words, as from a sacred anchor, I do not depart. And the same
statement is made by Gregory the Theologian<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#26"><SUP>26</SUP></A> of Nazianzus also in the
sermon on baptism: &laquo;For he is purity itself, and did not need purification; but
he is purified for you; just as for you he put on a garb of flesh, while he is
fleshless: and he would have run no danger at all from putting off baptism; for
he himself was a warden of passion to himself&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#27"><SUP>27</SUP></A>. Accordingly then<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#28"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
he was a warden to himself of hungering as well as of being tired after a
journey, and of accepting the other human passions, such as do not fall under
sin, in order to display the Humanization truly and without phantasy <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#29"><SUP>29</SUP></A>.
Of what we have said this is the sum; that we must anathematize those who divide
the one Christ: and they divide him by speaking of two natures after the union,
and consequently apportioning the operations and properties between the natures.
Accordingly good doctrine is contained in the<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#30"><SUP>30</SUP></A> ---- of the serene
king: for it anathematizes those who divide the one Son who was <A NAME="p14"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|14</SPAN></A>
hypostatically united to flesh into two natures, and the operations and
properties of the same two natures: for thus also says the impious Theodoret: &laquo;How
does he range under impiety those who divide the properties of the natures of
God who is before the ages and of the man who was assumed in the last days?&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#31"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
I have written these things though I am poor in intellect and praise the
greatness of your God-loving understanding; and because, as you are wise, I give
you an opportunity to attain wiser results. Forgive me that on account of the
lack of leisure caused by the present struggles I have been late in writing.
Greet your honoured consort, who is a partner and a helper in the affairs of
God.

<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>II.</SPAN>&nbsp;-------- OF THE SAME THE SECOND LETTER TO THE SAME OECUMENIUS THE COUNT
UPON THE SAME MATTER, AND IT IS AMONG THOSE WRITTEN DURING EPISCOPACY. [513-8.]&nbsp;</b>

<p> I wonder how it is that your God-loving magnificence has picked <A NAME="p15"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|15</SPAN></A>
up again from the beginning the contention that had been put to silence.
While confessing Emmanuel to be of two natures, to suppose the elements of which
he consists to be generalities covering many hypostases (this is what is meant
by the property of a generality) is a thing that is very abominable and inept,
and one that confirms the charge falsely disseminated against us by the impious:
for we are found to be imagining two natures before the union according to their
account; for there would be the whole of humanity and of course the Godhead
also, even before the Humanization of the Word. And these matters would need
further conversation by word of mouth, not written words in a letter, which are
subject to considerations of brevity, and bring danger<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#32"><SUP>32</SUP></A> to the
writer, wherever any unusual name or unelaborated phrase is inserted in the
document. You know what words that lead to rocks you have used in your recent
composition, and, though admitting that you do this as a concession, you have
still done it. But to us, who by ordinance from above and mercy have attained to
this priestly office, it does not bring honour to take such ill expressions in
our mouth and consign them to writing: for it is written, <A NAME="p16"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|16</SPAN></A>
&laquo;The lips of a priest will guard knowledge, and they will ask law from his
mouth&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#33"><SUP>33</SUP></A>. Wherefore Paul also, who was taken up to the third heaven,
and heard ineffable words<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#34"><SUP>34</SUP></A>, knowing the difficulty of words of this
kind, urged the believers to make earnest and constant prayer that speech might
be granted him with eloquence<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#35"><SUP>35</SUP></A>. Since then these things are so, and
we decline to employ a multitude of words, which as a rule do not escape sin<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#36"><SUP>36</SUP></A>,
I will use shortness of speech to your wisdom and knowledge, and ask you a very
easy question. Do you call the flesh possessing an intelligent soul, which God
the Word voluntarily united to himself hypostatically without any change, a
specimen or a generality, that is one soul-possessing hypostasis, or the whole
human generality? It is manifest that, if you wish to give a right-minded
answer, you will say one soul-possessing body. Accordingly we say that from it
and the hypostasis of God the Word the ineffable union was made: for the whole
of the Godhead and the whole of humanity in general were not joined in a natural
union, but special hypostases. And the holy and wise Cyril plainly witnesses to
us in that in <A NAME="p17"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|17</SPAN></A> the third chapter <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#37"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
or anathema he spoke thus: &laquo;Whoever divides
the one Christ into hypostases after the union, associating them in association
of honour or of authority only, and not rather in junction of natural union, let
him be anathema&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#38"><SUP>38</SUP></A>. And again in the Scholia the same says: &laquo;Hence
we shall learn that the hypostases have remained without confusion&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#39"><SUP>39</SUP></A>.
Accordingly the natural union was not of generalities, but of hypostases of
which Emmanuel was composed. And do not think that hypostases in all cases have
a distinct person assigned to them, so that we should be thought, like the
impious Nestorius, to speak of a union of persons, and to run counter to the
God-inspired words of the holy Cyril, who in the second letter to the same
Nestorius speaks thus: &laquo;But that it should be so <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#40"><SUP>40</SUP></A> will in no way
help the right principle of faith, even if some men spread about a union of
persons. For the Scripture did not say that God the Word united to himself the
person of a man, but that he became flesh&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#41"><SUP>41</SUP></A>. When hypostases subsist
by individual subsistence, as for instance, those of Peter and of Paul, whom the
authority of the apostleship united, then there will be a union of persons and a
brotherly association, not a natural junction <A NAME="p18"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|18</SPAN></A>
of one hypostasis made up out of two that is free from confusion. For this is
what those who adhere to the foul doctrines of Nestorius are convicted of saying
with regard to the divine Humanization also. They first make the babe exist by
himself separately, so that a distinct person is even assigned to him, and then
by attaching God the Word to him impiously introduce a union of persons into the
faith. This Gregory the Theologian <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#42"><SUP>42</SUP></A> also rejected by saying in the
great letter to Cledonius: &laquo;Whoever says that the man was formed, and God
afterwards crept in is condemned: for this is not a birth of God, but an escape
from birth&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#43"><SUP>43</SUP></A>. But, when hypostases do not subsist in individual
subsistence, as also in the case of the man among us, I mean him who is composed
of soul and body, but are without confusion recognised in union and composition,
being distinguished by the intellect only and displaying one hypostasis made out
of two, such a union none will be so uninstructed as to call one of persons.
Though the hypostasis of God the Word existed before, or rather <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#44"><SUP>44</SUP></A>
was
before all ages and times, being eternally with God both the Father and the Holy
Spirit, yet still the flesh possessing an intelligent soul which he united to
him did not exist <A NAME="p19"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|19</SPAN></A>&nbsp;before the union with him, nor was a distinct person assigned to it
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#45"><SUP>45</SUP></A>.
And the great Athanasius bears witness, who in the letter to Jovinian the king
says: &laquo;As soon as there is flesh, there is at once flesh of God the Word; and,
as soon as there is soul-possessing and rational flesh<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>, there is at
once soul-possessing rational flesh of God the Word<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#46"><SUP>46</SUP></A>: for in him also
it acquired subsistence&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#47"><SUP>47</SUP></A>. And the holy Cyril also testifies,
addressing the impious Diodorus as follows: &laquo;My excellent man, I say that you
are shooting forth unlearned words much affected with what is abhorrent. For the
holy body was from Mary, but still at the very beginning of its concretion or
subsistence in the womb it was made holy, as the body of Christ, and no one can
see any time at which it was not his, but rather simple as you say and the same
as this flesh of other men&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#48"><SUP>48</SUP></A>. Following these God-inspired words of
the holy fathers, and confessing our Lord Jesus Christ to be of two natures,
regard the distinct hypostases themselves of which Emmanuel was composed, and
the natural junction of these, and do not go up to generalities and essences<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#49"><SUP>49</SUP></A>,
of the whole of the Godhead and humanity in <A NAME="p20"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|20</SPAN></A>
general: for it is manifest that the whole of the Godhead is seen in the
Trinity, and humanity in general draws the mind to the whole human race. How
therefore is it anything but ridiculous and impious for us to say that the
Trinity was united in hypostasis to the race of mankind, when the holy
Scriptures say more plainly than a trumpet, &laquo;The Word became flesh and dwelt in
us&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#50"><SUP>50</SUP></A>, that is that one of the three hypostases who was rationally
and hypostatically united to soul-possessing flesh? But neither do we deny, as
we have also written in other letters on different occasions, that we often find
men designating hypostases by the name of essence<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>. Hence Gregory the
Theologian named hypostatic union union in essence<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A> in the letter to
Cledonius which we have just mentioned, speaking thus: &laquo;Whoever says that he
worked by grace as in a prophet, but not that he was united and fashioned
together with him in essence, may he be bereft of the excellent operation, or
rather may he be full of the contrary&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#52"><SUP>52</SUP></A>. And the wise Cyril in the
second letter to Succensus calls the manhood which was hypostatically united to
God the Word essence<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#51"><SUP>51</SUP></A>, saying: &laquo;For, if after saying 'one nature
<A NAME="p21"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|21</SPAN></A> of the Word' we had stopped and not added 'incarnate', but set the
dispensation as it were outside, they would perhaps in a way have a plausible
argument when they pretend to ask, 'Where is the perfection in manhood? or how
was the essence after our model made up?' But, since the perfection in manhood
and the characteristic of our essence has been introduced by the fact that we
said 'incarnate', let them be silent, since they have leaned upon the staff of a
reed&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#53"><SUP>53</SUP></A>. But saying that Emmanuel, is from two essences<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A>
also, as we confess him to be from two natures, even if one understand the
essences <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#54"><SUP>54</SUP></A> as hypostases, we avoid, as a thing that is unscientific,
and has not been stated in so many words by any of the God-clad fathers: for in
such matters we must avoid novelty, even if it has some religiousness about it,
and with the psalmist-prophet be preserved in the tent of caution, and be hidden
by grace from on high, even from the contention of tongues<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#55"><SUP>55</SUP></A>.

<p> [After first citing the passage of Basil which says, &laquo;'Unbegotten'

teachings of the saints and of the other fathers, the meaning becomes plain, and
there is nothing contradictory or dime alt in it: for 'being' here expresses the
distinct hypostasis of the Father. For the fathers said that the Holy Trinity
exists both in one essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#62"><SUP>62</SUP></A>, and in the being of each, that is, three
hypostases, existing severally, of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

<p>But now also we will come to what is required, and, we will again
say, that 'essence' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#62"><SUP>62</SUP></A> signifies a generality, and 'hypostasis' a
particularity, but 'being' and 'nature' introduce sometimes a general
signification, sometimes a partial or particular one. This is stated on account
of the varying use that is found in the holy fathers: for you knew both that
'essence'<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#62"><SUP>62</SUP></A> is sometimes employed in the particular signification of
'hypostasis ', and occasionally also <A NAME="p24"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|24</SPAN></A>
'hypostasis' is found employed in place of 'essence' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#63"><SUP>63</SUP></A>. For this
reason we decline to use such a signification as being unscientific.

</p>

<p> Enough has, I think, been said about essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#63"><SUP>63</SUP></A>
and
hypostasis. But the name 'nature' is sometimes taken in place of essence',
sometimes in place of hypostasis. For even the whole of mankind we call
comprehensively 'nature', as it is indeed written: &laquo;For all natures of beasts
and of birds, and of reptiles and of things that are in the water are subjected
and are made subject to human nature&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#64"><SUP>64</SUP></A>: and again we speak of one
nature in reference to a single man, Paul for example or Peter, or maybe James.
Where therefore we name all mankind one nature, we use the name 'nature' generically in place of 'essence'
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#63"><SUP>63</SUP></A>; but, where we say that there is
one nature of Paul, the name 'nature' is employed in place of 'individual
hypostasis'. So <A NAME="p25"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|25</SPAN></A> also we call the Holy Trinity one nature, employing the term 'nature' in
place of the general designation 'essence' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#65"><SUP>65</SUP></A>; as Gregory the Theologian the
bishop of Nazianzus also said in the sermon on the Holy Pentecost: &laquo;Confess the
Trinity to be of one Godhead, my friends; or, if you like, of one nature; and we
will ask for you from the Spirit the expression 'God'&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#66"><SUP>66</SUP></A>. But, when
we say 'one incarnate nature of God the Word', as Athanasius the prop of the
truth and the apostolic faith said in the books on the Incarnation of the Word <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#67"><SUP>67</SUP></A>,
we use 'nature' in place of 'individual designation', denoting the one
hypostasis of the Word himself, like that of Peter also or of Paul, or of any
other single man. Wherefore also, when we say 'one nature which became
incarnate', we do not say it absolutely, but by adding 'one nature of the Word
himself clearly denote the one hypostasis. But the very men who blasphemously
call the one Christ two natures use the name 'nature' in place of 'individual
designation', saying that the Word of God is one nature, and the man as they say
from Mary another. For they do not reach such a height of fatuity as to say that
they are using the name 'natures' in place <A NAME="p26"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|26</SPAN></A>
of 'general designation', I mean in the same sense as essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#68"><SUP>68</SUP></A>:
for, if the Holy Trinity is one nature, and all mankind one nature, in the same
sense as anything which is shown to be so on this principle, the Holy Trinity
will be found (to say a very absurd thing) to have become incarnate in all
mankind, that is the human race.

<p>But the Holy Scriptures instruct <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#69"><SUP>69</SUP></A> us otherwise, teaching us that
God the Word one only of the three hypostases became incarnate and humanized.

<p>But, when you hear these things, you will perhaps say that we ought not to
have spoken of difference between the natures from which Emmanuel is, lest we
ourselves be found to be repeating and using the same expression as these proud
men. Accordingly, let us also refrain from confessing the union, <A NAME="p27"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|27</SPAN></A>
because they also profess to speak of a union which consists in an
association of honour; and, because they speak of two natures after the union,
let us also not say that the union was made from two natures, rejecting even the
very mention of natures, like silly children, who tremble at terrifying alarms
that are fictitious and invented, as if they were truth, and flee to their
mothers' bosoms. If on account of the blasphemies contained in the opinions of
those men we yield to them words and names which establish the truth, together
with the sound of the words the great mystery of religion <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#71"><SUP>71</SUP></A>

<p>Accordingly it is the same thing to say that God the Word was

that were united beyond the reach of disturbance, and caused the two of them to

<p>Where then we confess the one out of two, Lord and Son and Christ, and one
incarnate nature of the Word himself, we understand the difference as it were in
the natural characteristics of the natures from which Christ is. But, if we
speak of two natures after the union, which necessarily exist in singleness and
separately, as if divided into a duality, but united by a conjunction of
brotherhood (if we ought to call such a thing unity), the notion of difference
reaches to the extent of division, and does not stop at natural characteristics.

<p>But, since it is a habit of the enemies of the truth to hurl accusations at <A NAME="p30"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|30</SPAN></A>
us of things which are the opposite of their evil opinions, and to charge us
with holding some mixture or blending or confusion or phantasy in the divine and
ineffable Humanization, after common deliberation we have decided to make clear
by a limitation and distinction what was stated by you without limitation. You
say of the mystery of Christ that you do not recognise the difference of the
natures, nor yet their individuality, since with 'difference' you understand
also 'division'. Hence also you clearly laid down the following by way of a
canon: &laquo;When therefore we seek to separate and distinguish rational nature from
irrational, and suprasensual from perceptible, and created from uncreated,
together with the difference between these things we also make a separation and
division&raquo;. These statements have been made by you as well and wisely as
possible, that, where there is rational and irrational, or perceptible and
suprasensual, or created arid uncreated, each of them remains by itself, and
appears in its own hypostasis, that is, has an individual and separate and
distinct existence; for here with difference is understood also division, and
again from the difference of the qualities which naturally belong to each singly
we recognise <A NAME="p31"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|31</SPAN></A> division. When therefore out of things that differ in kind and are not of one
essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#75"><SUP>75</SUP></A> with one another, the suprasensual I mean and the
perceptible, a combination or natural union takes place in order to make up one
animal, as we see in the case of a man, the division into two ceases, for of
this the notion of unity does not admit, but the difference and individuality as
it were in the natural characteristics of the elements which have come together
into one is preserved, since the body has not refused to be body, nor has the
soul passed into the nature of the body. The same thing, and something higher,
is understood with regard to Emmanuel also.<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#76"><SUP>76</SUP></A>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, since you have thought fit to ask me what is the difference that appears
in natural characteristics, I mean of the natures from which Emmanuel is, I will
explain clearly and not conceal. (<i>And a little farther on.</i>) For <A NAME="p32"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|32</SPAN></A>
Cyril the truly holy and wise after writing in the letter to Acacius, &laquo;Godhead
and manhood are not the same thing in respect of natural characteristics&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#77"><SUP>77</SUP></A>,
in the second volume <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#78"><SUP>78</SUP></A> against the blasphemies of Nestorius writes as
follows, as if explaining the meaning of the expression: &laquo;For between Godhead
and manhood I also allow that there is great distinction and distance: for the
things which have been named are clearly different, and in no point like one
another&raquo;<sup> </sup><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#79"><SUP>79</SUP></A>. This then is the difference that appears in natural
characteristics, the different principle underlying the existence of Godhead and
manhood <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#80"><SUP>80</SUP></A>: for the one is without beginning and uncreated, and
bodiless, and intangible, while the other is created, and subject to beginning,
and temporary and tangible, as being flesh and solid. This difference we in no
wise assert to have been removed by the union.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Of the same from the letter to Eleusinius which begins, </i>&laquo;In
wrestling-contests&raquo;.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was sufficient to banish this unseemly supposition, that 'difference <A NAME="p33"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|33</SPAN></A>
in characteristics' was not stated absolutely, but the word 'natural' was
added, which declares the fact that it is only by the intellect and by subtle
investigation that we can know of what kind each of the natures is which have
combined in the unity and made up one hypostasis and manifestly declare that
Emmanuel is one out of two opposite things, Godhead I mean and manhood, as
Gregory the Theologian <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#81"><SUP>81</SUP></A> said, &laquo;Let distinctness be maintained in the
unity&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#82"><SUP>82</SUP></A>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Of the same from another </i><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#83"><SUP>83</SUP></A> <i>letter to the same Eleusinius,
which begins, </i>&laquo;In wrestling-contests&raquo;.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How then, after these things have been written by me, is it not plain to
everyone from the words used by the wise Cyril that division also is then
understood to accompany difference, when the separate natures or hypostases
exist individually, not when one person and one incarnate nature or hypostasis
of God the Word is made up by coalescence from two? That the holy Cyril says
that separation or division is then joined with difference <A NAME="p34"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|34</SPAN></A>
when the natures exist apart and by themselves is testified by the addition
made to the words cited above from the <i>prosphonetikon </i>oration.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Of the same from the letter to Eleusinius, which begins,</i> &laquo;In wrestling-contests&raquo;.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And do not tell me that the holy Cyril alone used the expression in this
sense; but observe with sound intelligence that he does not step outside the
apostolic faith; for Gregory the Theologian also spoke words that are in accord
with him in the passage which we have just cited above. And, if none of the
God-clad fathers before him in fact spoke in so many words of unity in
hypostasis with reference to the Incarnation of God the Word, yet still all the
lovers of the right faith accepted it, inasmuch as it sets forth the splendour
of the mystery of the divine Humanization, and it agrees with the opinion of the
doctors of the church. Therefore also that wretched and impious Theodoret speaks
thus in the objection to the 2<sup>nd</sup> anathema: &laquo;Unity in hypostasis we
do not recognise at all, as being strange and alien to the divine Scriptures,
and to the doctors who expounded these&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#84"><SUP>84</SUP></A>. <A NAME="p35"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|35</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

<p>But perhaps someone will say that, when the wise Basil said, &laquo;Grace arising
from the dispensation&raquo;<sup> </sup><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#85"><SUP>85</SUP></A>, he referred to the coming in the flesh. But
let us know clearly that the Word of God, even before he rose upon us in fleshly
form, constantly controlled <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#86"><SUP>86</SUP></A> our life and our salvation; for 'in him
we live and move and exist'<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#87"><SUP>87</SUP></A>: for the name 'dispensation' is not
applied to the grace of the Humanization among us only. And Gregory the
Theologian <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#88"><SUP>88</SUP></A> is a witness of this when he says, &laquo;The other
appellations etc.&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#85"><SUP>85</SUP></A>.

<p> But know that the great Basil did not call Christ a God-clad man (far <A NAME="p36"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|36</SPAN></A>
be it!), but called Christ's flesh God-clad flesh. But the same immediately
afterwards termed the same flesh Christ-clad <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#90"><SUP>90</SUP></A>. But if the expression
'God-clad' and 'Christ-clad' is the same, the conclusion is that Christ the Word
who became incarnate and was humanized for our sakes is true God, not a God-clad
man.

<p> We therefore judge that which was desired by those who assembled at
Chalcedon against the truth, to banish the confession that Christ is to be
recognised as from two natures, and to introduce instead the confession that he
is to be recognised as in two natures, as the company of Nestorius desire, to be
abominable and also impious, and we will never propound the same teaching (?) as
those who, in order to open the gates to the doctrines of Nestorius, .....<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#92"><SUP>92</SUP></A>
so we also require the opposite, that the one be openly proclaimed, and the
other completely suppressed and banished in accordance <A NAME="p37"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|37</SPAN></A>
with the laws of the holy church. For let the means of remedy be introduced
by the same similar drugs as those by which it was desired to produce the
sickness; and let us not neglect things that are so manifest, and go about and
pick out, or search as among reeds, and seek if anywhere in the writings of the
holy fathers of the orthodox <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#93"><SUP>93</SUP></A> we occasionally find 'difference' or
'in two' or 'from two' indiscriminately and incautiously stated. Indeed in the
11<sup>th</sup> book of the interpretative narrative of the Gospel of John the
holy Cyril used the expression 'in two' of the separate hypostases as follows:
&laquo;Everywhere and under all circumstances there will follow and coincide with the
knowledge concerning the offspring the knowledge also concerning him who begot
him; as indeed the converse also is true. But, if the statement is true and is
unhesitatingly received, that the Father is understood together with and enters
together with the Son, and the Son also with the Father, and the knowledge of
each of them runs in the two, how can the Son be a creature, as. some impious
men say?&raquo;<sup> </sup><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#94"><SUP>94</SUP></A>; even as no one says that the name and fact of division
and union are the same, as they themselves indeed suppressed the one and stated

<p>For those hypostases or natures, being in composition without diminution, and
not existing separately and in individual existence, make up one person of one
Lord and Christ and Son, and one incarnate nature and hypostasis of the Word.

<p>From what has been stated the doctor teaches that the peculiarity of the
natural union is that the hypostases are in composition and are perfect without
diminution, but refuse to continue an individual existence so as to be numbered
as two, and to have its own person impressed upon each of them, which a
conjunction in honour cannot possibly do. <A NAME="p39"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|39</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

and Son and Lord, and one incarnate nature of the Word and one person.

<p> Since therefore these things have thus been made clear, it has already
been recognised that it is alien to those who confess a hypostatic union to call
the hypostases, that is the natures which in an ineffable manner coalesced in
one, from which Emmanuel is, persons, and therefore to think and say that the
union is from two persons. To say this belongs to those who confess a
falsely-named union, who make the man and God exist apart in individual
existence, and devise for themselves a conjunction founded upon authority and
identity of name. <A NAME="p40"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|40</SPAN></A>&nbsp;<A NAME="p41"><SPAN CLASS=pb></SPAN></A>

<p> But I hear that the Romans say, &laquo;We are afraid to call him who
suffered for us in the flesh one of the Trinity, lest we subject the Holy
Trinity to numeration&raquo;. But this is full of utter ignorance and impiety, and is
a pretext of men who seize pretexts for sins, or of those who know not what they
say and about what they affirm <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#101"><SUP>101</SUP></A>, as Paul the apostle somewhere says
about certain persons. The Holy Trinity is capable of numeration in respect of
hypostases; but, in that it is one and of the same essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#102"><SUP>102</SUP></A>, it
stands outside number.
</p>
<p>(<i>And again a little lower down.</i>) Accordingly therefore the Romans, who
are very wise, are infected with profound error, not knowing that in essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#102"><SUP>102</SUP></A>
the Trinity is incapable either of numeration or of division, but in respect of
hypostases it is both divided and separated, in order that distinctness may be
maintained in the individual likenesses of the Father and <A NAME="p44"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|44</SPAN></A>
<A NAME="p45"><SPAN CLASS=pb></SPAN></A>the Son and the Holy Spirit. But at those who resemble the Romans both in
impiety and in ignorance, the Jebusites <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#103"><SUP>103</SUP></A>, I am greatly surprised,
since they have in clumsy fashion and by a new and very crass expression named
the Holy Trinity a Trinity of hypostases' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#104"><SUP>104</SUP></A>. A word compounded in this
way I have never till this day heard; for it leads us to understand that three
glorified hypostases do not exist apart, but one that takes three forms and
changes now into the hypostasis of the Father, now into that of the Son, now
into the hypostasis of the Holy Spirit, and that it is one, but changes person <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#105"><SUP>105</SUP></A>
as in a theatre <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#106"><SUP>106</SUP></A>, and speaks or acts now as from the person

of the Son, now as from the

that there is aHoly Trinity, divided and distinct in hypostases, but not divided
in one essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#109"><SUP>109</SUP></A> and Godhead, and kingship and glory and eternity and
the other attributes which God has by nature. For the Father has one thing
hypostatically, fatherhood, and the fact that he is unbegotten; and the Son
again has one thing hypostatically, sonship, and the fact that he was begotten
by the Father; and the Holy Spirit again has one thing, the fact that he was not
begotten, but proceeds eternally without beginning from the Father: for in
virtue of these things distinctness of person belongs to each one of them, that
is, is marked out and defined for the hypostases, but all the other attributes
are, as I have said, common, equal in honour and undivided, and such as show
that we for our part have believed in one God, and in one <A NAME="p46"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|46</SPAN></A>
<A NAME="p47"><SPAN CLASS=pb></SPAN></A>essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#109"><SUP>109</SUP></A>, and he exists and is made known in three hypostases. For
the Son was begotten by the Father, and the Spirit proceeds from the Father,
although eternally and without time, and their ascent is to him, as to a root
and source, and from him they are, though they are not after him. And for this
reason, while we confess three hypostases, we do not believe in three first
causes, but one first cause, and one kingship. After pursuing the matter so far
we praise only and do not investigate what the unbegottenness of the Father is,
or what the generation of the Son is, or what the procession of the Holy Spirit
is; for these things are known only by the Father who begot and the Son who was
begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father: but he requires us
to know 'through these things that we are to confess one essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#110"><SUP>110</SUP></A>
and
Godhead, made known in three distinct hypostases.

<p>For that the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit should be named on the
occasion of baptism ......... For how [can] they who have not participated in flesh nor been humanized ......... the only Son
and Word who was begotten by the Father? For there are indeed many rites that
are performed, and ......... look to the same origin. <A NAME="p48"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|48</SPAN></A>
<A NAME="p49"><SPAN CLASS=pb></SPAN></A>But each ........., so that even the understandings are confused.
Of this I ..... in one of my treatises which I wrote . . . about
interpretations. There after examining the question why the Lord came to baptism
when he was 30 years of age in the flesh I said at one time that it was in order
to show that the new birth begets men full-grown in reasonable age, for so also
the first man was created full-grown, and immediately as full-grown received a
commandment and a law, and was given permission to till and keep Paradise, and
the words which follow<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#113"><SUP>113</SUP></A>; and at another that by means of three
periods comprised in three decads which make 30 years he signified the mystery
that was revealed on the Jordan, that one Godhead is made known in three
complete hypostases, by which holy baptism in the Father and the Son and the
Holy Spirit was to be performed. That these things introduce no confusion
Gregory the Theologian in the sermon on the Passover states as follows: &laquo;The
Lord's passion<sup>2</sup>, the passion<sup>2</sup>, and again I say the passion<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#114"><SUP>114</SUP></A>,
in honour of the Holy Trinity&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#115"><SUP>115</SUP></A>; though I know that no other
<A NAME="p49"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|49</SPAN></A><SPAN CLASS=pb> </SPAN>undertook the saving passion on our behalf in the flesh except God the Word,
who became incarnate for our race. For the whole of the saving Humanization has
this effect, that the mystery of the Holy Trinity is revealed to us, although
you speak of the birth in flesh, or of the Gross or of the burial, or of the
Resurrection from among the dead, dividing the Humanization into many elements.
For indeed in each of these we confess that we know the Trinity, in that we
indicate upon our faces that the sign of the revered Cross is a dissolver of
every evil influence; and, when therefore we sign ourselves, we sign three
times, and we show that it is through the Gross that we have obtained knowledge
in the Trinity. And this sign is a thing which makes known and completes all
things that are done among Christians; and it is everywhere adopted, at the
performance of baptism, at the consecration of water, at the celebration of the
rational, spiritual sacrifice, and at the symbolic and ineffable ordinations to
the priesthood of those who are duly appointed to the sacred ministry, though in
all these things we do not call upon one of the hypostases only, that is God the
Word who <A NAME="p50"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|50</SPAN></A> was humanized, but on the three together, the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit, indicating that it is by the power of the Cross that we have partaken of
all these things and have obtained knowledge in them<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#116"><SUP>116</SUP></A>.

<p> To the devout presbyters and orthodox<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#117"><SUP>117</SUP></A> deacons, and to the

the magnificent and Christ-loving magistrates of the city, and to all the people
of the holy church, Severus greeting in our Lord.
</p>
<p>To those who are not wise in their mind or are otherwise without intelligence, and are lacking in true instruction, the holy Scripture gives
the proper rule and place, in order that their emptiness of mind and lack of instruction may be turned to wisdom: for indeed it commands those who
are such both to learn and to ask, or to be silent altogether; for the holy
book <A NAME="p51"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|51</SPAN></A> of Proverbs somewhere said: &laquo;To the fool who asketh wisdom shall be
reckoned: but, when a man maketh himself silent, he is thought to be wise&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#120"><SUP>120</SUP></A>.
But the man who keeps this rule it raises and advances, and incites to learn
things that are of use and profit, and it says, &laquo;Give thine heart to wisdom,
and prepare thine ears for words of understanding&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#121"><SUP>121</SUP></A>. I am surprised
therefore that the brother whom you mention (out of tenderness for his soul I do
not mention his name) did not know his own measure, and, besides not knowing
originally the subject on which he was talking, neglected this legally
established and salutary rule; and, when he ought to have bent a ear of
understanding to those who are wiser than he is, he on the contrary threatened
to take the ignorance that is in him to the city of Alexandria, like an
invincible warrior, who is able to overcome and take captive all that meet him,
and sell them where he likes. Therefore I have both accepted your wisdom in the
Lord, which is worthy of the church and very honourable, and your patience,
which is such as befits Christians, and have crowned them also with a decree of
many praises, since in accordance with the apostolic model you both received and
admonished him as your member and brother <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#122"><SUP>122</SUP></A>, and brought forward the
teachings of the holy fathers. And, <A NAME="p52"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|52</SPAN></A> whereas you once and twice secretly and openly refuted and corrected him on
the points on which he spoke without knowledge, and he was again involved in the
same errors, and you behaved like doctors and churchmen, and on all sides seek
to gain his salvation, and by actual deeds show that you look to the apostolic
commandment which commands, &laquo;Let everything be done decently and in order&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#123"><SUP>123</SUP></A>,
but he, though he was thought worthy to receive so much attention, had no mercy
on his soul, and did not restrain himself so as to show moderation and humility,
I expressed blame and at the same time showed mercy and still show mercy, since
ignorance is free from danger<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#124"><SUP>124</SUP></A>, for a man is not blamed because he
does not know. He is trying to bring upon himself the sin that does not deserve
forgiveness, in that he does not yield to those who are wise among the brethren,
or seek from wiser men a cure for his ignorance by desire to learn, but pettily
searches into things that are unknown and uncertain, and does his best to find
men to share his opinions, in order that he may seem to be saying something when
he is saying nothing that is sound. But the other things which he said without <A NAME="p53"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|53</SPAN></A>
knowledge he has with difficulty come to honour by silence, in that he
assented to the passages from the holy fathers (that were brought before him;
and he was reduced to one passage, the words used by the holy Cyril in the
second volume <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#125"><SUP>125</SUP></A> against the blasphemies of Nestorius, which are
as follows: (( For, because the Word who is from God the Father took flesh and
came forth as a man like us, he would not for this reason be also termed a
double thing. For he is one, and not without flesh, who in his own nature is
without flesh and blood&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#126"><SUP>126</SUP></A>. After you had quoted to him the
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#127"><SUP>127</SUP></A> words used by the doctor, he persisted and said
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#128"><SUP>128</SUP></A> that after his own
Resurrection <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#129"><SUP>129</SUP></A> we must confess that God the Word is without flesh
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#130"><SUP>130</SUP></A>,
inasmuch as he put off that which was without variation and without <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#131"><SUP>131</SUP></A>
separation hypostatically united to him, a thing that is beyond all impiety and
profanity, so that <A NAME="p54"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|54</SPAN></A> everyone who has natural (I will not say, spiritual) intelligence must wonder
if a fact which is so universally admitted has ever been made a subject of
contention, and has <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#132"><SUP>132</SUP></A> passed the lips of anyone who has duly believed
in our one Lord and God and Saviour <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#133"><SUP>133</SUP></A> Jesus Christ. If he
were skilled in divine doctrine, he should have (to omit everything else)
considered the anathemas of Gregory the Theologian, who in the great letter to
Cledonius which begins, 'I wonder what this innovation is', clearly lays down
these principles in it, &laquo;If anyone says that the flesh <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#134"><SUP>134</SUP></A>
was now laid
down by him, and the Godhead is stripped of a body, and does not confess that he
both is and will come with the thing assumed itself, may he not see the glory of
his coming. For where is the body now except with him who assumed it? For it has
not been laid up in the sun, as the silly tale of the Manichees goes, in order
that he may be honoured through the object of contempt, or diffused and
dissolved in the air, like the nature of a voice and the wafting of a smell, and
the course of lightning that does not stand still. But what becomes of the fact
that he was actually touched after the Resurrection, or that he will again some
time <A NAME="p55"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|55</SPAN></A> be seen by those who pierced him? For the Godhead by itself is invisible. But
he will come with the body, according to my account, and such as he was seen by,
or was shown to, the disciples on the mount, inasmuch as the Godhead easily
overcomes the flesh&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#135"><SUP>135</SUP></A>.<i> </i>Who.that reads these words resplendent
with truth, and flashing with the rays of the Holy Spirit, will dare to say that
the Word of God, who was humanized immutably and without any phantasy <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#136"><SUP>136</SUP></A>,
is without flesh after the inexplicable and incomprehensible union? Accordingly
it is clear that you also have not gone beyond what is fitting in opposing the
precipitous error of that man and saying in order to remove him from this error,
&laquo;The words used by the doctor about the Word of God, In his own nature he is
without flesh and blood', refer to the time before the Humanization&raquo;. Indeed,
since he himself said that 'he is one, and not without flesh', how can it be
anything but wholly unreasonable, and presumptuous and irreverent, for us to
gainsay this, and contend that he is without <A NAME="p56"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|56</SPAN></A>
flesh? But the words which he went on to add, 'who in his own nature is
without flesh and blood', plainly introduce this thought, that in his own
nature, that is in the Godhead, he has no association with flesh and blood. He
did not take the flesh into the fulness of his own divine nature and mix it with
it, nor did he mingle it with his own Godhead, but that in the dispensatory
assumption we might understand him to be not without flesh, Emmanuel being
wonderfully composed and consisting of two elements, the Godhead and the
manhood: but even so he preserved the absence, of mixture in the divine essence<sup>1</sup>,
and did not change the essence<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#137"><SUP>137</SUP></A> of the Godhead into the nature of
flesh. And that this is so I bring as a witness to the accuracy of his doctrines
the doctor himself, who by the operation of the Holy Spirit is an accurate
doctor. In the first letter to Succensus, when certain men had advanced a
similar objection, he expressed himself thus: &laquo;Since I found in <A NAME="p57"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|57</SPAN></A>
the memorial an assertion of this kind stated, that since the Resurrection
the holy body of Christ the Saviour of us all has passed into the nature of the
Godhead, so as to be all Godhead only, I thought it right to speak against this
also&raquo;. And thereupon, after he has above in a brief compass gone through all
the statement of the dispensation of the Humanization, he brings against it this
argument: &laquo;It is impossible for a body taken from earth to endure the change
into the divine nature. And, if not, we bring against the Godhead the charge
that it is as a thing that is made and as a thing that has taken into it
something that is not its by nature&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#138"><SUP>138</SUP></A>. See! how plainly he denies
that the divinity of the Word has taken anything into its essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#139"><SUP>139</SUP></A>
which is not its by nature, though we confess that flesh possessing an
intelligent soul was taken by God the Word, and he united this to him
hypostatically, but not so that anything should be added to his divine essence<sup>2</sup>,
as if it were deficient (for he is truly complete in everything), but that from
the unmixed union of the Incarnation, and the composition out of two elements,
the Godhead <A NAME="p58"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|58</SPAN></A> and the manhood, Emmanuel should be made up, who in one hypostasis is
ineffably composite; not simple, but composite: as the soul of a man like us,
which by nature is bodiless and rational, which is naturally intertwined with
the body, remains in its suprasensual and bodiless nature, but by reason of the
composition with the body makes up one composite animal, man. Accordingly the
assumption of the body makes no addition to the essence <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#140"><SUP>140</SUP></A>
</sup>of the soul,
but makes up the composite animal, as it is reasonable to understand with regard
to the theory <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#141"><SUP>141</SUP></A> of Emmanuel also. The Word did not take the flesh
intelligently possessed of a soul in order to complete his being God, as we have
said, but that one hypostasis might be wonderfully and immutably made up out of
two elements, the Godhead we mean and the manhood, and the one incarnate nature
of the Word himself, and one person: for the Word of God, according to the
saying of Paul the apostle, partook of blood and flesh after our pattern <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#142"><SUP>142</SUP></A>.
And that this is so the approved Cyril further shows in the letter to Valerian
bishop of Iconium; who wrote as follows: &laquo;For God and man did not come
together, as they say, and make up <A NAME="p59"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|59</SPAN></A> one Christ; but, as I have already said, the Word, being God, partook of
blood and flesh like us, in order that he may be known to be God who was
humanized, and who took our flesh, and made this his, because, as the man who
was composed of soul and body is known to be one, so also now <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#143"><SUP>143</SUP></A>
he is
acknowledged to be one Son and Lord. For one nature and hypostasis of a man is
acknowledged, though he is known to be made of diverse and heterogeneous
elements: for the body is truly different in nature from the soul; but it
belongs to it, and with it makes up the hypostasis of the one man. And in mental
conception and in theory the difference of the things that have been named is
not obscure, but by combination and concurrence that cannot be cut asunder one
animal, man, is made up. The Word therefore, the Only one of God, did not come
forth as man by taking a man, but, though his birth from the Father is
ineffable, he became man by forming a man <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#144"><SUP>144</SUP></A> for himself through the
Holy Spirit which is of one essence with him. Accordingly he is known to be one,
though in the theory which is according to reason his own body is different in
nature from himself. Let it therefore be everywhere acknowledged that he was not
without soul, but that he was possessed of an intelligent soul&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#145"><SUP>145</SUP></A>.
Similarly also in the second volume <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#146"><SUP>146</SUP></A> <A NAME="p60"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|60</SPAN></A>
against the blasphemies of Nestorius he clearly teaches that the assumption
of flesh did not pass into the Godhead of the Word, but that the Word of God
remained in his own nature, and apart from flesh, but by the immutable
combination with flesh it was wisely and beyond all reason and understanding
brought about that one Christ should be marvellously made up; for he speaks
thus: &laquo;Accordingly confess one, not dividing the natures, while you know and
understand that to flesh belongs one principle, and to Godhead that which befits
it only. For we do not say that the flesh of the Word became Godhead, but rather
that it is divine as being his. For, as the flesh of a man is called his, on
what ground is it not right for us also to call that of the Word divine?&raquo; And
again farther on: &laquo;If therefore he were a wise and intelligent man at all, he
should say that the body is from a woman, but confess besides that by being
combined in hypostatic union with the Word it has made up one Christ and one
Son, and one Lord, who being the same is God and man&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#147"><SUP>147</SUP></A>. The
expressions therefore that are used by this genuine and very accurate father,
'for he is one, and not without flesh', and, 'he who in his own nature is apart
from flesh and blood', demonstrate <A NAME="p61"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|61</SPAN></A> this, as is plain from what we have demonstrated, that in the dispensatory
conjunction he is not without flesh: for he is one composed of two elements, the
Godhead and the manhood, which have a perfect existence in their own sphere; but
in his own nature he is known to be apart from flesh and blood, and without a
body; not that he mingled flesh with the nature or with the essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#148"><SUP>148</SUP></A>
of the Godhead, but that he kept the Godhead sublime and pure and unmixed, in
the characteristics of its own incorporeal character, as also he did not change
the manhood which was hypostatically united to him, but kept it free and without
change in its own characteristics. Wherefore also one may see that Nestorius and
those who like Jews hold his opinions wish to reject the absence of change of
the hypostatic union, and to put confusion into the minds of the believers,
while they are everywhere making this charge, that we confess that the body was
changed into the divine essence<sup>1</sup>, and thereby hold one incarnate
nature of God the Word, and they say that they themselves only, the wretched,
unhappy men, keep the Godhead of the holy Trinity unmixed and pure, by
confessing that the man from Mary, as they themselves say, in loving mercy was
conjoined to <A NAME="p62"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|62</SPAN></A> God the Word and shares with him in sonship and divine authority, and by this
self-created scruple <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#149"><SUP>149</SUP></A> they make the Trinity a quaternity. And for
this reason the wise Cyril shows Nestorius also, who was their leader in this
fatuity, speaking thus: &laquo;Therefore God the Word is named Christ also, because
he has the eternal conjunction with Christ, and God the Word cannot do anything
without the manhood: for he knows the coalescence exactly <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#150"><SUP>150</SUP></A>,
not with the Godhead, as the new wise men amoug the doctors say&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#151"><SUP>151</SUP></A>.
And the same man of small intellect weaves the same charge, and in the treatise
entitled 'Against the Theopaschites or Cyrillians', which he composed in the
form of question and answer, speaks thus:
</p>
<p>&laquo;The Theopaschite says: 'And how can we be accused of the composition of the
Diphysites, we who call Christ one incarnate nature of God?'
</p>
<p>The orthodox <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#152"><SUP>152</SUP></A> says: 'Your own refutation, which you think is a
defence, itself refutes. For you have confessed that one nature is prepared for
Christ, from incorporeality and a body, and a hypostasis with one nature <A NAME="p63"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|63</SPAN></A>
of the incarnation of the Godhead. But this is the confusion of those who
have two natures, that the natures themselves are deprived of the hypostases
which they severally possess, that are confounded with one another'&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#153"><SUP>153</SUP></A>.
</p>
<p>And again farther on in the same treatise:
</p>
<p>&laquo;The Theopaschite says: 'What do you think of an eggshell (?) of water that
has been poured into the sea?' The orthodox <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#154"><SUP>154</SUP></A> says: 'What else except
that the unstable addition of the water has disappeared in the great volume of
the sea?'
</p>
<p>The Theopaschite says: 'Something similar happened also to the flesh: for do
not think that the Godhead is smaller than the sea in relation to the flesh as
compared with the shifting character of the eggshell'.
</p>
<p>The orthodox<sup>2</sup> says: 'By &laquo;shifting character&raquo; do you mean a kind
of instability, or the change of that which was swallowed up into that which
swallowed it up?'
</p>
<p>The Theopaschite says: 'The change of the essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#155"><SUP>155</SUP></A>
of the body
into the Godhead'.
</p>
<p>The orthodox<sup>2</sup> says: 'The nature of the body remaining, or being
dissolved into non-existence?' <A NAME="p64"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|64</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The Theopaschite says: 'The flesh passing into the nature of the Godhead
instead of the essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#156"><SUP>156</SUP></A> of flesh'&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#157"><SUP>157</SUP></A>.
</p>
<p>While very vainly putting together such reasons against the right confession
of the Humanization, as I said before, reasons which contend against God, and
saying that a man should be worshipped with the Trinity, Nestorius and those who
think with him state of themselves that they preserve the unity of nature of the
three hypostases unmixed, in that they do not confess that God the Word was
hypostatically united to flesh possessing an intelligent soul, and call the
union that is so far above nature and immutable and wonderful mingling.
Wherefore also Dorotheus, who became bishop of Marcianopolis <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#158"><SUP>158</SUP></A>, and
belonged to the same Jewish company and party, presented a petition to Marcian's
own self at the very beginning of his reign, and found fault with the position <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#159"><SUP>159</SUP></A>
held by the bishops, and the sound opinion of the holy churches; and he speaks
thus: &laquo;Therefore, merciful kings, in consideration of their so ridiculous, that
is lamentable, opinions, renew the firm maintenance of the connaturality while
it is possible, while there is time, by recalling Nestorius from exile <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#160"><SUP>160</SUP></A>,<i>
</i>and join together the people of Christ who are divided, lest, <A NAME="p65"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|65</SPAN></A>
as I pray may not happen, the past be repeated&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#161"><SUP>161</SUP></A>. The holy Cyril
therefore, having exposed such old people's fables and Jewish tales <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#162"><SUP>162</SUP></A>
in every part of his writings, in the first letter to Succensus also, which I
mentioned above, said thus: &laquo;But it is impossible for a body taken from earth
to endure the change into the divine nature; for it cannot be done. And, if not,
we speak of the Godhead as a thing that is made, and as a thing that has taken
into it something that is not its by nature. For on the score of impropriety it
is equal for us to say that the body was changed into the nature of Godhead, and
also the other thing too that the Word was changed into the nature of flesh.
For, as this is impossible (for he is invariable and immutable), so also is the
other. For it is not among possibilities that any created thing can pass into
the essence or nature of Godhead. But the body too is a created thing.
Accordingly we say that Christ's body is divine, because it is also God's body,
and resplendent with ineffable glory, incorruptible, holy, life-giving: but,
that it was changed into the nature <A NAME="p66"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|66</SPAN></A> of Godhead, none of the holy fathers has either thought or said, nor do we
ourselves so hold&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#163"><SUP>163</SUP></A>. This fact therefore according to the expression
of the doctor, that the body of the Word is resplendent with ineffable glory,
incorruptible and holy and life-giving, Gregory the Theologian also in the
demonstration contained in the letter to Gledonius demonstrated by saying that
the Godhead overcame the incarnation <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#164"><SUP>164</SUP></A>. Accordingly the flesh remained
flesh, even after the God-befitting Resurrection and Ascension, but adorned with
divine and ineffable glory, and with all the excellencies that befit God; and it
is divine as something that is the body of God, and it was not changed into the
essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#165"><SUP>165</SUP></A> of the Godhead. It is in this meaning that the expression of
the doctor with which we are now concerned also should rightly be understood
that God the Word is one and not without flesh: for he is incarnate by
hypostatic union in flesh possessing an intelligent soul (but in his own nature
he is without flesh and blood), that is, without mixture <A NAME="p67"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|67</SPAN></A>
with what he possesses in his essence <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#166"><SUP>166</SUP></A></sup> and nature, that is the
bodiless and immutable and incomprehensible Godhead.
</p>
<p>As for what you say at the end that the man who easily follows illusions (?) <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#167"><SUP>167</SUP></A>
</sup>and shifts his ground widely said on the advice of certain persons, that
we must think of<i> </i>the Word of God in the infinity of his divine essence <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#166"><SUP>166</SUP></A>
</sup>without flesh, is very foolish and senseless. Even though the Word of God
is infinite, the whole of him was united to the flesh that was received from the
holy Virgin, the God-bearer and ever-virgin Mary, even the very person of the
Word and not a partial operation as in the prophets. How then is it anything but
ridiculous for us to say that he who was in the actual divine hypostasis wholly
united to a body naturally as well as miraculously is without flesh, even in the
greatness of his infinite Godhead<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#168"><SUP>168</SUP></A>? For 'there is no limit to his
greatness' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#169"><SUP>169</SUP></A>, as David said, and he fills everything, and is above
everything, and cannot be comprised by anyone. And the subtlety of <A NAME="p68"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|68</SPAN></A>
the mystery cannot be explored by reason and intellect, how the whole of him
was in flesh, and the whole of him is in all things and the whole of him is
superior to all things and he himself is Ruler of all in infinity. But, that we
believe that the very hypostasis of God the Word became incarnate, according to
the apostolic tradition of the church that has been handed down from of old, it
is superfluous for us to demonstrate by testimonies to those who have once
believed in the Gospel, when John who was divine in words beyond the evangelists
said, &laquo;The Word became flesh and came to dwell in us&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#170"><SUP>170</SUP></A>. How ever,
since there is a doubt about it, and in order that we may close the doors
against all contention, on this point too let the words of the father himself, I
mean the holy Cyril, come to our assistance, who in the defence of the second
chapter <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#171"><SUP>171</SUP></A> addressed to Theodoret the deceiver wrote thus: &laquo;Since
Nestorius therefore everywhere eliminates the birth in flesh, and introduces
among us a union of authority only, and says that a man was conjoined to God,
who is honoured by identity of name of sonship, in contending against his
propositions we were compelled to say that the hypostatic union took place, in
which expression <A NAME="p69"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|69</SPAN></A> the word 'hypostatic' denotes nothing else except this only, that the nature
itself or his hypostasis, which is the Word himself, after it has been united to
human nature without variation and confusion, as we have often said, is
recognised as one Christ [and] is so, the same God and man&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#172"><SUP>172</SUP></A>. After
the same fashion in the Scholia also he comes forward with the same words as
follows: &laquo;'For in him dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily', that is not
by assumption simply <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#173"><SUP>173</SUP></A>, like light that shines, or fire that imparts
its heat [to] the objects near it, but, if we may so say, that the divine and
incontaminable nature itself by a true union as I have said made the temple from
the Virgin a dwelling-place for that which he is recognised to be. For thus
Christ Jesus is recognised to be one&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#174"><SUP>174</SUP></A>. But, that the whole of him
was in a body, and was hypostatically united to it, him of whom all things were
divinely full, he himself confirms by his own words. For it is written in the
Gospel of John also that he said to Nicodemus, &laquo;No man hath gone up to heaven,
except him who came down from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#175"><SUP>175</SUP></A>;
though he did not come down from heaven in that he became man, for he did not
bring the flesh down from <A NAME="p70"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|70</SPAN></A> heaven, but he received it from the holy Virgin, flesh that is of our race,
and of our nature. Nor again, when he was speaking to Nicodemus, was he
corporeally in heaven; but incorporeally, in that he is God, heaven and earth
and what is above heaven were perpetually full of him. And in the eighth section
of the second of the books against <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#176"><SUP>176</SUP></A> Julian the great in
demon-worship, which were written by him in defence of the Christian religion,
the doctor shows how the Word of God, while he is all in all, was hypostatic
ally united to the flesh derived from the holy Mary, and, beyond every creature,
filled all things by reception from him (in a suprasensual sense nothing is
empty of him), though the infinity of his greatness surpasses and soars above
all things that exist with a great space between (how great it is impossible to
say): by whom according to the words of Isaiah &laquo;all the nations have been
reckoned as a drop from a pot, and as the sand of a balance&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#177"><SUP>177</SUP></A>. But
the holy Cyril again speaks thus: &laquo;He has become, as I said, in the likeness of
men, as it is written, and in our human appearance truly. Nevertheless we did
not say that he who cannot be comprised was <A NAME="p71"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|71</SPAN></A>
confined, nor that he was inclosed in the limits of the body. For it is
utterly silly and complete folly to say anything of the kind of him who is by
nature and in truth God. For, while he is one and the only Son, and completely
above all human phantasy, the whole of him is in virtue of a gift in every man,
and in each [one] by presence, not being divided nor cleft asunder, but [above]
everything by nature, and in everything as God. 'But in that all-pure and holy
body 'all the fulness of the Godhead bodily has come to dwell', as it is
written. And he was as in his own flesh, but still even so he filled all things
from him&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#178"><SUP>178</SUP></A>. And in the treatise addressed to the queens the opening words of
which are, Those who administer the divine and heavenly preaching', he explains
the meaning of the statement that the Word of God and all the fulness of the
Godhead came to dwell in flesh as written by Paul in this way: &laquo;But we believe
that the Word became flesh, not by way of removal or change, but rather that he
came to dwell in us, and, to speak correctly, made the body that was in truth
united <A NAME="p72"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|72</SPAN></A> to him, possessing an intelligent soul, his own temple. And the divine Paul,
declaring the indwelling of the Word in the holy flesh, or the true union, said
that in him all the fulness of the Godhead came to dwell, not so much by way of
assumption or presence, or by way of a gift of grace, but bodily, that is in
essence; as in the case of a man also it is said [that] his spirit dwells in
him, though it is not something different from him&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#179"><SUP>179</SUP></A>. How then shall
we say [that] he who is wholly in everything by way of gift, and in each man in
presence (for he receives all things from him and they depend upon his
presence), and who further also is in everything and is nowhere cleft asunder or
divided, and further is wholly in the all-holy flesh in essence, and so is
united to it, after the fashion in which the soul of a man like us is united to
its own body, how shall we say that he is without his own flesh, because he
filled all these things with the gift of himself, he who is infinite, and is
wholly in everything? But to inquire into such a marvellous subject is a piece
of utter foolishness: for glorious things are sealed by faith only. In the other
treatise addressed to the religious virgin queens, Arcadia and Marina, which
begins, 'The world's boast', the same wise Cyril <A NAME="p73"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|73</SPAN></A>
inserted a demonstration from the holy John who became bishop of
Constantinople, who spoke about the God-bearer Mary, and about the birth of God
the Word, as follows: &laquo;'And instead of a sun she contained without confining
the Sun of righteousness. And do not ask how: for, where God wills, the order of
nature is defeated. For he willed, he was able, he came down, and he saved. All
things run into one for God. To-day he who is is born, and he who is became that
which he was not. For, being God, he became man, not by departing from being
God; for he did not became man by departure from Godhead, nor did he become God
by growth from man: but, being the Word, he became flesh on account of suffering
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#180"><SUP>180</SUP></A>,
while he remained invariable in his nature'. And he adds to these things: 'He who sits upon a lofty and high throne is laid in a
manger. He who is intangible and simple and bodiless is grasped by human hands.
He who cuts asunder the bonds of sin is wrapped in swaddling-clothes'&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#181"><SUP>181</SUP></A>.
And the saintly Proclus who became bishop of the same city in the exposition
which he delivered in the church of Anthimus on the feast of the Resurrection
spoke to the same effect as follows: &laquo;The heaven <A NAME="p74"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|74</SPAN></A>
cries, 'He who became man, who was crucified in flesh, is God: for as God he
caused me to incline and came down'. The sun also cries, 'He who was crucified
in flesh is my Lord: for I in fear of the light of the Godhead held-back my
rays'. The earth also cries, 'He who clothed himself in a body, who was
crucified in flesh, is the Maker: for, though I embraced his flesh in a manger,
yet I did not confine the might of his Godhead'&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#182"><SUP>182</SUP></A>. It would have
been possible to add other things also which are like these and resemble them,
but it is superfluous to add to what has been so wisely said, and make the
discussion inordinately long. But I pray your holy assembly and lawful church to
be of the same mind, as the apostle said <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#183"><SUP>183</SUP></A>, and conform to the same
rule <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#184"><SUP>184</SUP></A>, and, if any disputed point arises, not make this a cause of
strife and division, and of useless contentions, but lovingly join with one
another in the inquiry. But, if any of you has anything to say, let him speak
with humble mind, as the words of God, as Peter the 'chosen apostle gave
admonition <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#185"><SUP>185</SUP></A>. If anything also needs further explanation, you must
not act hastily, nor be in a hurry, but await the proper time, and bring it
before the saintly bishops, and accept the healing that they shall apply. As for
<A NAME="p75"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|75</SPAN></A> the brother who gave occasion for this dispute, since we have written these
few words, receive him lovingly, and strengthen him, and acknowledge him as your
member. And, whether he is one man, or many who were associated with him in this
dispute or ignorance, act in the same way towards them: for concerning those who
are such the apostle commands us and says, at one time, &laquo;Him that is weak in
the faith bring near to you&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#186"><SUP>186</SUP></A>, and at another, &laquo;And reckon them not as
enemies, but admonish them as brothers&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#187"><SUP>187</SUP></A>. It is not because they
made inquiries, or because they were ignorant that they are blameworthy; on the
contrary they would actually have been praised, if they had discussed the point
with humility, and not with haste and confusion, and with a desire to add to
ignorance; for this is what prevented them from being received in regard to the
discussion which they raised. However, now that we have written so much, let
love vanquish everything, and let not these distressing matters come even into
remembrance: for 'love' also, as it is written, 'covers a multitude of sins'<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#188"><SUP>188</SUP></A>;
which love may the God of love and the lawgiver Christ also strengthen in you. <A NAME="p76"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|76</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

living in the Spirit, and remembering me, our religious and Christ-loving

<p>For we may hear wise men outside also saying, &laquo;Not to sin<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#194"><SUP>194</SUP></A> at
all, and to do everything rightly is of God&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#195"><SUP>195</SUP></A>. And we see the divine
Scripture also saying of each created thing, &laquo;Let there be light, and there was
light; and God saw the light that it was good&raquo;; and again, &laquo;Let there be
so-and-so and there was; and God saw that it was good&raquo;; and after everything
together so to speak which he called forth and which answered, &laquo;God saw <A NAME="p78"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|78</SPAN></A>
all that he had made and lo! it was very good&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#196"><SUP>196</SUP></A>. How then can
anyone say that things which are good both in themselves severally, and because
they fit together with one another and make up one world, are a sin on God's
part? If so be they are a sin, they are not good: but, if they are good, they
are not a sin. But, if by reason that they are corruptible, therefore they are a
sin, yet rather, as a certain wise man says, &laquo;God created everything that it
might come into being, and salutary are the creations of the world, and there is
no poison of corruption in them; and Sheol hath no kingdom upon earth&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#197"><SUP>197</SUP></A>.
Again, if the first man had kept the commandment, and not gone astray after sin
through the serpent's deceitfulness, and lost the grace of immortality, having
voluntarily drawn death upon himself, then creation itself also would have
continued, acquiring for its own self the grace of immortality from God: for in
accordance with the condition <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#198"><SUP>198</SUP></A> in which we are for whose sake it came
into being its parts also pass away. For this reason then, when man himself was
condemned to death, it itself also served corruption and 'was made subject to
vanity' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#199"><SUP>199</SUP></A>, as the apostle says; but it hopes further to gain with us
what it had from <A NAME="p79"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|79</SPAN></A> the beginning: and it will have continuance without corruptibility when we
are admitted to the resurrection and the kingdom of heaven: for the most wise
Paul himself also cries, &laquo;Creation itself also shall be freed from the bondage
of corruption, into the freedom of the glory of the children of Gods&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#200"><SUP>200</SUP></A>.
</p>
<p align="center">(<i>And after other things</i>).
</p>
<p>But, my good friend, neither indeed did God make the world in order that it
might be corrupted, for 'salutary are the creations of the world', as you have
heard; but, since it is of a very fluid nature, he on the contrary brought it
into being in order that it might partake of incorruption; for indeed 'even
creation itself shall be freed from the bondage of corruption into the freedom
of the glory of the children of God'. For what logic is it, tell me, that
rational man who sinned of his own accord should according to your argument be
raised to incorruption, while creation which is inanimate and without
perception, which for his sake was made subject to vanity, should be delivered
to final destruction, and not partake of the incorruptibility and the glory of
those for whose sake it was made <A NAME="p80"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|80</SPAN></A> subject to corruption? For that the world shall be consummated is manifest
according to the faith in the divine Scriptures: for that the rudiments which
compose this visible creation will not pass into absolute non-existence, but
will be changed into something better, Paul testifies when he says, &laquo;The form
of the world passeth away&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#201"><SUP>201</SUP></A>, and not 'this world', and Peter also
testifies when he writes, &laquo;The heavens shall be dissolved with fervent heat,
and the elements shall burn and collapse&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#202"><SUP>202</SUP></A>. (But those in whom
righteousness dwells look for new heavens and a new earth according to his
promises.) And before him David sings about the heavens the passage also, &laquo;They
all shall grow old as a garment, and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and
they shall be changed&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#203"><SUP>203</SUP></A>. Words agreeing with these were written by
the Theologian Gregory also, in the sermon on the funeral of his brother
Caesarius, as follows: &laquo;But why am I faint-hearted about the hopes? Why do I
become a man of time? I await the voice of the archangel, the last trump, the
transformation of heaven, the changing of the earth, the emancipation of the
elements, the renovation of the whole world. Then shall I see Caesarius, no
longer departing, no longer carried, no longer <A NAME="p81"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|81</SPAN></A>
being mourned for, no longer being pitied, bright, glorious, exalted, even as
you have often appeared to me in a dream, O most brother-loving <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#204"><SUP>204</SUP></A>, and
most brother-loving; either as I have wished to depict thee, or in reality&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#205"><SUP>205</SUP></A>.
And the most wise John, the expounder of the divine words, in the commentary on
the epistle to the Hebrews speaks as follows: &laquo;And besides this he demonstrated
another thing also worth attention <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#206"><SUP>206</SUP></A> in parabolic form: for he also
denoted the transformation of the world by saying, 'As a garment shall they grow
old; and as a vesture thou shalt fold them up, and they shall be changed'; a
thing which he also states in the epistle to the Romans, that he shall transform
the world: and setting forth the easiness he added that, as a man may fold up a
vesture, so shall he fold them up . and change them. But, if he effected the
transformation and the creation into something better and higher so easily, for
the creation of something worse he needed another; how long will, you not be
ashamed?&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#207"><SUP>207</SUP></A>. And in the commentary on the epistle to the Romans he
gives an account of this matter in very complete form, writing as follows : &laquo;'For
the expectation of creation', he says, 'looks for the revelation of the sons of
God. <A NAME="p82"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|82</SPAN></A> For creation was made subject to vanity, not of its own accord, but because
of him who subjected it in hope'. For what he says is something like this. 'This
same creation suffers great pain expecting and hoping for the good things which
we have just mentioned. But expectation is earnest looking'. But, in order that
the account may be clearer, he also personifies the whole of this world, as the
prophets too do, when they introduce rivers clapping hands, and high places
leaping, and the mountains dancing; not that we may understand these to be
animate, nor that we may assign any reason to them; but that we may learn the
abundance of the good things, so that it reaches even to things without
perception. And they often do this same thing in the case of distressing things
also, introducing a vine lamenting and wine and mountains, and the roofs of the
temple crying, that from this again we may understand the greatness of the evil
things. But, imitating these, the apostle personifies <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#208"><SUP>208</SUP></A>
creation and
says that it groans and suffers pain; not because he had heard any groan come
from earth and sky; but that he may show the abundance of the future good
things, and the desire of escape from the prevailing evil things. 'For creation
was <A NAME="p83"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|83</SPAN></A> made subject to vanity, not of its own accord, but because of him who
subjected it'. What is 'Creation was made subject to vanity'? It was made
corruptible. Why and wherefore? On account of you the man. For, since you
received a body that is mortal and passible, the earth also received a curse,
and produced briars and thorns. But, that heaven together with the earth will
grow old and eventually pass to the better ending, hear the prophet saying, 'In
the beginning, Lord, thou laidst the foundations of the earth, and the heavens
are the work of thine hands. They shall perish, but thou endurest; and they all
shall grow old as a garment; and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they
shall be changed'. And Isaiah, demonstrating these things, said, 'Observe heaven
above and the earth beneath; because heaven hath been solidified as smoke, and
the earth shall grow old as a garment; and they that dwell therein shall perish
like them'. You have seen how 'creation was made subject to vanity', how also it
shall be freed from corruption; for the former said 'As a vesture shalt thou
fold them up, and they shall be changed', and Isaiah said 'They that dwell
therein shall perish like them', not <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#209"><SUP>209</SUP></A> speaking of utter destruction,
for neither shall the men who dwell in it undergo such as this, but the
temporary destruction, and through that very thing they shall pass to <A NAME="p84"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|84</SPAN></A>
incorruption, just indeed as by saying 'like these things' he pointed to
creation itself, that is the universe <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#210"><SUP>210</SUP></A>, just indeed as Paul also says
farther on. However for the present he is speaking about its subjection and
showing why it was made of this kind, and assigning us as the reason. What then?
Was violence done to it in that it underwent these things for another? Not at
all; for it was indeed made for me. How then is a thing which was made for me
injured when it undergoes these things for my reformation? But, to look at it in
another way, we ought not even to raise the question of justice and injustice
with respect to things without life and perception. But Paul because he
personified it uses none of the arguments that I have stated, but by another
method of reasoning sets himself superfluously to comfort the hearer. But what
was it? 'What say you? It underwent evil things for you and has become
corruptible. But it lost nothing; for it shall also become incorruptible again
through you': for this is the meaning of 'in hope'. But, when he says, 'It was
not made subject of its own will', he does not say this to show that it is
possessed of thought, but that you may learn that <A NAME="p85"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|85</SPAN></A>
everything was brought about by the will of Christ, and the one is not a
reformation of the other. But he stated also in what hope. 'Because
creation itself also shall be freed'. What is 'itself also'? That not you, but
it also, even a thing that is far inferior to you, and that does not partake of
reason and perception, this also shall partake with you in the good things. For
it 'shall be delivered', he says, 'from the bondage of corruption'; that is, it
shall be no longer corruptible; but it shall follow the beauty of your body.
For, as, when it became corruptible, creation also became the same, so, when it
is rendered incorruptible, creation also as well shall again follow; to denote
which indeed he added, 'into the freedom of the glory of the children of God '&raquo;
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#211"><SUP>211</SUP></A>.
</p>
<p>But, inasmuch as the Alexandrine is a stranger and a barbarian to the divine
Scripture, and is not accustomed to the teachings of this Scripture, he thinks
that God is a creator of corruption, and he calls the world his sin; a thing
that is of fluid nature, but is honoured by the grace of incorruptibility
together with man for whose sake also it was made. It was not as a sin of God
that Christ reformed the world's subjection also that was for man's sake, that
he might bring in one set of <A NAME="p86"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|86</SPAN></A> things in place of another, as this wicked and deceiving man says; in place
of bodies that had been delivered to death the immortality of spirits, and in
place of the corruption of the world eternal incorruptibility, and in place of
abundance of sins abundance of right acts; but in order that he might raise man,
who had fallen, and by erring been stripped of the grace of God through which he
had immortality, to the original state, through the resurrection of the bodies
into incorruption, by which this world also shall partake of the freedom and the
glory, as we have written.
</p>
<p align="center">(<i>And after other things</i>.)
</p>
<p>But from the investigation you have plainly recognised his corruption on
every point, and his spuriousness in the matter of faith; in the theology which
concerns the Father and the Son mingling of hypostases (since he has cast behind
him the godlessness of Sabellius the Libyan); in the Incarnation of the Only one
phantasy and change, and the other things that do away the true Humanization and
fight against our salvation; in the Resurrection lessening of hope, and denial
of the resurrection of bodies; in the creation of the visible world, a
blaspheming tongue that under the appearance of good will arms itself against
the wise Creator and Maker, <A NAME="p87"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|87</SPAN></A> and that utters follies akin to those of Mani the madman and Marcion (for
well was he named Mani from <i>mania, </i>that is, from madness, who is the
founder of the Manichees, who are most exceedingly foul). But that these
confused opinions are rejected and anathematized by the holy Church, and those
who were the originators of them, there is none among Christians who does not
confess. Accordingly therefore it is manifest that Alexander, inasmuch as he has
agreed with all these opinions, shares the anathema of each one, being subject
to many sentences or punishments <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#212"><SUP>212</SUP></A>.

<p> But we hear of the said Mara that he said this also as well, that the
holy Virgin did not feel the birth, in manifest opposition to the Holy Spirit
and to the Scriptures which were spoken by him. The loud-voiced among prophets,
Isaiah, shows that he came forth from the bond of virginity like anything else,
and he was ineffably born without rending her from Mary the God-bearer, saying
thus, &laquo;Before she that travailed bare, and before the <A NAME="p89"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|89</SPAN></A>
pain of the travail came, she escaped and bare a male child&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#214"><SUP>214</SUP></A>.
The fact that she escaped shows that the birth took place with perception on the
part of her who gave birth, and not in phantasy <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#215"><SUP>215</SUP></A>. So Gregory the
Theologian also in the sermon about Easter says of the birth of the babe when it
is born: &laquo;But she also cried <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#216"><SUP>216</SUP></A> from the compulsion of the virgin and
maternal bonds, with great power, when a male child was born from the
prophetess, as Isaiah announces&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#217"><SUP>217</SUP></A>. How could the fact that she
cried from the compulsion and did not rend the bond of virginity happen without
perception, and not with such great perception as this oh the part of her who
bare? And these things took place ineffably and beyond everything. He who wished
to come truly in all our attributes, and to be made like to us his brethren
without sin, was . certainly born in fleshly fashion by a manifest and true
birth, causing perception in her who bare, free from all pain and suffering; for
the prophet proclaims that she gave birth before the pain of the travail came.
For how was she to be subjected to the trial of pains and anguish, who put an
end to the bearing of children in anguish through the fact that joy was born for
the whole race of men? For, &laquo;Lo!&raquo;, he says, &laquo;I announce unto you great <A NAME="p90"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|90</SPAN></A>
joy, that is to all the people, that there hath been born to you to-day a

<p> For the bread that is consecrated on the holy tables and

But, if it is the body of him who rose, it is plain that it is impassible and
immortal. If we do not look at the bread that is mystically transmuted, but at
that which comes under the eyes of the senses, and, seeing it broken, do not
confess it to be indeed immortal, it is time for us to say that neither is it
God's body: for what is seen is indeed bread. By the faith therefore by which we
understand and believe it to be the body of God who became incarnate without
variation for our sakes, and voluntarily suffered and rose, by the same faith we
understand and confess that it is also immortal and impassible, and bestows
impassibility and immortality on us. For he who allowed it to be cut and
divided, because indeed it was otherwise impossible for us to partake of it, in
the same mercifulness also allows God's body which has been already transmuted
to appear as bread. And for a confirmation of the transmutation that is
accomplished this has been seen by many even with the eyes of their senses
themselves, and they have seen bloodstained flesh being broken, not the bread
that is laid upon the altar.<A NAME="p92"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|92</SPAN></A>

<p> But with regard to the reception of Eutyches that it was done in a
canonical way, and that it casts no slur on the holy. Dioscorus, and on the
synod which assembled with him at Ephesus, I addressed the arguments on this
head to certain persons some time ago, and I also dealt completely with it as
the truth demands; and I have thought it good and urgent to send a copy of these
things to your learning. Not only the wretched man from Scythopolis <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#220"><SUP>220</SUP></A>, but many
others besides before him and after him, employed the same blasphemous
absurdities, not knowing what they are saying <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#221"><SUP>221</SUP></A>, but made
empty-mindedness fulness of blasphemy against God. The holy synod which
assembled at Ephesus with the saintly witness of the truth Dioscorus taught
nothing new whatever with regard to the faith, but only effected the deprivation
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#222"><SUP>222</SUP></A> of those who were infected with the Jewish poison of
<A NAME="p93"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|93</SPAN></A> Nestorius and cast them off: but Eutyches, who presented a petition and
anathematized his heresy, on account of which he was accused, it accepted on the
ground of the actual petition itself and on the ground of the minutes <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#223"><SUP>223</SUP></A>
that were written at Constantinople before Flavian, since it did not recognise
the poison that was in his heart, and the disease hard to be discovered was in
accordance with the human standard properly hidden from it; for the divine
Scripture plainly teaches that 'man looks on the face, but God looks on the
heart' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#224"><SUP>224</SUP></A>. But what will anyone say about those who assembled at
Chalcedon, who received Theodoret and Hiba, who not merely hid the foul heresy
of Nestorius in the heart, but actually displayed it with open face. When the
contents of the minutes' on account of which Hiba's deprivation <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#225"><SUP>225</SUP></A>
</sup>took
place had been read, and his letter to Mari the Persian, which was full of many
blasphemies (a copy of which I have also sent to you), the representatives of
Leo, who had become prelate of the church of the Romans, pronounced him
blameless, making the following declaration <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#226"><SUP>226</SUP></A>: &laquo;Pascasinus and
Lucentius the reverend bishops and Boniface the presbyter representing <A NAME="p94"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|94</SPAN></A>

<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#229"><SUP>229</SUP></A> of the
reverend bishops we know that the reverend Hiba has been shown to be innocent.
For, when his letter was read, we recognised that it is orthodox <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#230"><SUP>230</SUP></A>;
and therefore our decision is that the episcopal rank also and the church from
which he was wrongfully ejected in his absence be restored'&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#231"><SUP>231</SUP></A>. And
to these things the whole synod assented; and they promulgated the same
decision. How then can those who defend those men dare to make the reception of
Eutyches, which took place according to the canons, a charge against the holy
Dioscorus and the synod which assembled with him?

<p> And, in order not to extend the letter to a great length, from these

consequence of the document' and of the minutes <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#241"><SUP>241</SUP></A>
written in the royal
city, and of the depositions <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#242"><SUP>242</SUP></A> on behalf of Eutyches that are
contained in them the holy synod <A NAME="p96"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|96</SPAN></A> which then assembled in the city of the Ephesians gave a decision by which it
declared this man innocent; and it can never be accused on account of the fact
that after these things the same Eutyches ran back to the vomit <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#243"><SUP>243</SUP></A>
of
his own evil opinion. For neither against the holy fathers did this bring a
reproach, because many heretics consented to a temporary hypocrisy, and again
returned to their impiety; since even with the 318 holy fathers Eusebius
Pamphili both sat in concourse with them and was one of their number; and he
contended with these on behalf of the madness of Arius, and armed himself
against those who held the right opinions.

Constantinople before Flavian, and brought in again at Ephesus, plainly contain
this expression, which was confessed by Eutyches, and confirmed by him, in that

<p> The saintly presbyter John has removed and gone to the place of
light of the righteous, and to the rest above in which those who have so lived
abide, expecting the day of the perfect and full promise, and not without us to
be made perfect, as Paul who was initiated into the deep and ineffable things of
the foreknowledge of God somewhere says <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#248"><SUP>248</SUP></A>. What need is there even to
say <A NAME="p98"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|98</SPAN></A> what poignant and heavy sorrow has shaken my soul? For it is a great loss
that this wretched turbidity of times in which we ourselves have been left alive
should by such men being snatched away be gradually laid bare and reduced so to
speak to the last dregs. About him there is much that I might write on the
laudatory side, but, overcome by the multitude of subjects, I say this briefly,
that he alone taught us and caused us to see before our eyes, what is the
kingdom of heaven that is spoiled, which spoilers seize <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#249"><SUP>249</SUP></A>. In such a a
way, clad in the feeble body as in a chain of lead, he parted and dispersed all
things outside, and by taking little thought for things that draw downwards, and
receiving strength through desire of heavenly things, he fitted himself wholly
for things above, to which he has now easily departed. Therefore we must both
weep and groan for our solitude, which has been deprived entirely of such a
pattern and honourable example. But, since we ought to bow our neck before the
just scales of the judgments of God, we praise him who so orders these things
and brings them to pass: for the wise and strenuous Job somewhere says, &laquo;But if
he too hath so judged, who is he that gainsaith him? For what he himself wished

the rest we pray that by the saintly prayers of those who have made a good
departure hence we may be saved, and as far as possible be kept unharmed, and
not wander from the faith of these men, and may be raised to them in memory.
</p>
<p>May these things be so. But in respect of what has been written by your love
of God about the sustenance of the poor, and our necessity or refreshment, and
that you wish to share with us in everything, and give readily, know this, that
we accept the full purpose of your mind, but, being small and weak, we look to
Paul the doctor of the church, and as regards our needs set ourselves to feel
shame and refrain, and look at him who says, &laquo;In all things I have kept myself
without being burdensome to you and will keep myself&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#251"><SUP>251</SUP></A>. But with
respect to the relief of our brethren who are labouring under the same
distresses, by which life is oppressed, I will exert myself, and will be
importunate, or rather <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#252"><SUP>252</SUP></A> will use lawful boldness of speech
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#253"><SUP>253</SUP></A>,
and will beg, and grasp <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#254"><SUP>254</SUP></A>, and incite to liberal giving; and I will
again use his words and say, &laquo;He that soweth sparingly shall reap sparingly;
and he that soweth bountifully shall reap bountifully&raquo;: and this he seals by
the <A NAME="p100"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|100</SPAN></A> very wise and understanding addition, &laquo;Every man as his heart willeth, not

</p>
<p>As to the book that I have composed against the heretical fatuity of the
wicked grammarian, by often writing and asking for it to be sent to you before
it was completely finished you were acting like men who urge a boy who is
healthy and well-prepared, and instructed in military affairs, to appear in the
line of battle when he has not yet put on his armour. But, now that by God's
help it has been finished, as far as our little power goes, and has been duly
written, and duly collated as far as was possible, it has been sent. It was a
very difficult task and needed a great store of books, and it was so to speak
difficult for me to correct, because I am moving from place to place, and I have
not everywhere at hand fitting testimonies and demonstrations from the
Scriptures. For I thought it right to meet not only the lamentable babblings of
the grammarian, but also the whole web of impiety contained in what was defined
and done by way of innovation at Chalcedon by the synod which met there, and the
impious Tome of Leo, taking occasion from the very <A NAME="p101"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|101</SPAN></A>
things stated by him (I mean that grammarian) to expose the dishonesty of the
adversaries, and cut the very root so to speak of bitterness <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#256"><SUP>256</SUP></A>, and to
show whence it sprang, and that these things are not new, but were evolved long
ago by the impious company of those who unlearnedly held this evil opinion; and
not only so, but also to show the agreement of the doctors of the orthodox <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#257"><SUP>257</SUP></A>,
and of things which to men who are not practised in divine doctrines seem to be
contrary, and have the same purpose before them, and to guard myself as far as
possible against contention from all sides. Immediately therefore after the holy
Cyril and Gregory the Theologian, and all who so to speak taught the same
things, had also said that we must note the distinction in theory <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#258"><SUP>258</SUP></A>
and in thought of the natures of which Emmanuel is composed, from which natures
the different character and diverse essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#259"><SUP>259</SUP></A> of the elements that
were joined in union is recognised, Theodotus of saintly memory, bishop of
Ancyra in Galatia, seems to deny this and not to accept the division in thought <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#260"><SUP>260</SUP></A>.
On this account many of the orthodox <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#257"><SUP>257</SUP></A> also were confounded by the
heretics as if they were adducing fathers who said <A NAME="p102"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|102</SPAN></A>
contradictory things, though the objectors could not discern even the reading
of the words of Theodotus, but read them differently, not as the words stand.
This therefore and all such points we have brought together from all quarters,
and, God stretching forth his hand, have explained them, and so have shown the
objections of the impious to be vain. The demonstrations which they adduce are
of ancient date and not of yesterday and the day before, and they have been
worked up by means of inventions and false attributions and tens of thousands of
contrivances, since they wish on all sides to show the refutation of the impiety
to be futile. Therefore it was indeed a task replete with great difficulties to
find these passages, and lay bare the evil dealing and expose the deceit
contained in them. These things the prophet's words fit, which were spoken in
the name of God to those of Israel, &laquo;Ephraim hath surrounded me with falsehood,
and the house of Israel and of Judah with impiety&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#261"><SUP>261</SUP></A>: and still
better that also which is written in Daniel, &laquo;They worked zealously to
strengthen their deceit which consisted in transgressions&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#262"><SUP>262</SUP></A>. Having
therefore as far as possible read all the books, thoroughly and not negligently,
I made myself acquainted with their evil purpose after <A NAME="p103"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|103</SPAN></A>
much labour and after searching for each one of them (often it could not be
found at all), and this though I am in a condition <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#263"><SUP>263</SUP></A>
of exile, and
flee from one place to another for refuge like boats <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#264"><SUP>264</SUP></A>
upon the sea.
To me also it was gratifying that the wise and Christ-loving Zacharias the
scholastic <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#265"><SUP>265</SUP></A> should read the dissertation mentioned: for in the royal
city also I used to bring my works to him, when he would listen attentively with
all care fulness, and received from God the privilege of being a wise hearer of
Jerusalem, I mean of the church of God, and did not shrink from being an
admirable adviser, on account of the great experience and instruction in the
sacred books which he has enjoyed from his boyhood. And we believe that upon you
the religious presbyter Victor <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#266"><SUP>266</SUP></A> the same grace blooms, and that it in
no way falls short of that which was given to him, or certainly it was even
greater, and reaches a still higher standard on account of the order of the
presbyterate, and the priestly seat to which you have been called by God. I
therefore beg you all to read the composition diligently and with attentive
thoughts and, as your habit is, wisely, and if as weak men we have anywhere gone
wrong to point it out. &laquo;That a brother should be helped by a brother, this also
is the firm strength of a fortified <A NAME="p104"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|104</SPAN></A>
city&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#267"><SUP>267</SUP></A>, the God-inspired words teach. Therefore also we made it
our business, as far as possible, to bring this dissertation also to certain men
of intelligence and skilled in argument, who are not without a share in divine
and profane learning, and read it to them, generally stealing an opportunity for
reading, and doing this in secret, on account of the present time. The beginning
of this treatise I have put in such a form <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#268"><SUP>268</SUP></A>, in order that I may seem
to have prepared this while I was living in Antioch, lest perhaps these
adversaries might kindle a greater flame of prejudice against me, if they
perceived that this had been composed by me in exile: and in truth when I was
there I began to prepare material for an answer, though, when the persecution
came, it scattered these things.
</p>
<p>Since you, the God-loving presbyter Philip <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#269"><SUP>269</SUP></A>, have often asked
for the Book of Dispensations as you say to be sent you, the only reason for
which we have put off doing this is that we are desirous of first carrying out
your request, and casting an eye of criticism on what is written in it; which
down to this day we have been confident of being able to do, though all our
attention was occupied with the said composition. Therefore, when we have read
your book also hastily, we will send it as soon as possible. <A NAME="p105"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|105</SPAN></A>
</p>
<p>As to those who have been converted from the error of Theodotus <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#270"><SUP>270</SUP></A>,
we say this much, that, if there are some who received ordination from Theodotus
himself, since he was a bishop legally appointed, but was afterwards perverted
to the abominable tenet of a self-created observance <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#271"><SUP>271</SUP></A>, I mean that of
the illegal re-anointing, and to a change as to the faith, so that he does not
confess that our Lord and God Jesus Christ, who is of one essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#272"><SUP>272</SUP></A>
with the Father in the Godhead, himself became also of one essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#272"><SUP>272</SUP></A>
with us without variation, and took our likeness, except sin only, let these be
subject to the periods of penance which Timothy of saintly memory, archbishop of
Alexandria, laid down with regard to those who are converted from the heresy of
the Diphysites <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#273"><SUP>273</SUP></A>. But, if there are some others who derive the
ordinations alleged to have been performed over them from the man called Gregory
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#274"><SUP>274</SUP></A>
or from others, who are not even bishops, let these be reckoned as laymen, and
not dream of the name of service or priesthood; but eventually after some time,
if some of them receive a report for good works, let these <A NAME="p106"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|106</SPAN></A>
be ordained, as if they had been advanced from the lay standing to the
priestly chancel <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#275"><SUP>275</SUP></A>. But I was surprised to see that in your letter,
though you termed them laymen, you afterwards asked the question &laquo;How long a
period ought to be appointed for these men&raquo;, as if they were clergymen <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#276"><SUP>276</SUP></A>,
men who never became such at all. Therefore also I praised the ignorance of the
religious presbyter Victor about these men.
</p>
<p>As to the complete manuscript <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#277"><SUP>277</SUP></A> of the divine Scriptures which
belonged to John whose soul is at rest, which may fill many bellies of poor men,
sell it: for we by God's grace have books <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#278"><SUP>278</SUP></A>, and would we had also
perfect knowledge of these, which we pray may be given to us by God.
</p>
<p>We were not surprised to hear that those without are at peace with you, since
we recalled to mind the divine declaration which says to the righteous man, &laquo;For
the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#279"><SUP>279</SUP></A>. Therefore
also we again praised him who confessed these things without falsehood.

<p><b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C35"></A>XXXV.</SPAN>&nbsp;-------- OF THE PATRIARCH SEVERUS TO THE MONKS OF THE EAST
</b><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#280"><SUP>280</SUP></A>. [520-5.]&nbsp;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p> To the holy fathers and archimandrites of the holy cloisters in the
East and the presbyters and deacons, and all the brothers who are practising the
God-loved life of monasticism Severus greeting in our Lord.
</p>
<p>I have heard that the great convents of the holy monasteries in the East, who
are honoured for eminence in life and in asceticism and for age, have withdrawn,
and that to this same thing they have been driven by compulsion, by those who
without fear stretch out their hands against every man: and I groaned deeply;
and I continued weeping till there was no strength left in me to weep more, as
the Holy Scripture somewhere says <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#281"><SUP>281</SUP></A>. For I sorrowed not for you (no
tears are needed for you) but for the countries which have been deprived of you,
and for those who live a religious life in them, and to speak generally for all
that district <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#282"><SUP>282</SUP></A>. If there were not universal wrath, and the face of
God were not averted, you at least would <A NAME="p108"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|108</SPAN></A>
have remained, as pillars of the great house who would have prevented the
ruin that was threatening it. So also, when Jerusalem was being chastised for
her sins, and was being delivered to various chastisements, the God of mercy,
'he that taketh pleasure in mercy' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#283"><SUP>283</SUP></A> (for so the divine Scriptures
term him), again spared her on account of his great mercifulness, and, because
he did not wish to bring a complete destruction, is seen to address, those who
administered such chastisements as were to come, things which Jeremiah saw and
heard by prophetic perception, in this way: &laquo;Go up to her walls and pull down;
but make not a full end. Leave her foundations because they are of the Lord&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#284"><SUP>284</SUP></A>.
If then you, who are the foundations of the Lord which stave off destruction,
have now been disturbed and shaken, what is there to expect, save sore stripes
from God, and great evils that cannot be assuaged and wrath that is poured out,
which he who in just judgment brings it declares in such words as these: &laquo;Behold!
my wrath and mine anger is poured out upon this country and upon men and upon
cattle and upon all things that are in the field, and upon all the fruits of the
earth, and they shall be burnt up and shall not be extinguished&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#285"><SUP>285</SUP></A>?
<A NAME="p109"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|109</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>For these reasons I sorrowed, and I perceived not the number of my groans,
while I contemplated the desolation of the ways that led to your convents and
sent to you those who had a zealous desire to delight their souls by the
remembrance of divine things, and to whom constant standing and angelic singing
were a festival, and the upward-pressing life, which reminds rational souls of
the imitation of God. For thus Jeremiah also made lament after the destruction
of Jerusalem, and said as in a figure: &laquo;The ways of Zion mourn because there is
none to come to the feast. All the gates in her are desolate&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#286"><SUP>286</SUP></A>.
(And he himself clearly said that her produce is given to destruction). &laquo;Whose
priests shall go into captivity groaning, and they that have taken upon them the
virgin life shall be led away. And she that was abandoned by them hath
bitterness for these things&raquo;. For, in order that none might think that the
lamentation that was made was not right, on account of beams and stones and
great buildings that were razed to the earth and the dust, exalting plainly by
words the greatness of the disaster, he made proclamation and said: &laquo;Her
priests groan and her virgins <A NAME="p110"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|110</SPAN></A> are carried away, and she herself within herself hath bitterness&raquo;
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#287"><SUP>287</SUP></A>.
And Elisha the great, who received a double portion of the spirit that was in
Elijah, the man of many visions and miracles, foreseeing that which was future
like the present, and how many evils the people of Israel was to endure,
inasmuch as Hazael, King of Syria, was to come against them to war, wept
bitterly when he .considered the incurability of the evils that were coming, and
under stress of these things he could not refrain, and abstain from tears, and
from pity, though they were about to endure these chastisements as they
deserved. And therefore also the divine Scripture says as in wonder: &laquo;And the
man of God wept&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#288"><SUP>288</SUP></A>. But I beg and entreat your sanctities (for you
are my affection no less than he <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#289"><SUP>289</SUP></A>), you who also suffer with your
kindred, and, to speak in the words of the apostle, &laquo;have a heart of mercy and
of grace&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#290"><SUP>290</SUP></A>, pray for the sheep and avert the wrath, and cease not
holding up your saintly hands to your Jesus, saying to him from the divine
Scriptures, &laquo;These sheep what have they done? Have pity, Lord, upon thy people,
and give not thine inheritance to shame&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#291"><SUP>291</SUP></A>. Perhaps he will be
turned by these prayers and repent, and will leave in his country a blessing, <A NAME="p111"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|111</SPAN></A>
a sacrifice and a libation to the Lord our God. For on your account I have no
weight of care and no anxiety: for well I know that everything is easy to you,
and there is no impediment or difficulty of walking for your feet, which are
adorned in apostolic fashion with bareness, and by their steps are able to bless
even the uninhabited deserts and make them habitable; . and that the lack of
money in your girdles is a fulness of all abundance, so that it provides a
superfluity for others also, and the staff in your hands is a symbol of the very
fixity and firmness of the faith that is in you, so that it supports those who
are shaken also and they do not fall; but the earth and the heaven and the air <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#292"><SUP>292</SUP></A>
are your purse, and all the elements supply food in diverse forms and coming of
itself, and make it known to everyone that &laquo;man liveth not by bread alone, but
also by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God&raquo;<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#293"><SUP>293</SUP></A>: I
forbear to say, what is a great thing and very true, that, since you have a
spiritual rock going before you (and Paul said that Christ is a rock <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#294"><SUP>294</SUP></A>),
that is to you food and drink; for you were persecuted with this same rock when
it was persecuted. For in the case of the sons of Israel of old, who saw little,
and had their eye blinded by Egyptian <A NAME="p112"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|112</SPAN></A>
darkness, and could scarcely see the writing of the law and could not
contemplate the depth of hidden mysteries, the apostle justly wrote that &laquo;that
rock followed them&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#295"><SUP>295</SUP></A>: for it was right that they who were
so-imperfect should be first exercised in the law, and afterwards see Christ
following them. Wherefore also in waterless countries he gave them water in
tangible form, assuaging the thirst of the flesh; and, whenever they desired flesh, he invisibly brought birds like rain from the air
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#296"><SUP>296</SUP></A>, and
other things like these and resembling them. But before your own perfections,
who can contemplate the very glory of the Lord 'with open face', as again Paul
said <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#297"><SUP>297</SUP></A>, that rock continually goes in front, giving suprasensual food
and drink, and showing everyone that through the things which you have endured
you cry and say, &laquo;Who shall separate me from the love of Christ? Tribulation,
or distress, or persecution, or hunger or nakedness or clanger or the sword, as
it is written, 'For thy sake we die every day; we have been reckoned as sheep
for slaughter'; but in all these things we are victorious through him who loved
us&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#298"><SUP>298</SUP></A>. For the results of your victory are not only
<A NAME="p113"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|113</SPAN></A> in this evil present world, in which you showed invincibility, but all of
them are more truly in the future world. Then all who have been exercised in the
life of virginity, and have prevailed over shameful passions and are honoured
for white-haired old age of the intellect, and for the holy order, and deceive
the accompanying honour, shall be gratified with such joy that their soul shall
be made drunk with good things, as to which Jeremiah the prophet, depicting them
beforehand, spoke thus: &laquo;Then shall virgins rejoice in gatherings of young men
and old men shall rejoice: and I will turn their mourning into joy, and I will
make them rejoice: and I will make great and make drunken the soul of the
priests the sons of Levi, and my people shall be filled with my good things&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#299"><SUP>299</SUP></A>;
and these things that fail not and are as they are, and are never destroyed.
Such as these are the blessed homes and mansions. But, if there is yet an
extension and we have not been brought to the end of time, assuredly 'he who
scattered Israel he will gather him, and he will keep him as a shepherd who
feedeth his flock' and will say, &laquo;With weeping went they out, and with
consolation will I bring them: and I will make them to dwell by streams of
waters in a right way and they shall not again go astray&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#300"><SUP>300</SUP></A>.
<A NAME="p114"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|114</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But pray that we also may hold to the right and unerring way, and our foot
may not turn aside to the right hand or to the left from the king's highway <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#301"><SUP>301</SUP></A>
which was rightly traversed by those seers and ministers of the word. For,
inasmuch as you exercise yourselves in the law of the Lord by night as well as
by day, you know well that, even if a man contend, he is not crowned unless he
contends lawfully. For certain men have come in upon us, wishing to put a
blemish on the 'good confession' to which we were called and which we confessed
'before many witnesses' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#302"><SUP>302</SUP></A> as the apostle said, that is, before the
whole church and 'the elect angels' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#303"><SUP>303</SUP></A>, never having yielded to
remissness. For that 'we are not of remissness which leads to perdition' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#304"><SUP>304</SUP></A>
you also well know: for you are the first who testify. For, 'having no sound
knowledge of what they say or the things about which they strive' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#305"><SUP>305</SUP></A>,
they do not consent to confess that the true flesh of God and the Word which is
from the holy God-bearer and ever-virgin Mary and from the Holy Spirit, which
was hypostatically united to him, so that from the fact that he came to be with
us as God who became man he was named Emmanuel, and that he was made like unto
us in all things except sin, suffers <A NAME="p115"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|115</SPAN></A>
like us and is susceptible of innocent passions, but say that he suffered in
semblance, and that the flesh was impassible and immortal at the time of the
voluntary and saving Cross; and besides other impossible things the wretched men
foolishly speak of false passions, and in false words they name phantasy <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#306"><SUP>306</SUP></A>
incorruptibility, and deny the true incorruptibility, and they fail to notice
the wisdom of the dispensation whereby the impassible God united to himself
those of our passions which do not fall under the description of sin, wishing in
it to taste our death voluntarily, destroy its dominion over us, and by means of
the Resurrection to set us free in incorruptibility, that is in impassibility
and immortality, and raise us to our first state in which also we were created.
If the Word of God desired to display passions and death in unreal form, the
Incarnation is quite superfluous. He had the divine impassibility and
immortality, and so also he might have suffered as in semblance and shown
himself after the fashion of former appearances, as he appeared as a man who
wrestled with Jacob and was received in Abraham's house, and was represented in
many forms through the prophets: for this he himself is seen to have said in
Hosea the prophet <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#307"><SUP>307</SUP></A>. But this was not <A NAME="p116"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|116</SPAN></A>
what he desired, but that by means of a real death he might save the man who
had died through the deceit of the serpent, and make his own Resurrection the
gate and way of return to everlasting life. For this reason Paul cries louder
than all trumpets in the ears of men who will not hear: &laquo;For, since by man came
death, by man also cometh the resurrection of the dead. For, as in Adam all
died, so also in Christ shall all live&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#308"><SUP>308</SUP></A>. But... with... the
Scriptures and... these hasty and presumptuous men presumed blasphemously to say
against the divine Scriptures and against the holy fathers who interpreted them
in approved fashion, who at various times fed the holy churches. From these
things you see clearly how much difference and distinction there is between
truth and error even as the heaven is far from the earth, and that out of the
thought of their heart they have 'devised words of iniquity' and that 'truth has
perished in their ways, and they could not walk in the right way', and also that
'they have removed their thoughts from understanding' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#309"><SUP>309</SUP></A>. For well did
Isaiah the prophet expose them beforehand by these words. <A NAME="p117"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|117</SPAN></A>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Pray therefore, saintly ones (for indeed I say the same thing many times)
that we may be delivered from evil and unjust men. For they have been unable not
only to endure reproof on account of their wickedness, but even to give drink to
them that thirst: for, besides their thoughts that blaspheme against God, 'their
counsels<sup>1</sup> also 'are counsels of murder' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#310"><SUP>310</SUP></A>. For this very
thing Isaiah says with me concerning them. But that these same men may be
changed to what is right make the subject of your own prayers. For we on our
part look to him who willeth not the death of a sinner so much as that he be
converted and live <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#311"><SUP>311</SUP></A>. Indeed at first on the entreaty (and to speak
the truth on the compulsion) of him who wrote unsoundly and rashly upon this
same matter <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#312"><SUP>312</SUP></A>, while far away and in hiding I wrote and admonished
him in a brotherly manner and urged him to have regard to the holy fathers and
to the approved doctors and follow them, and correct himself. And even upon this
he attacked my meanness in a ferocious manner, worse than any raging savage
beast, and kept bitterly complaining because he did not find me a partner of his
error, and over the whole world, as far as he could, he sent out and scattered
abroad what he had <A NAME="p118"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|118</SPAN></A> written, which came from his heart 'not from the mouth of the Lord'
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#313"><SUP>313</SUP></A>:
and we were set forth as a laughing-stock to those who contend for the
Chalcedonian impiety; and in Palestine, as I have learned, and in other
provinces <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#314"><SUP>314</SUP></A> </sup>they were going about, and everywhere opening and
extending their capacious mouth and saying: &laquo;See! Those who pride themselves on
being orthodox <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#315"><SUP>315</SUP></A> have been manifestly seen to be zealous for the
semblance of Eutyches, which is the error of the followers of Mani&raquo;. Then
indeed, being pierced by the judgments of God after the manner of goads and
being... in my soul because I could not endure the slander and the blasphemy
against the glory of the Most High and the fact that one man's error should be a
stain upon the whole body of the church, I made the true facts known to
everyone, facts which are known and familiar to you also, saying with courage as
well as faith in accordance with the truth (for Jesus is very God and Saviour),
&laquo;If it be my lot to die with thee I will not deny thee&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#316"><SUP>316</SUP></A>, but, &laquo;I
will go up upon the mountains, and will preach to Jerusalem&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#317"><SUP>317</SUP></A>. May
I gain his boldness of speech <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#318"><SUP>318</SUP></A>, and may I receive help from him,

<p> For it is not saying what agrees with the 318 fathers that is
prohibited to us, but adding anything to or detracting anything from the
correctness of the doctrines <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#320"><SUP>320</SUP></A>. If not, the synod of the 150 also
incurs blame, because it widened the theology <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#321"><SUP>321</SUP></A> relating to the
Spirit, and, when the confession had been laid down with regard to the only Son
who became incarnate for us, it added the <A NAME="p120"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|120</SPAN></A>

from the silence it might be inferred that it too enjoys equal honour? Assuredly
those who turn away their faces from it would raise arguments against those who
hold to it, and the one would say, &laquo;It is suppressed as impious&raquo;, while the
others would say. &laquo;It has met with the same suppression as the other synods&raquo;,
and again there would be contentions and disturbances.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>And again before these things he says.</i>
</p>
<p>For for us to say that the synod must be suppressed, and formulate an
orthodox confession, but not reject the blasphemies with the persons themselves
and the words, is neither lawful nor conducive to peace. But, even if we be
willing to shut our eyes, no one among the congregations of the orthodox <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#324"><SUP>324</SUP></A>,
especially after so much agitation, would agree to such a spurious union, since
the apostle plainly says, &laquo;If anyone preacheth to you outside what ye have
received, let him be anathema&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#325"><SUP>325</SUP></A>. What has thrown the churches into
confusion down to the present day is this, the fact that those who are in power halt between the two sides, and wish always to please both sides.

TO THE PRESBYTERS AT ALEXANDRIA. </b>[516-8.]&nbsp;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p> When I took in my hands the letter that has now been addressed to me
by your holinesses, I began to read it with such pleasure as if a son were
seeing his father's face after the lapse of a long time. But after reading it I
knew you better from the contents; for I found the letter to be in reality
wholly occupied with fatherly reproofs; for it is often a habit of fathers also
to apply unfounded <A NAME="p124"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|124</SPAN></A> reproofs to sons in order to make them more
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#333"><SUP>333</SUP></A> industrious and
vigilant; but, when they see them making a wise defence to the accusation and
dissipating the reproofs, then they exchange the desire of fault-finding for the
desire of natural affection, and are filled with tears and exult from joy, and
submit to a defeat that they have made an object of much prayer, and proclaim
the sons' victory as their own. Accordingly listen like fathers to your son's
defence, and judge upright judgment, and test the matter carefully as in the
scales of a balance. You say in the letter that we departed from the strict rule
in making union with the Isaurians, because Philoxenus, when he wrote to them in
the course of the controversy, testified that there is nothing wanting in the
edict <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#334"><SUP>334</SUP></A>, and said that he was in communion with the prelate of
Alexandria <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#335"><SUP>335</SUP></A>, and did not omit the names of the heretics. Tell me what
blame this casts upon the Isaurians, since they are shown to have summoned
Philoxenus by letter to the high standard of their profession, and, when he
would not at that time rise to their height and range himself on the side of
strictness, together with the others to have left those who were in communion
with <A NAME="p125"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|125</SPAN></A> Flavian who previously held the see of Antioch, and united with us only, and
exposed in writing the imperfection of the edict, and professed that they would
not otherwise enter into communion with the chief of the Alexandrines until he
first made a defence to the orthodox <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#336"><SUP>336</SUP></A> in common and removed from the
midst the scandals which separate us from him. How then do you find fault with
them as if they had neglected these things, things which they were in fact
careful to put in writing? If to write to Philoxenus and summon him to the
perfect standard is a cause of blame in them, it is time for us to blame some of
you also who in the royal city urged us to go [to] Philoxenus and examine him,
and to bring serious accusations against the [holy] Cyril because he wrote to
Acacius the prelate of Berrhoea, when he advised him to disavow the 12 chapters <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#337"><SUP>337</SUP></A>
and the other works against Nestorius. But it is not receiving a letter from men
who are involved in heresies, or otherwise not of a perfect mind, which subjects
us to blame, but adhering to the things written by [them], and not walking in a
contrary direction. I am much <A NAME="p126"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|126</SPAN></A> astonished at that part of your [letter in which after] saying that the edict
is imperfect you write lower down, &laquo;We, [when] in the chapters <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#338"><SUP>338</SUP></A>
which we presented to the prelate of the men of Jerusalem we said that the edict
contains a [right] profession of faith, said so as a concession, not as the
truth&raquo;. How then is it imperfect, if in truth it does not contain a right
profession, and does not remove the scandals from the midst? That which is
imperfect contains at any rate some part [agreeing with] that which is perfect,
so that [that] which is wanting for perfection may be restored: but that [which]
contains nothing sound [even] in part is not imperfect but entirely [false] <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#339"><SUP>339</SUP></A><i>
</i>and is the same as that which does not exist. [But] how is it that you, when
writing to father Stephen the Isaurian of religious memory, imitated what was
[formerly] said as a concession, and said, &laquo;The edict contains a right
profession of faith&raquo;? Or how is it that the God-loving fathers in Egypt reject
the written testament <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#340"><SUP>340</SUP></A> of defence which remained with them as they
say from father John the archimandrite and bishop who is among the saints,
[which] is composed of the actual bare words of the edict? Or rather <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#341"><SUP>341</SUP></A>,
to <A NAME="p127"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|127</SPAN></A> cite the very words themselves, let someone proceed to say what heresy it
introduces when it is said, &laquo;For we say that both the miracles and the
passions, which he underwent voluntarily in the flesh, belong to one only Son of
God&raquo;, and again, &laquo;Because the true and sinless Incarnation from the God-bearer
did not bring about an addition of a Lord; for the Trinity remained a Trinity
even when one of the Trinity, God the Word, became incarnate&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#342"><SUP>342</SUP></A>. But
perhaps you will say that the words are rightly expressed and free from blame,
but are not sufficient to demolish the scandals; for, inasmuch as they are
ambiguously expressed, even those also who call the one Christ two natures
profess them, since [they confess] the form <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#343"><SUP>343</SUP></A> which they call the Son
who became incarnate to be one and the same in identity of honour, in identity
of name in that he is of the same [essence], in authority, as we ourselves
elsewhere stated, when convicting the edict of ambiguity; but we ought not to
open a door to impiety by ambiguity in what we write, according to the words of
Gregory the Theologian, &laquo;For this is a common sandal which is put on both feet;
this is an image which looks at everyone who passes; a sifting which [sifts out]
everything&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#344"><SUP>344</SUP></A>. But this argument is then [sound]
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#345"><SUP>345</SUP></A> <A NAME="p128"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|128</SPAN></A> when the ambiguity is introduced [and the] truth condemned, [for accuracy] is
then expelled and banished, [like that which] was done by the synod which the
holy [Athanasius] termed 'an assembly of Caiaphas' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#346"><SUP>346</SUP></A>, [when it
introduced] the expression 'like' and removed [that of] co-essentiality, in
order that the Arians might understand the word 'like' to mean 'resembling'...
and the orthodox <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#347"><SUP>347</SUP></A> 'that which is of the same essence'
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#348"><SUP>348</SUP></A> and
'that which does not vary in anything'. But, if, when it pronounced that [the
Son] is like the Father, it had added, 'that is identical [in] essence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#348"><SUP>348</SUP></A>
with the Father', it would by the addition have limited the expression of
likeness which is [common] to both and eradicated the error arising from the
ambiguity. So also a man who accepts the right confession of the edict, if it is
enough for him, and he does not add the exact words which remove the heresy,
opens a door to impiety through the ambiguity of the written words, and falls
under the sentences of the holy Gregory in that he is doing detriment to the
truth. But, if besides the edict he both confesses one incarnate nature of God
the Word and anathematizes those who speak of two natures after the union, and
the operations and properties of these, and all the impiety that was <A NAME="p129"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|129</SPAN></A>
confirmed at Chalcedon, he has removed the danger <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#349"><SUP>349</SUP></A>
that is expected from the
ambiguity, and has bound the understanding of both parties under the yoke of
exactitude, and has also followed the law of Gregory the Theologian who in the 3<sup>rd</sup>
letter to Cledonius wrote thus: &laquo;Since therefore the same expressions when
rightly understood are consistent with religion, but when badly interpreted
contain foul impiety, what wonder is it if we accepted the words of Vitalis also
in a more religious sense, for so our object urges, while others are furious
against the sense of the things written?&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#350"><SUP>350</SUP></A> Let us therefore
acquiesce in the spiritual distinctions of Gregory the Theologian, and shun
ambiguity only when it stands alone, and by the double meaning inflicts injury
on the truth; but, when it is made subservient to accuracy by the addition of
more perfect statements, let us accept it. This same teaching is given by Basil
also who has the same spirit as Gregory in the epistle which he wrote to Maximus
the philosopher, the words being as follows: &laquo;But for my part I must call what
is yours mine <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#351"><SUP>351</SUP></A>. As to the term 'like in essence', if it has added
'without variation', I accept the expression, as <A NAME="p130"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|130</SPAN></A>
coming to the same thing as co-essentiality, that is, according to the sound
meaning of the expression 'co-essentiality', which those at Nicaea also
understood, when they called the Only one 'Light of Light', 'true God of true
God', and similar things, and consequently introduced the expression
'co-essentiality'. But it is never possible for us to imagine any difference
between light and light, or between truth and truth, or between the essence of
the Only one and that of the Father. If anyone therefore takes it as I have
said, I accept the expression. But, if anyone severs 'without variation' from
'like', as those at Constantinople <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#352"><SUP>352</SUP></A> did, I am suspicious of the
phrase, as diminishing the glory of the Only one. For even in the case of things
that resemble in a few points also, and are very much inferior to the originals,
we are accustomed often to use the expression 'like'&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#353"><SUP>353</SUP></A>. In
accordance therefore with these enactments of the fathers, since a mention of
the edict was once inserted in the defence of the Isaurians, we have accepted
it, because the whole evil-doing that is contrived by the ambiguity was removed
by the very fact that the things that are lacking were added, <A NAME="p131"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|131</SPAN></A>
and a clear defence was made to us that exposed the imperfection of the
edict. These things I was desirous to write, not out of self-seeking <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#354"><SUP>354</SUP></A>,
but because I have inserted in the letter a portion of what has often been
addressed by me in laborious arguments to many who maintained that the edict
sufficed for a defence. It is not as one might think because we cling to the
memory of the edict that we are compelled to employ words of this kind, nor
because we wish to oppose you; but, since by reason of our sins 'we have been
made a spectacle to the world, and to angels and to men', as the wise Paul says <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#355"><SUP>355</SUP></A>,
and we are henceforth set under the eyes of everyone, we must speak the words of
truth to everyone alike, and guard ourselves beforehand against causes of blame
even from all quarters, and use the examples and God-inspired teachings of the
holy fathers to guide us in what is right, and not love laughter and show
ourselves betrayers of lawful accuracy, nor yet incur blame for lack of learning
and spring beyond the bounds of the wrestling-space, but wisely consider the
saying of Koheleth, &laquo;There is a righteous man who perisheth in his
righteousness&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#356"><SUP>356</SUP></A>. Even now we are ready, and that since the holy
<A NAME="p132"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|132</SPAN></A> John the presbyter and archimandrite ..... wrote to us, to proceed to Egypt,
only provided that he will choose for us a quiet spot suited for our purpose, so
that we may not be annoyed by turbulent men, nor yet suffer injury from our
opponents. For through your saintly prayers those orthodox <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#357"><SUP>357</SUP></A>
</sup>in
Isauria, forming a determination worthy of their previous life, and being the
first to incur danger <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#358"><SUP>358</SUP></A> on behalf of the common hope, have lawfully
instituted an orthodox archbishop <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#359"><SUP>359</SUP></A>: and now both the man himself who
has been instituted [and some of] the God-loving bishops who performed his
institution, men who were indeed known to our meanness in the royal city, have
written us letters that are very excellent and full of propitious hopes, which
we will also read to you our fathers, [when] we deliberate [upon] what is
beneficial. For you [will see] <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#360"><SUP>360</SUP></A> from what has been [said] that we
should not [reject] <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#360"><SUP>360</SUP></A> so much good, and accept the contrary, or rather
<sup><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#361"><SUP>361</SUP></A> </sup>simple [words]. And this I [heartily]
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#360"><SUP>360</SUP></A> wish [your] sanctities
to believe, that I would have chosen to be burned with fire, [in order] that
what is <A NAME="p133"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|133</SPAN></A> gratifying to you may be done, and especially where with the gratification
there is combined lawfulness and reasonableness. But these things, [if] God
pleases, we will [consider] <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#362"><SUP>362</SUP></A> at length together when we meet.

<p> And know this, that, where general unions were concerned, the fathers
did not wish to inquire into the observance of the strict rule with regard to
names. Many of the 318 who assembled at Nicaea, as ecclesiastical histories
relate, were present at the synod at Ariminus [<i>sic</i>] and at Sardica <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#366"><SUP>366</SUP></A>;
and still, though the doctrines there laid down <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#367"><SUP>367</SUP></A>
were not approved,
no one contended about names. And in the same way at Nicaea <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#368"><SUP>368</SUP></A>
in
Thrace also the synod of bishops which pronounced that the Father is like the
Son, not co-essential, was rightly rejected; and yet there was no question about
names at that time. It is a long matter to recount the other rejected synods,
that at Sirmium, that at Lampsacus, that at Rome, that at Zelo <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#369"><SUP>369</SUP></A>, that
at your Seleucia, all of which the synod of the 150 caused to be passed over in
silence as if it had <A NAME="p135"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|135</SPAN></A> forgotten them, not introducing among us any vain talk or superfluous inquiry
about names, but only asserting the divinity <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#370"><SUP>370</SUP></A> of the Holy Spirit
together with the Father and the Son, and explaining the intention of the 318.
And, when the holy Cyril with the holy synod at Ephesus accomplished the
deprivation <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#371"><SUP>371</SUP></A> of the evil Nestorius, the bishops of the East, though
they contended for his rejected tenets<sup>3</sup>, afterwards agreed to the
deprivation <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#371"><SUP>371</SUP></A> of that wolf and the rejections of the hateful tenets
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#372"><SUP>372</SUP></A>;
and there was never any discussion about names, although how many do you think
had died in the meanwhile, who contended for the wickedness of Nestorius? For
these things, as I have said, general unions have no room; but they remained
without examination; since many are in fact passed over at councils, although
they have often been involved in impious opinions. Since then at the present
time some common agreement among the churches is hoped for, do not lower your
mind to untimely hair-splitting. As there is a time to speak and a time to be
silent <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#373"><SUP>373</SUP></A>, so there is a time both to inquire into a matter of this
kind and not to inquire. Bear these things in mind and be rightly disposed, <A NAME="p136"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|136</SPAN></A>
and have no regard to men who cleave to division, and find fault with
everything in the same way, whom the sacred Scripture calls backbiters and
enemies of the common peace, and Christ the God of peace <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#374"><SUP>374</SUP></A>.

<p> In dealing with abstentions with regard to names preserved in the
sacred tablets we must in fitness duly compare the things of which the sacred
Scripture said that, when they fall into water that is contained in small
vessels, they pollute it, but, when into pools or wells or cisterns containing
many streams, they cause no stain or pollution. For the law of the divine Spirit
said thus: &laquo;And every drink that ye shall drink in any vessel shall be
polluted; and everything on which anything from a dead body falls is polluted.
However fountains of water and pools and cisterns of water shall be pure&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#380"><SUP>380</SUP></A>.
This principle then ought to be observed in the present case also. If a man
separates from many on the ground that they are infected with heresy, or that
they communicate with those who are infected, let him with all his power
maintain abstention from the dead body, and not mention even the name of those
who are under suspicion and not genuine, lest it fall and pollute the <A NAME="p139"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|139</SPAN></A>
purity of the communion. But, if the holding of the orthodox faith, and an
anathema of every heresy reigns in the churches, and whole countries and
provinces <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#381"><SUP>381</SUP></A>, and populous churches, confess one uncorrupted
confession, then names which are thought to pollute are inundated by the
multitude of streams. It is good that no particle of a dead body should be
introduced even into a large quantity of water; but if perchance <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#382"><SUP>382</SUP></A>
it
in fact happen to be introduced, it is cleansed by the quantity of streams, and
swamped by the quantity of cleansing <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#383"><SUP>383</SUP></A>. We find that in fact the holy
fathers also who were in former times upholders of the right word managed these
things in this way. Show us from the compositions of the doctors of the church
that, after so large a number had found fault with the faith of the 318 at
Ariminus [sic], any question was raised about the names of those who had died.
And, not to make the letter tedious by using many words, let us pass on in mind
to times that are near and not far removed. We find that the holy Timothy, he
who underwent long exiles <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#384"><SUP>384</SUP></A>, united with everyone in the Encyclical,
and communicated with Paul bishop of the city of the Ephesians, and Peter who
had become prelate of <A NAME="p140"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|140</SPAN></A> this great Christ-loving city of Antioch, while names under suspicion were
preserved in the sacred tablets; and the holy Cyril, when he united with the
Easterns after the deprivation <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#385"><SUP>385</SUP></A> of Nestorius, when many bishops had
died, and had departed under the stain of the Nestorian heresy, made no inquiry
about names. If therefore those who set great store by strictness in respect of
such names say that the oblation is not pure, let them know that their
strictness also draws its origin and existence from such communion, and descends
from that source as from a root. For the saintly Timothy, as we have said,
consented to hold communion with those of like opinions in company with such
names, he whose grandsons they are who now with a boastful front loudly
proclaim, &laquo;You shall not approach me because I am pure&raquo;. And this we say
superfluously, that some of the bishops in the cities of the Easterns set even
this also straight, and ceased to mention all such names: for others found it
impossible to set this same thing straight; and it was not right for such a
reason for them to enter on wrangles <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#386"><SUP>386</SUP></A>, and set themselves in array
against the enthusiasm of the people of the cities, in order that they might
suffer shipwreck in the most essential things. <A NAME="p141"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|141</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

<p> They are not acting rightly who think that our oblation is not pure on
account of the names of those who have already died, and who have fallen into
heretical tenets <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#388"><SUP>388</SUP></A>, and have not been removed from the sacred tablets;
because in fact such matters did not affect the oblation of orthodoxy <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#389"><SUP>389</SUP></A>
of the holy fathers also. Though Eusebius Pamphili contended for the disease of
Arius, both in speech and in act, the members of the church of Caesarea
mentioned his name, until the holy Cyril passed by, when he was hastening to the
city of the Ephesians, and had this name removed. What shall we then say? That
throughout the time during which the name of Eusebius stood in the sacred
tablets it perturbed the oblation of men who held right opinions <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#388"><SUP>388</SUP></A>?
What? When again the same holy Cyril of saintly memory wrote to the holy <A NAME="p142"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|142</SPAN></A>
Proclus bishop of Constantinople at that time to spare the name of Theodore
of Mopsuestia, who was the putrid source of the hateful and putrid tenets <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#390"><SUP>390</SUP></A>
of Nestorius, in order not to give an opportunity to those who wished to disturb
the church <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#391"><SUP>391</SUP></A>, shall we think that thereby some pollution and stain of
heresy was inflicted on the oblation of the orthodox <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#392"><SUP>392</SUP></A>? By no means.
If we search into this, there is no time at which we shall see the church to be
pure. If is already well-known that such things have not and never will cause
any injury to the whole fulness of the body of Christ. In fact in Leviticus we
find something like this written, where it is dealing with the pollution that is
caused to anything by a dead body, as follows: &laquo;And all food that ye shall eat
on which water shall come, and there fall upon it any of these dead things, it
is pollution; and every drink that ye shall drink in any vessel is polluted.
However of <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#393"><SUP>393</SUP></A> springs of water and of pools and of cisterns of water
they shall be pure&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#394"><SUP>394</SUP></A>. What then is it that is made known to us by
this? That, when certain men are by themselves, in a church for instance or in
one <A NAME="p143"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|143</SPAN></A> city, or in monasteries perhaps make mention of the names of those who are
under suspicion and of dead men, like the similarly small amount of water
contained in a vessel they are polluted by the mention, as if something dead
were falling; but, when churches of many provinces <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#395"><SUP>395</SUP></A><i> </i>and of
dioceses are held in one bond of faith, and resemble fair fountains and pools
and cisterns of water, the dead thing which has the property of polluting if it
fall cannot injure; for it is swamped by the flow, and by the abundance of many
streams. I have said these things in order to show from the God-inspired
Scripture, and from the bishops, the pastors, the upholders of right reason,
that in such matters observance of every point is endless, and that mention of
this kind <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#396"><SUP>396</SUP></A> </sup>does no injury to the fair body of the church. But your
sanctity should know that we have by a letter made the above project known to
the saintly Dioscorus also, bishop of Alexandria <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#397"><SUP>397</SUP></A>, since we
considered his assent also most necessary. <A NAME="p144"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|144</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

<p>Being pricked by these words and divine laws as by goads, and fearing and
trembling, I mentioned the matter of those from Cappadocia who wish to be united
to us to the saintly Dioscorus bishop of Alexandria and our fellow-minister, and
1 consulted with your learning also, revealing to you all my affairs from the
beginning, and hiding nothing whatever; and I do not know how it is that you
have thrown over the letters and consultations that have passed since that time,
and tell us to take no account of those from Cappadocia the waste country, but
to treat the divine laws that I have just mentioned with contempt. In the first
place the same account is due to one soul <A NAME="p146"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|146</SPAN></A>
and to many; and next how can we call the two Cappadocias and Armenia waste
places? But in this you thought or spoke rather <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#404"><SUP>404</SUP></A>
like the natives of
the country (allow me with your pardon to say), and not truly. For it is the
habit of the Alexandrines to think that the sun rises for them only, and towards
them only the lamp burns, so that they even jestingly term outside cities
'lampless'. If for the purpose of right judgments it is possible to weigh the
numbers of a people, like weights that are distinguished by the inclinations of
the scale of a balance, the inhabitants of all these countries will produce no
less than the whole city of the Alexandrines. But you say that in the case of
men who make right requests we should have regard to our understanding. But in
this also we have a better principle, as we showed in what we said a little
before, having countless other texts of the God-inspired Scriptures also which
command us, that those that are strong should bear the infirmities of those that
are weak <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#405"><SUP>405</SUP></A>, and that we should not have regard to our own affairs but
to the interest of others <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#406"><SUP>406</SUP></A>, and texts that agree with those. And,
while was writing and speaking <A NAME="p147"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|147</SPAN></A> these things, I showed caution in every point, and did not trust to myself in
everything, but awaited the assent of the saintly Dioscorus my fellow-minister
who shares my opinions, and Eleusinius <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#407"><SUP>407</SUP></A> and Proclus
<sup><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#408"><SUP>408</SUP></A> </sup>the
God-loving bishops from Cappadocia I took from the beginning as my
fellow-communicants and now hold them as such, since they have anathematized the
synod of Chalcedon by many signatures in no small number of tomes: but Soteric <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#409"><SUP>409</SUP></A>
who offered us a covenant of union and conjunction I passed over, for I did not
wish to term him our fellow-communicant by letter (how could I so term one who
is not bound in communion?) Wherefore also Asterius, his God-loving brother, and
bishop of Nyssa, is ready to leave the see. So for our part we held to our own
principles and did not give any man, to speak in the words of Scripture, cause
of offence <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#410"><SUP>410</SUP></A>. For we know positively and we say openly
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#411"><SUP>411</SUP></A> that you have formed an execrable purpose that is not pleasing to God. And I beg
your learning not to bestow this foolish favour on me at all, and hide what was
written by me, but make it known, if possible, to everyone. What sense is there
in <A NAME="p148"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|148</SPAN></A> our promising something difficult on account of an insignificant cause of
fear, and in fact taking the opposite course?

<p>But as to the edict I have often said to your wisdom what my position is, and
it seems a piece of perversity that we should sing <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#412"><SUP>412</SUP></A>

about the same things; for whether you remember or do not remember is the same
to me. While the things wickedly done at Chalcedon against the orthodox faith
are not anathematized by name, no argument can persuade me like an interpreter
of dreams to expound and forcibly understand the text of the edict as a
rejection of the unlawful things. (<i>And again he says of the Henotikon</i>.)

destitute of healing for what is required. <A NAME="p149"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|149</SPAN></A>&nbsp;

</p>
<p>And, when all the bishops of the East were present at Antioch <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#413"><SUP>413</SUP></A>,
and anathematized the synod in writing, and we addressed a synodical letter to
Timothy the prelate of the royal city, we anathematized what was done at
Chalcedon against the orthodox faith, and the Jewish Tome of Leo, and those who
call our one Lord and God Jesus Christ two natures after the incomprehensible
union. And afterwards, when innumerable attacks were made upon me, insomuch that
the glorious Asterius, the ex-prefect <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#414"><SUP>414</SUP></A> of the city, who held the
office called <i>a secretis </i><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#415"><SUP>415</SUP></A>,<i> </i>was sent after me, I was not
in the least frightened, nor did I fear, nor yield to the time, though he said,
&laquo;The kingdom of the Romans is in a turmoil <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#416"><SUP>416</SUP></A> on account of this&raquo;,
but I plainly said, &laquo;I am ready to leave the city and resign the see, rather
than upset one stroke of what I wrote from the beginning in the synodical words
addressed to Timothy&raquo;: and this I did not say without writing it down, but I
expressed myself with freedom <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#417"><SUP>417</SUP></A> in writing to the religious king also.

<p>But this you may keep firmly and fixedly in your mind, that no one shall be our fellow-communicant, nor will we consent to greet by letter any
man who at the same time receives the wicked synod at Chalcedon contrary to the
law, and does not anathematize the Tome of Leo. But, if any concession is

name the things done at Chalcedon against the orthodox faith, and against those
who contended on behalf of this, and the wicked Tome of Leo, who became chief of
the church of the Romans, and those who call our one Lord and God Jesus Christ
two natures after the divine and ineffable union, there being also expressly
joined with these things the right confession contained in the edict of Zeno of
pious ending, for the rejection of the wicked synod at Chalcedon. If the things
blasphemously and unlawfully done at that synod, and the polluted Tome of Leo,
and those who after the union divide the one Christ into a duality of natures,
are not anathematized, though the edict or <i>Henotikon </i>is taken as a
rejection of these things, I do not consider this sufficient for persuasion, as

</p>

<p>And now I turn to the statement made by your religiousness, that one of those
who live an ascetic life of philosophic labour, after he had come and presented
himself for ordination <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#425"><SUP>425</SUP></A> in order that he might officiate as a priest to
God, having afterwards come to remember his life, and the sins that he had
committed in his boyhood, and all the rest of his life, and having learned <A NAME="p155"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|155</SPAN></A>
that the canon requires blamelessness, sought to range himself outside the
priestly ministry, and in a way renounce ordination <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#426"><SUP>426</SUP></A>, and satisfy the
canon. How is this endurable? tell me; and how is it anything but a result of
false modesty? You write that this man has lived both with earnestness and
according to the ordinances of philosophy <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#427"><SUP>427</SUP></A>, and, to speak in the
language of Scripture, looks to himself <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#428"><SUP>428</SUP></A>. If the facts of that great
sin which cuts off from the priesthood or from the ministry had happened after
the profession of monastic life, then there would have been reason for modesty
to play its part. But, where the facts of the sin happened firsthand the
enrolling in philosophy followed, how is it right to feel fear where no fear is <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#429"><SUP>429</SUP></A>?
We believe, not without the divine Spirit, that the holy habit of the monastic
life carries forgiveness of sins, and strips off the old man 'who is corrupted
in the lusts of error', and puts on 'the new man who was created in God, in
righteousness and sanctity of truth' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#430"><SUP>430</SUP></A>, as the wise Paul somewhere
said in writing. I adduce, although I am addressing those who know, in
confirmation of what has been stated, <A NAME="p156"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|156</SPAN></A>
the vision which that heavenly man the great Antony saw. What in fact does
the man who told the story of his life say, the divine Athanasius who is among
the high-priests? &laquo;When he was about to eat, and had risen to pray at the 9<sup>th</sup>
hour, he felt his consciousness lifted up, and (wonderful to relate!) he felt
himself standing and seeing himself, as if he had been taken outside him, and as
if he were being led into the air by some men, and afterwards some grievous and
cruel men standing in the air and seeking to prevent him from passing. And, when
the conductors opposed, these required an account to know if he were not liable
to them; but, when they sought to make an account from his birth, those who were
leading Antony prevented it, saying to these: 'What happened from his birth the
Lord has wiped out; but you may inquire into the time since he became a monk and
made profession to God'. Then upon their making charges and failing to convict,
the road was made free and unimpeded before him. And immediately he saw himself
standing, as if he had come to himself, and that he was again wholly Antony&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#431"><SUP>431</SUP></A>.
Guided therefore by this divine command, I have answered the present question;
and I affirm and say with confidence that that modest man <A NAME="p157"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|157</SPAN></A>
must retain the priestly ministry, since with his very scrupulousness and
carefulness he has conferred a great benefit upon us, and by the wise and modest
question has astringed with apostolic salt those who gape for priestly offices,
and fun after ordinations <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#432"><SUP>432</SUP></A>, like the pomp <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#433"><SUP>433</SUP></A>
and honours of
the world, and those whose minds are fixed on pride or on visions of things
here, and who treat as of no account the judgments which we shall receive for
these things, when the day of judgment arrives, which will assuredly come, and
is spoken of by every one's mouth, but is looked for by few as it should be
looked for.

<p> You are acting rightly and as befits women who profess religion in
asking everything without shame; for there is one thing only that brings shame,
if through sin we come in conflict with God's laws, and fall under the <A NAME="p158"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|158</SPAN></A>
judgment of divine wrath. I. Know therefore that a woman who has the usual
flow of blood ought not to communicate in the divine communion till the blood
ceases to come. II. On the same principle, in the case of one also who has held
the chaste intercourse of the couch with a lawful husband, after the same
intercourse, it is not in accordance with religion that she should for the space
of a day receive the most mysterious food: for these things increase men's awe
and clearness of vision as regards the practice of religion and the worship of
God.

<p>In the apostolic injunctions something like this is written about a widow who
is appointed in the churches: &laquo;But, after she enters upon her functions, as has
been said, let her not be concerned with anything, but be alone, for the purpose
of undisturbed prayers; for to such a widow solitude is a foundation of holiness
and of life: for she has had no pleasure in anyone else but the God of gods, the
Father in heaven. But at stated times let her give praise apart, at night and in
the morning. If she have a menstruation, let her remain in the church, but not
approach the altar; not that she is polluted, but because honour is due to the
altar&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#435"><SUP>435</SUP></A>. For the sake <A NAME="p159"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|159</SPAN></A>
of confirmation we have also adduced the answers of the blessed and saintly
Timothy, the great bishop of Alexandria, who was at the time of the synod of the
150 bishops, which in giving instruction on such matters write for us in
agreement with the apostles, and on the present point enjoin as follows: <i>Question
V; </i>if a woman be with her husband at night, whether she ought to receive or
not; <i>Answer. </i>&laquo;They ought not to receive immediately, since the apostle
cries: 'Deprive not one another, unless it be by consent for a time' (by 'time'
he means that which is occupied with communion), 'that ye may devote yourselves
to prayer, and come together again, lest Satan tempt you concerning the lust of
incontinence'&raquo;: and again: <i>Question VII; </i>if a believing woman see that
which is customary among women, whether she ought to approach the mysteries on
the same day, or not. <i>Answer. </i>&laquo;A religious woman therefore who is about
to receive of the divine communion ought to prepare herself beforehand before

<p> But, as to the kings, hear a story of the holy old men that has been
transmitted and has come down to us. They said that the religious king
Theodosius sent someone secretly to father Nisthora <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#440"><SUP>440</SUP></A>
the God-clad old
man, begging of him to pray that a male child might be given him: and, on the
day on which the messenger reached his cell in the desert, it happened that that
old man died two or three hours before; and, when that man knocked at the door,
immediately the old man rose up and sat down according to his custom to make a
rope <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#441"><SUP>441</SUP></A> of palm-leaves; and he said to his disciple, &laquo;Bring in the man
who knocked&raquo;: and when he came in he said to him, &laquo;Say to Theodosius, 'Because
God loves you, he will not give you a <i>malakion; </i>for after your reign the
faith shall be corrupted; and the faith of Nestorius shall prevail, and God does
not wish the evil to be done through your seed'&raquo; (The Egyptians call a male
infant <i>malakion, </i>as the Byzantines call it <A NAME="p162"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|162</SPAN></A>
<i>philikarion):</i> and, when that man had gone out, that old man again lay down
and fell asleep and departed to God. This father Nisthora was a celebrated man,
so that his words are recorded in several of the books which contain tales of the holy old men. So long therefore as the synod of Chalcedon is in force, it
is impossible for a king to beget sons <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#442"><SUP>442</SUP></A>, or, if he beget one, to
leave the kingdom to his son. And this was both foretold by those holy men, and
in the days of Leo the king proved by experience: for Leontarius the younger was actually created Caesar, and died an untimely death before his father
<A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#443"><SUP>443</SUP></A>.
Vainly therefore does he err who deceives himself.

<p> David that king and lover of God and prophet, who was more humble
than all men, when Saul had twice armed himself against him, with many <A NAME="p163"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|163</SPAN></A>
thousands of armed men and warlike soldiers, and, after being in a way
caught, he not only escaped in a marvellous manner from the danger <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#444"><SUP>444</SUP></A>
which surrounded him, but even captured with his hands the man who had armed
himself against him, and he had it in his power to kill him, mercifully spared
him twice, that enemy and murderer who was so ferociously set against him. And
yet, [after] he had received such an experience of God's support and protection,
hear what kind of things he meditates and says [in] his mind when he is debating
with himself. &laquo;And David said in his heart, 'Now shall I [be delivered] one day
into Saul's hands and there is nothing good for me, unless I escape to the land
of aliens, and Saul cease searching for me through the whole border of Israel,
and I escape from his [hand]'. And David arose and the 600 men who were with
him; and he went to Achish son of Maacah, [King of Gath]; and David settled with
Achish in Gath he and his men&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#445"><SUP>445</SUP></A>. Where therefore was then Caesaria
the strongest of all persons in faith, in order that she might have said to
David also who was [meditating] and doing such things, &laquo;Whither flee you, O
prophet? Rather <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#446"><SUP>446</SUP></A> <A NAME="p164"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|164</SPAN></A>
you are forgetting God's [high and] constant right hand, which saved you and
delivered that adversary and foeman into your hands, faithless thoughts have
gained control of you&raquo;; and, &laquo;The land of the mightiness of that Exalted one
is more worthy of confidence for your protection than that of Achish the
barbarian. It seems to me that the words escape your memory which you yourself
... sing by the Holy Spirit, which, I believe, run: 'Many are the tribulations
of the righteous, and the Lord will deliver them out of them all. The Lord
preserveth all their bones, and not one of them shall be broken'; and again,
'The Lord will deliver the souls of his own bondmen' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#447"><SUP>447</SUP></A>&raquo;? In answer to
these things David would say, &laquo;Listen, my daughter, and incline thine ear' <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#448"><SUP>448</SUP></A>.
I know the purport of the spiritual songs that were sung by me better than you:
but I also know the God of all, who beyond all hope snatches his own peculiar
bondmen out of all dangers <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#449"><SUP>449</SUP></A>, and again, exercising them, also leaves
them to adopt plans derived from human thoughts, and weapons drawn from nature,
in order that they may also flee and choose to suffer everything, and not betray
God, and do aught that distresses him. If we trusted to his help and were
incapable of falling, not weakening in <A NAME="p165"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|165</SPAN></A>
anything of ourselves or contributing anything, the virtue would be without
reward; or rather <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#450"><SUP>450</SUP></A> there would be no room at all to perform anything
whatever, or to show any kind of success&raquo;.
</p>
<p>For this reason therefore Moses the great was afraid of the king of Egypt and
fled, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian for 40 years, and again he
returned to Egypt, and transfers the fear to the king, and he chastised that
obstinate and disobedient man with plagues by means of the marvellous signs.
[And the one] was the effect of the virtue of Moses, that is [the affair] of the
flight by which he fled, in order to bring just help to his countrymen who were
being oppressed, while the other was the effect of the mightiness of God, the
display of the great wonders.
</p>
<p>And Elijah the prophet, fearing the threat of Jezebel, the wife of that
prodigal <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#451"><SUP>451</SUP></A> and impious man, was a fugitive, he who bound the clouds
for three years and six months, and dried up the land with drought, and again by
a word brought down rain. But Paul also, the great in signs and wonders, was let
down from the wall in a basket <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#452"><SUP>452</SUP></A> by the disciples in Damascus
<A NAME="p166"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|166</SPAN></A> and fled, when the Jews wanted to kill him; and those who took pleasure in
hearing his teaching did not say, &laquo;Let the teacher stay with us that we may
hear his very pleasant exposition, by means of which he causes the venomous
reptiles to flee like a stag&raquo; (I mean the demons and evil spirits that are
envious and hostile against the salvation of men).
</p>
<p>(<i>After other things</i>). And the Lord also, the Giver of powers, not
being a teacher of timidity, said, &laquo;When they persecute you in this city, flee
ye to another&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#453"><SUP>453</SUP></A>, wishing us not to trust in our own strength, but
rather <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#454"><SUP>454</SUP></A> be anxious about such things, and, when at his permission
conditions of trial beset us, then indeed we must fight bravely.

<p>When I learned that the presbyter and archimandrite Beronician (?) <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#458"><SUP>458</SUP></A>
of saintly memory had departed and migrated to the heavenly mansions, partly
from outside report, and partly from his revered letter, which at his decease <A NAME="p168"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|168</SPAN></A>
he left for me as a blessing <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#459"><SUP>459</SUP></A>, which is truly full of all
spiritual blessing, then I was distressed and my heart gave me bitter pain; and
not only did I lament for his decease, but I also lifted the eyes of my mind
together with my body upwards, and lifted up my voice to him, as to one who
hears and perceives; for indeed he does even perceive the truth, &laquo;My father, my
father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#460"><SUP>460</SUP></A>.

<p>An identical copy <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#461"><SUP>461</SUP></A> to each one of them.
</p>
<p> That a church is a confession of right faith no one who is reckoned
among Christians and has understanding doubts, since the Lord plainly said in
the Gospels to the divine Peter, the first of the apostles, when he made the
confession, &laquo;Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God&raquo;, &laquo;Thou art Cephas,
and upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of Sheol shall not <A NAME="p169"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|169</SPAN></A>
prevail against it&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#462"><SUP>462</SUP></A>; and he called the firmness and fixity of
such a confession a rock. And, as speech knows a right and sound opinion on
faith as a church, so it also knows the believers who confess it as a church.
And David the wonderful among prophets, depicting this church beforehand as a
queen and a virgin clad in various kinds of flowers and in royal excellencies,
and for this reason all the more and <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#463"><SUP>463</SUP></A> in loving fashion espoused to
the king, and gathering many virgin souls, and attracting them to her pattern
and the example of her chaste life, said, &laquo;Virgins shall go to the king after
her&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#464"><SUP>464</SUP></A>. You also therefore showed by your writings and acts, after
choosing the virgin and angelic life, that is free from all material things,
that you are walking after the queen and first virgin, the church. See therefore
that you turn not your looks away, but with all diligence look intently and
securely and fixedly at her, and cleave to her, in order that, being hard by,
you may enter the king's temple, which is the expected rest, and the
suprasensual bridal-chamber, concerning which the same prophet again said, &laquo;Holy
is thy temple, and wonderful in righteousness&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#465"><SUP>465</SUP></A>:
<A NAME="p170"><SPAN CLASS=pb>|170</SPAN></A> For it excites wonder as something holy and raised above earthly deeds and
thoughts, and it cannot be expressed and explained in words, but shows by
experience to those who are worthy what manner of thing it is; and, looking at
the bountiful right hand of the Giver, they will say, &laquo;Pleasure is in thy right
hand for ever&raquo; <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#466"><SUP>466</SUP></A>. These things may your chastities find, showing as
you do the lamp of asceticism in its brightness, through keeping the orthodox
faith; for, when this is absent, the lamp inasmuch as it lacks oil cannot give
light <A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#467"><SUP>467</SUP></A>. Be not therefore remiss in labours, but sustain yourselves on
the hope of the future life, and look for a reward to be added to the now
existing troubles, and ask the God of all not to allow us to be tried beyond
what we can bear, but with the trial to give also a way of escape, that we may
be able to endure <sup><A HREF="severus_coll_2_letters_fn.htm#468"><SUP>468</SUP></A></sup>. And these things we have written in few words,
being as we are at a distance and in varying and unwonted places; but every day
we are with you in spirit, and speak similar words.&nbsp;
