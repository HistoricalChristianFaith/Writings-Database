<p align="left">This is a mysterious item which I found on the internet.&nbsp; 
The translator is given as William A. Curtis, who appears to have been a 
Scottish divine in Glasgow in the early 20th century.&nbsp; But the originator 
seems to be a Theodore J. Nottingham, who says that he obtained it from a 
certain Dr Charles Ashanin, who in turn obtained it from Curtis' papers.&nbsp; 
Nottingham wrote to Harry Plantinga at CCEL, offering the item
<a href="http://www.ccel.org/o/origen/prayer/note1.txt.htm">thus</a> in January 
2001:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p align="left">I would like to ask that you add a link to a very rare 
	translation that has come into my possession and which is posted free on the 
	Internet. Translated from the original Greek by a reknown (sic) Scottish 
	scholar at the turn of the century, the manuscript of &quot;Origen on Prayer&quot; was 
	passed on to my spiritual mentor, a Church Historian from the former 
	Yugoslavia, who recently passed on. On behalf of his fifty year effort to 
	publish this material, I have placed it, newly edited and updated, at this 
	site: "http://tedn.hypermart.net/origen.htm". Please share it with persons 
	interested in the great master.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">The item is widely available now online.&nbsp; In case it 
vanishes, I have placed it here.</p>
