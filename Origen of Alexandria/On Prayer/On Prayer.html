<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C1"></A>I.</SPAN>&nbsp;INTRODUCTION
<p>
</b>Things in themselves so supremely great, so far above man, so
utterly above our perishable nature, as to be impossible for the race of
rational mortals to grasp, as the will of God became possible in the
immeasurable abundance of the Divine grace which streams forth from God upon
men, through Jesus Christ the minister of His unsurpassable grace toward us, and
through the cooperant Spirit. Thus, though it is a standing impossibility for
human nature to acquire Wisdom, by which all things have been established&mdash;for
all things, according to David, God made in wisdom&mdash;from being impossible it
becomes possible through our Lord Jesus Christ, who was made for us wisdom from
God and righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
<p>
For what or who is man that he shall know the counsel of God, or who shall
conceive what that Lord willeth? Since the thoughts of mortals are weakling and
our purposes are prone to fail; for the body that is corruptible weighs down
soul, and mind with its store of thought is burdened by it's earthly tabernacle;
and things on earth we forecast with difficulty, but things in heaven whoever
yet traced out? Who would not say that it is impossible for man to trace out
things in heaven? Yet this impossible thing, by the surpassing grace of God,
becomes possible; for he who was caught up unto a third heaven traced out things
in the three heavens through having heard unutterable utterances which it was
not permitted for man to speak. Who can say that it is possible for the mind of
the Lord to be known by man?
<p>
But this, too, God graciously gives through Christ who said to His disciples:
&quot;No longer do I call you servants, because the servant knows not what his
lord's will is, but I have called you friends, because all the things that I
have heard from my Father I have made known to you; so that through Christ there
is made known to them the will of one who, when He teaches them the will of the
Lord, has no desire to be their lord any longer but instead becomes a friend to
those whose lord he was before.&quot; Moreover, as no one knows the things of
man save the Spirit of man that is in him, so also no one knows the things of
God save the Spirit of God.
<p>
Now if no one knows the things of God save the Spirit of God, it is impossible
that a man should know the things of God. But mark how this too becomes
possible: but we, he says, have received not the spirit of the world but the
spirit which is from God, that we may know the things graciously given to us by
God, and these also we speak not in words taught of human wisdom but in those
taught of the Spirit. But I think, right pious and industrious Ambrosius, and
right discreet and manful Tatiana, from whom I avow that womanly weakness has
disappeared as truly as it had from Sarah of old, you are wondering to what
purpose all this has been said in preface about things impossible for man
becoming possible by the grace of God, when the subject prescribed for our
discourse is Prayer.
<p>
The fact is, I believe it to be itself one of those things which, judged by our
weakness, are impossible, clearly to set forth with accuracy and reverence a
complete account of prayer, and in particular of how prayer ought to be offered,
what ought to be said to God in prayer, which seasons are more, which less,
suitable for prayer . . . The very apostle who by reason of the abundance of the
revelations is anxious that no one should account to him more than he sees or
hears from him, confesses that he knows not how to pray as he ought, for what we
ought to pray, he says, we know not how to as we ought. It is necessary not
merely to pray but also to pray as we ought and to pray what we ought. For even
though we are enabled to understand what we ought to pray, that is not adequate
if we do not add to it the right manner also.
<p>
On the other hand what is the use of the right manner to us if we do not know to
pray for what we ought? Of these two things the one, I mean the 'what we
ought' of prayer, is the language of the prayer, while the 'as we ought' is
the disposition of him who prays. Thus the former is illustrated by &quot;Ask
for the great things and the little shall be added unto you,&quot; and &quot;Ask
for the heavenly things and the earthly shall be added unto you,&quot; and
&quot;Pray for them that abuse you,&quot; and &quot;Entreat therefore the Lord
of the harvest that He send out workers unto his harvest,&quot; and &quot;Pray
that you enter not into temptation,&quot; and &quot;Pray that your flight be not
in winter or on a Sabbath,&quot; and &quot;In praying babble not&quot; and the
like passages: the latter by &quot;I desire therefore that men pray in ever
place lifting up holy hands without anger and questioning, and in like manner
that women array themselves decently in simplicity, with modesty and discretion,
not in or gold or pearls or costly raiments, but, as becomes women of pious
profession, through good works. Instructive too, for prayer 'as we ought' is
the passage:
<p>
&quot;If then you art offering your gift at the altar and there think you that
your brother hath aught against you, leave there your gift before the altar, and
go back&mdash;first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your
gift;&quot; for what greater gift can be sent up to God from a rational creature
than fragrant words of prayer that is offered from a conscience devoid of taint
from Sin? Similarly instructive is &quot;Deprive not one another, save by
agreement for a season that you may give yourselves to prayer and may be
together at another time again, in order that Satan may not have occasion to
exalt over you by reason of your incontinence.
<p>
For prayer 'as we ought' is restrained unless the marriage mysteries which
claim our silence be consummated with more of solemnity and deliberation and
less of passion, the 'agreement' referred to in the passage obliterating the
discord of passion, and destroying incontinence, and preventing Satan's
malicious exultation. Yet again instructive for prayer 'as we ought' is the
passage: &quot;If you are standing at prayer, forgive aught that you have
against any man;&quot; and also the passage in Paul &quot;Any man who prays or
preaches with covered head dishonours his head, and any woman who prays or
preaches with unveiled head dishonors her head&quot; is descriptive of the right
manner of prayer.
<p>
Paul knows all these sayings, and could cite, with subtle statement in each
case, manifold more from law and prophets and gospel fulfillment, but in the
moderation, yes, and in the truthfulness of his nature, and because he sees how
much, after all of them, is lacking to knowledge of the right way to pray what
he ought, he says &quot;but what we ought to pray we know not how to as we
ought,&quot; and adds thereto the source from which a man's deficiency is made
up if though ignorant he has rendered himself worthy to have the deficiency made
up within him:
<p>
&quot;The Spirit himself more than intercedes with God in sighs unspeakable and
He that searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because His
intercession on behalf of saints is according to God.&quot; Thus the Spirit who
cries &quot;Abba Father&quot; in the hearts of the blessed, knowing with
solicitude that their sighing in this tabernacle can but weigh down the already
fallen or transgressors, &quot;more than intercedes with God in sighs
unspeakable,&quot; for the great love and sympathy He feels for men taking our
sighs upon himself; and, by virtue of the wisdom that resides in Him, beholding
our Soul humbled 'unto dust' and shut within the body 'of humiliation,' He
employs no common sighs when He more than intercedes with God but unspeakable
ones akin to the unutterable words which a man may not speak. Not content to
intercede with God, this Spirit intensifies His intercession, &quot;more than
intercedes,&quot; for those who more than conquer, as I believe such as Paul
was, who says &quot;Nay in all these we more than conquer.&quot;
<p>
He simply &quot;intercedes,&quot; I think, not for those who more than conquer,
nor again for those who are conquered, but for those who conquer. Akin to the
saying &quot;what we ought to pray we know not how to as we ought, but the
Spirit more than intercedes with God in sighs unspeakable,&quot; is the passage
&quot;I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also:
I will sing with the spirit; and I will sing with the understanding also.&quot;
<p>
For even our understanding is unable to pray unless the spirit leads it in
prayer within hearing of it as it were, anymore than it can sing or hymn, with
rhythmic cadence and in unison, with true measure and in harmony, the Father in
Christ, unless the Spirit who searches all things even the depth of God first
praise and hymn Him whose depth He has searched and, as He had the power,
comprehended. I think it must have been the awakened consciousness of human
weakness falling short of prayer in the right way, above all realized as he
listened to great words of intimate knowledge falling from the Savior's lips in
prayer to the Father, that moved one of the disciples of Jesus to say to the
Lord when He ceased praying, &quot;Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also
taught his disciples.&quot; The whole train of language is as follows: &quot;And
it came to pass, as He was at prayer in a certain place, that one of His
disciples said to Him when He ceased &quot;Lord, teach us to pray even as John
also taught his disciples.&quot;
<p>
For is it conceivable that a man who had been brought up under instruction in
the law and hearing of the words of the prophets and was no stranger to the
synagogue had no knowledge whatsoever of prayer until he saw the Lord praying in
a certain place? It is absurd to pretend that he was one who did pray after the
Jewish practice but saw that he needed fuller knowledge as to the place in
reference to prayer. What was it, too, in reference to prayer that John used to
teach the disciples who came to him for baptism from Jerusalem and all Judea and
the country round about, but certain things of which, as one who was greater
than a prophet, he had vision in reference to prayer, which I believe he would
not deliver to all who were baptized but privately to those who were disciples
with a view to baptism?
<p>
Such are the prayers, which are really spiritual because the spirit was praying
in the heart of the saints, recorded in scripture, and they are full of
unutterably wonderful declarations. In the first book of Kings there is the
prayer of Hannah, partially, because the whole of it was not committed to
writing since she was 'speaking in her heart' when she perservered in prayer
before the Lord; and in Psalms, the seventeenth psalm is entitled &quot;A prayer
of David,&quot; and the ninetieth &quot;A prayer of Moses, man of God,&quot; and
the hundred and second &quot;A prayer of a poor man at a time he is weary and
pours forth his supplication before the Lord.&quot;
<p>
These are prayers which, because truly prayers made and spoken with the spirit,
are also full of the declarations of the wisdom of God, so that one may say of
the truths they proclaim &quot;Who is wise that he shall understand them? And
understanding, then he shall fully know them.&quot; Since therefore it is so
great an undertaking to write about prayer, in order to think and speak worthily
of so great a subject, we need the special illumination of the Father, and the
teaching of the first born Word himself, and the inward working of the Spirit, I
pray as a man&mdash;for I by no means attribute to myself any capacity for
prayer&mdash;that I may obtain the Spirit of prayer before I discourse upon it, and
I entreat that a discourse full and spiritual may be granted to us and that the
prayers recorded in the Gospels may be elucidated.
<p>
So let us now begin our discourse on Prayer.
<b>
<p align="left">
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C2"></A>II.</SPAN>&nbsp;SCRIPTURAL USES OF THE GENERAL WORDS FOR PRAYER</b>
<p>
So far as I have observed, the first instance of the term prayer that I find is
when Jacob, a fugitive from his brother Esau's wrath, was on his way to
Mesopotamia at the suggestion of Isaac and Rebecca. The passage runs: And Jacob
vowed a vow (prayed a prayer), saying&mdash;If the Lord God will be with me, and
guard me in this way that I am going, and give me bread to eat and raiment to
put on, and bring me back in safety to my father's house, then shall the Lord be
my God and this stone which I have set up as a pillar shall be for me God's
house, and of all that you will give me I will give you tithe.
<p>
It should also to be remarked that the term prayer is in many places is
different from prayer as we speak of it&mdash;as when applied in the case of one who
professes that he will do certain things in exchange for obtaining certain other
things from God. The expression prayer is, however, employed in our usual sense
[in early texts]. Thus in Exodus after the scourge of frogs, the second in order
of the ten, &quot;Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said to them: Pray unto
the Lord for me that He withdraw the frogs from me and from my people; and I
will send the people forth that they may sacrifice to the Lord.&quot;
<p>
And if, because Pharaoh's word is aw-thar' anyone should be sceptical as to aw-thar'
meaning here prayer as well as vow, he should observe what follows: &quot;Moses
said to Pharaoh, 'Kindly tell me when I am to pray (aw-thar') for you and for
your officials and for your people, that the frogs may be removed from you and
your houses and be left only in the Nile.'&quot; In the case of the fleas, the
third scourge, I have observed that neither does Pharaoh entreat that prayer be
made nor does Moses pray. In the case of the flies, the fourth, he says: Pray
therefore unto the Lord for me.
<p>
Then Moses also said: I will go out from you and pray unto God and the flies
shall go away from Pharaoh and his servants and his people tomorrow. And shortly
after: So Moses went out from Pharaoh and prayed unto God. Again in the case of
the fifth and the sixth scourge neither did Pharaoh entreat that prayer should
be made nor did Moses pray, but in the case of the seventh Pharaoh sent and
called for Moses and Aaron and said to them: I have sinned this time; the Lord
is righteous, I and my people are impious. Therefore pray unto the Lord that
there be an end of thunder and hail and fire. And shortly after: Moses went out
from Pharaoh outside the city, and stretched forth his hands unto the Lord and
there was an end to the thunder. Why is it not as in the foregoing cases?
<p>
And he prayed, but he stretched forth his hands unto the Lord. That is a
question to be considered more conveniently elsewhere. In the case of the eighth
scourge, however, Pharaoh says . . . and pray (aw-thar') to the LORD your God
that at the least he remove this deadly thing from me.&quot; So Moses went out
from Pharaoh and prayed (aw-thar') unto God. We said that the term prayer (aw-thar')
is, as in Jacob's case, in many places employed in a sense other than the
customary. In Leviticus for instance: The Lord spoke to Moses saying: Speak to
the children of Israel; and you shall say unto them:
<p>
Whoever vows (naw-dar') a vow (neh'-der), setting a price upon his soul to the
Lord, his price, if a male from twenty to sixty years, shall be fifty didrachims
of silver, sanctuary standard. And in Numbers: And the Lord spoke to Moses
saying: Speak to the Children of Israel; and you shall say unto them: Man or
woman, whoever vows (naw-dar') a great vow of consecration to the Lord, shall be
consecrate from wine and strong drink&mdash;and so on of the so-called Nazarite;
then, shortly after: and shall hallow his head in that day in which he was
hallowed to the Lord for the days of the vow.
<p>
And again shortly after: This is the law for him that has vowed when he shall
have fulfilled the days of his vow . . . ; and again shortly after: And after
that, he that has vowed will drink wine. This is the law for him that has vowed,
whoever has vowed his votive gift to the Lord, apart from what his hand may find
by virtue of his vow which he has vowed according to the law of consecration.
And towards the end of Numbers: And Moses spoke to the rulers of the tribes of
the Children of Israel saying, This is the thing which the Lord has decreed: A
man who has vowed a vow to the Lord or sworn an oath or entered a bond, on his
soul shall not desecrate his word: all that has gone out of his mouth shall he
do.
<p>
And if a woman has vowed a vow to the Lord or entered a bond in the house of her
father in her youth, and her father has heard her vows and her bonds that she
entered into against her soul, and her father has let them pass in silence, all
her vows shall stand, and her bonds that she entered into against her soul shall
remain: after which he lays down sundry other laws for such a woman. In this
sense it is written in Proverbs: [I have a peace offering: today I pay my vows;
and a foolish son is a father's shame: unhallowed are vows from a harlot's hire;
and] it is a snare to a man to hallow hastily anything of his own: for after
vowing comes repenting.
<p>
And in Ecclesiastes: Better not vow than vow without paying; and in the Acts of
the Apostles: There are among us four men of their own accord under a vow. I
thought it not out of place first to distinguish the meaning of prayer (aw-thar')
in its two senses, and similarly of prayer (neh'-der), for the latter turn in
addition to its common and customary general usage, is also employed, in the
sense which we are accustomed to attach to vow in what is told of Hannah in the
first book of Samuel: Now Eli the priest was sitting on a seat at the doorway of
the temple of the Lord.
<p>
And she was in bitterness of soul and prayed (paw-lal') unto the Lord and wept
sore. And she vowed (naw-dar') a vow (neh'-der) and said: O Lord of hosts, if
you will indeed look on the humiliation of your bondwoman and remember me and
forget not your bondwoman and will give to your bondwoman male seed, then will I
give him in gift to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come
upon his head. And yet in this instance, one may, not without plausibility, with
special regard to the words &quot;she prayed (paw-lal') unto the Lord,&quot;
&quot;and she vowed a vow,&quot; Ask whether, as she has done both of two
things, that is &quot;prayed unto the Lord&quot; &quot;and vowed a vow,&quot;
the word prayed ( paw-lal') on the one hand is not employed in our customary
signification of prayer (aw-thar'), and &quot;vowed a vow&quot; on the other
hand in the sense in which it is employed in Leviticus and Numbers.
<p>
For &quot;I will give him in gift to the Lord all the days of his life, and no
razor shall come upon his head&quot; is strictly not a prayer but such a vow as
Jephthah also vowed in the passage; and Jephthah vowed a vow to the Lord and
said: If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand, then it
shall be that whoever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me on my return
in peace from the Children of Ammon shall be the Lord's and I will offer him up
as a burnt offering.
<b>
<p align="left">
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C3"></A>III.</SPAN>&nbsp;OBJECTIONS TO PRAYER</b>
<p>
If then I must next, as you have urged, set forth in the first place the
arguments of those who told that nothing is accomplished as a result of prayers
and therefore allege that prayer is superfluous, I shall not hesitate to do that
also according to my ability&mdash;the term prayer being now used in its more common
and general sense. In such disrepute indeed is the view and to such a degree has
it failed to obtain champions of distinction that, among those who admit a
Providence and set a God over the universe, not a soul can be found who does not
believe in prayer.
<p>
The opinion (sentiment) belongs either to utter atheists who deny the existence
of God, or assume a God, as far as the name goes, but deprive Him of providence.
Already, it must be said, the adverse inworking, with intent to wrap the most
impious of opinions around the name of Christ and around the teaching of the Son
of God, has made some converts on the needlessness of prayer&mdash;a sentiment which
find champions in those who by every means do away with outward forms, eschewing
baptism and eucharist alike, misrepresenting the Scriptures as not actually
meaning this that we call prayer but as teaching something quite different from
it.
<p>
Those who reject prayers, while, that is to say, setting a God over the universe
and affirming Providence&mdash;for it is not my present task to consider the
statements of those who by every means do away with a God or Providence&mdash;might
reason as follows: God knows all things before they come to be. There is nothing
that upon its entrance into existence is then first known by Him as previously
unknown. What need to send up prayer to One who, even before we pray, knows what
things we have need of? For the heavenly Father knows what things we have need
of before we ask Him.
<p>
It is reasonable to believe that as Father and Artificer of the universe who
loves all things that are and abhors nothing that He has made, quite apart from
prayer He safely manages the affairs of each like a father who champions his
infant children without awaiting their entreaty when they are either utterly
incapable of asking or through ignorance often desirous of getting the opposite
of what is to their profit and advantage. We men come further short of God even
than the merest children of the intelligence of their parents. And in all
likelihood the things that are to be are not only foreknown but prearranged by
God, and nothing takes place contrary to His prearrangement. Were anyone to pray
for sunrise he would be thought a simpleton for entreating through prayer for
the occurrence of what was to take place quite apart from his prayer: In like
manner a man would be a fool to believe that his prayer was responsible for the
occurrence of what was to take place in any case even had he never prayed.
<p>
And again, as it is the height of madness to imagine that, because one suffers
discomfort and fever under the sun at Summer Solstice, the Sun is through prayer
to be transferred to the Springtime Zodiac, in order that one may have the
benefit of temperate air, so it would be the height of infatuation to imagine
that by reason of prayer one would not experience the misfortunes that meet the
race of men by necessity. Moreover, if it be true that sinners are estranged
from birth and the righteous man has been set apart from his mother's womb, and
if, while as yet they are unborn and have done neither good nor evil, it is said
the elder shall serve the younger, that the elective purpose of God may stand
based not on works but on the Caller, it is in vain that we entreat for
forgiveness of sins or to receive a spirit of strength to the end that, Christ
empowering us, we may have strength for all things.
<p>
If we are sinners, we are estranged from birth: if on the other hand we were set
apart from our mother's womb, the best of things will come our way even though
we do not pray. It is prophesied before his birth that Jacob shall be over Esau
and that his brother shall serve him: what has prayer to do with that? Of what
impiety is Esau guilty that he is hated before his birth? To what purpose does
Moses pray, as is found in the ninetieth psalm, if God is his refuge since
before the mountains were settled and the earth and world were formed. Besides,
of all that are to be saved, it is recorded in the Epistle to Ephesians that the
Father elected them in Him, in Christ, before the world's foundation, that they
should be holy and blameless before Him, preordaining them unto adoption as His
sons through Christ.
<p>
Either, therefore, a man is elect, of the number of those who are so since
before the world's foundation, and can by no means fall from his election in
which case he has therefore no need of prayer; or he is not elect nor yet
preordained, in which case he prays in vain, since, though he should pray ten
thousand times, he will not be listened to. For whom God foreknew, them He also
preordained to conformity with the image of His Son's glory; and whom He
preordained, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also justified;
and whom He justified, them He also glorified.
<p>
Why is Josiah distressed, or why has he anxiety as to whether or not he will be
listened to in prayer, when, many generations before, he was prophesied by name
and his future action not only foreknown but foretold in the hearing of many. To
what purpose, too, does Judas pray with the result that even his prayer turned
to sin, when from David's times it is pre-announced that he will lose his
overseership, another receiving it in his stead.
<p>
It is self-evidently absurd, God being unchangeable and having pre-comprehended
all things and adhering to His prearrangements, to pray in the belief that
through prayer one will change His purpose, or, as though He had not already
prearranged but awaited each individual's prayer, to make intercession that He
may arrange what suits the supplicant by reason of his prayer, there and then
appointing what He approves as reasonable though He has previously not
contemplated it. At this point the propositions you formulated in your letter to
me may be set down word for word thus: Firstly, if God is foreknower of the
future and it must come to pass, prayer is vain. Secondly, if all things come to
pass by virtue of God's will, and His decrees are fixed, and nothing that He
wills can be changed, prayer is vain. Towards a solution of the difficulties
which benumb the instinct of prayer, the following, as I believe, helpful
considerations may be advanced.
<b>
<p align="left">
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C4"></A>IV.</SPAN>&nbsp;ANSWER TO OBJECTIONS: MAN'S FREEWILL AND GOD'S FOREKNOWLEDGE</b>
<p>
Of objects that move, some have the cause of motion outside them. Such are
objects which are lifeless and in passive motion simply by force of condition,
and those which are moved by force of nature and of life in the same manner and
not like things which move occasionally, for stones and stocks that have been
quarried or cut off from growth, being in passive motion simply by force of
condition, have the cause of motion outside them.
<p>
Such too are dead bodies of animals and movable parts of plants, which change
position under compulsion and not as animals and plants themselves change their
position but in the same manner as stones and stocks cut off from
growth&mdash;although even these may be said to move in respect that, all bodies in
decay being in flux, they possess the motion inherently attendant upon decay.
Besides these a second class of moving objects are those which move by force of
their internal nature or life, which are said by those who use terms in their
stricter sense to move of themselves.
<p>
A third kind of movement is that in animals, which is termed spontaneous
movement, whereas, in my opinion, the movement of rational beings is independent
movement. If we withdraw from an animal spontaneous movement, it cannot be any
longer conceived as even an animal; it will be like either a plant moving by
mere force of nature or a stone borne along by some force external to it:
Whenever an object follows its own peculiar movement, since that is what we have
termed independent movement, it must needs be rational. Thinkers therefore who
will have it that nothing is in our power, will necessarily assent to a most
foolish statement, firstly that we are not animals, and secondly that neither
are we rational beings, but that, what we are believed to do, we may be said to
do by force as it were of some external cause of motion and in no sense moving
ourselves.
<p>
Let anyone, moreover, with special regard to his own feelings, see whether
without shame he can deny that it is himself that wills, eats, walks, gives
assent to and accepts certain opinions, dissents from others as false. There are
certain opinions to which a man cannot possibly assent though he puts them with
innumerable refinements of argument and with plausible reasoning: and similarly
it is impossible to assent to any view of human affairs in which our free will
is in no sense preserved.
<p>
Who assents to the view that nothing is comprehensible, or lives as in complete
suspense of judgement: Who that has received a sense perception of a domestic
misdeed, forebears to reprove the servant? And who is there that does not
censure a son who fails to pay the duty owed to parents, or does not blame and
find fault with an adulteress as having committed a shameful act? Truth forces
and compels us, in spite of innumerable refinements, to impulsive praise and
blame, on the basis of our retention of free will with the responsibility in
which it involves us.
<p>
If our free will is in truth preserved with innumerable inclinations towards
virtue or vice, towards either duty or its opposite, its future must like other
things have been known by God, before coming to pass, from the world's creation
and foundation; and in all things prearranged by God in accordance with what He
has seen of each act of our free wills. He has with due regard to each movement
of our free wills prearranged what also is at once to occur in His providence
and to take place according to the train of future events. God's foreknowledge
is not the cause of all future events including those that are to have their
efficient cause in our freewill guided by impulse.
<p>
Even though we should suppose God ignorant of the future, we shall not on that
account be incapacitated for effecting this and willing that. Rather it ensues
from His foreknowledge that our individual free wills receive adjustment to suit
the universal arrangement needful for the constitution of the world. If,
therefore, our individual free wills have been known by Him, and if in His
providence He has on that account been careful to make due arrangement for each
one, it is reasonable to believe that He has also pre-comprehended what a
particular man is to pray in that faith, what his disposition, and what his
desire.
<p>
That being so, in His arrangement it will accordingly have been ordained
somewhat after this wise: This man I will hear for the sake of the prayer that
he will pray, because he will pray wisely: but that man I will not hear, either
because he will be unworthy of being heard, or because his prayer will be for
things neither profitable for the suppliant to receive nor becoming me to
bestow: and in the case of this prayer, of some particular person, let us say, I
will not hear him, but in the case of that I will.
<p>
Should the fact of God's unerring foreknowledge of the future disquiet anyone by
suggesting that things have been necessarily determined, we must tell him that
it is a real part of God's fixed knowledge that a particular man will not with
any fixed certainty choose the better or so desire the worse as to become
incapable of a change for his good. And again I will do this for this man when
he prays, as becomes me seeing that he will pray without reproach and will not
be negligent in prayer: upon that man who will pray for a certain amount, I will
bestow this abundantly in excess of his asking or thinking, for it becomes me to
surpass him in well doing and to furnish more than he has been capable of
asking.
<p>
To this other man of a particular character I will send this angel as minister,
to cooperate from a certain time in his salvation and to be with him for a
certain period: to that other, who will be a better man than he, that angel of
higher rank than his. From this man who, after having devoted himself to the
higher views will gradually relax and fall back upon the more material, I will
withdraw this superior cooperator, upon whose withdrawal that duly inferior
power, having found an opportunity to get at his slackness, will set upon him
and when he has given himself up in readiness to sin, will incite him to these
particular sins. So we may imagine the Prearranger of All saying:
<p>
Amos will beget Josiah, who will not emulate his father's faults but will find
his way leading on to virtue, and will by aid of these companions be noble and
good, so that he will tear down the evilly erected altar of Jeroboam. I also
know that Judas, in the sojourn of my son among the race of men, will at the
first be noble and good but later turn aside and fall away to human sins so that
he will rightly suffer thus for them. This foreknowledge, it may be in regard to
all things, certainly in regard to Judas and other mysteries, exists in the Son
of God also, who in His discernment of the evolution of the future has seen
Judas and the sins to be committed by him, so that, even before Judas came into
existence, He in His comprehension has said through David the words beginning
&quot;O God, keep you not silence at my praise.&quot;&mdash;Knowing as I do the
future and what an influence Paul will have in the cause of religion, ere yet I
set me to begin creation and found the world I will make choice of him: I will
commit him from the moment of his birth to these powers that cooperate in men's
salvation.
<p>
I will set him apart from his mother's womb. I will permit him at the first to
fall in youth into an ignorant zeal and in the avowed cause of religion to
persecute believers in my Christ and to keep the garments of them that stone my
servant and witness Stephen, so that later at the close of his youthful
wilfulness he may be given a fresh start and change for the best and yet not
boast before me but may say: &quot;I am not fit to be called an apostle, because
I persecuted the church of God,&quot; and realizing the kindness that he will
receive from me after his faults committed in youth in the avowed cause of
religion may declare &quot;It is by God's grace that I am what I am&quot;; and,
being restrained by conscience by reason of the deeds he wrought while still
young against Christ, he will not be excessively elated by the exceeding
abundance of the revelations which in kindness I shall show him.
<p>
To the objection in reference to prayer for the rising of the Sun we may reply
as follows. The Sun also possesses a certain free will, since he with the moon
joins in praising God, for &quot;Praise Him, Sun and Moon&quot; it says: as also
manifestly the moon and all the stars conformably, for it says &quot;Praise Him
all the stars and light.&quot; As, therefore, we have said that God has employed
the free will of individual beings on earth for the service of beings on earth
in arranging them aright, so we may suppose that He has employed the free will,
fixed and certain and steadfast and wise as it is, of sun, moon and stars in
arranging the whole world of heaven with the course and movement of the stars in
harmony with the whole.
<p>
If I do not pray in vain for what concerns any other freewill, much more shall I
pray for what concerns the freewill of the stars which tread in heaven their
world-conserving measures. It may indeed be said of beings on earth that certain
appearances in our surroundings call out now our instability, now our better
inclination to act or speak in certain ways: but in the case of beings in heaven
what appearances can interpose to oust and remove from the course that benefit
the world beings which have each a life so adjusted by Reason independently of
them, and which enjoy so ethereal and supremely pure a frame?

<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C5"></A>V.</SPAN>&nbsp;ANSWER TO OBJECTIONS: CONDITIONS NECESSARY TO PRAYER</b>
<p>
With a view to impel men to pray and to turn them from neglect of prayer, we may
not unreasonably further use an illustration such as this. Just as, apart from
woman and apart from recourse to the function requisite for procreation, man
cannot procreate, so one may not obtain certain things without prayer in a
certain manner, with a certain disposition, with a certain faith, after a
certain antecedent mode of life. Thus we are not to babble or ask for little
things or pray for earthly things or enter upon prayer with anger and with
thoughts disturbed.
<p>
Nor again is it possible to think of giving oneself to prayer apart from
purification. Nor again is forgiveness of sins possible to the supplicant unless
from the heart he forgives his brother who has done wrong and entreats him to
obtain his pardon. That benefit accrues to him who prays rightly or according to
his ability strives to do so, follows, I consider, in many ways: It is, first of
all, surely in every sense a spiritual advantage to him who is intent upon
prayer, in the very composure of prayer to present himself to God and in His
presence to speak to Him with a vivid sense that he looks on and is present. For
just as certain mental images and particular recollections connected with the
objects recollected may sully the thoughts suggested by certain other images, in
the same way we may believe that it is advantageous to remember God as the
object of our faith&mdash;the One who discerns the movements within the inner
sanctuary of the soul as it disposes itself to please the Examiner of Hearts and
Inquisitor of Reins as One who is present and beholds and penetrates into every
mind.
<p>
Even though further benefit than this be supposed to accrue to him who has
composed his thoughts for prayer, no ordinary gain is to be conceived as gotten
by one who has devoutly disposed himself in the season of prayer. When this is
regularly practiced, how many sins it keeps us from, and how many achievements
it brings us to, is known only to those who have given themselves up with some
degree of constancy to prayer.
<p>
For if the recollection and recontemplation of a man who has found fame and
benefit in wisdom incites us to evaluate him and sometimes restrains our lower
impulses, how much more does the recollection of God the Father of All, along
with prayer to Him, become advantageous to those who are persuaded that they
stand before and speak to a present and hearing God!
<p>
What I have said may be established from the divine scriptures in the following
way. He who prays must lift up holy hands, forgiving everyone who has wronged
him, with the passion of anger banished from his soul and in wrath with none.
And again, to prevent his mind from being made turbid by irrelevant thoughts, he
must while at prayer forget for the time everything outside prayer&mdash;surely a
state of supreme blessedness! As Paul teaches in the first Epistle to Timothy
when he says: &quot;I desire therefore that men pray in every place lifting up
holy hands without anger and disputations. And further, a woman ought, most of
all at prayer, to preserve simplicity and decency in soul and body, above all
and especially while she prays reverencing God and expelling from her intellect
every wanton womanish recollection, arrayed not in chaplets and gold or pearls
or costly raiment, but in the things in which it becomes a woman of pious
profession to be arrayed, (and I marvel that anyone should hesitate, were it on
the strength of such a condition alone, to pronounce her blessed who has thus
presented herself for prayer) as Paul has taught in the same Epistle when he
says, &quot;in like manner that women array themselves decently in simplicity
with modesty and discretion, not in chaplets and gold or pearls or costly
raiment, but, as becomes woman of pious profession, through good works.&quot;
(1Tim.2:9)
<p>
And besides, the prophet David speaks of much else that the saint possesses in
prayer. We may, not irreverently, cite these passages as showing that, even if
this alone be considered, the attitude and preparation for prayer of one who has
offered himself to God is of the highest benefit. He says: &quot;Unto you have I
lifted mine eyes, who dwellest in heaven and unto you have I lifted my soul, O
God.&quot; For when the eyes of thought are lifted up from dwelling on earthly
things and being filled with the imagination of material objects, and are
elevated to such a height as to look beyond begotten things and to be engaged
solely in contemplation of God and in solemn converse with Him becoming to the
Hearer.
<p>
Surely those eyes themselves have already got the highest advantage in
reflecting the glory of the Lord with face unveiled and being transformed into
the same image from glory to glory, for they then partake of a certain divine
perception shown by the words: &quot;the light of your face, O Lord, hath been
signalized upon us.&quot; (Ps.4:6) And indeed the soul being lifted up, and
parting from body to follow spirit, and not only following the spirit but also
merging in it, as is shown by the words &quot;Unto you have I lifted my
soul,&quot; is surely already putting off its existence as soul and becoming
spiritual. And if forgiveness is a very high accomplishment, so high as
according to the prophet Jeremiah to embrace a summary of the whole law, for he
says, &quot;I laid not those commands upon your fathers as they were gone forth
from Egypt, but this command I laid:
<p>
Let each man not be unforgiving to his neighbor in his heart,&quot; and if in
entering upon prayer with unforgiveness left behind us we keep the Savior's
command, &quot;If you're standing at prayer forgive aught that you have against
any man.&quot; (Mk.11:25) It is plain that those who stand in that temper to
pray have already received the best of possessions.
<b>
<p align="left">
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C6"></A>VI.</SPAN>&nbsp;ANSWER TO OBJECTIONS: HE WHO PRAYS PRAYS NOT ALONE</b>
<p>
So far, I have said that, even on the supposition that nothing else is going to
follow our prayer, we receive the best of gains when we have come to perceive
the right way to pray and when we achieve it. But it is certain that he who thus
prays, having previously cast aside all discontent with Providence, will, if
intent to mark the inworking of the Hearer, in the very act hear the response
&quot;Here am I.&quot;
<p>
The above condition is expressed in the words &quot;If you withdraw your bonds
and protests and murmuring utterance,&quot; for he that is content with what
comes to pass becomes free from every bond, and does not protest against God for
ordaining what He wills for our discipline, and does not even in the secrecy of
his thoughts murmur inaudibly; for they who murmur thus, not daring to abuse
Providence roundly for what occurs with voice and soul but desiring as it were
to escape the observation even of the Lord of All in their discontent, are like
bad domestics who rail, but not openly, against their masters' orders.
<p>
And I think the same thing is meant in the passage in Job: &quot;In all these
ocurrences Job sinned not with his lips in the sight of God&quot;; and it is
just this that the saying in Deuteronomy enjoins must not happen, when it says:
&quot;Take heed lest a secret utterance be ever in your heart to break the law,
saying the seventh year draws nigh&quot; and so on. So then he who prays thus,
becomes, as already so greatly benefited, more fit to mingle with the Spirit of
the Lord that fills the whole world and fills all the earth and the heaven and
says by the prophet: &quot;'Do not I fill the heaven and the earth?' says the
Lord.&quot;
<p>
And further, through the afore mentioned purification as well as through prayer,
he will enjoy the good office of the Word of God, who is standing in the midst
even of those who do not know Him and who fails the prayer of none, to pray to
the Father along with Him for whom He mediates. For the Son of God is high
priest of our offerings and our pleader with the Father. He prays for those who
pray, and pleads along with those who plead. He will not, however, consent to
pray, as for his intimates, on behalf of those who do not with some constancy
pray through Him, nor will he be Pleader with the Father, as for men already His
own, on behalf of those who do not obey His teaching to the effect that they
ought at all times to pray and not lose heart.
<p>
For it says, &quot;He spoke a parable to the end that they ought at all times to
pray and not lose heart. 'There was a certain judge in a certain city,'&quot;
and so on; and earlier he said unto them, &quot;Who of you shall have a friend,
and shall go unto him at midnight and shall say to him:
<p>
Friend, lend me three loaves since a friend of mine has come to me after a
journey and I have naught to set before him&quot;; and a little later, &quot;I
tell you, even though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, he
will yet because of his being unabashed get up and give him as many as he
wants.&quot; And who that believes the guileless lips of Jesus can but be
stirred to unhesitating prayer when He says, &quot;Ask and it shall be given you
for everyone that asks receives,&quot; since the kind Father gives to those who
have received the spirit of adoption from the Father, the living bread when we
ask Him, not the stone which the adversary would have become food for Jesus and
His disciples, and since The Father gives the good gift in rain from heaven to
those that ask him.
<p>
But these pray along with those who genuinely pray&mdash;not only the high priest
but also the angels who &quot;rejoice in heaven over one repenting sinner more
than over ninety-nine righteous that need not repentance,&quot; and also the
souls of the saints already at rest. Two instances make this plain. The first is
where Raphael offers their service to God for Tobit and Sarah. After both had
prayed, the scripture says, &quot;The prayer of both was heard before the
presence of the great Raphael and he was sent to heal them both,&quot; and
Raphael himself, when explaining his angelic commission at God's command to help
them, says:
<p>
&quot;Even now when you prayed, and Sarah your daughter-in-law, I brought the
memorial of your prayer before the Holy One,&quot; and shortly after, &quot;I am
Raphael, one of the Seven angels who present the prayers of saints and enter in
before the glory of the Holy One. Thus, according to Raphael's account at least,
prayer with fasting and almsgiving and righteousness is a good thing.
<p>
The second instance is in the Books of the Maccabees where Jeremiah appears in
exceeding &quot;white haired glory&quot; so that a wondrous and most majestic
authority was about him, and stretches forth his right hand and delivers to
Judas a golden sword, and there witnesses to him another saint already at rest
saying, &quot;This is he who prays much for the people and the sacred city,
God's prophet Jeremiah.&quot; For it is absurd when knowledge, though manifested
to the worthy through a mirror and in a riddle for the present, is then revealed
face to face not to think that the like is true of all other excellences as
well, that they who prepare in this life beforehand are made strictly perfect
then.
<p>
Now one of these excellences in the strictest sense according to the divine word
is love for one's neighbor, and this accordingly we are compelled to think of as
possessed in a far higher degree by saints already at rest than by those who are
in human weakness and wrestle on along with the weaker. It is not only here that
&quot;if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it and if one member is
glorified, all the members rejoice with it&quot; in the experience of those who
love their brethren, for it beseems the love also of those who are beyond the
present life to say &quot;I have anxiety for all the churches:
<p>
Who is weak and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble and I do not burn?&quot;
Especially when Christ avows that according as such one of the saints may be
weak, He is weak in like manner, and in prison and naked and a stranger and
hungry and athirst. For who that reads the gospel is ignorant that Christ, in
taking on himself whatever befalls believers, counts their sufferings His own?
<p>
And if angels of God came to Jesus and ministered to Him, and if we are not to
think of the ministry of the angels to Jesus as having been limited to the brief
space of His bodily sojourn among men while He was still in the midst of
believers not as one that reclined at table but as one that ministered, how many
angels, I wonder, must now be ministering to Jesus when He would &quot;bring
together the Children of Israel one by one&quot; and gather them from the
dispersion, saving those who fear God and call upon Him, and must be cooperating
more than the apostles in the increase and enlargement of the church! Thus in
John certain angels are spoken of in the Apocalypse as actually presiding over
the churches.
<p>
Not in vain do angels of God ascend and descend unto the Son of Man, beheld of
eyes that have been enlightened with the light of knowledge. In the very season
of prayer, accordingly, being reminded by the suppliant of his needs, they
satisfy them as they have ability by virtue of their general commission. To
further the acceptance of our view we may make use of some such image as the
following in support of this argument.
<p>
Suppose that a righteously minded physician is at the side of a sick man praying
for health, with knowledge of the right mode of treatment for the disease about
which the man is offering prayer. It is manifest that he will be moved to heal
the suppliant, surmising, it may well be not idly, that God has had this very
action in mind in answer to the prayer of the suppliant for release from the
disease. Or suppose that a man of considerable means, who is generous, hears the
prayer of a poor man offering intercession to God for his wants. It is plain
that he, too, will fulfil the objects of the poor man's prayer, becoming a
minister of the fatherly counsel of Him who at the season of the prayer had
brought together him who was to pray and him who was able to supply and by
virtue of the rightness of his principles, incapable of overlooking one who has
made that particular request.
<p>
As therefore we are not to believe that these events are fortuitous, when they
take place because He who has numbered all the hairs of the head of saints, has
aptly brought together at the season of the prayer the hearer who is to be
minister of His benefaction to the suppliant and the man who has made his
request in faith; so we may surmise that the presence of the angels who exercise
oversight and ministry for God is sometimes brought into conjunction with a
particular suppliant in order that they may join in breathing his petitions.
<p>
Nay more, beholding ever the face of the Father in heaven and looking on the
Godhead of our Creator, the angel of each man, even of &quot;little ones&quot;
within the church, both prays with us, and acts with us where possible, for the
objects of our prayer.
<b>
<p>
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C7"></A>VII.</SPAN>&nbsp;ANSWER TO OBJECTIONS: THE TRUE
PLACE OF PRAYER IN MAN'S LIFE</b>
<p>
Again I believe the words of the prayer of the saints to be full of power above
all when praying &quot;with the spirit,&quot; they pray &quot;also with the
understanding,&quot; which is like a light rising from the suppliant's mind and
proceeding from his lips to gradually weaken by the power of God the mental
venom injected by the adverse powers into the intellect of such as neglect
prayer and fail to keep that saying of Paul's in accordance with the
exhortations of Jesus, &quot;Pray without ceasing.&quot; For it is as if a dart
from the suppliant's soul, sped by knowledge and reason or by faith, proceeds
from the saint and wounds to their destruction and dissolution the spirits
adverse to God and desirous of casting round us the bonds of sin.
<p>
Now, since the performance of actions enjoined by virtue or by the commandments
is also a constituent part of prayer, he prays without ceasing who combines
prayer with right actions, and becoming actions with prayer. For the saying
&quot;pray without ceasing&quot; can only be accepted by us as a possibility if
we may speak of the whole life of a saint as one great continuous prayer.
<p>
Of such prayer what is usually termed prayer is indeed a part, and ought to be
performed at least three times each day, as is plain from the account of Daniel
who, in spite of the grave danger that impended, prayed three times daily. Peter
furnishes an instance of the middle prayer of the three when he goes up to the
housetop about the sixth hour to pray on that occasion on which he also saw the
vessel which descended from heaven let down by four corners. The first is spoken
of by David: &quot;In the morning shall you hear my prayer: in the morning will
I present myself to you and keep watch.&quot;
<p>
The last is indicated in the words: &quot;the lifting up of my hands in evening
sacrifice.&quot; Indeed we shall not rightly speak even the season of night
without such prayer as David refers to when he says &quot;at midnight I arose to
make acknowledgment to you for your righteous judgments&quot; and as Paul
exemplifies when, as it is said in the Acts of the Apostles, along with Silas he
offers prayer and praise to God &quot;about midnight&quot; in Phillipi so that
the prisoners also heard them.
<b>
<p align="left">
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C8"></A>VIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;ANSWER TO OBJECTIONS: SIGNAL INSTANCES OF PRAYER</b>
<p>
If Jesus prays and does not pray in vain, if He obtains His requests through
prayer and it may be would not have received them without prayer, who of us is
to neglect prayer? Mark tells us that &quot;in the morning long before daybreak
he arose and went out and departed to a lonely place and there prayed.&quot;
Luke says: &quot;And it came to pass, as He was at prayer in a certain place,
that one of His disciples said to Him when He ceased, . . . and elsewhere: And
He passed the night in prayer to God.&quot; John records a prayer of Him in the
words:
<p>
&quot;These things spoke Jesus, and lifting up His eyes unto heaven He said, 'Father the hour is come; glorify your Son that your Son may also glorify
you.'&quot; And the Lord's saying, &quot;I knew that you hear me always,&quot;
recorded in the same writer shows that it is because He is always praying that
He is always heard.
<p>
What need is there to tell the tale of those who, through right prayer, have
obtained the greatest of things from God, when it is open to everyone to select
any number of them for himself from the Scriptures? Hannah did service to the
birth of Samuel, who is numbered along with Moses, because though barren she
prayed in faith unto the Lord. Hezekiah, who while still childless learned from
Isaiah that he was about to die, is included in the Savior's genealogy because
he prayed. When the people were already on the point of perishing under a single
decree as the result of Haman's conspiracy, it was the heard prayer with fasting
of Mordecai and Esther that added to the Mosaic festivals and gave rise to the
Mordecaic day of rejoicing for the people.
<p>
It was, moreover, after offering holy prayer that Judith with God's help
overcame Holophernes, and thus a single woman of the Hebrews wrought shame upon
the house of Nebuchadnezzar. It was on being heard that Ananiah and Azariah and
Mishael became worthy to receive a hissing rain and wind which kept the flame of
the fire from taking effect. Through Daniel's prayers the lions in the
Babylonians' pit were muzzled.
<p>
Even Jonah, because he did not despair of being heard from the belly of the
monster that had swallowed him, was able to quit the monster's belly and
complete his interrupted prophet's mission to the Ninevites. And further, how
many things could each of us recount should he choose to recall with gratitude
the benefits conferred upon him and to offer praise to God for them! Souls that
have long been barren but have become conscious of their intellects' sterility
and the barrenness of their mind, through persevering prayer have conceived of
the Holy Spirit and given birth to thoughts and words of salvation full of
contemplated truth.
<p>
How many of our foes have been dispersed, when often countless thousands in the
adverse host were wearing us down with intent to sweep us away from the divine
faith, and we rejoiced, when their appeal was to chariots and horses but ours to
the name of the Lord, to see that in truth deceptive is a horse for safety! Many
a time indeed does he whose trust is in praise to God&mdash;for Judith means
praise&mdash;cut his way through guileful and persuasive speech, that chief
commander of the adversary who brings numbers even of reputed believers to their
knees.
<p>
What need is there to go on to tell of all who many a time have fallen among
temptations hard to overcome, whose burn was sharper than any flame, and have
suffered naught under them but emerged from them in every way unscathed, without
so much of scathe as the slightest odor of the hostile fire; or again of all the
brutes exasperated against us, in the form of wicked spirits or cruel men, that
we have encountered and often muzzled by our prayers, so that they were impotent
to fasten their fangs in our members which had become those of Christ. Often in
each saint's experience has the Lord dashed together the teeth of lions, and
they were brought to nothing, as water flowing by.
<p>
We know that often fugitives from God's commands who have been swallowed by
death, which at the first prevailed against them, have been saved by reason of
repentance from so great an evil, because they did not despair of being able to
be saved though already overpowered in the belly of death: for death prevailed
and swallowed, and again God took away every tear from every face. What I have
said after my enumeration of persons who have been benefited through prayer, I
consider to have been most necessary to my purpose of turning aspirants after
the spiritual life in Christ from prayer for little earthly things, and urging
readers of this writing towards the mystical things of which the above mentioned
were types.
<p>
For it is always and wholly prayer for the spiritual, mystical things which we
have instanced, that is practised by him who does not war according to the flesh
but with the Spirit mortifies the body's actions, preference being given to the
things suggested by analogy and study over the benefaction apparently indicated
by the language of scripture as having accrued to those who had prayed.
<p>
For in ourselves also we are to strive, hearing the spiritual law with spiritual
ears, that barrenness or sterility may not arise, but that we may like Hannah
and Hezekiah be heard, being freed from barrenness or sterility, and like
Mordecai and Esther and Judith be delivered from plotting enemies&mdash;in our case
the spiritual powers of evil. Inasmuch as Egypt is an iron furnace and also a
symbol of every earthly place, let every one who has escaped from the wickedness
of the life of men without having been scorched by sin or having had his heart
like an oven full of fire, give thanks no less than the men who experienced rain
amid fire.
<p>
Let him, too, who has been heard when he has prayed and said &quot;Deliver not
to the brutes a soul that makes acknowledgment to you,&quot; and who has
suffered naught from asp and basilisk because through Christ he has trod on
them, and who has trampled lion and snake and enjoyed the good authority
bestowed by Jesus to walk over serpents and scorpions and upon the whole power
of the enemy, without having been injured by any of them, give thanks more than
Daniel as having been delivered from brutes more terrible and harmful.
<p>
Let him, moreover, who has learned by experience what manner of monster that
which swallowed Jonah typified, perceiving that it is of such that Job has
spoken, &quot;May He curse it that curses that day, He that is to worst the
great monster,&quot; if he should ever come by reason of any disobedience to be
in the belly of the monster, pray in penitence, and he shall come out thence;
and if, after coming out, he abides in obedience to the commands of God, he
shall be able according to the kindness of the Spirit to be a prophet to
perishing Ninevites of today and to become a means to their salvation, without
discontent with the kindness of God or desire that He should abide in severity
towards penitents.
<p>
The very highest thing that Samuel is said to have done through prayer is
spiritually possible of achievement today by every genuine dependant upon God
who has become worthy to be heard. It is written: &quot;And now do but stand and
see this great thing which the Lord does under you eyes. Is it not wheat harvest
today? I will call upon the Lord and He will give thunders and rain.&quot; And
then shortly after it says &quot;and Samuel called upon the Lord, and the Lord
gave thunders and rain in that day.&quot; To every saint who is genuinely in
discipleship to Jesus it is said by the Lord, &quot;Lift up your eyes and behold
how the fields are white already unto harvest. He that harvests receives wages
and gathers fruit unto life eternal.&quot;
<p>
In this time of harvest the Lord does a great thing under the eyes of those who
hear the prophets; for when he that is adorned by the Spirit calls upon the
Lord, God gives from heaven thunders and rain that waters the Soul, in order
that he who was before in vice may deeply fear the Lord and the minister of
God's benefaction whose claim to reverence and veneration has been attested
through the hearing of his prayers. Elijah indeed by a divine word opened the
heavens after they had been shut to the impious three years and six months, a
thing which anyone may accomplish at any time when through prayer he receives
the Soul's rain, if he be one who has hitherto been deprived of it because of
sin.
<b>
<p align="left">
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C9"></A>IX.</SPAN>&nbsp;THE CONTENT OF PRAYER: ITS FOUR MOODS</b>
<p>
After thus interpreting the benefactions which have accrued to saints through
their prayers, let us turn our attention to the words &quot;ask for the great
things and the little shall be added unto you: and ask for the heavenly things
and the earthly shall be added unto you.&quot; All symbolical and typical things
may be described as little and earthly in comparison with the true and the
spiritual.
<p>
And, I believe, the divine Word, in urging us on to imitate the prayers of the
saints, speaks of the heavenly and great things set forth through those
concerned with the earthly and little, in order that we may make our requests
according to the reality of which their achievements were typical. He says in
effect: Do you who would be spiritual ask for the heavenly and great, in order
that obtaining in them heavenly things you may inherit a kingdom of heaven, and
as obtaining great things you may enjoy the greatest blessings, while as for the
earthly and little that you require by reason of your bodily necessities, your
Father will supply them to you in due measure.
<p>
In the first Epistle to Timothy the Apostle has employed four terms
corresponding to four things in close relation to the subject of devotion and
prayer. It will therefore be of service to cite his language and see whether we
can satisfactorily determine the strict meaning of each of the four. He says,
&quot;I exhort therefore first of all that requests, prayers, intercessions,
thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men,&quot; and so on.
<p>
Request I take to be that form of prayer which a man in some need offers with
supplication for its attainment; prayer, that which a man offers in the loftier
sense for higher things with ascription of glory; intercession, the addressing
of claim to God by a man who possesses a certain fuller confidence;
thanksgiving, the prayerful acknowledgment of the attainment of blessings from
God, he who returns the acknowledgment being impressed by the greatness, or what
seems to the recipient the greatness, of the benefactions conferred. Of the
first, examples are found in Gabriel's speech to Zachariah who, it is likely,
had prayed for the birth of John: &quot;Fear not, Zachariah, because your
request hath been heard and your wife Elizabeth shall beget you a Son and you
shall call his name John;&quot; in the account in Exodus of the making of the
Calf: &quot;And Moses made request before the Lord God, and said: To what
purpose, Lord, art you in anger wroth with your people whom you hast brought out
of the land of Egypt in great might?&quot;
<p>
In Deuteronomy: &quot;And I made request before the Lord a second time even as
also the former time forty days and forty nights bread I ate not and water I
drank not for all your sins that you sinned;&quot; and in Esther: &quot;Mordecai
made request of God, recalling all the works of the Lord, and said; Lord, Lord,
King Almighty,&quot; and Esther herself &quot;made request of the Lord God of
Israel and said: Lord our King . . . &quot; Of the second, examples are found in
Daniel: &quot;And Azariah drew himself up and prayed thus, and opening his mouth
amid the fire said . . . ;&quot; and in Tobit: &quot;And with anguish I prayed
saying, 'Righteous art you, O Lord, and all your works; all your ways are
mercy and truth, and judgment true and righteous dost you judge forever.'&quot;
Since however, the circumcised have marked the passage in Daniel spurious as not
standing in the Hebrew, and dispute the Book of Tobit as not within the
Testament, I shall cite Hannah's case from the first book of Kings.
<p>
&quot;And she prayed unto the Lord, and wept exceedingly, and vowed a vow, and
said, 'O Lord of Hosts, if you will indeed have regard unto the humiliation of
your bondmaid,'&quot; and so on; and in Habakkuk: &quot;A prayer of Habakkuk the
prophet, set to song. O Lord, I have hearkened to your voice and was afraid; I
did mark your works and was in ecstasy. In the midst of two living beings you
shall be known; as the years draw nigh you shall be fully known;&quot; a prayer
which eminently illustrates what I said in defining prayer that it is offered
with ascription of glory by the suppliant. And in Jonah also, Jonah prayed unto
the Lord his God from the belly of the monster, and said, &quot;I cried in my
affliction unto the Lord my God, and he heard me. You heard my wail from the
belly of death, my cry; you flung me away into the depths of the heart of the
sea, and streams encircled me.&quot;
<p>
Of the third, we have an example in the Apostle where he with good reason
employs prayer in our case, but intercession in that of the Spirit as excelling
us and having confidence in approaching Him with whom He intercedes; for as to
what we are to pray, he says, &quot;as we ought we know not, but the Spirit
Himself more than intercedes with God in sighs unspeakable, and He that searches
hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit because His intercession on behalf
of saints is according to God;&quot; for the Spirit more than intercedes, and
intercedes, whereas we pray.
<p>
What Joshua said concerning the sun's making a stand over against Gabaoth is, I
think, also intercession: Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD
delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, &quot;Here spoke Joshua
to the Lord in the day when God delivered up the Amorites before the children of
Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon;
and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon;&quot; and in Judges, it is, I think, in
intercession that Samson said, &quot;Let my soul die together with the
aliens&quot; when he leaned in might and the house fell upon the princes and
upon all the people in it. Even though it is not explicitly said that Joshua and
Samson interceded but that they said, their language seems to be intercession,
which, if we accept the terms in their strict sense, is in our opinion distinct
from prayer.
<p>
Of thanksgiving an example is our Lord's utterance when He says: &quot;I make
acknowledgment to you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you did hide
these things from the wise and understanding and reveal them to infants;&quot;
for I make acknowledgment is equivalent to I give thanks.
<p align="left">
<b><SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C10"></A>X.</SPAN>&nbsp;THE RECIPIENT OF PRAYER IN ITS FOUR MOODS</b>
<p>
Now request and intercession and thanksgiving, it is not out of place to offer
even to men&mdash;the two latter, intercession and thanksgiving, not only to saintly
men but also to others. But request to saints alone, should some Paul or Peter
appear, to benefit us by making us worthy to obtain the authority which has been
given to them to forgive sins&mdash;with this addition indeed that, even should a
man not be a saint and we have wronged him, we are permitted our becoming
conscious of our sin against him to make request even of such, that he extend
pardon to us who have wronged him.
<p>
Yet if we are offer thanksgiving to men who are saints, how much more should we
give thanks to Christ, who has under the Father's will conferred so many
benefactions upon us? Yes and intercede with Him as did Stephen when he said,
&quot;Lord, set not this sin against them.&quot; In imitation of the father of
the lunatic we shall say, &quot;I request, Lord, have mercy&quot; either on my
son, or myself, or as the case may be. But if we accept prayer in its full
meaning, we may not ever pray to any begotten being, not even to Christ himself,
but only to the God and Father of All to whom our Savior both prayed himself, as
we have already instanced, and teaches us to pray.
<p>
For when He has heard one say. &quot;Teach you us to pray,&quot; He does not
teach men to pray to Himself but to the Father saying, &quot;Our Father in
heaven,&quot; and so on. For if, as is shown elsewhere, the Son is other than
the Father in being and essence, prayer is to be made either to the Son and not
the Father or to both or to the Father alone.
<p>
That prayer to the Son and not the Father is most out of place and only to be
suggested in defiance of manifest truth, one and all will admit. In prayer to
both it is plain that we should have to offer our claims in plural form, and in
our prayers say, &quot;Grant you both, Bless you both, Supply you both, Save you
both,&quot; or the like, which is self-evidently wrong and also incapable of
being shown by anyone to stand in the scriptures as spoken by any.
<p>
It remains, accordingly, to pray to God alone, the Father of All, not however
apart from the High Priest who has been appointed by the Father with swearing of
an oath, according to the words He hath sworn and shall not repent, &quot;You
art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.&quot; In thanksgiving to
God, therefore, during their prayers, saints acknowledge His favors through
Christ Jesus.
<p>
Just as the man who is scrupulous about prayer ought not to pray to one who
himself prays but to the Father upon whom our Lord Jesus has taught us to call
in our prayers, so we are not to offer any prayer to the Father apart from Him.
He clearly sets this forth himself when He says, &quot;Verily, verily, I tell
you, whatsoever you may ask of my Father He shall give you in my house. Until
but now you have not asked aught in my name. Ask and you shall receive, that
your joy may be fulfilled.&quot;
<p>
He did not say, &quot;Ask of me,&quot; nor yet simply &quot;Ask of the
father,&quot; but &quot;Whatsoever you may ask of the Father, He will give you
in my name.&quot; For until Jesus taught this, no one had asked of the Father in
the name of the Son. True was the saying of Jesus, &quot;Until but now you have
not asked aught in my name&quot;; and true also the words, &quot;Ask and you
shall receive, that your joy may be fulfilled.&quot; Should anyone, however who
believes that prayer ought to be made to Christ himself, confused by the sense
of the expression make obeisance, confront us with that acknowledged reference
to Christ in Deuteronomy, &quot;Let all God's angels make obeisance to
Him,&quot; we may reply to him that the church, called Jerusalem by the prophet,
is also said to have obeisance made to her by kings and queens who become her
foster sires and nurses, in the words, &quot;Behold, I lift up my hand upon the
nations, and upon the isles will I lift up my sign: and they shall bring your
sons in their bosom and your daughters they shall lift up on their shoulders;
and kings shall be your foster sires, their queens they nurses: to the face of
the earth shall they make obeisance to you, and the dust of your feet shall they
lick: and you shall know that I am the Lord and shall not be ashamed.&quot;
<p>
And how does it not accord with Him who said, &quot;Why callest you me good?
None is good save One&mdash;God the Father&quot; to suppose that He would say,
&quot;Why pray you to me? To the Father alone ought you to pray, to whom I also
pray, as indeed you learn from the holy Scriptures. For you ought not to pray to
one who has been appointed high priest for you by the Father and has received it
from the Father to be advocate, but through a high priest and advocate able to
sympathize with your weaknesses, having been tried in all points like you but,
by reason of the Father's free gift to me, tried without sin.
<p>
Learn you therefore how great a free gift you have received from my Father in
having received through regeneration in me the Spirit of adoption, that you may
be called sons of God and my brethren. For you have read my utterance spoken
through David to the Father concerning you, 'I will proclaim your name to my
brethren; in the midst of the church will I sing hymns to you.' It is not
reasonable that those who have been counted worthy of one common Father should
pray to a brother.To the Father alone ought you, with me and through me, to send
up prayer.&quot;
<p>
So then hearing Jesus speak to such effect, let us pray to God through Him, all
with one accord and without division concerning the manner of prayer. Are we not
indeed divided if we pray some to the Father, others to the Son&mdash;those who pray
to the Son, whether with the Father or without the Father, committing a crude
error in all simplicity for lack of discrimination and examination?
<p>
Let us therefore pray as to God, intercede as with a Father, request as of a
Lord, give thanks as to God and Father and Lord, though in no way as to a
servant's lord; for the Father may reasonably be considered Lord not only of the
Son but also of those who through Him are become sons also, though, just as He
is not God of dead but of living men, so He is not Lord of baseborn servants but
of such as at the first are ennobled by means of fear because they are as
infants, but serve thereafter according to love in a service more blessed than
that which is in fear. For within the soul itself, visible to the Seer of Hearts
alone, these are distinctive characters of servants and sons of God.

<p align="left">
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C11"></A>XI.</SPAN>&nbsp;THE OBJECTS OF PRAYER</b>
<p>
Everyone who asks for the earthly and little things from God disregards Him who
has enjoined the asking of heavenly and great things. God is incapable of
bestowing anything either earthly or little. Should anyone suggest instances to
the contrary in which the material things bestowed upon the saints in the past
as a result of prayer, and indeed the express language of the Gospel when it
teaches that the earthly and the little are to be added unto us, we may reply to
him as follows.
<p>
When someone bestows upon us a particular material object, we should not say
that the person has bestowed upon us the shadow of the object, for it is
unintentional to present two things, object and shadow. The giver's intention is
to give a material object; our receipt of its shadow is a consequence of the
gift. In like manner if, with mind grown nobler, we have discerned the gifts
that are principally given to us by God, we shall most properly describe as
consequences of the great and heavenly spiritual gifts of grace the material
things which are given to each of the saints for his good or in proportion to
his faith or according as the Giver wills, and wisely does He will, even though
we are unable to describe a cause and reason worthy of the Giver for each of His
gifts.
<p>
Greater fruit had been borne by Hannah's soul in being turned from sterility
than was her body in conceiving Samuel. Diviner had been the offspring begotten
by Hezekiah's mind than that which was begotten of the material seed of his
body. Higher had been the deliverances of Esther and Morecai and the people from
spiritual plots than was that from Haman and his conspirators. Mightier was the
prince that sought to ruin her soul, whose power Judith had cut through than he
whom she met in Holophermes.
<p>
Who would not acknowledge that in the spiritual blessing which comes home to all
the saints and which Isaac spoke of to Jacob, &quot;God give you of the rain of
heaven,&quot; a higher rain had fallen to Ananiah and those with him than the
material rain that overcame Nebuchadnezzar's flame? Greater had been the
muzzling of the unseen lions by the prophet Daniel so that they were unable to
work anything against his soul, than that of the visible lions to which all of
us who read the passage have understood it to refer.
<p>
And who as a saint, becoming a fit recipient of the holy spirit, had ever, like
Jonah, escaped the belly of a monster that swallowed every fugitive from God and
which has been defeated by Jesus our Savior? It need not cause surprise if, to
keep the metaphor, the corresponding shadow is not given to all who receive
objects capable of making shadows, while to some a shadow is what is given.
Students of questions relating to sundials and of the relation of shadows to the
illuminating body clearly observe what is the case with bodies generally, that
at a particular time some projectors are shadowless, others are short shadowed,
others are more or less long-shadowed.
<p>
It is therefore not astonishing that, as the Giver's plan is to bestow the
principal things in accordance with certain unutterable and mystic guiding
principles and suitable to the recipients and occasions, when the principal
objects are being given there should sometimes go with them no shadows at all
for the recipients. At other times shadows are but few; at other times shadows
which are smaller in comparison accompany different objects.
<p>
As the presence or absence of the shadow of bodies neither pleases nor pains the
man whose object of search is solar beams, he possesses his chief necessity in
being illumined or freed from shadow or in having more or less of shadow as the
case may be. If the spiritual things are ours, and we are being illumined by God
for complete possession of true blessings, we shall not quibble over a matter so
paltry as concerns the shadow.
<p>
For material and physical things count as fleeting feeble shadow, in no way
comparable to the saving holy gifts of the God of All. What comparison is there
between material riches and the riches that are in every word and all wisdom?
Who in his senses would compare health of flesh and bone with health of mind,
strength of soul, and consistency of thought&mdash;things which, if kept in measure
by God's word, make bodily sufferings a paltry scratch, and even slighter if we
can grasp it.
<p>
He that has discerned the meaning of the beauty of the bride whom the bridegroom
Word of God loves, a soul blooming with more than heavenly and more than mundane
beauty, will be ashamed to dignify with the same name of beauty the physical
beauty of woman or child or man. For of beauty in the strict sense flesh is not
capable, being deformity throughout. For all flesh is as grass, and the glory
thereof, which is manifest in the so called beauty of women and children, is
according to the prophet's language compared to a flower, &quot;All people are
grass, their constancy is like the flower of the field. The grass withers, the
flower fades, when the breath of the LORD blows upon it; surely the people are
grass. The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God will stand
forever.&quot;
<p>
Again, who that has perceived the nobility of the sons of God shall any longer
give the name of nobility to what passes as such among men? After contemplating
Christ's kingship over kings, how shall the mind not dispel all kingship upon
earth? When the human mind, so far as capable while still bound to a body, has
once beheld as clearly as may be an army of angels, and among them
chief-commanders of the Lord's hosts, and archangels and thrones and lordships
and principalities and more than heavenly authorities, and has come to
understand that it can obtain from the Father their equivalent, how shall it not
despise those things which though frailer than shadow are the admiration of the
foolish, even if they should all be given to it, as most shadowy and in
comparison insignificant, and look beyond in order not to fall short of
obtaining the true principalities and diviner authorities?
<p>
We should therefore pray for the principal and truly great and heavenly things,
and as for those concerned with the shadows accompanying the principal, commit
them to the God who knows before we ask Him what things, by reason if our
perishable body, we have need.

<p align="left">
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C12"></A>XII.</SPAN>&nbsp;THE LORD'S PRAYER: THE PREFACE IN MATTHEW</b>
<p>
What I have said, according to my capacity to receive the grace which has been
given by God through His Christ, and as I trust in the Holy Spirit
also&mdash;whether it be so you will judge when you read it&mdash;may suffice by way of
examination of the general subject of prayer. I shall now proceed to the next
task, to consider how full of meaning is the prayer outlined by the Lord. It is
first of all to be observed that to most people Matthew and Luke might seem to
have recorded the same prayer sketched as a pattern for right prayer. Matthew's
words run thus:
<p>
Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be
done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive
us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And do not bring us to the
time of trial, but rescue us from the evil one.
<p>
But Luke's run as follows:
<p>
Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Give us each day our daily
bread. And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone indebted to
us. And do not bring us to the time of trial.
<p>
To those who suppose it to be the same prayer we may reply that the utterances,
though they certainly resemble one another, also appear to differ, as I shall
set forth in investigating them. In the second place it is not possible that the
same prayer should be said on the mountain where &quot;When Jesus saw the
crowds, he went up the mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to
him. Then he began to speak, and taught them, saying&quot;&mdash;for it is in the
course of the recital of the Beatitudes and the subsequent injunctions that it
is found recorded in Matthew. It also have been said, &quot;He was praying in a
certain place, and after he had finished, one of his disciples said to him,
&quot;Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.&quot;
<p>
It is surely impossible that the same words should be described as having been
spoken in the course of continuous utterance without any question to precede
them and as being announced in response to a disciple's request. One might,
however, say the prayers are equivalent and were spoken as one. On the one
occasion in continuous discourse, on the other in response to the request of a
different disciple who in all likelihood was not present when He spoke the form
in Matthew or had not mastered what had earlier been spoken. But perhaps it is
better that the prayers be regarded as different, with certain portions in
common.
<p>
In Mark, though I have searched there also in case the record of an equivalent
should escape me, I have not found so much as a vestige of a prayer contained. I
have already said that before praying one must first be composed and disposed in
a particular manner. Let us therefore glance at the words preceding the prayer
contained in Matthew, which were uttered by our Savior. They are as follows: And
whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and
pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by
others.
<p>
Truly I tell you, they have received their reward. But whenever you pray, go
into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and
your Father who sees in secret will reward you. When you are praying, do not
heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard
because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you
need before you ask him.
<p>
Pray then in this way: Our Savior often appears as inveighing against the love
of glory as a deadly passion, just as He has done in this place where He
dissuades us from the practice of actors at the season of prayer, for it is a
practice of actors rather to plume themselves in piety before men rather than to
have communion with God.
<p>
Remembering then the words, &quot;How can you believe when you accept glory from
one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the one who alone is
God?&quot; we ought to despise all glory with men even though it be thought
honorably gained and to seek the strict and true glory which is from Him alone
who glorifies the deserving in a manner becoming to Himself and exceeding the
desert of the person glorified. The very act which would in itself be thought
honorable and is thought praiseworthy is polluted when we do it to be glorified
by men or to appear to men, and on that account it is attended by no recompense
from God. Unerring as the whole of Jesus' language is, it becomes even more so
when it is spoken with His accustomed oath.
<p>
Of those who for human glory seem to do good to their neighbor, or pray in
synagogues and at broadway corners, he says. &quot;Truly I tell you, they have
received their reward.&quot; For as the rich man according to Luke had good
things in his human life, being no longer capable of obtaining them after the
present life because he had had them, so he that has his reward, as having sown
not &quot;unto the spirit&quot; but &quot;unto the flesh&quot; shall &quot;reap
corruption&quot; but shall not &quot;reap eternal life&quot; in his giving or in
his prayers.
<p>
It is sowing unto the flesh when one does alms, with trumpeting before him, in
synagogues and thoroughfares to be glorified by men, or likes to pray standing
in synagogues and at broadway corners to appear to men and thought a pious and a
holy person among the onlookers. Indeed every wayfarer along the broad and
spacious way leading to destruction without rightness or straightness but
crooked and cornered throughout, (for the straight line is broken in it to the
utmost), is standing no less than he who prays at broadway corners, not in one
but through his love of pleasure in a number of streets in which beings who as
men are perishing because they have fallen away from their divinity, are to be
found glorifying and pronouncing blessed those whom they have thought to act
piously.
<p>
There are always many who are rather pleasure-loving than God-loving in their
seeming prayer who debauch prayer amid banqueting and carousing, standing in
truth at the broadway corners and praying. For everyone who has made pleasure
his rule of life has in his passion for the spacious fallen out of the narrow
straitened way of Jesus Christ that is without a single bend and has no corner
at all.
<p>
There is a certain difference between Church and Synagogue. The church in the
strict sense is without &quot;a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind,&quot;
is holy and blameless. Into it enters neither child of harlot, nor eunuch or
emasenlate, nor yet Egyptian or Edomite unless sons born to them in the third
generation enables them with difficulty to join the church, nor Moabite and
Ammonite, unless the tenth generation is complete and the aeon passed.
<p>
The Synagogue on the other hand may be built by a centurion, as was the case in
times preceding the sojourn of Jesus when as yet witness had not yet been borne
that the man possessed faith such as the Son of God did not find even in Israel.
Now he who likes to pray in synagogues is not far from broadway corners. But it
is not so with the saint, for he loves, not likes to pray, in churches, not
broadway corners, in the straightness of the narrow straitened way, not to
appear to men, but to present himself before the Lord God, a male in the sense
that he observes the acceptable year of the Lord and keeps the commandment which
says, &quot;Thrice in the year shall every male present himself before the Lord
God.&quot;
<p>
We are to attend to the word &quot;appear&quot; carefully, since no appearance
is a good inasmuch as it only seems to exist and not in truth, and misleads the
senses and expresses nothing exactly and truly. As actors of plays in theatres
are not what they profess nor are really what the mask they wear makes them look
like, so too all who appear to assume the outward sensible form of goodness and
are not righteous but actors of righteousness, acting moreover in a theatre of
their own&mdash;namely synagogues and broadway corners. But he that is no actor but
has cast off all that is alien to him and sets himself to please in that theatre
which is inconceivably greater than any which has been mentioned, enters into
his own storeroom to the riches therein treasured up, and shuts up after him his
treasury of wisdom and knowledge.
<p>
Never turning his glance outwards or doting on things outside, having shut up
every door of the senses that he may not be drawn away by sensations or have
their sensible presentation stealing into his mind, prays to the Father who does
not shun or desert a place so secret but dwells in it, the Only Begotten also
being present with Him. For He says &quot;I and the Father will come unto him
and make abode with him.&quot; And plainly, if we do pray thus, we shall be
interceding not only with a God but also with a Father who is righteous, who
does not desert us as His children but is present in our secret place and
watches it and increases the contents of the storeroom if we shut up its door.
<p>
When we pray let us not babble but use godly speech. We babble when, without
scrutiny of ourselves or of the devotional words we are sending up, we speak of
the corrupt in deed or word or thought, things which are mean and reprehensible
and alien to the incorruptibleness of the Lord. He, then, that babbles in prayer
is in a synagogic disposition worse than any yet described and in a harder way
than those who are at broadway corners, preserving not as much as a vestige even
of acting in goodness.
<p>
For according to the passage in the Gospel only heathen babble, being quite
insensible of great or heavenly petitions and therefore sending up every prayer
for the material and the external. To a babbling heathen, then, is he like who
asks for things below from the Lord who dwells in heaven and above the heights
of the heavens.
<p>
He who is wordy also seems to be a babbler and he who babbles to be wordy. There
is no unity in matter and in bodily substances, but every such supposed unity is
split up and divided and disintegrated into many units to the loss of its union.
Good is one; many are the base. Truth is one; many are the false. True
righteousness is one; many are the states that act it as a part. God's wisdom is
one; many are the wisdoms of this age and of the rulers of this age which come
to nought. The word of God is one, but many are the words alien to God.
<p>
Therefore no one shall escape Sin as the result of wordiness, and no one who
thinks to be heard as the result of wordiness can be heard. For this reason we
ought not to make our prayers like heathen babbling or wordiness or other
practice after the likeness of the serpent, for the God of saints, being a
Father, knows of what things His children have need, since such things are
worthy of Fatherly knowledge.
<p>
He who knows not God knows not the things of God also&mdash;knows not the things of
which he has need, for the things of which he thinks he has need are mistaken.
But he who has contemplated the better and diviner things of which he is in need
shall obtain the objects of his contemplation which are known by God and which
have been known by the Father even before asking. After these remarks upon the
preface to the prayer in the Gospel according to Matthew, let us now proceed to
consider what the prayer sets forth.
<b>
<p align="left">
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C13"></A>XIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;THE LORD'S PRAYER&mdash;OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN</b>
<p>
Our Father in Heaven. It deserves a somewhat careful observation of the
so-called Old Testament to discover whether it is possible to find anywhere in
it a prayer of one who addresses God as Father. For though I have made
examination to the best of my ability, I have up to the present failed to find
one. I do not say that God is not spoken of as Father or that accounted
believers in God are not called sons of God, but that I have not yet found in
prayer that confidence in calling God Father which the Savior has proclaimed.
<p>
That God is spoken of as Father and those who have waited on God's word as sons,
may be seen in many places, as in Deuteronomy, &quot;You have forsaken God your
parent and forgotten God your nourisher,&quot; and again, &quot;Is He not your
Father himself that got you and made you and created you?&quot; and again,
&quot;Sons who have not faith in them.&quot; And in Isaiah, &quot;I have
nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me&quot;; and
in Malachi, &quot;A son honors his father, and a servant his master: if then I
be a father, where is my honor? and if I be a master, where is my fear?&quot; So
then, even though God is termed Father and their Sons who have been begotten by
reason of their faith in Him, yet sure and unchangeable sonship is not to be
seen in the ancient people.
<p>
The very passages I have cited since the subjection of those so-called sons,
since according to the apostle &quot;the heir, as long as he is a child, differs
nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; But is under tutors and
governors until the time appointed of the father.&quot; But the fullness of time
is in the sojourn of our Lord Jesus Christ, when they who desire receive
adoption as sons, as Paul teaches in the words, &quot;For you did not receive a
spirit of slavery unto fear, but you received a spirit of adoption as sons,
wherein we cry 'Abba Father'&quot;; and as it is in the Gospel according to
John, &quot;To as many as received Him He gave authority to become children of
God if believers on His name&quot;; and it is by reason of this Spirit of
adoption as sons, we learn in the Catholic Epistle of John regarding the
begotten of God, that &quot;Everyone that is begotten of God does no sin because
His seed abides in him, and he cannot sin because he is begotten of God.&quot;
<p>
And yet if we think of the meaning of the words which are written in Luke,
&quot;When you pray say: Father . . . ,&quot; we shall hesitate to address this
expression to Him unless we have become genuine sons in case, in addition to our
other sins, we should also become liable to a charge of impiety. My meaning is
as follows. In the first Epistle to Corinthians Paul says, &quot;No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' save in a holy spirit, and no one that speaks in God's spirit
says 'cursed be Jesus' calling the same thing a holy spirit and God's
spirit.&quot; What is meant by speaking in a holy spirit of Jesus as Lord is not
quite clear, as countless actors and numbers of heterodox people, and at times
even demons conquered by the power in the name, utter the expression.
<p>
No one therefore will venture to declare that anyone of these calls Jesus 'Lord' in a holy spirit. For the same reason, indeed, they could not be shown
to call Jesus Lord at all, since they alone call Jesus Lord who express it from
inward disposition in service to the word of God and in proclaiming no other
Lord than Him in all their conduct. And if it be such who say Jesus is Lord, it
may be that everyone who sins, in that he curses the divine Word through his
transgression, has through his actions called out, &quot;Cursed be Jesus.&quot;
<p>
And accordingly, as the one type of man says &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; and the
man of opposite disposition &quot;Cursed be Jesus,&quot; &quot;so everyone that
hath been begotten of God and does not sin&quot; because he is partaker of God's
seed which turns him from all sin, says through his conduct &quot;Our Father in
Heaven,&quot; the spirit himself witnessing with their spirit that they are
children of God and heirs to Him and joint heirs with Christ, since as suffering
with Him they reasonably hope with Him also to be glorified. But in order that
theirs may be no one-sided utterance of the words &quot;Our Father,&quot; in
addition to their actions they have a heart&mdash;a fountain and source of good
actions&mdash;believing unto righteousness, in harmony with which their mouth makes
acknowledgment unto salvation.
<p>
So then their every act and word and thought, formed by the only begotten word
in accord with Him, imitates the image of the invisible God and has come to be
&quot;in accordance with the image of the Creator&quot; who makes &quot;the sun
to rise upon evil men and good and rains upon righteous and unrighteous,&quot;
that there may be in them the image of the heavenly One who is himself also an
image of God. Saints, therefore, as an image of an Image himself, a son, receive
the impress of Sonship, becoming conformed not only to the glorified body of
Christ but also to Him who is in that body, and they become conformed to Him who
is in a glorified body through being transformed by the renewing of their mind.
<p>
And if such men through out the whole of life voice the words &quot;Our Father
in the Heavens,&quot; plainly he that does sin, as John says in the Catholic
Epistle, &quot;is of the devil because the devil sins from the beginning&quot;
and just as God's seed abiding in the begotten of God produces inability to sin
in him who is formed in accordance with the only begotten Word, so the devil's
seed is in everyone that does sin, to the extent in which it is present within
the soul&mdash;not suffering its possessor to have power to prosper. But since
&quot;for this end was the Son of God manifested that He might undo the actions
of the devil,&quot; it is possible, through the undoing of the actions of the
devil by the sojourn of the Word of God within our Soul, for the evil seed
implanted in us to be utterly removed and for us to become children of God.
<p>
Let us, therefore, not think that it is words we are taught to say in any
appointed season of prayer. On the contrary, if we understand our former
consideration of prayer without ceasing, let our whole life of prayer without
ceasing speak the words &quot;Our Father in the Heavens,&quot; having its
commonwealth in no wise on earth but in every way in heaven, which is God's
throne because of the foundation of the kingdom of God in all who wear the image
of the Heavenly One and therefore become heavenly. When the Father of saints is
said to be in the heavens, we are not to suppose that He is circumscribed by
material form and dwells in heaven.
<p>
Since, in that case, as contained God will be formed to be less than the heavens
because they contain Him, whereas the ineffable might of His godhead demands our
belief that all things are contained and held together by Him. And, in general,
passages which taken literally are thought by the simpler order of minds to
assert that God is in space are to be otherwise taken in a sense more becoming
to great spiritual concepts of God.
<p>
Such are those passages in the Gospel according to John: Before the feast of the
Passover, Jesus, knowing that His hour had come that He should pass from this
world to the Father, as He had loved His own who were in the world, loved them
to the end; and shortly after: knowing that the Father had given all into His
hands, and that He had come forth from God and was returning to God; and later:
you heard that I said to you: I return and come unto you. If you loved me you
would have rejoiced that I go to the Father; and again later; Now I return to
Him that sent me and none of you asks me: Where do you return?
<p>
If these things are to be taken spacially, so also plainly is: Jesus answered
and said to them, &quot;If any one love me he will keep my word and my Father
will love him and we shall come unto him and make abode with him.&quot; But
surely the words do not imply a spacial transition of the Father and the Son to
the lover of the word of Jesus and are therefore not to be taken spacially.
<p>
On the contrary, the Word of God, in condescension for us and, in regard to His
proper desert, in humiliation while among men, is said to pass from this world
unto the Father so that we also may behold Him perfectly there in reversion to
His proper fullness from the emptiness among us whereby He emptied
himself&mdash;where we also, enjoying His guidance, shall be filled and freed from
all emptiness. To such an end the Word of God well may leave the world and
depart to Him that sent Him, and go to the Father! And as for that passage near
the end of the Gospel according to John, &quot;Cling not to me, for I am not yet
gone up unto my Father,&quot; let us seek to conceive it in the more mystical
sense:
<p>
Let ours be the more reverent conception of the ascension of the Son to the
Father with sanctified insight, an ascension rather of soul than of body. I
think it right to have linked these considerations to the clause Our Father in
the Heavens for the sake of doing away with a low conception of God held by
those who think that He is in heaven spacially, and of preventing anyone from
saying God is in material space since it follows that He also is physical, which
leads to opinions most impious\&mdash;to belief that He is divisible and material
and corruptible. For every material thing is divisible and corruptible.
<p>
Or else let them tell us, not on the strength of vague sensation but with a
claim to clear understanding, how it can be of any other than a material nature.
Since, then, in writings before Christ's bodily sojourn there are also many
statements which seem to say that God is in physical space, it appears to me to
be not out of place to cite a few of them also for the sake of doing away with
any doubt in those who, because they know no better, confine God, who is over
all, within small and scanty space on their own scale. First, in Genesis it says
Adam and Eve heard the sound of the lord God walking at evening in the garden,
and both Adam and his wife hid themselves from the Lord God amid the wood of the
Garden.
<p>
I shall put the question to those who not only refuse to enter into the
treasures of the passage but do not so much as knock at all at its door, whether
they are able to imagine the Lord God, who fills the heaven and the earth, who
as they themselves suppose in the more physical sense uses heaven as throne and
the earth as a footstool for His feet, as contained by so scanty a space in
comparison with the whole heaven and the earth that a garden which they suppose
to be material is not filled by God but so far exceeds Him in greatness as to
hold Him even when walking while a sound from the tread of His feet is heard?
Absurder still on their interpretation is the hiding of Adam and Eve, in fear of
God by reason of their transgression, from before God amid the wood of the
Garden.
<p>
For it is not even said that they merely desired to hide but that they actually
hid themselves. And how is it in their view that God inquires of Adam saying:
Where are you? I have discussed these matters at greater length in my
examination of the contents of Genesis, yet here, too&mdash;in order not to pass by
so grave a subject in complete silence&mdash;it will suffice if I recall what is
said by God in Deuteronomy: I will dwell in them and walk in them. For as is His
walk in saints such is His walk in the Garden also, since everyone that sins
hides from God and shuns His oversight and renounces his confidence with Him. So
it was that Cain also went out from before God and dwelt in the land of Nod over
against Eden. In the same way, therefore, as He dwells in saints.
<p>
So also does He dwell in heaven (that is, in every saint who wears the image of
the Heavenly One, or Christ, in whom all who are being saved are luminaries and
stars of heaven, or else because saints are in heaven) according to the saying:
Unto you who dwells in heaven have I lifted up my eyes. And yet the passage in
Ecclesiastes: Be not in haste to utter speech before God, because God is in
heaven above, and you on Earth below, means to show the interval which separates
those who are in the body of humiliation from Him who is with the angels and
holy powers who are being exalted by the help of the Word also and with Christ
himself. For it is not unreasonable that He should be strictly at the Father's
throne, allegorically called heaven, while His church, termed Earth, is a
footstool at His feet.
<p>
I have cited a few Old Testament utterances, thought to represent God in space,
for the sake of urging the reader by every means within the power given me to
accept the divine scripture in the higher and more spiritual sense whenever it
seems to teach that God is in space. And it was fitting that these
considerations should be linked to the clause Our Father in the Heavens inasmuch
as it distinguishes the essence of God from all created beings. For it is upon
such as do not share in that essence that a certain glory of God and a power
from Him, an outflow of the deity, comes.

<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C14"></A>XIV.</SPAN>&nbsp;HALLOWED BE THY NAME</b>
<p>
Hallowed be Thy name. Although this may represent either that the object of
prayer has not yet come to pass, or after its attainment, that it is not
permanent in which case the request is for its retention; the language in this
instance makes it plain that it is with the implication that the name of the
Father has not yet been hallowed, that we are bidden&mdash;according to Matthew and
Luke, that is&mdash;to say &quot;Hallowed be Thy Name.&quot; Then how, one might
say, should a man request the hallowing of God's name as though not hallowed?
Let us understand what the Father's name, and what the hallowing of it, means. A
name is a summary designation descriptive of the peculiar character of the thing
named.
<p>
Thus the Apostle Paul has a certain peculiar character, partly of soul which is
accordingly of a certain kind, partly of intellect which is accordingly
contemplative of certain things, and partly of body which is accordingly of a
certain kind. It is the peculiar in these characteristics, the unique
combination&mdash;for there is not another being identical with Paul&mdash;that is
indicated by means of the appellation Paul. In the case of men, however, whose
peculiar characteristics are changed, their names also by a sound usage are
changed according to scripture.
<p>
When the character of Abram was transformed, he was called Abraham; when that of
Simon he was named Peter, and when that of Saul the persecutor of Jesus, he was
designated Paul. But in the case of God, inasmuch as He is himself ever
unchangeable and unalterable, the proper name which even He may be said to bear
is ever one, that mentioned in Exodus, &quot;He that is,&quot; or the like.
Since therefore, though we all have some notion of God, conceiving of Him in
various ways, but not all of what He is, for few and, be it said, fewer than few
are they who comprehend His compete holiness&mdash;we are with good reason taught to
attain to a holy conception of Him in order that we may see His holiness as
creator, provider, judge, elector, abandoner, acceptor, rejector, rewarder and
punisher of each according to his desert.
<p>
For it is in such and similar terms that God's peculiar character may be said to
be sketched which I take to be the meaning of the expression, God's name
according to the scriptures in Exodus: Thou shall not take the name of the Lord
your God in vain; in Deuteronomy: Be my utterance awaited as rain: as dew let my
words descend, as showers upon herbage and as moisture upon grass: for I have
called on the Lord's name; and in Psalms: They shall remember your name in every
generation.
<p>
It is he who associates the thought of God with wrong things that takes the name
of the Lord God in vain, and he who is able to utter rain that cooperates with
his hearers in the fruit bearing of their souls, and who addresses words of
exhortation that are like dew, and who in the edifying torrent of his words
turns upon his listeners showers most helpful or moisture most efficacious is
able to do so because he has perceived his need of God as the accomplisher and
calls in the real supplier of those things; and everyone who penetrates the very
things of God recalls to mind rather than learns the mysteries of piety even
when he seems to be told them by another or thinks that he discovers them. And
as the suppliant ought at this point to reflect that his asking is for the
hallowing of God's name, so in Psalms it is said Let us Exalt His name together,
the patriarch enjoining attainment to the true and exalted knowledge of God's
peculiar nature with all harmony, in the same mind, and in the same will.
<p>
It is exalting the name of God together when, after one has participated in an
outflow of deity in having been sustained by God and having overcome his enemies
so that they are unable to rejoice over his fall, he exalts the power of God in
which he has participated, as is shown in the twenty-ninth psalm by the words: I
will exalt you, O Lord, for you have sustained me and not made my enemies to
rejoice over me. A man exalts God when he has consecrated to Him a house within
himself, since the superscription of the Psalm also runs thus: A Psalm of
singing for the consecration of the House of David.
<p>
It is further to be observed regarding the clause Hallowed be your Name and its
successors in imperative form, that the translators also continually made use of
imperatives instead of ablatives, as in the Psalms: Speechless let the guileful
lips be, that speak lawlessness against the righteous instead of 'may they be'
and Let the creditor search out all his possessions: Let him possess no helper,
concerning Judas in the one hundred and eighth; for the whole Psalm is a
petition concerning Judas that certain things may befall him.
<p>
But Tatian, failing to perceive that let there be does not always signify the
ablative but is occasionally also imperative, has most impiously supposed that
God said Let there be light in prayer rather than in command that the light
should be; since, as he puts it in his godless thought, God was in darkness. In
reply to him it may be asked, how is he going to take the other sayings? Let the
Earth grow grass, and Let the water below heaven be gathered together, and Let
the waters bring forth creeping things with living souls, and Let the earth
bring forth a living soul. Is it for the sake of standing upon firm ground that
He prays that the water below heaven be gathered together into one meeting
place, or for the sake of partaking of the things that grow from the earth that
He prays Let the Earth grow . . . ?
<p>
What manner of need, to match His need of light; has He of creatures of water,
air, and land that He should pray for them also? If even on Tatian's view it is
absurd to think of Him as praying for these things which occur in imperative
expressions, may the same not be said of Let be there light&mdash;that it is an
imperative and not an ablative expression? I thought that, in view of the fact
that prayer is expressed in imperative forms, some reference was necessary to
his perversion for the sake of those&mdash;I myself have met with cases who have
been misled into accepting his impious teaching.
<b>
<p align="left">
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C15"></A>XV.</SPAN>&nbsp;THY KINGDOM COME</b>
<p>
Thy Kingdom Come. According to the word of our Lord and Savior, the Kingdom of
God does not come observably, nor shall men say 'Lo it is here', or 'Lo is
it there', but the Kingdom of God is within us; for the utterance is exceedingly
near in our mouth and in our heart. It is therefore plain that he who prays for
the coming of the kingdom of God prays with good reason for rising and fruit
bearing and perfecting of God's kingdom within him.
<p>
For every saint is ruled over by God and obeys the Spiritual laws of God, and
conducts himself like a well-ordered city; and the Father is present with him,
and Christ rules together with the Father in the perfected Soul, according to
the saying that I mentioned shortly before: We will come unto him and make abode
with him. By God's kingdom I understand the blessed condition of the mind and
the settled order of wise reflection; by Christ's kingdom the issue of words of
salvation to their hearers and the practice of acts of righteousness and the
other excellences; for the son of God is word and righteousness.
<p>
But every sinner is tyrannized by the ruler of this world, since every sinner is
in conformity with the present evil world, and does not yield himself to Him who
gave Himself for us sinners that He might release us from the present evil world
and release us according to the will of God our Father, as it is expressed in
the Epistle to Galatians. And he who, by reason of deliberate sin is tyrannized
by the ruler of this world, is also ruled over by sin: wherefore we are bidden
by Paul to be no longer subject to sin that would rule over us, and we are
enjoined in these words, Let sin therefore not rule in our mortal body that we
should obey its lusts.
<p>
But in reference to both clauses Hallowed Be Thy Name and Thy Kingdom Come, it
may be urged that, if the suppliant prays them with a view to being heard and
ever is heard, plainly his will be an instance, answering to what has just been
said, of the name of God being hallowed and of the rise of the Kingdom of God,
in which event how shall he any longer with propriety pray for things already
present as though they not present, saying Hallowed be Thy Name: Thy Kingdom
Come:?&mdash;And in that case it will sometimes be proper not to say Hallowed Be Thy
Name: Thy Kingdom Come.
<p>
To this it may be replied that just as he who prays to obtain a word of
knowledge and a word of wisdom will with propriety pray for them continually
with the prospect of continually receiving fuller contemplations of wisdom and
knowledge through being heard, although his knowledge of such things as he may
be able in the present to receive is partial, whereas the perfect that annuls
the partial shall then be manifested when the mind confronts its objects face to
face without sensation&mdash;so perfection in our individual hallowing of the name
of God and in the rise of His kingdom within us is not possible unless there
also come perfection of knowledge and wisdom and it may be the other
excellences.
<p>
We are wayfaring toward perfection if we forget the things behind, pressing on
toward those before us. The kingdom of God within us will therefore be
consummated in us as we advance without ceasing, when, the saying in the Apostle
is fulfilled, that Christ, His enemies all made subject to Him, shall deliver
the kingdom to God the Father that God may be All in All. For this reason let us
pray without ceasing with a disposition made divine by the Word, and say to our
Father in heaven: Hallowed Be Thy Name: Thy Kingdom Come. Of the kingdom of God
it is further to be said by way of distinction that as righteousness has no
partnership with lawlessness and light no community with darkness and Christ no
argument with Belial, so a kingdom of sin is incompatible with the Kingdom of
God.
<p>
If, accordingly we would be ruled over by God, by no means let sin rule in our
mortal body nor let us obey its commands when it calls our soul forth to the
works of the flesh that are alien to God, but let us mortify our members that
are on earth and bear the fruits of the Spirit that the Lord may walk in us as
in a spiritual garden, ruling alone over us with His Christ seated within us on
the right of the Spiritual power that we pray to receive, sitting until all His
enemies within us become a footstool for His feet and every rule and authority
and power be undone from us.
<p>
These things may come to pass in the case of each of us, and death the last
energy be undone, so that Christ may say within us also O death, where is your
sting? O grave! Where is your victory? Even now, therefore, let our corruptible
put on the holiness and incorruptibleness that consists in chastity and purity,
and our mortal, death undone, wrap itself in the paternal immortality, so that,
being ruled over by God, we may even now live amid the blessings of regeneration
and resurrection.
<b>
<p align="left">
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C16"></A>XVI.</SPAN>&nbsp;THY WILL BE DONE ON EARTH ALSO AS IN HEAVEN</b>
<p>
Thy Will be done on Earth also as in Heaven. After the clause Thy Kingdom come
Luke has passed over these words in silence and placed the clause Give us daily
our Needful Bread. Let us therefore examine next in succession the words I have
placed first as set down in Matthew alone. As suppliants who are still on earth,
believing that the will of God is done in heaven among all the household of the
heavens, let us pray that the will of God may be done by us also who are on
earth in like manner with them, as will come to pass when we do nothing contrary
to His will.
<p>
And when the will of God as it is in heaven has been accomplished by us also who
are on earth, we shall inherit a kingdom of heaven as having, alike with them,
worn the image of the Heavenly One, while those who come after us on earth are
praying to become in turn like us who have come to be in heaven.
<p>
So far as Matthew alone is concerned the words on Earth also as in Heaven can be
taken in common, so that what we are enjoined to say in prayer would run thus:
Hallowed be Thy Name on Earth also as in Heaven: Thy Kingdom come on Earth also
as in Heaven: Thy Will be done on Earth also as in Heaven. For alike the name of
God has been hallowed among those who are in heaven, and the kingdom of God is
risen in them, and the will of God has been done in their midst&mdash;things indeed
which are all unrealized by us but which can be acquired by us through rendering
ourselves worthy to obtain God's hearing in reference to them all.
<p>
The words Thy Will be done on Earth also as in Heaven may raise the question how
has the will of God been done in Heaven where the spiritual forces of evil are,
by reason of which the sword of God shall drink deep even in heaven? If we pray
thus that the will of God be done on Earth just as it is being done in heaven
may we not thoughtlessly be praying that the very opposite may abide on earth
where such things already come from heaven since much that is bad on earth is
due to the overcoming spiritual forces of evil which are in the heavenly places?
<p>
Anyone who allegorizes heaven and asserts that it is Christ, and Earth the
church&mdash;what throne so worthy of the Father as Christ? What footstool of the
feet of God as the Church?&mdash;will easily solve the question by replying that
everyone in the church ought to pray to receive the paternal will in such wise
as Christ has done, who came to do the will of His Father and accomplished if
completely. For it is possible by being joined to Him to become one spirit with
Him and therefore receptive of the will to the end that, as it has been
accomplished in heaven, so it may be accomplished on earth also; for he that is
joined to the Lord, according to Paul, is one spirit. And I believe that one who
carefully considers it will find this an interpretation not to be despised.
<p>
But someone may dispute it by citing what is said to the eleven disciples by the
Lord after the resurrection at the close of the this gospel: There hath been
given to me all authority on earth also as in heaven. That is, having authority
over the things that are in heaven, He says that He has also received it over
those on earth:
<p>
Whereas those that are in heaven have already been illumined by the Word, it is
at the consummation of the world that those on earth are also, in imitation of
those over which the Savior received authority, brought to a successful issue by
reason of the authority given to the Son of God: accordingly His will is to
receive those who are disciples under Him as in a sense cooperants through their
prayers to the Father in order that, in like manner with the things in heaven
that are subject to Truth and Word, He may lead the things on Earth, restored by
reason of the authority which He has received on earth also as in heaven, to an
end fraught with bliss for the objects of His authority.
<p>
On the other hand one who would take heaven to be the Savior and Earth the
church, asserting that it is the firstborn of all creation, on whom the Father
reposes as on a throne, that is heaven, would find that it is the man whom He
put on after having been fitted for such power because He had humbled himself
and having been obedient till death, who says after the resurrection There hath
been given to me all authority on Earth also as in heaven&mdash;the man in the
Savior having received His authority over the things in heaven, as the proper
possessions of the Only-begotten, in order to be in communion with Him, mingling
in His divinity and becoming one with Him.
<p>
But if this second thought does not yet solve the difficulty as to how the will
of God can be in heaven when the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places
wrestle against those who are on earth, it will be possible to solve the
question from this consideration&mdash;It is not by virtue of place but of principle
that one who is still on earth but has a commonwealth in heaven and lays up
treasure in heaven and has his heart in heaven and wears the image of the
Heavenly One, is no longer of the earth nor of the world below but of heaven and
of the heavenly world that is better than this.
<p>
So, too, the spiritual forces of evil which still dwell in the heavenly places
but have their commonwealth on earth and plot against men the means whereby they
wrestle against mankind, and lay up treasure on Earth, and wear an image of the
Earthly One who the beginning of the Lord's fashioning made to be mocked by the
angels, are not heavenly nor by reason of their vicious disposition do they
dwell in the heavens. Accordingly when it is said: Thy will be done on Earth
also as in Heaven, we are not to reckon those beings as in heaven at all,
because through pride they have fallen along with Him who fell from heaven like
a thunderbolt.
<p>
And it may well be that our Savior, in saying that we ought to pray that the
Father's will may be done on Earth also as in heaven, does not by any means
order prayer for things spacially on earth that they may be made like things
spacially in heaven, but His will in enjoining prayer is that all things on
earth, that is things inferior and conformed to the earthly, be made like the
better which have their commonwealth in heaven, which have all become heaven.
<p>
For he that sins, wherever he may be, is earth, and will turn into the like
somehow, unless he repents, whereas he that does the will of God and does not
disobey the spiritual laws of salvation is heaven. Whether therefore we are
still earth because of sin, let us pray that the will of God may extend
restoringly to us also as it has already reached those who have become or are
heaven before us: or if we are already accounted not earth but heaven by God,
let our request be that, in like manner with heaven, on earth also, in inferior
things I mean, the will of God may be fulfilled unto what I may term earth's
heaven-making, so that there shall be no longer earth but all things become
heaven.
<p>
For if, on this interpretation, the will of God be done on earth also as in
heaven, earth will not remain earth, just as to make my meaning clearer with
another illustration&mdash;if the will of God be done in the case of the wanton as
it has been with the temperate, the wanton will be temperate, or if it should be
in the case of the unrighteous as it has been with the righteous, the
unrighteous will be righteous. If, therefore, the will of God be done on earth
also as it has been in heaven, we shall all be heaven; for though flesh that
helps not; and blood that is akin to it, are unable to inherit God's kingdom,
they may be said to inherit it if they be changed from flesh and earth and clay
and blood to the heavenly essence.
<b>
<p align="left">
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C17"></A>XVII.</SPAN>&nbsp;GIVE US TODAY OUR NEEDFUL BREAD</b>
<p>
Give us today our Needful Bread, or as Luke has it, Give us daily our Needful
Bread. Seeing that some suppose that it is meant that we should pray for
material bread, their erroneous opinion deserves to be done away with and the
truth about the needful bread set forth, in the following manner. We may put the
question to them&mdash;how can it be that He, who says that heavenly and great
things ought to be asked for as if, on their view, He has forgotten His teaching
now enjoins the offering of intercession to the Father for an earthly and little
thing, since neither is the bread which is assimilated into our flesh a heavenly
thing nor is it asking a great thing to request it?
<p>
For my part I shall follow the Teacher's own teaching as to the bread and cite
the passages in detail. To men who have come to Capernaum to seek Him He says,
in the Gospel according to John, Verily, verily, I tell you you seek me not
because you saw signs but because you ate of the loaves of bread and were filled
. . . for he that has eaten and been filled with the loaves of bread which have
been blessed by Jesus seeks the more to grasp the Son of God more closely and
hastens toward Him.
<p>
Wherefore He will enjoin: Work not for the food that perishes but for the food
that abides unto life eternal which the Son of Man shall give you. And when,
upon that, they who had heard inquired and said: What are we to do that we may
work the works of God? Jesus answered and said to them: This is the work of God
that you believe on him whom He has sent. As it is written in Psalms, God sent
His Word and healed them, that is the diseased, and believers in that Word work
the works of God which are food that abides unto life eternal.
<p>
And my Father, He says, gives you the true bread from heaven, for the bread of
God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. It is true
bread that nourishes the true man who is made in God's image, and he that has
been nourished by it also becomes in the Creator's likeness. What is more
nourishing to the soul than Word, or what more precious to the mind of him that
is capable of receiving it than the Wisdom of God?
<p>
What is more congenial to the rational nature than Truth? Should it be urged in
objection to this view that He would not in that case teach men to ask for
needful bread as if something other than Himself, it is to be noted that He also
discourses in the Gospel according to John sometimes as if it were other than
Himself but at other times as if He is Himself the Bread. The former in the
sense of the words: Moses hath given you the bread from heaven yet not the true
bread, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
<p>
In the latter sense, to those who had said to Him Ever give us this bread, He
says: I am the bread of life: he that comes unto me shall not hunger, and he
that believes on me shall not thirst; and shortly after: I am the living bread
that is come down from heaven: if anyone eat of this bread he shall live unto
eternity: yea and the bread which I shall give is my flesh which I shall give
for the sake of the life of the world.
<p>
Now since all manner of nourishment is spoken of as bread according to Scripture
as is clear from the fact that it is recorded of Moses that he ate not bread and
drank not water forty days, and since the nourishing Word is manifold and
various, not all being capable of nourishment by the solidity and strength of
the divine teachings, He is therefore pleased to offer strenuous nourishment
befitting men more perfect, where He says:
<p>
The bread which I shall give is my flesh which I shall give for the sake of the
life of the world: and shortly after: Except you eat the flesh of the son of Man
and drinks His blood, you have not life in yourselves. He that eats my flesh and
drinks my blood hath life eternal, and I will raise him up in the last day. for
my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. He that eats my flesh and
drinks my blood abides in me and I in him.As the living Father sent me and I
live because of the Father, so also he that eats me&mdash;he too shall live because
of me. This is the true food, Christ's flesh, which being Word has become flesh,
as it is said And the Word became flesh. When we eat and drink the Word He
tabernacles in us.
<p>
When He is assimilated the words are fulfilled: We beheld His glory. This is the
bread that is come down from heaven. Not as the fathers ate and died, he that
eats this bread shall live unto eternity. Discoursing to infant Corinthians who
walk in the way of man Paul says: I gave you milk to drink, not meat, for you
were not yet able. Nay even now you are not yet able, for you are still of the
flesh; and in the Epistle to Hebrews: And you are become in need of milk, not of
solid nourishment. For any one who partakes of milk is devoid of moral reason,
for he is infant.
<p>
But solid nourishment is for mature men who by force of use have their senses
trained to discriminate good and evil. In my opinion the words: One man hath
faith to eat anything, but he that is weak eats vegetables are also in his
intention meant to refer not to material forms of nourishment but to the words
of God that nourish the soul: Of these the man most faithful and mature is able
to partake of any, he being denoted in the words One man hath faith to eat
anything, whereas the weaker and more immature is content with simpler teachings
that do not quite produce full strength in him, reference being intended to him
in the words But he that is weak eats vegetables.
<p>
There is also in Solomon a saying in the Proverbs which I think teaches that the
man who by reason of simplicity is incapable of the stronger and greater
sentiments is better, short of false thought, than the man who, though more
ready and keener and of greater insight into things, fails to penetrate the
principle of peace and harmony in all. Solomon's passage runs as follows: Better
is hospitality of vegetables served with friendship and grace than a fatted calf
with enmity.
<p>
Many a time do we accept untutored simpler entertainment, accompanied by good
conscience, as guests at the table of those who are unable to furnish us with
more, with greater satisfaction than any elevation of words upreared against the
knowledge of God and proclaiming with ample plausibility a sentiment alien to
the Father of our Lord Jesus who has given the law and the prophets. In order,
therefore, that we may neither fall sick of soul for lack of nourishment nor die
to God because of famine of the Lord's word, let us in obedience to the teaching
of our Savior, with righter faith and life, ask the Father for the living bread
which is the same as the needful bread.
<p>
Let us now consider what the word epiousion, needful, means. First of all it
should be known that the word epiousion is not found in any Greek writer whether
in philosophy or in common usage, but seems to have been formed by the
evangelists. At least Matthew and Luke, in having given it to the world, concur
in using it in identical form. The same thing has been done by translators from
Hebrew in other instances also; for what Greek ever used the expression enotizou
or akoutisthete instead of eistaota dexai or akousai poice se.
<p>
Exactly like the expression epiousion, needful, is one found in Moses' writings,
spoken by God: Ye shall be my periousios&mdash;peculiar people. Either word seems to
me to be a compund of ousia&mdash;essence&mdash;the former signifying the bread that
contributes to the essence, the latter denoting the people that has to do with
the essence and is associated with it. As for ousia, essence, in the strict
sense, by those who assert the priority of the substance of immaterial things,
it is ranked with immaterial things which are in possession of permanent being
and neither receive addition nor suffer subtraction. For addition and
subtraction are characteristic of material things in reference to which growth
and decay take place owing to their being in a state of flux, in need of
imported support and nourishment.
<p>
If the import exceeds the waste in a period growth takes place, if it is less,
diminuation; and if, as in conceivable, there are things receiving no import at
all, they are in what I may term unmitigated diminuation. Those on the other
hand who hold the substance of immaterial things to be posterior and that of
material things to be prior, define essence in these terms: It is the primary
matter of existing things out of which they are or the matter of bodily things
out of which they are; or that of terms out of which they are; or the primary
unqualified substance or presubstance of existing things; or that which admits
of all transformations and modifications though itself as such inherently
incapable of modification; or that which undergoes all modification and
transformation.
<p>
On their view essence is inherently unqualified and inarticulate as such. It is
even indeterminate in magnitude, but it is involved in all quality as a kind of
ready ground for it. By qualities they mean distinctively like the actualities
and the activities in which movements and articulations of the essence have come
to be, and they say that the essence as such has no part in these inherently
though it is always incidentally inseparable from some of them and equally
receptive of all the agent's actualizations however it may act and transform.
(For it the force associated with the essence, pervading all that would be
responsible for all quality and the particular dispositions involving it.)
<p>
And they say that it is throughout transformable and throughout divisible, and
that any essence can coalesce with any other, all being a unity not
withstanding. What I have said in this discussion of essence raised by the
expressions the needful bread and the peculiar people has been to distinguish
the meanings of essence. And since we have already seen that it is spiritual
bread for which we ought to ask, we must needs understand the essence to be akin
to the bread, so that just as material bread on assimilation into the body of
the nourished passes into its essence, so the living bread which is come down
from heaven being assimilated into the mind and soul may impart its own power to
him who has lent himself to nourishment from it, and so become the needful bread
for which we ask.
<p>
And again, in like manner, as the nourished attains strength varying according
to the character of the nourishment whether solid and fit for athletes or of the
nature of milk and vegetables, so it follows that when the word of God is given
either as milk as befits children, or as vegetables as suits invalids, or as
flesh as is proper for combatants, each of the nourished acquires this or that
power or nature according to the word to which he has lent himself.
<p>
Moreover, there is a kind of reputed nourishment which is in reality harmful, a
second that is productive of disease, and another that cannot even be
assimilated, and all of these may be transferred by analogy to varieties of
reputedly nourishing teachings. Needful, therefore, is the bread which
corresponds most closely to our rational nature and is akin to our very essence,
which invests the soul at once with well being and with strength, and, since the
Word of God is immortal, imparts to its eater its own immortality.
<p>
It is just this needful bread that seems to me to be otherwise termed in
Scripture a tree of life, he who stretches forth his hand to which and takes of
it shall live unto eternity. And under a third name this tree is termed wisdom
of God in Solomon's words: She is a tree of life to all that take hold upon her
and to those that lean upon her as upon the Lord she is safe. And since the
angels also are nourished by God's wisdom receiving power for the accomplishment
of their proper works from their contemplation in truth with wisdom, it is said
in Psalms that the angels also are nourished, men of God designated Hebrews
holding communion with the angels and, as it were, even becoming messfellows
with them.
<p>
Such is the meaning of the saying:Bread of angels hath man eaten. Far from us be
such poverty of mind as to suppose that it is of some material bread, such as is
recorded to have come down from heaven upon those who had quitted Egypt, that
the angels continually partake and are nourished, as though it was actually in
this that the Hebrews had communion with the angels, God's ministering spirits.
And while we are considering the needful bread and the tree of life and the
wisdom of God and the common nourishment of saintly men and angels, it is not
untimely to refer to the three men recorded in Genesis who were entertained by
Abraham and partook of three measures of fine flour of wheat kneaded into
ember-cakes, and to observe that this may perhaps simply be told in a figurative
sense.
<p>
It would show that saints are able upon occasion to impart spiritual and
rational nourishment not only to men but also to divine powers, either for their
benefit or for the exhibition of their most nourishing acquisitions, the angels
being cheered and nourished in such display and becoming the readier to
cooperate in every way and henceforth to conspire in the apprehension of fuller
and greater things by the man who has cheered and so to say nourished them with
his store of nourishing teachings already acquired.
<p>
No wonder that a man may nourish angels when even Christ avows himself to stand
before the door and knock in order that He may enter into him that opens to Him
and sup with him on his fare, thereafter Himself in turn to impart His own to
him who first according to his individual power has entertained the Son of God.
So then the partaker of the needful bread, having his heart confirmed, becomes a
son of God whereas he that has portion in the serpent is none other than a
spiritual Ethiopian and himself in turn changes into a snake by reason of the
serpent's toils so that, even should he express a desire for baptism, he is
reproached by the Word and hears it said: Snakes, offspring of vipers, who hath
prompted you to flee from the coming wrath?
<p>
And David speaks of the serpent body being fed on by Ethiopians: Thou has
shattered the heads of the serpents in the water, you hast crushed the serpent's
head, you hast given him to be food for the Ethiopian peoples. If it is not
absurd to suppose that, since the Son of God and also the Adversary are of
essential substances, either of them may become nourishment to this soul or
that, why need we hesitate in the case of all powers, better and worse,
including human beings, to believe that each one of us may derive nourishment
from any of them?
<p>
As Peter was about to commune with the centurion Cornelius and those who met
together with him in Caesarea, and thereafter to impart the words of God to the
Gentiles also, he saw, the vessel let down from heaven by four corners, in which
were all manner of quadrupeds and reptiles and beasts of the earth, whereupon he
was also bidden rise up and stay and eat, and after he had said in deprecation:
Thou knowest that nothing common or unclean hath ever entered my mouth, he was
commanded to call no man common or unclean because what God had made clean ought
not to be made common by Peter; in the words of the passage, what things God
hath made clean make not you common.
<p>
Accordingly the clean and unclean food distinguished according to the law of
Moses in terms of various animals bear an analogy to the differing characters of
rational beings and teaches that some are nourishing for us but others the
reverse until God has cleansed and made all, or those from every race,
nourishing. But while that is indeed so and while there is such diversity among
foods, the needful bread, for which we ought to pray in order to be counted
worthy of it, and, being nourished by the Word that was God with God in the
beginning to be made divine God, is one and transcends all the foods mentioned.
<p>
But it will be said that the word epiousion, needful, is formed from epienai, to
go on, so that we are bidden to ask for the bread proper to the coming age, in
order that God may take it in advance and bestow it on us now. Thus what was to
be given as it were tomorrow would be given us today, today being taken to mean
the present age, tomorrow the coming. Since, however, as far as I can judge, the
preceding interpretation is better, let us go on to consider the added reference
to today in Matthew or the expression daily written in Luke.
<p>
To call the whole present age today is a usage frequent in the Scriptures, as in
the passages: He is father of the Moabites until today, and He is father of the
Ammonites until today, and this account has been reported among Jews until
today, and in the Psalms, Today if you hear His voice harden not your hearts. In
Joshua, this is expressed very clearly: Turn not away from the Lord in the days
of today. And if today means the whole present age, yesterday is probably the
bygone age. That I have understood to be its meaning in Psalms and in Paul in
the Epistle to Hebrews.
<p>
In Psalms it is thus: A thousand years are in thine eyes as a yesterday that had
passed&mdash;whatever the much talked of millennium means, it is likened to
yesterday as opposed to today; and in the apostle it is written, Jesus Christ is
the same yesterday and today and unto the ages. No wonder that the whole of an
age counts with God as the space of a single day with us, aye and less as I
think. We may also consider whether the accounts of feasts or assemblies
recorded in terms of days or months or seasons or years have symbolical
references to ages. For if the law contains a shadow of coming things, its many
Sabbaths must be a shadow of many days and its moons come round in the course of
intervals of time, completed by some manner of a moon's conjunction with some
sun.
<p>
And if a first month and tenth till fourteenth day and a feast of unleavened
bread from fourteenth till twenty-first contain a shadow of coming things, who
is wise and to such a degree God's friend as to have vision of the first among
many months and its tenth day and so on? What need I say of that feast of seven
weeks of days, and of that seventh month whose new moon is a day of trumpets and
on whose tenth day falls a day of atonement, which are known to God alone who
has enacted them? Who has to such a degree received the mind of Christ as to
interpret those seventh years of freedom for Hebrew domestic slaves and of
remission of debts and of cessation from tillage of the holy land?
<p>
And over and above the feast of every seven years there is yet another year, the
so-called Jubilee, clearly to imagine whose nature even partially, or the true
laws to be fulfilled in it, is for no one save Him who has contemplated the
Father's counsel in reference to the order in all the ages according to His
unsearchable judgments and His univestigable ways. In trying to reconcile two
apostolic passages it has often occurred to me to raise the question how there
can be consummation of ages at which Jesus has been manifested once for all unto
abolition of sins if there are going to be ages following after this. The
Apostles' passages are as follows: In the Epistle to Hebrews, but now at a
consummation of the ages He hath been manifested once for all unto abolition of
sins through His sacrifice; but in the Epistle to Ephesians, in order that He
may show forth, in the years following, the exceeding riches of His Grace in
kindness toward us.
<p>
Well, in conjecture as to matters so great, I believe that, just as the year's
consummation is it's last month after which arises another month's beginning, so
probably the present age is a consummation of numerous ages completing as it
were a year of ages, and after it certain coming ages will arise whose beginning
is the coming age, and in those coming ages God shall show forth the riches of
His Grace in kindness, when the greatest sinner, who for having spoken ill
against the Holy Spirit is held fast by his sin throughout the present age and
the coming one from beginning to end, shall after that, I know not how, receive
a dispensation.
<p>
When a man has had vision of these things and has given thought to a week of
ages with intent to contemplate a kind of holy sabbath&mdash;keeping and a month of
ages to see God's holy new moon, and a year of ages to survey the feasts of the
year when every male must appear before the Lord God, and the corresponding
years of so many ages to discern the seventh holy year, and seven weekly years
of ages to sing a hymn to the Enactor of Laws so great, how can he after such
consideration cavil over what is the merest fraction of an hour in the day of
such an age, instead of doing everything to become, through his preparation
here, worthy of obtaining the needful bread and to receive it while it is today
and daily, what daily means being already clear from the foregoing explanations.
<p>
For he who prays today to God, who is from infiniti to infiniti, not only for
today but also in a sense for that which is daily shall be enabled to receive
from Him who hath power to bestow exceedingly above what we ask or think even
things&mdash;to use extreme language&mdash;which transcend those that eye hath not seen
and ear hath not heard and that have not gone up into the heart of man. These
considerations seem to me to have been very necessary for the understanding of
both the expressions today and daily when we are praying that the needful bread
be given us from His Father.

<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C18"></A>XVIII.</SPAN>&nbsp;AND FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS AS WE ALSO HAVE FORGIVEN OUR DEBTORS</b>
<p>
And forgive us our Debts as we also have forgiven our Debtors, or as Luke has
it, And forgive us our Sins, for we also ourselves forgive everyone in Debt to
us. Concerning debts the Apostle also says: Pay your debts to all&mdash;to whom you
owe tribute, tribute, to whom fear, fear, to whom taxes, taxes, to whom honor,
honor: owe no man anything save mutual love.
<p>
We owe therefore in having certain duties not only in giving but also in kind
speech and corresponding actions, and indeed we owe a certain disposition
towards one another. Owing these things, we either pay them through discharging
the commands of the divine law, or failing to pay them, in contempt of the
salutary word, we remain in debt. The like reflection applies to debts toward
brothers, to those who in the religious sense have been born again with us in
Christ, as well as to those who have a common mother or father with us.
<p>
We also have a certain debt toward fellow citizens, and another toward all men
in common, in particular toward guests and toward men at the age of fatherhood,
and another toward such as it is right that we should honor as sons or as
brothers. He, therefore, who does not do what is a debt to be discharged to
brothers remains a debtor for what he has not done. So, too, should we fail in
what falls, at the prompting of the charitable spirit of wisdom, to human beings
also at our hands, our indebtedness becomes the greater. Indeed, we also have
debt in personal concerns&mdash;to use the body in a certain way, so as not to wear
out the flesh of the body through love of pleasure, and on the other hand to
treat the soul with a certain care, and to take forethought for the keenness of
the mind, and for our speech that it be without sting and helpful and not
trifling. Whenever we fail to perform what we owe, even to ourselves, the
heavier does our debt become.
<p>
Besides all these, being above all a creation and formation of God, we owe it to
preserve a certain disposition towards Him with love that is from a whole heart
and from a whole strength and from a whole mind, and if we fail to achieve this
we remain God's debtors, sinning against the Lord. And who in that case shall
pray for us? For if a man sinning sin against a man, then shall they pray for
him: but if he sin against the Lord, who shall pray for him? as Eli says in the
first book of Kings.
<p>
Moreover, we are debtors to Christ who bought us with His own blood, just as
every house slave is also debtor to his purchaser for the sum of money given for
him. We have also a certain indebtedness to the Holy Spirit: we are paying it
when we do not grieve Him in whom we were sealed unto a day of redemption, and
when, without grieving Him, we bear the fruits demanded of us, He being present
with us and quickening our soul.
<p>
And even though we do not know precisely which is our individual angel that
looks upon the face of the Father in heaven, it is at least manifest to each of
us upon reflection that we are debtors to him also for certain things. And
inasmuch as we are in a world theater both of angels and of men, one must know
that as the performer in a theater owes it to say or do certain things in sight
of the spectators, and if he fails to perform this is punished as having
insulted the whole theater, so we, too, owe to the whole world, to all the
angels and the race of men alike, those things which, if we have the will, we
shall learn of wisdom.
<p>
Apart from those more general debts, there is a certain indebtedness to a widow
who is being provided for by the church, a second to a deacon, another to an
elder, while that to a bishop is heaviest of all&mdash;being demanded by the Savior
of the whole church and avenged if not paid. As already said, the Apostle
mentions a certain common debt between husband and wife, when he says: Let the
husband pay his indebtedness to the wife and wife likewise to the husband, and
continues Deprive not one another.
<p>
But what need is there, when readers of this writing select their own examples
from the record, for me to speak of all the things we owe which we either fail
to pay and so come to be restrained or else pay and come to be free? Suffice it
to say that it is impossible while in this life to be without debt at any hour
of night or day. In owing, a man either pays or else withholds the indebtedness.
He may either pay or withhold in this life. Some indeed owe no man anything;
others pay off most and owe little; others pay little and owe more; and a man
may conceivably pay nothing and owe everything.
<p>
And besides, he who pays all so as to owe nothing may at sometimes effect his
object if he prays for forgiveness for previous indebtedness, inasmuch as such
forgiveness may reasonably be thought obtainable by one who has for sometime
made it his ambition to reach the position of having no obligation unpaid and
thus owing nothing. Our very activities in transgression leave their impression
within our mind and become the indictment against us on which we shall be
brought to trial when, as it were, the books that have been indicted by us all
shall be brought forth, in the time when we shall all stand before the judgment
seat of Christ that each may receive what he has earned through the body
according to his conduct whether good or bad.
<p>
It is also in reference to such indebtedness that it is said in the Proverbs:
Give not yourself in certainty to your shame, for if the man shall not have
ability to pay, they shall take your bed that is under you. But if we owe to so
many, it is certain that men owe to us also. Some owe to us as to human beings,
others as to fellow citizens, others as to fathers, some as to sons, yet others
as wives to husbands or as friends to friends. Whenever, accordingly, any of our
very numerous debtors have behaved too remiss in the matter of payment of there
dues to us, our more charitable course will be to bear them no grudge and to
remember our own indebtedness and how often we have failed to discharge them not
only towards men but also towards God himself.
<p>
Remembering what as debtors we have not paid but withheld during the time which
it was our duty to have done this or that for our neighbor had run by, we shall
be gentler toward those who have fallen in debt to us in turn and have not paid
their indebtedness, especially if we do not forget our transgressions against
the Divine and the unrighteousness we have spoken against the Height either in
ignorance of the truth or else in displeasure at the misfortunes that have
befallen us.
<p>
But if we refuse to become gentler towards those who have fallen in debt to us,
our experience will be that of him who did not remit the hundred shillings to
his fellow servant and of whom, according to the parable set down in the gospel,
though already pardoned, the master exacts in severity what had already been
remitted, saying to him: Wicked servant and slothful, was it not right for you
to pity your fellow servant as I also pitied you? Cast him into prison until he
pay all that is owed. And the Lord continues: So shall the heavenly Father do to
you also if you forgive not each his brother from your hearts.
<p>
It is however on profession of penitence that we are to forgive those who have
sinned against us, even though our debtor often does so; for He says: If your
brother sin against you seven times a day and seven times turn and say, &quot;I
repent,&quot; you shall forgive him. It is not we who are harsh towards the
impenitent, but they who are wicked to themselves, for he that spurns
instruction hates himself. Yet even in such cases we should seek in every way
that healing arise within him who is so completely perverted as not even to be
conscious of his own ills but to be drunken with a drunkenness more fatal than
from wine, from the darkening of evil.
<p>
When Luke says Forgive us our Sins he means the same as Matthew, since sins are
constituted when we owe and do not pay, though he does not appear to lend
support to him who would forgive only penitent debtors when he says that it is
enacted by the Savior that we ought in prayer to add: for we ourselves also
forgive everyone in debt to us. And it would seem that we have all authority to
forgive the sins that have been committed against us as is clear from both
clauses: as we also have forgiven our debtors; and for we ourselves also forgive
everyone in debt to us. But it is when a man is inspired by Jesus as were the
apostles, when he can be known from his fruits to have received the Spirit that
is Holy and to have become spiritual through being led by the Spirit after the
manner of a Son of God unto every reasonable duty, that he forgives whatsoever
God has forgiven and holds those sins that are irremediable, and as the prophets
served God in speaking not their own message but that of the divine Will, so he
too serves the God who alone has authority to forgive.
<p>
In the Gospel according to John the language referring to the forgiveness
exercised by the apostles runs thus: Receive the Holy Spirit: whosoever's sins
you forgive, they are forgiven unto them: whosoever's you hold, they are held.
Anyone taking these words without discrimination might blame the apostles for
not forgiving all men in order that all might be forgiven but holding the sins
of some so that they are held with God also on their account.
<p>
It is helpful to take an example from the Law with a view to understand God's
forgiveness of sins through men. Legal priests are prohibited from offering
sacrifice for certain sins in order that the persons for whom the sacrifices are
made may have their misdeeds forgiven; and though the priest has authority to
make offerings for certain involuntary or willful misdeeds, he of course does
not presume to offer a sacrifice for sin in cases of adultery or willful murder
or any other more serious offence.
<p>
So, too, the apostles, and those who have become like apostles, being priests
according to the Great High Priest and having received knowledge of the service
of God, know under the Spirit's teaching for which sins, and when, and how they
ought to offer sacrifices, and recognize for which they ought not to do so. Thus
Eli the priest, knowing that his sons Hophni and Phineahas are sinners, with a
sense of his inability to cooperate with them for forgiveness of sins, confesses
his despair of such a result in his words:
<p>
If a man sins against a man, then shall they pray for him, but if he sin against
the Lord, who shall pray for him? I know not how it is, but there are some who
have taken upon themselves what is beyond priestly dignity, perhaps through
utter lack of accurate priestly knowledge, and are proud of their ability to
pardon even acts of idolatry and to forgive acts of adultery and fornication,
claiming that even sin unto death is absolved through their prayer for those who
have dared to commit such.
<p>
They do not read the words: There is sin unto death; not for it do I say that a
man should ask. Nor should we omit to mention the resolute Job's offering of
sacrifice for his sons, with the words: Perhaps my sons have had evil thoughts
in their minds toward God. Though the sinful thoughts are doubtful and at worst
have not reached the lips, he offers his sacrifice for them.
<b>
<p align="left">
<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C19"></A>XIX.</SPAN>&nbsp;AND BRING US NOT INTO TEMPTATION BUT
DELIVER US FROM EVIL</b>
<p>
And bring us not into Temptation but deliver us from Evil. In Luke the words but
deliver us from Evil are omitted. Assuming that the Savior does not command us
to pray for the impossible, it appears to me to deserve consideration in what
sense we are bidden to pray not to enter into temptation when all human life on
earth is a test.
<p>
In that on earth we are beset by the flesh which wars against the spirit and
whose intent is emnity to God as it is by no means capable of being subject to
the law of God, we are in temptation. That all human life on earth is a trial we
have learned from Job in the words: Is not the life of men on earth a trial, and
the same thing is made plain from the seventeenth psalm in the words: In you
will I be delivered from trial. Paul, too, writing to the Corinthians says that
God bestows not freedom from temptation but freedom from temptation beyond one's
power.
<p>
More than human temptation has not possessed you, and God is to be trusted not
to let you be tempted beyond your power but to make the temptation be
accompanied by the outlet of power to endure it. Whether our wrestling is with
the flesh that lusts or wars against the spirit, or with the soul of all
flesh&mdash;in other words the ruling faculty, called the heart, of the body in
which it resides&mdash;as is the wrestling of those who are tempted with human
temptations, or, as advanced and maturer athletes, who no longer wrestle with
blood and flesh nor are reviewed in the human temptations which they have
already trampled down, our struggles are with the principalities and authorities
and world-rulers of His darkness and the Spiritual forces of evil, we have no
release from temptation.
<p>
In what sense then does the Savior bid us pray not to enter into temptation,
when God in some sense tempts all men? Think you, says Judith, not only to the
elders of that day but also to all readers of her writing, of all that He did
with Abraham and all His temptations of Isaac and all that befell Jacob in
Mesopotamia of Syria while he shepherded the flocks of Laban, his mother's
brother. For it is not that whereas He tested them by fire for the proving of
their hearts, the Lord who, for their admonishment, scourges those who approach
Him, now wreaks vengeance upon us.
<p>
And David declares as a general truth concerning all righteous men that Many are
the afflictions of the righteous, while in the acts the Apostle says: because it
is through many afflictions that we must enter into the kingdom of God. And if
we failed to understand what escapes most men in reference to prayer that we
enter not into temptation, we would at this point say that the apostles were not
heard in their prayers since throughout their whole time they endured countless
sufferings: in toils more abundantly, in blows more abundantly, in prisons above
measure, in deaths often, while Paul in particular: five times received forty
stripes save one at the hands of Jews, thrice was beaten with rods, once was
stoned, thrice was shipwrecked, passed a night and a day in the deep, a man in
every way afflicted, in straits, persecuted, cast down, confessing: Until the
present hour we have hungered, thirsted, gone naked, been buffeted, lacked rest,
toiled at work with our own hands. Reviled, we have blessed; persecuted, we have
borne up; slandered, we have exhorted.
<p>
When the apostles have failed in prayer, we might ask what hope there is for any
of their inferiors to obtain God's hearing when one prays? One ignorant of the
true meaning of the Savior's command will have reason to suppose that the words
in the twenty-fifth psalm, Test me, O Lord, and try me; assay my reins and my
heart with fire, are in opposition to our Lord's teaching about prayer. And when
has anyone ever believed that those of whom he had complete knowledge were free
of temptations?
<p>
And what time can be conceived during which a man could be lighthearted as
though he did not struggle to avoid sinning? Is a man poor? Let him beware lest
one day he steal and forswear by the name of God. Again, is he rich? Let him not
be lighthearted, for he may become completely false and say in exaltation,
&quot;Who sees me?&quot; Even Paul, for all his riches, in all manner of
discourse and in all manner of knowledge, is not released from the danger of
sinning on their account through excessive exaltation, but needs a stake of
Satan to buffet him in order that he may not be excessively exalted. Even though
a man may have a comparatively good conscience and fly up in alarm from things
evil, let him read what is said in the second book of the Chronicles of
Hezekiah, who is said to have fallen from the elevation of his heart.
<p>
And if, because I have not dwelt on the case of the poor, someone is
lighthearted&mdash;as though poverty involved no temptation&mdash;he must know that the
Plotter plots to cast down the needy and the poor, especially since according to
Solomon, the needy endure no threats. And what need is there to tell how many,
because of their material riches which they had failed to manage rightly, have
found a place in punishment along with the rich man in the Gospel? And how many,
because they bore poverty ignobly, with behavior more servile and base than was
seemly in Saints, have fallen away from their heavenly hope? Even they who are
midway between these extremes of riches and poverty are not by any means
released from sinning according to their possession, moderate though it be.
<p>
Again, one who is in bodily health and well being imagines that by virtue of his
mere health and well being he is outside of all temptation. And yet, whose sin
it is, apart from those in well being and in health, to corrupt the temple of
God, no one will venture to say because the meaning of the passage is clear to
everyone. And who in sickness has escaped the incitements to corrupt the temple
of God, having leisure at such time and readily admitting thoughts of unclean
things, not to speak of all the others things beside these which trouble him
unless he guards his heart with all vigilance?
<p>
Many a man, overcome by troubles and incapable of bearing sickness manfully, has
been shown to be suffering at the time from sickness rather of the soul than of
the body, and many another, ashamed to bear the name of Christ nobly, has,
through shunning disrepute, fallen into eternal shame. Again, a man may think
that he has respite from temptation when he is in honor among men. Yet is not
the Lord's saying, They have their reward from men, proclaimed to those who are
elated over their popularity? Do not the words strike dismay: How can you have
come to believe, when you have received glory from one another, and seek not the
glory which is from God alone?
<p>
And what need is there for me to recount the crimes done in pride by the reputed
noble, and the fawning submission of the so-called low born towards the reputed
noble by reason of their ignorance, a submission which separates from God men
who are devoid of genuine friendliness but feign that fairest of human
possessions&mdash;love. The whole life of man on earth is therefore a trial, as has
already been said. Let us for that reason pray for deliverance from trial not
through being exempt from it&mdash;that is an utter impossibility for beings on
earth&mdash;but through not succumbing under it.
<p>
It is when a man succumbs in the moment of tempting, I take it, that he enters
into temptation, being held in its nets. Into those nets the Savior entered for
the sake of those who had already been caught in them, and in the words of the
Song of Songs, looking out through the meshwork makes answer to those who have
been already caught by them and have entered into temptation, and says to those
who form His bride: Arise, my dear one, my fair one, my dove. To bring home the
fact that every time is one of temptation on earth, I will add that even he who
meditates upon the law of God day and night and makes a practice of carrying out
the saying, A righteous man's mouth shall meditate on wisdom, has no release
from being tempted. How many in their devotion to the examination of the divine
Scriptures have, through misunderstanding the messages contained in Law and
Prophets, devoted themselves to godless and impious or to foolish and ridiculous
opinions?
<p>
What need is there for me to answer, when there are countless examples of such
mistakes among those who do not seem to be open to the charge of righteousness
in their reading? The same fate has also overtaken many in their reading of the
Apostles and Gospels inasmuch as, through their own lack of discernment, they
fashion in imagination a Son or a Father other than the One divinely conceived
and truly recognized by Holy Writ. For one who fails to have true thoughts of
God or His Christ has fallen away from the true God and from His Only Begotten,
and his worship of the imaginary Father and Son, fashioned by his lack of
discernment, is no real worship. Such is his fate through having failed to
recognize the temptation present in the reading of Holy Writ to arm himself and
take a stand as for a struggle already upon him.
<p>
We ought therefore to pray, not that we be not tempted&mdash;that is
impossible&mdash;but that we be not encompassed by temptation, the fate of those who
are open to it and are overcome. Now since, outside of the Lord's Prayer, it is
written Pray that you enter not into temptation, the force of which may perhaps
be clear from what has already been said, whereas in the Lord's prayer we ought
to say to God our Father, Bring us not into Temptation, it is worth seeing in
what sense we ought to think of God as leading one who does not pray or is not
heard into temptation. If entering into temptation means being overcome, it is
manifestly out of the question to think that God leads anyone into temptation as
though He delivered him to be overcome.
<p>
The same difficulty awaits one no matter in what sense one may interpret the
words Pray that you enter not into temptation, for if it is an evil to fall into
temptation, which we pray may not be our fate, must it not be out of place to
think of the Good God, who is incapable of bearing evil fruits, as encompassing
anyone with evils? It is of service to cite in this connection what Paul has
said in the Epistle to Romans&mdash;thus: Claiming to be wise they became foolish
and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of
corruptible man and of winged and four footed and creeping things. Wherefore God
delivered them in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness to the dishonoring
of their bodies among themselves; and shortly after:
<p>
Therefore God delivered them unto passions of dishonor: for both their females
changed the natural use into the unnatural, and the males likewise setting aside
the natural use of the female, were consumed . . . and so on. And again shortly
after: And as they proved not to have God in full knowledge, God delivered them
unto a reprobate mind to do the unseemly.
<p>
We may simply confront dividers of the Godhead with all these passages and put
these questions to them since they hold that the good Father of Our Lord is
distinct from the God of the law. Is it the good God who leads into temptation
one who fails in prayer? Is it the Father of the Lord who delivers in the lusts
of their hearts those who have already done some sin unto uncleanness to the
dishonoring of their bodies among themselves?
<p>
Is it He who, as they themselves say, is free from judging and punishing, who
delivers unto passions of dishonor and unto a reprobate mind to do the unseemly
men who would not have fallen into the lusts of their hearts had they not been
delivered to them by God, who would not have succumbed to passions of dishonor
had they not been delivered to them by God, and who would not have lapsed into a
reprobate mind but for the fact that the so condemned had been delivered to it
by God.
<p>
I am well aware that these passages will trouble such thinkers exceedingly.
Indeed they have fashioned in imagination a God other than the Maker of heaven
and earth, because they find many such passages in the Law and the Prophets and
have been offended by the author of such utterances as not good. But I on my
part, for the sake of that question, raised in connection with the words Bring
us not into Temptation, which led to my citation of the apostle's words also,
must now consider whether I in turn find a solution of apparent contradictions
worth considering. Well, it is my belief that God rules over each rational soul,
having regard to its everlasting life, in such a way that it is always in
possession of free will and is itself responsible alike for being, in the better
way, in progress towards the perfection of goodness, or otherwise for descending
as the result of heedlessness to this or that degree of aggravation of vice.
<p>
Accordingly, since a swift and somewhat short cure gives rise in some men to a
contempt for the disease into which they have fallen, with the possible result
of their incurring it a second time, He will in such other cases with good
reason allow the vice to increase to a certain extent, suffering it even to be
aggravated in them to the verge of incurableness, in order that they may be
sated through long continuance in the evil and through surfeit of the sin for
which they lust, and may be brought to a sense of their injury, and, having
learned to hate what formerly they welcomed, may be enabled when cured to enjoy
more steadfastly the health which their cure has brought to their souls. So it
was that the mixed throng among the Children of Israel, once fell into lust.
<p>
Sitting down they and the Children of Israel cried out saying, &quot;Who will
give us flesh to eat? We remember the fish we used to eat freely in Egypt, and
the cucumbers and melons and leeks and onions and garlic, but now is our soul
parched; our eyes are on nothing save the manna.&quot; Then, shortly after, it
is said: And Moses heard them crying in their tribes; each was at his door. And
again shortly after the Lord says to Moses: And you shall say to the people,
&quot;Sanctify yourselves for the morrow, and eat flesh, because you have cried
before the Lord saying, 'Who will give us flesh to eat, because it was well
with us in Egypt,' and the Lord shall give you flesh to eat. So eat flesh! Eat
it not one nor two nor five days, not ten nor twenty days; for a month of days
eat till it issue from your nostrils, and it shall make you ill, because you
have disobeyed the Lord who is among you, and have cried before Him, 'Wherefore have we left Egypt?'&quot; Let us therefore see whether the
narrative I have laid before you as a parallel is of help towards a solution of
the apparent contradiction in the clause Bring us not into temptation and in the
words of the apostle. Having fallen into lust, the mixed throng among the
Children of Israel cried and the Children of Israel with them.
<p>
Plainly so long as they were without the objects of their lust, they were not
able to be sated with them or cease their passion. In fact, it was the will of
the benevolent and good God, in giving them the object of their lust, not to
give it in such a way that any lust should be left in them. For that reason He
tells them to eat the flesh not one day&mdash;for had they partaken of the flesh a
short time their passion would have remained in their soul which would have been
kindled and set ablaze by it&mdash;nor does He give them the object of their lust
for two days.
<p>
It being His will to make it excessive for them, He utters what is, to one who
can understand, a threat rather than a promise of their apparent gratification,
saying, &quot;Neither shall you pass five days eating the flesh nor twofold
those, nor yet twofold those again, but eat flesh for a whole mouth, until such
time as your imagined good shall issue from your nostrils with choleric
affection, and with it your culpable and base lust for it. So shall I set you
free from all further lust of living, that when you have come out in such
condition you may be pure from lust and may remember all the troubles through
which you were set free from it.
<p>
Thus you shall be enabled either not to fall into it again, or, should that ever
happen through forgetfulness during the long lapse of time of your sufferings on
account of lust, if you take no heed to yourselves and not appropriate the Word
that completely frees you from every passion, if you fall into evil and at a
later time, through having come to lust again for creation, require a second
time to obtain the objects of your lust&mdash;in hatred of that object revert again
to the good and heavenly nourishment through despising that which you longed for
the most.&quot;
<p>
The like fate, accordingly, will overtake those who have changed the glory of
the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man and of
winged and four-footed and creeping things, and who are forsaken of God and
thereby delivered in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness to the
dishonoring of their bodies as men who have brought down to soulless insensible
matter the name of Him who has bestowed upon all sentient rational beings not
only sense but even rational sense, and to some indeed a complete and excellent
sense and intelligence. Such men are reasonably delivered to passion of dishonor
by the God whom they have forsaken, being forsaken by Him in return, receiving
the requital of error through which they came to love the itch for pleasure.
<p>
For it is more of a requital of their error for them to be delivered to passions
of dishonor than to be cleansed by the fire of Wisdom and to have each of their
debts exacted from them in prison to the last farthing. For in being delivered
to passions of dishonor which are not only natural but many of the unnatural,
they are debased and hardened by the flesh and become as though they had no soul
or intelligence any longer but were flesh entirely, whereas in fire and prison
they receive not requital of their error but benefaction for the cleansing of
the evil contracted in their error, along with salutary sufferings attendant in
the pleasure-loving and are thereby set free from all stain and blood in whose
defilement and pollution they had to their own undoing been unable even to think
of being saved.
<p>
So their God shall wash away the stain of the sons and daughters of Zion and
shall cleanse away the blood from their midst with a spirit of judgment and a
spirit of burning: for He comes in as the fire of a furnace and as soap, washing
and cleansing those who are in need of such remedies because it has not been
their clear desire to have knowledge of God. After being delivered to these
remedies they will of their own accord hate the reprobate mind, for it is God's
will that a man acquire goodness not as under necessity but of his own accord.
Some, it may well be, will have had difficulty in perceiving the baseness of
evil as the result of long familiarity with it, but then turning away from it as
falsely taken to be good.
<p>
Consider too, whether God's reason for hardening the heart of Pharaoh also is
that he may, because hardened, be unable to say, as in fact he did, &quot;The
Lord is righteous, but I and my people are impious.&quot; Rather it is that he
needs more and more to be hardened and to undergo certain sufferings, in order
that he may not, as the result of a too speedy end to the hardening, despise
hardening as an evil and frequently again deserve to be hardened.
<p>
If their nets are not wrongfully stretched for birds, according to the statement
in the Proverbs, but God rightly leads men into the snare, as one has said, You
led us into the snare, and if not even a sparrow, cheapest of birds, falls into
the snare without the counsel of the Father, its fall into the snare being due
to the failure to use aright its control of its wings given to it to soar, let
us pray to do nothing to deserve being brought into temptation by the righteous
judgment of God, as in the case with everyone who is delivered by God in the
lusts of his own heart unto uncleanness, or delivered unto passions of dishonor,
or as not having proved to have God in full knowledge, is delivered unto a
reprobate mind to do the unseemly. The use of temptation is somewhat as follows.
Through temptations the content of our soul, which is a secret to all except
God, ourselves included, becomes manifest, in order that it may no longer be a
secret to us what manner of men we are but that we may have fuller knowledge of
ourselves and realize, if we choose, our own evils and be thankful for the
blessings manifested to us through temptations. That the temptations which
befall us take place for the revealing of our true nature or the discerning of
what is hidden in our heart, is set forth by the Lord's saying in Job and by the
scripture in Deuteronomy, which runs thus: Think you that I have uttered speech
to you for any reason other than that you may be revealed as righteous?
<p>
And in Deuteronomy: He afflicted you and starved you and gave you manna to eat,
and He led you about in the wilderness where biting serpents and scorpions and
thirst are, that the things in your heart might be discerned. And if we desire
references to plain history, it is matter of knowledge that Eve's readiness to
be deceived and unsoundness of thought did not originate when in disobedience to
God she hearkened to the serpent, but had already been betrayed, the reason for
the serpent's having engaged her being that with its peculiar wisdom it had
perceived her weakness.
<p>
Nor was it the beginning of evil in Cain where he slew his brother, for already
the heart-knowing God had little regard for Cain and his sacrifices. It was
simply that his wickedness became manifest when he took Abel's life. Had Noah
not drunk of the wine that he cultivated and become intoxicated and uncovered
himself, neither Ham's indiscretion and irreverence towards his father nor his
brother's reverence and modesty towards their parent would have been revealed.
<p>
Though Esau's plot against Jacob seemed to have provided an excuse for his being
deprived of the blessing, his soul even before that had roots of fornication and
profanity. And we should never have known of the splendor of Joseph's
self-control, prepared as he was against falling a victim to any lust, had his
master's wife not fallen in love with him. Let us therefore, in the intervals
between the succession of temptations, make a stand against the impending trial,
and prepare ourselves for all possible contingencies&mdash;in order that, come what
may, we may not be convicted of unreadiness but may be shown to have braced
ourselves with the utmost care. For when we have carried out all our part, the
deficiency caused by human weakness will be filled up by God who cooperates for
good in all things with those who love Him, and whose future growth has been
foreseen according to His unerring knowledge.
<p>
In the words Bring us not into Temptation Luke seems to me to have virtually
taught Deliver us from Evil also. In any case it is natural that the Lord should
have addressed the briefer form to the disciple as he had already been helped,
but the more explicit to the many who were in need of clearer teaching. God
delivers us from Evil, not when the enemy does not engage us at all in conflict
through any of his own wiles or those of the ministers of his will, but when we
make a manful stand against contingencies and are victorious.
<p>
In that sense I have also taken the words: Many are the afflictions of the
righteous: and He delivers them from them all. For God delivers us from
afflictions not when afflictions are no more&mdash;and surely Paul's expression in
everything afflicted implies that affliction had never yet ceased&mdash;but when, by
God's help, under affliction we are not straitened.
<p>
According to a usage native to Hebrews, 'affliction' denotes misfortune that
happens without reference to a human will, whereas 'straitening' refers to the
will overcome by affliction and surrendered to it: hence Paul well says: in
everything afflicted but not impoverished. And I consider the words in Psalms In
affliction you set me at large to be similar, for by 'setting at large' is
meant the joyousness and cheerfulness of temper which comes to us from God in
the season of misfortune through the cooperation and presence of God's
encouraging and saving Word. We are accordingly to understand deliverance from
evil in the same way. God delivered Job, not through the Devil's failure to
receive authority to beset him with certain temptations&mdash;for he did receive
it&mdash;but through his own avoidance of sin in the sight of God amidst all that
befell him and through the exhibition of his righteousness.
<p>
Thus he who had said: Does Job revere God for nothing? Have you not fenced about
with a circle his goods without and his goods within the house and the goods of
all who are his, and blessed his work and made his flocks and herds to abound on
the earth? But send forth your hand, and touch all that he has, and surely he
will curse you to your face, was put to shame as having thereby spoken falsely
against Job, for he, after all his suffering, did not, as the Adversary said,
curse God to His face, but even when delivered to the tempter he continued
steadfastly blessing God, reproving his wife for saying Speak you some word
against God and die, and rebuking her in the words: As one of the senseless
women have you spoken.
<p>
If we have accepted the good from the Lord's hand, shall we not endure the evil?
And a second time concerning Job the Devil said to the Lord: Skin for skin; all
that the man has he will pay for his soul. Nay but send forth your hand and
touch his bones and his flesh, and surely he will curse you to your face. But he
is overcome by the champion of virtue and shown to be a liar, for Job inspite of
the severest sufferings stood firm committing no sin with his lips in the sight
of God. Two falls did Job wrestle and conquer, but no third such struggle did he
undergo, for the threefold wrestling had to be reserved for the Savior, as it is
recorded in the three Gospels, when the Savior known in human form thrice
conquered the Enemy. In order therefore to ask of God intelligently that we
enter not into temptation and that we be delivered from Evil, let us consider
these things and investigate them in our own minds more carefully. Through
hearkening unto God let us become worthy to be heard by Him, and let our
entreaty be that when tempted we may not be brought to death, and that when
assailed by flaming darts of evil, we may not be set on fire by them.
<p>
All whose hearts are (as one of the Twelve Prophets says, as an ember-pan) are
set on fire by them, but not so they who with the shield of faith quench all the
flaming darts aimed at them by the Evil One, since they have within themselves
rivers of water springing up into life eternal which do not let the fire of the
Evil One prevail but readily undo it with the flood of their inspired and saving
thought that is impressed by contemplation of the truth upon the soul of him
whose study is to be spiritual.

<SPAN class="chapterno"><A NAME="C20"></A>XX.</SPAN>&nbsp;FORMALITIES OF PRAYER: CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
I think it not out of place to add, by way of completing my task in reference to
prayer, a somewhat elementary discussion of such matters as the disposition and
the posture that is right for one who prays, the place where one ought to pray,
the direction towards which one ought except in any special circumstances to
look, and the time suitable and marked out for prayer.
<p>
The seat of disposition is to be found in the soul, that of the posture in the
body. Thus Paul, as we observed above, suggests the disposition in speaking of
the duty of praying without anger and disputation and the posture in the words
lifting up holy hands, which he seems to me to have taken from the Psalms where
it stands thus&mdash;the lifting up of my hands as evening sacrifice; as to the
place I desire therefore that men pray in every place, and as to the direction
in the Wisdom of Solomon: that it might be known that it is right to go before
the sun to give thanks to you and to intercede with you towards the dawn of
light.
<p>
Accordingly it seems to me that one who is about to enter upon prayer ought
first to have paused awhile and prepared himself to engage in prayer throughout
more earnestly and intently, to have cast aside every distraction and confusion
of thought, to have bethought him to the best of his ability of the greatness of
Him whom he is approaching and of the impiety of approaching Him frivolously and
carelessly and, as it were, in contempt, and to have put away everything alien.
<p>
He ought thus to enter upon prayer with his soul, as it were, extended before
his hands, and his mind intent on God before his eyes, and his intellect raised
from earth and set toward the Lord of All before his body stands. Let him put
away all resentment against any real or imagined injurer in proportion to his
desire for God not to bear resentment against himself in turn for his injuries
and sins against many of his neighbors or any wrong deeds whatsoever upon his
conscience.
<p>
Of all the innumerable dispositions of the body that, accompanied by
outstretching of the hands and upraising of the eyes, standing is
preferred&mdash;inasmuch as one thereby wears in the body also the image of the
devotional characteristics that become the soul. I say that these things ought
to be observed by preference except in any special circumstances, for in special
circumstances, by reason of some serious foot disease one may upon occasion
quite properly pray sitting, or by reason of fevers or similar illnesses, lying,
and indeed owing to circumstances, if, let us say, we are on a voyage or if our
business does not permit us to retire to pay our debt of prayer, we may pray
without any outward sign of doing so.
<p>
Moreover, one must know that kneeling is necessary when he is about to arraign
his personal sins against God with supplication for their healing and
forgiveness, because it is a symbol of submission and subjection. For Paul says;
For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father from whom is all fatherhood named
in heaven and on earth. It may be termed spiritual kneeling, because of the
submission and self-humiliation of every being to God in the name of Jesus, that
the apostle appears to indicate in the words: that in the name of Jesus every
knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
<p>
It should not be supposed that beings in heaven have bodies so fashioned as
actually to possess knees, since their bodies have been described possibly as
spherical in form by those who have discussed these matters more minutely. He
who refuses to admit this will also, unless he outrages reason, admit the uses
of each of the members in order that nothing fashioned for them by God may be in
vain. One falls into error on either hand, whether he shall assert that bodily
members have been brought into being by God for them in vain and not for their
proper work, or shall say that the internal organs, the intestine included,
perform their proper uses even in heavenly beings. Exceedingly foolish will it
be to think that it is only their surface, as with statues, that is human in
form and nothing further underneath.
<p>
This much discussion will suffice, then, of kneeling and of seeing that: in the
name of Jesus every knee shall bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
To the same effect, it is written by the prophet: To me every knee shall bow. In
regard to place, it should be known that every place is rendered fit for prayer
by one who prays rightly, for in every place sacrifice is offered to me . . .
says the Lord, and I desire therefore that men pray in every place.
<p>
But to secure the performance of one's prayers in peace without distraction, the
rule is for every man to make choice, if possible, of what I may term the most
solemn spot in his house before he prays, considering in addition to his general
examination of it, whether any violation of law or right has not been done in
the place in which he is praying, so as to have made not only himself but also
the place of his personal prayer of such a nature that the regard of God has
fled from it.
<p>
And in reference to this matter of place, lengthy consideration leads me to say
what may seem to be harsh, but what, if one inquires into it carefully, may
possibly not invite contempt, namely that it is a question whether it is
reverent and pure to intercede with God in the place of that union which is not
unlawful but is conceded by the Apostle's word by way of indulgence not
injunction. For if it is not possible to give oneself to prayer as one ought
without devoting oneself to it by agreement for a season, the matter of the
place also may possibly deserve to be considered if possible.
<p>
Yet there is a certain helpful charm in a place of prayer being the spot in
which believers meet together. Also it may well be that the assemblies of
believers also are attended by angelic powers, by the powers of our Lord and
Savior himself, and indeed by the spirits of saints, including those already
fallen asleep, certainly of those still in life, though just how is not easy to
say. In reference to angels we may reason thus: If an angel of the Lord shall
encamp round about those that fear Him and shall deliver them, and if Jacob's
words are true, not only of himself but to all who have devoted themselves to
God, when we understand him to say the angel who delivers me from all evil . . .
it is natural to infer that, when a number of men are genuinely met for Christ's
glory, that angel of each man&mdash;who is round about each of those that
fear&mdash;will encamp with the man with whose guardianship and stewardship he has
been entrusted, so that when saints assemble together there is a twofold church,
the one of men the other of angels.
<p>
And although it is only the prayer of Tobit, and after him of Sarah who later
became his daughter-in-law owing to her marriage to Tobias, that Raphael says he
has offered up as a memorial, what happens when several are linked in one mind
and conviction and are formed into one body in Christ? In reference to the
presence of the power of the Lord with the church Paul says: you being gathered
together with my spirit and with the power of the Lord Jesus, implying that the
Lord Jesus' power is not only with the Ephesians but also with the Corinthians.
<p>
And if Paul, while still wearing the body, believed that he assisted in Corinth
with his spirit, we need not abandon the belief that the blessed departed in
spirit also, perhaps more than one who is in the body, make their way likewise
into the churches. For that reason we ought not to despise prayer in churches,
recognizing that it possesses a special virtue for him who genuinely joins in.
<p>
And just as Jesus' power and the spirit of Paul and similar men, and the angels
of the Lord who encamp round about each of the saints, are associated and join
with those who genuinely assemble themselves together, so we may conjecture that
if any man be unworthy of a holy angel and give himself up through sin and
transgressions in contempt of God to a devil's angel, he will perhaps, in the
event of those like him being few, not long escape that providence of those
angels which oversee the church by the authority of the divine will and will
bring the misdeeds of such persons to general knowledge; whereas if such persons
become numerous and meet as mere human societies with business of the more
material sort, they will not be overseen.
<p>
That is shown in Isaiah when the Lord says: neither if you shall come to appear
before me; for I will turn away my eyes from you, and even if you multiply your
supplication I will not pay attention.
<p>
For in place of the already mentioned twofold company of saintly men and blessed
angels there may, on the other hand, be a twofold association of impious men and
evil angels. Of such a congregation it might be said alike by holy angels and by
pious men: I sat not down with the council of vanity, and with transgressors I
will not enter in; I hated the church of evildoers and with the impious I will
not sit down. I think that it was also for such a reason that the people in
Jerusalem and the whole of Judea, having come to be in a state of great
sinfulness, became subject to their enemies through the abandonment by God and
the overshielding angels and the saving work of saintly men&mdash;having become
people who have abandoned the Law.
<p>
For whole gatherings are at times thus abandoned to fall into temptation in
order that even that which they seem to have may be taken away from them. Like
the fig tree that was cursed and taken away from the roots because it had not
given fruit to the hungering Jesus, they wither and lose any little amount they
once had of lively power according to faith.
<p>
So much for what seem to me to have been necessary observations in considering
the place of prayer and in setting forth its special virtue in respect to place
in the case of the meetings of saintly men who come together reverently in
churches. A few words may now be added in reference to the direction in which
one ought to look in prayer. Of the four directions, the North, South, East, and
West, who would not at once admit that the East clearly indicates the duty of
praying with the face turned towards it with the symbolic suggestion that the
soul is looking upon the dawn of the true light?
<p>
Should anyone, however, prefer to direct his intercessions according to the
aperture of the house, whichever way the doors of the house may face, saying
that the sight of heaven appeals to one with a certain attraction greater than
the view of the wall, and the eastward part of the house having no opening, we
may say to him that since it is by human arrangement that houses are open in
this or that direction but by nature that the East is preferred to all the other
directions, the natural is to be set before the artificial. Besides, on that
view why should one who wished to pray when in the open country pray to the East
in preference to the West? If, in the one case it is reasonable to prefer the
East, why should the same not be done in every case? Enough on that subject.
<p>
I have still to treat the topics of prayer, and therewith I purpose to bring
this treatise to an end. Four topics which I have found scattered throughout the
Scriptures appear to me to deserve mention, and according to these everyone
should organize their prayer. The topics are as follows: In the beginning and
opening of prayer, glory is to be ascribed according to one's ability to God,
through Christ who is to be glorified with Him, and in the Holy Spirit who is to
be proclaimed with Him.
<p>
Thereafter, one should put thanksgivings: common thanksgivings&mdash;into which he
introduces benefits conferred upon men in general&mdash;and thanksgivings for things
which he has personally received from God. After thanksgiving it appears to me
that one ought to become a powerful accuser of one's own sins before God and ask
first for healing with a view to being released from the habit which brings on
sin, and secondly for forgiveness for past actions. After confession it appears
to me that one ought to append as a fourth element the asking for the great and
heavenly things, both personal and general, on behalf of one's nearest and
dearest. And last of all, one should bring prayer to an end ascribing glory to
God through Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit. As I already said, I have found
these points scattered throughout the scriptures.
<p>
The element of glorious ascription occurs in these words in the one hundred and
third psalm:&mdash;O Lord, my God, how exceedingly you are magnified. You have put
on praise and majesty, who are He that wraps himself in light as in a mantel,
who stretches out the heaven like a curtain, who roofs His upper chambers with
waters, who makes clouds His chariot, who walks on wings of winds, who makes
winds His angels and flaming fire His ministers, who lays the foundations of the
earth for its safety&mdash;it shall not swerve for ever and ever; the deep is a
mantle of His vestment; on the mountains shall waters stand; from your rebuke
shall they flee; from the sound of your thunder shall they shrink in fear.
<p>
Indeed most of the psalm contains ascription of glory to the Father. But anyone
may select numerous passages for himself and see how broadly the element of
glorious ascription is scattered. Of thanksgiving, this may be set forth as an
example. It is found in the second book of Kings, and is uttered by David, after
promises made through Nathan to David, in astonishment at the bounties of God
and in thanksgiving for them. It runs: Who am I, O Lord my Lord, and what is my
house, that you have loved me to this extent? I am exceeding small in your
sight, my Lord, and yet you have spoken on behalf of the house of your servant
for a long time to come. Such is the way of man, O Lord my Lord, and what shall
David go on to say more to you? Even now you know your servant, O Lord. For your
servant have you wrought and according to your heart have you wrought all this
greatness to make it known to your servant that he should magnify you, O Lord my
Lord.
<p>
Of confessions we have an example in: From all my transgressions deliver me. And
elsewhere: My wounds have stunk and been corrupt because of my folly. I have
been wretched and bowed down utterly; all the day have I gone with sullen face.
Of petitions we have an example in the twenty-seventh psalm: Draw me not away
with sinners, and destroy me not with workers of unrighteousness, and the like.
And it is right as one began with ascription of glory, to bring one's prayers to
an end in ascription of glory, singing and glorifying the Father of all through
Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit&mdash;to whom be glory unto eternity.
<p>
Thus, Ambrosius and Tatiana, studious and genuine brethren in piety, according
to my ability I have struggled through my treatment of the subject of prayer and
of the prayer in the Gospels together with its preface in Matthew. But if you
press on to the things in front and forget those behind and pray for me in my
undertaking, I do not despair of being enabled to receive from God the Giver a
fuller and more divine capacity for all these matters, and with it to discuss
the same subject again in a nobler, loftier, and clearer way. Meanwhile,
however, you will peruse this with indulgence.</p>
