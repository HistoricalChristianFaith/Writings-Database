Regrettably, we have not found a clean OCR version of Rufinus' translation of Origen's books 1-10 Commentary on Romans, from which we could make a public domain English translation.<br>

If you become aware of one, please let us know by opening an issue on <a href='https://github.com/HistoricalChristianFaith/Writings-Database/issues'>this Github repository</a>.<br>

Here's a Latin version of it, in Migne's Patrologia-Graeca volume 14: <a href='https://archive.org/details/patrologiaecurs270unkngoog/page/n423/mode/2up'>https://archive.org/details/patrologiaecurs270unkngoog/page/n423/mode/2up</a><br>
<br>

It's also available in the Sources Chr√©tiennes Online volume 532, a French translation (which also shows the Latin alongside). However this is locked behind a Brepolis subscription (usually IP locked to subscribing college campuses networks): <a href='https://apps.brepolis.net/BrepolisPortal/default.aspx'>https://apps.brepolis.net/BrepolisPortal/default.aspx</a>

Finally, it is available in an English translation still in copyright via the Fathers of the Church series - you can search inside these copyrighted books at Google Books here: <a href='https://books.google.com/books/about/Commentary_on_the_Epistle_to_the_Romans.html?id=g1w-swfFF3MC'>Books 1-5</a>, <a href='https://books.google.com/books/about/Commentary_on_the_Epistle_to_the_Romans.html?id=3E9VjfiXWz0C'>Books 6-10</a>
