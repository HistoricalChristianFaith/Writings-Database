<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter I.-He Calls Upon God, and Proposes to Himself to Worship Him.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>1. I Call upon Thee, my God, my mercy, who madest me, and who didst not forget me, though forgetful of Thee. I call Thee into<SUP><A HREF="#P2258_883573">1</A></SUP> my soul, which by the desire which Thou inspirest in it Thou preparest for Thy reception. Do not Thou forsake me calling upon Thee, who didst anticipate me before I called, and didst importunately urge with manifold calls that I should hear Thee from afar, and be converted, and call upon Thee who calledst me. For Thou, O Lord, hast blotted out all my evil deserts, that Thou mightest not repay into my hands wherewith I have fallen from Thee, and Thou hast anticipated all my good deserts, that Thou mightest repay into Thy hands wherewith Thou madest me; because before I was, Thou wast, nor was I [anything] to which Thou mightest grant being. And yet behold, I am, out of Thy goodness, anticipating all this which Thou hast made me, and of which Thou hast made me. For neither hadst Thou stood in need of me, nor am I such a good as to! be helpful unto Thee,<SUP><A HREF="#P2259_884462">2</A></SUP> my Lord and God; not that I may so serve Thee as though Thou weft fatigued in working, or lest Thy power may be less if lacking my assistance nor that, like the land, I may so cultivate Thee that Thou wouldest be uncultivated did I cultivate Thee not but that I may serve and worship Thee, to the end that I may have well-being from Thee; from whom it is that! am one susceptible of well-being.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P2261_885072"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter II.-All Creatures Subsist from the Plenitude of Divine Goodness.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>2. For of the plenitude of Thy goodness Thy creature subsists, that a good, which could profit Thee nothing, nor though of Thee was equal to Thee, might yet be, since it could be made of Thee. For what did heaven and earth, which Thou madest in the beginning, deserve of Thee? Let those spiritual and corporeal natures, which Thou in Thy wisdom madest, declare what they deserve of Thee to depend thereon,-even the inchoate and formless, each in its own kind, either spiritual or corporeal, going into excess, and into remote unlikeness unto Thee (the spiritual, though formless, more excellent than if it were a formed body; and the corporeal, though formless, more excellent than if it were altogether nothing), and thus they as formless would depend upon Thy Word, unless by the same Word they were recalled to Thy Unity, and endued with form, and from Thee, the one sovereign Good, were all made very good. How have they deserved of Thee, that they should be even formless, since they would not be even this except from Thee?</P>

<P>3. How has corporeal matter deserved of Thee, to be even invisible and formless,<SUP><A HREF="#P2264_886254">3</A></SUP> since it were not even this hadst Thou not made it; and therefore since it was not, it could not deserve of Thee that it should be made? Or how could the inchoate spiritual creature<SUP><A HREF="#P2265_886451">4</A></SUP> deserve of Thee, that even it should flow darksomely like the deep,-unlike Thee, had it not been by the same Word turned to that by Whom it was created, and by Him so enlightened become light, although not equally, yet conformably to that Form which is equal unto Thee? For as to a body, to be is not all one with being beautiful, for then it could not be deformed; so also to a created spirit, to live is not all one with living wisely, for then it would be wise unchangeably. But it is good<SUP><A HREF="#P2266_887158">5</A></SUP> for it always to hold fast unto Thee,<SUP><A HREF="#P2267_887216">6</A></SUP> lest, in turning from Thee, it lose that light which it hath obtained in turning to Thee, and relapse into a light resembling the darksome deep. For even we ourselves, who in respect of the soul are a spiritual creature, having turned away from Thee, our light, were in that life "sometimes darkness; "<SUP><A HREF="#P2268_887908">7</A></SUP> and do labour amidst the remains of our darkness, until in Thy Only One we become Thy righteousness, like the mountains of God. For we have been Thy judgmentS, which are like the great deep.<SUP><A HREF="#P2269_888114">8</A></SUP> </P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter III.-Genesis 1. 3,-Of "Light,"-He Understands as It is Seen in the Spiritual Creature.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>4. But what Thou saidst in the beginning of the creation, "Let there be light, and there was light,"<SUP><A HREF="#P2273_888667">9</A></SUP> I do not unfitly understand of the spiritual creature; because there was even then a kind of life, which Thou mightest illuminate. But as it had not deserved of Thee that it should be such a life as could be enlightened, so neither, when it already was, hath it deserved of Thee that it should be enlightened. For neither could its formlessness be pleasing unto Thee, .unless it became light,-not by merely existing, but by beholding the illuminating light, and cleaving unto it; so also, that it lives, and lives happily,<SUP><A HREF="#P2274_889206">10</A></SUP> it owes to nothing whatsoever but to Thy grace; being converted by means of a better change unto that which can be changed neither into better nor into worse; the which Thou only art because Thou only simply art, to whom it is not one thing to live, another to live blessedly, since Thou art Thyself Thine own Blessedness.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter IV.-All Things Have Been Created by the Grace of God, and are Not of Him as Standing in Need of Created Things.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>5. What, therefore, could there be wanting unto Thy good, which Thou Thyself art, although these things had either never been, or had remained formless,-the which Thou madest not out of any want, but out of the plenitude of Thy goodness, restraining them and converting them to form not as though Thy joy were perfected by them? For to Thee, being perfect. their imperfection is displeasing, and therefore were they perfected by Thee, and were pleasing unto Thee; but not as if Thou wert imperfect, and wert to be perfected in their perfection. For Thy good Spirit was borne over the waters,<SUP><A HREF="#P2278_890393">11</A></SUP> not borne up by them as if He rested upon them. For those in whom Thy. good Spirit is said to rest,<SUP><A HREF="#P2279_890510">12</A></SUP> He causes to rest in Himself. But Thy incorruptible and unchangeable will, which in itself is all-sufficient for itself, was borne over that life which Thou hadst made, to which to live is not all one with living happily, since, flowing in its own darkness, it liveth also; for which it remaineth to be converted unto Him by whom it was made, and to live more and more by" the fountain of life," and in His light to "see light,"<SUP><A HREF="#P2280_890957">13</A></SUP> and to be perfected, and enlightened, and made happy.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P2282_891028"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter V.-He Recognises the Trinity in the First Two Verses of Genesis.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>6. Behold now, the Trinity appears unto me in an enigma, which Thou, O my God, art, since [Thou, O Father, in the Beginning of our wisdom,-Which is Thy Wisdom, born of Thyself, equal and co-eternal unto Thee,-that is, in Thy Son, hast created heaven and earth. Many things have we said of the heaven of heavens, and of the earth invisible and formless, and of the darksome deep, in reference to the wandering defects of its spiritual deformity, were it not converted unto Him from whom was its life, such as it was, and by His enlightening became a beauteous life, and the heaven of that heaven which was afterwards set between water and water. And under the name of God, I now held the Father, who made these things; and under the name of the Beginning,<SUP><A HREF="#P2284_891856">14</A></SUP> the Son, in whom He made these things; and believing, as I did, that my God was the Trinity, I sought further in His holy words, and behold, Thy Spirit was borne over the waters. Behold the Trinity, O my God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,-the Creator of all creation.</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P2286_892166"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VI.-Why the Holy Ghost Should Have Been Mentioned After the Mention of Heaven and Earth.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>7. But what was the cause, O Thou true-speaking Light? Unto Thee do I lift up my heart, let it not teach me vain things; disperse its darkness, and tell me, I beseech Thee, by our mother charity, tell me, I beseech Thee, the reason why, after the mention of heaven, and of the earth invisible and formless, and darkness upon the deep, Thy Scripture should then at length mention Thy Spirit? Was it because it was meet that it should be spoken of Him that He was "borne over," and this could not be said, unless that were first mentioned "over" which Thy Spirit may be understood to have been "borne?" For neither was He "borne over" the Father, nor the Son, nor could it rightly be said that He was "borne over" if He were "borne over" nothing. That, therefore, was first to be spoken of "over" which He might be "borne;" and then He, whom it was not meet to mention otherwise than as having been "borne." Why, then, was it not meet that it should otherwise be mentioned of Him, than as having been "borne over?"</P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P2289_893274"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VII.-That the Holy Spirit Brings Us to God.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>8. Hence let him that is able now follow Thy apostle with his understanding where he thus speaks, because Thy love "is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us;"<SUP><A HREF="#P2291_893515">15</A></SUP> and where, "concerning spiritual gifts," he teacheth and showeth unto us a more excellent way of charity;<SUP><A HREF="#P2292_893637">16</A></SUP> and where he bows his knees unto Thee for us, that we may know the super-eminent knowledge of the love of Christ.<SUP><A HREF="#P2293_893776">17</A></SUP> And, therefore, from the beginning was He super-eminently "borne above the waters." To whom shall I tell this? How speak of the weight of lustful desires, pressing downwards to the steep abyss? and how charity raises us up again, through Thy Spirit which was "borne over the waters?" To whom shall I tell it? How tell it? For neither are there places in which we are merged and emerge.<SUP><A HREF="#P2294_894185">18</A></SUP> What can be more like, and yet more unlike? They be affections they be loves; the filthiness of our spirit flowing away downwards with the love of cares, and the sanctity of Thine raising us upwards by the love of freedom from care; that we may lift our hearts<SUP><A HREF="#P2295_894505">19</A></SUP> unto Thee where Thy Spirit is "borne over the waters;" and that we may come to that pre-eminent rest, when our soul shall have passed through the waters which have no substance.<SUP><A HREF="#P2296_895377">20</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P2298_895778"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter VIII.-That Nothing Whatever, Short of God, Can Yield to the Rational Creature a Happy Rest.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>9. The angels fell, the soul of man fell<SUP><A HREF="#P2300_895919">21</A></SUP> and they have thus indicated the abyss in that dark deep, ready for the whole spiritual creation, unless Thou hadst said from the beginning, "Let there be light," and there had been light, and every obedient intelligence of Thy celestial City had cleaved to Thee, and rested in Thy Spirit, which unchangeably is "borne over" everything changeable. Otherwise, even the heaven of heavens itself would have been a darksome deep, whereas now it is light in the Lord. For even in that wretched restlessness of the spirits who fell away, and, when unclothed of the garments of Thy light, discovered their own darkness, dost Thou sufficiently disclose how noble Thou hast made the rational creature; to which nought which is inferior to Thee will suffice to yield a happy rest,<SUP><A HREF="#P2301_897459">22</A></SUP> and so not even herself. For Thou, O our God, shalt enlighten our darkness;<SUP><A HREF="#P2302_897831">23</A></SUP> from Thee are derived our garments of light,<SUP><A HREF="#P2303_897897">24</A></SUP> and then shall our darkness be as the noonday.<SUP><A HREF="#P2304_897962">25</A></SUP> Give Thyself unto me, O my God, restore Thyself unto me; behold, I love Thee, and if it be too little, let me love Thee more strongly. cannot measure my love, so that I may come to know how much there is yet wanting in me, ere my life run into Thy embracements, and not be turned away until it be hidden in the secret place of Thy Presence.<SUP><A HREF="#P2305_898325">26</A></SUP> This only I know, that woe is me except in Thee,-not only without, but even also within myself; and all plenty which is not my God is poverty to me.<SUP><A HREF="#P2306_899221">27</A></SUP> </P>

  <UL><P><A NAME="P2308_899253"></A>
<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter IX.-Why the Holy Spirit Was Only "Borne Over" The Waters.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>10. But was not either the Father or the Son "borne over the waters?" If we understand this to mean in space, as a body, then neither was the Holy Spirit; but if the incommutable super-eminence of Divinity above everything mutable, then both Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost were borne "over the waters." Why, then, is this said of Thy Spirit only? Why is it said of Him alone? As if He had been in place who is not in place, of whom only it is written, that He is Thy gift?<SUP><A HREF="#P2310_899793">28</A></SUP> In Thy gift we rest; there we enjoy Thee. Our rest is our place. Love lifts us up thither, and Thy good Spirit lifteth our lowliness from the gates of death.<SUP><A HREF="#P2311_899980">29</A></SUP> In Thy good pleasure lies our peace.<SUP><A HREF="#P2312_900033">30</A></SUP> The body by its own weight gravitates towards its own place. Weight goes not downward only, but to its own place. Fire tends upwards, a stone downwards. They are propelled by their own weights, they seek their own places. Oil poured under the water is raised above the water; water poured upon oil sinks under the oil. They are propelled by their own weights, they seek their own places. Out of order, they are restless; restored to order, they are at rest. My weight is my love;<SUP><A HREF="#P2313_900537">31</A></SUP> by it am I borne whithersoever I am borne. By Thy Gift we are inflamed, and are borne upwards; we wax hot inwardly, and go forwards. We ascend Thy ways that be in our heart,<SUP><A HREF="#P2314_900890">32</A></SUP> and sing a song of degrees; we glow inwardly with Thy fire, with Thy good fire, and we go, because we go upwards to the peace of Jerusalem; for glad was I when they said unto me, "Let us go into the. house of the Lord."<SUP><A HREF="#P2315_901130">33</A></SUP> There hath Thy good pleasure placed us, that we may desire no other thing than to dwell. there for ever.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter X.-That Nothing Arose Save by the Gift of God.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>11. Happy creature, which, though in itself it was other than Thou, hath known no other state than that as soon as it was made, it was, without any interval of time, by Thy Gift, which is borne over everything mutable, raised up by that calling whereby Thou saidst, "Let there be light, and there was light." Whereas in us there is a difference of times, in that we were darkness, and are made light;<SUP><A HREF="#P2319_901708">34</A></SUP> but of that it is only said what it would have been had it not been enlightened. And this is so spoken as if it had been fleeting and darksome before; that so the cause whereby it was made to be otherwise might appear,-that is to say, being turned to the unfailing Light it might become light. Let him who is able understand this; and let him who is not,<SUP><A HREF="#P2320_902079">35</A></SUP> ask of Thee. Why should he trouble me, as if I could enlighten any "man that cometh into the world?"<SUP><A HREF="#P2321_902287">36</A></SUP> </P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XI.-That the Symbols of the Trinity in Man, to Be, to Know, and to Will, are Never Thoroughly Examined.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>12. Which of us understandeth the Almighty Trinity?<SUP><A HREF="#P2325_902513">37</A></SUP> And yet which speaketh not of It, if indeed it be It? Rare is that soul which, while it speaketh of It, knows what it speaketh of. And they contend and strive, but no one without peace seeth that vision. I could wish that men would consider these three things that are in themselves. These three are far other than the Trinity; but I speak of things in which they may exercise and prove themselves, and feel how far other they be.<SUP><A HREF="#P2326_904338">38</A></SUP> But the three things I speak of are, To Be, to Know, and to Will. For I Am, and I Know, and I Will; I Am Knowing and Willing; and I Know myself to Be and to Will; and I Will to Be and to Know. In these three, therefore, let him who can see how inseparable a life there is,-even one life, one mind, and one essence; finally, how inseparable is the distinction, and yet a distinction. Surely a man hath it before him; let him look into himself, and see, and tell me. But when he discovers and can say anything of these, let him not then think that he has discovered that which is above these Unchangeable, which Is unchangeably, and Knows unchangeably, and Wills unchangeably. And whether on account of these three there is also, where they are, a Trinity; or whether these three be in Each, so that the three belong to Each; or whether both ways at once, wondrously, simply, and vet diversely, in Itself a limit unto Itself, yet illimitable; whereby It is, and is known unto Itself, and sufficeth to Itself, unchangeably the Self-same, by the abundant magnitude of its Unity,-who can readily conceive?

Whence as a skin hast Thou stretched out the firmament of Thy Book;<SUP><A HREF="#P2398_915915">98</A></SUP> that is to say, Thy harmonious words, which by the ministry of mortals Thou hast spread over us. For by their very death is that solid firmament of authority in Thy discourses set forth by them more sublimely extended above all things that are under it, the which, while they were living here, was not so eminently extended.<SUP><A HREF="#P2399_916521">99</A></SUP> Thou hadst not as yet spread abroad the heaven like a skin; Thou hadst not as yet noised everywhere the report of their deaths.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XX.-Concerning Reptiles and Flying Creatures (Ver. 20),-The Sacrament of Baptism Being Regarded.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>26. Let the sea also conceive and bring forth your works, and let the waters bring forth the moving creatures that have life.<SUP><A HREF="#P2491_937020">171</A></SUP> For ye, who "take forth the precious from the vile,"<SUP><A HREF="#P2492_937093">172</A></SUP> have been made the mouth of God, through which He saith, "Let the waters bring forth," not the living creature which the earth bringeth forth, but the moving creature having life, and the fowls that fly above the earth. For Thy sacraments, O God, by the ministry of Thy holy ones, have made their way amid the billows of the temptations of the world, to instruct the Gentiles in Thy Name, in Thy Baptism. And amongst these things, many great works of wonder have been wrought, like as great whales; and the voices of Thy messengers flying above the earth, near to the firmament of Thy Book; that being set over them as an authority, under which they were to fly whithersoever they were to go. For "there is no speech, nor language, where their voice is not heard;" seeing their sound<SUP><A HREF="#P2493_937898">173</A></SUP> "hath gone through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world," because Thou, O Lord, hast multiplied these things by blessing.<SUP><A HREF="#P2494_938784">174</A></SUP> </P>

<P>27. Whether do I lie, or do I mingle and confound, and not distinguish between the clear knowledge of these things that are in the firmament of heaven, and the corporeal works in the undulating sea and under the firmament of heaven? For of those things whereof the knowledge is solid and defined, without increase by generation, as it were lights of wisdom and knowledge, yet of these self-same things the material operations are many and varied; and one thing in growing from another is multiplied by Thy blessing, O God, who hast refreshed the fastidiousness of mortal senses; so that in the knowledge of our mind, one thing may, through the motions of the body, be in many ways<SUP><A HREF="#P2496_939483">175</A></SUP> set out and expressed. These sacraments have the waters brought forth;<SUP><A HREF="#P2497_939597">176</A></SUP> but in Thy Word. The wants of the people estranged from the eternity of Thy truth have produced them, but in Thy Gospel; because the waters themselves have cast them forth, the bitter weakness of which was the cause of these things being sent forth in Thy Word.</P>

<P>28. Now all things are fair that Thou hast made, but behold, Thou art inexpressibly fairer who hast made all things; from whom had not Adam fallen, the saltness of the sea would never have flowed from him,-the human race so profoundly curious, and boisterously swelling, and restlessly moving; and thus there would be no need that Thy dispensers should work in many waters,<SUP><A HREF="#P2499_940379">177</A></SUP> in a corporeal and sensible manner, mysterious doings and sayings. For so these creeping and flying creatures now present themselves to my mind, whereby men, instructed, initiated, and subjected by corporeal sacraments, should not further profit, unless their soul had a higher spiritual life, and unless, after the word of admission, it looked forwards to perfection.<SUP><A HREF="#P2500_940781">178</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>29. And hereby, in Thy Word, not the depth of the sea, but the earth parted from the bitterness of the waters,<SUP><A HREF="#P2504_941254">179</A></SUP> bringeth forth not the creeping and flying creature that hath life,<SUP><A HREF="#P2505_941374">180</A></SUP> but the living soul itself.<SUP><A HREF="#P2506_941422">181</A></SUP> For now hath it no longer need of baptism, as the heathen have, and as itself had when it was covered with the waters,-for no other entrance is there into the kingdom of heaven,<SUP><A HREF="#P2507_941620">182</A></SUP> since Thou hast appointed that this should be the entrance,-nor does it seek great works of miracles by which to cause faith; for it is not such that, unless it shall have seen signs and wonders, it will not believe,<SUP><A HREF="#P2508_941857">183</A></SUP> when now the faithful earth is separated from the waters of the sea, rendered bitter by infidelity; and "tongues are for a sign, not to those that believe, but to those that believe not."<SUP><A HREF="#P2509_942065">184</A></SUP> Nor then doth the earth, which Thou hast founded above the waters,<SUP><A HREF="#P2510_942155">185</A></SUP> stand in need of that flying kind which at Thy word the waters brought forth. Send Thy word forth into it by Thy messengers. For we relate their works, but it is Thou who workest in them, that in it they may work out a living soul. The earth bringeth it forth, because the earth is the cause that they work these things in the soul; as the sea has been the cause that they wrought upon the moving creatures that have life, and the fowls that fly under the firmament of heaven, of which the earth hath now no need; although it feeds on the fish which was taken out of the deep, upon that table which Thou hast prepared in the presence of those that believe.<SUP><A HREF="#P2511_943209">186</A></SUP> For therefore He was raised from the deep, that He might feed the dry land; and the fowl, though bred in the sea, is yet multiplied upon the earth. For of the first preachings of the Evangelists, the infidelity of men was the prominent cause; but the faithful also are exhorted, and are manifoldly blessed by them day by day. But the living soul takes its origin from the earth, for it is not profitable, unless to those already among the faithful, to restrain themselves from the love of this world, that so their soul may live unto Thee, which was dead while living in pleasures,<SUP><A HREF="#P2512_944674">187</A></SUP> -in death-bearing pleasures, O Lord, for Thou art the vital delight of the pure heart.</P>

<P>30. Now, therefore, let Thy ministers work upon the earth,-not as in the waters of infidelity, by announcing and speaking by miracles, and sacraments, and mystic words; in which ignorance, the mother of admiration, may be intent upon them, in fear of those hidden signs. For such is the entrance unto the faith for the sons of Adam forgetful of Thee, while they hide themselves from Thy face,<SUP><A HREF="#P2514_945173">188</A></SUP> and become a darksome deep. But let Thy ministers work even as on the dry land, separated from the whirlpools of the great deep; and let them be an example unto the faithful, by living before them, and by stimulating them to imitation. For thus do men hear not with an intent to hear merely, but to act also. Seek the Lord, and your soul shall live,<SUP><A HREF="#P2515_945543">189</A></SUP> that the earth may bring forth the living soul. "Be not conformed to this world."<SUP><A HREF="#P2516_945647">190</A></SUP> Restrain yourselves from it; the soul lives by avoiding those things which it dies by affecting. Restrain yourselves from the unbridled wildness of pride, from the indolent voluptuousness of luxury, and from the false name of knowledge;<SUP><A HREF="#P2517_945904">191</A></SUP> so that wild beasts may be tamed, the cattle subdued, and serpents harmless. For these are the motions of the mind in allegory; that is to say, the haughtiness of pride, the delight of lust, and the poison of curiosity are the motions of the dead soul; for the soul dies not so as to lose all motion, because it dies by forsaking the fountain of life,<SUP><A HREF="#P2518_946305">192</A></SUP> and so is received by this transitory world, and is conformed unto it.</P>

<P>31. But Thy Word, O God, is the fountain of eternal life, and passeth not away; therefore this departure is kept in check by Thy word when it is said unto us, "Be not conformed unto this world,"<SUP><A HREF="#P2520_946638">193</A></SUP> so that the earth may bring forth a living soul in the fountain of life,-a soul restrained in Thy Word, by Thy Evangelists, by imitating the followers of Thy Christ.<SUP><A HREF="#P2521_946824">194</A></SUP> For this is after his kind; because a man is stimulated to emulation by his friend.<SUP><A HREF="#P2522_946929">195</A></SUP> "Be ye," saith he, "as I am, for I am as you are."<SUP><A HREF="#P2523_947013">196</A></SUP> Thus in the living soul shall there be good beasts, in gentleness of action. For Thou hast commanded, saying, Go on with thy business in meekness, and thou shalt be beloved by all men;<SUP><A HREF="#P2524_947218">197</A></SUP> and good cattle, which neither if they eat, shall they over-abound, nor if they do not eat, have they any want;<SUP><A HREF="#P2525_947359">198</A></SUP> and good serpents, not destructive to do hurt, but "wise"<SUP><A HREF="#P2526_947440">199</A></SUP> to take heed; and exploring only so much of this temporal nature as is sufficient that eternity may be "clearly seen, being understood by the things that are."<SUP><A HREF="#P2527_947620">200</A></SUP> For these animals are subservient to reason,<SUP><A HREF="#P2528_947684">201</A></SUP> when, being kept in check from a deadly advance, they live, and are good.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XXII.-He Explains the Divine Image (Ver. 26) of the Renewal of the Mind.</FONT></P>

</UL><P>32. For behold, O Lord our God, our Creator, when our affections have been restrained from the love of the world, by which we died by living ill, and began to be a "living soul" by living well;<SUP><A HREF="#P2532_948216">202</A></SUP> and Thy word which Thou spakest by Thy apostle is made good in us, "Be not conformed to this world;" next also follows that which Thou presently subjoinedst, saying, "But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind,"<SUP><A HREF="#P2533_948616">203</A></SUP> -not now after your kind, as if following your neighbour who went before you, nor as if living after the example of a better man (for Thou hast not said, "Let man be made after his kind," but, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness"),<SUP><A HREF="#P2534_948882">204</A></SUP> that we may prove what Thy will is. For to this purpose said that dispenser of Thine,-begetting children by the gospel,<SUP><A HREF="#P2535_949021">205</A></SUP> -that he might not always have them "babes," whom he would feed on milk, And cherish as a nurse;<SUP><A HREF="#P2536_949140">206</A></SUP> "be ye transformed," saith He, "by the renewing of your mind, that he may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God."<SUP><A HREF="#P2537_949304">207</A></SUP> Therefore Thou sayest not, "Let man be made," but, "Let us make man." Nor sayest Thou, "after his kind," but, after "our image" and "likeness." Because, being renewed in his mind, and beholding and apprehending Thy truth, man needeth not man as his director<SUP><A HREF="#P2538_949582">208</A></SUP> that he may imitate his kind; but by Thy direction proveth what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of Thine. And Thou teachest him, now made capable, to perceive the Trinity of the Unity, and the Unity of the Trinity. And therefore this being said in the plural, "Let us make man," it is yet subjoined in the singular, "and God made man;" and this being said in the plural, "after our likeness," is subjoined in the singular, "after the image of God."<SUP><A HREF="#P2539_950068">209</A></SUP> Thus is man renewed in the knowledge of God, after the image of Him that created him;<SUP><A HREF="#P2540_950173">210</A></SUP> and being made spiritual, he judgeth all things,-all things that are to be judged,-"yet he himself is judged of no man."<SUP><A HREF="#P2541_950316">211</A></SUP> </P>

</UL><P>33. But that he judgeth all things answers to his having dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowls of the air, and over all cattle and wild beasts, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. For this he doth by the discernment of his mind, whereby he perceiveth the things "of the Spirit of God;"<SUP><A HREF="#P2545_950779">212</A></SUP> whereas, otherwise, man being placed in honour, had no understanding, and is compared unto the brute beasts, and is become like unto them.<SUP><A HREF="#P2546_950939">213</A></SUP> In Thy Church, therefore, O our God, according to Thy grace which Thou hast accorded unto it, since we are Thy workmanship created in good works,<SUP><A HREF="#P2547_951106">214</A></SUP> there are not only those who are spiritually set over, but those also who are spiritually subjected to those placed over them; for in this manner hast Thou made man, male and female,<SUP><A HREF="#P2548_951309">215</A></SUP> in Thy grace spiritual, where, according to the sex of body, there is not male and female, because neither Jew nor Greek, nor bond nor free.<SUP><A HREF="#P2549_951469">216</A></SUP> Spiritual persons, therefore, whether those that are set over, or those who obey, judge spiritually; not of that spiritual knowledge which shines in the firmament, for they ought not to judge as to an authority so sublime, nor doth it behove them to judge of Thy Book itself, although there be something that is not clear therein; because we submit our understanding unto it, and esteem as certain that even that which is shut up from our sight is rightly and truly spoken.<SUP><A HREF="#P2550_951965">217</A></SUP> For thus man, although now spiritual and renewed in the knowledge of God after His image that created him, ought yet to be the "doer of the law, not the judge."<SUP><A HREF="#P2551_953579">218</A></SUP> Neither doth he judge of that distinction of spiritual and carnal men, who are known to Thine eyes, O our God, and have not as yet made themselves manifest unto us by works, that by their fruits we may know them;<SUP><A HREF="#P2552_953813">219</A></SUP> but Thou, O Lord, dost already know them, and Thou hast divided and hast called them in secret, before the firmament was made. Nor doth that man, though spiritual, judge the restless people of this world; for what hath he to do to judge them that are without,<SUP><A HREF="#P2553_954096">220</A></SUP> knowing not which of them may afterwards come into the sweetness of Thy grace, and which continue in the perpetual bitterness of impiety?</P>

<P>34. Man, therefore, whom Thou hast made after Thine own image, received not dominion over the lights of heaven, nor over the hidden heaven itself, nor over the day and the night, which Thou didst call before the foundation of the heaven, nor over the gathering together of the waters, which is the sea; but he received dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and over all cattle, and over all the earth, and over all creeping things which creep upon the earth. For He judgeth and approveth what He findeth right, but disapproveth what He findeth amiss, whether in the celebration of those sacraments by which are initiated those whom Thy mercy searches out in many waters; or in that in which the Fish<SUP><A HREF="#P2555_954980">221</A></SUP> Itself is exhibited, which, being raised from the deep, the devout earth feedeth upon; or in the signs and expressions of words, subject to the authority of Thy Book,-such signs as burst forth and sound from the mouth, as it were flying under the firmament, by interpreting, expounding, discoursing, disputing, blessing, calling upon Thee, so that the people may answer, <I>Amen</I>. The vocal pronunciation of all which words is caused by the deep of this world, and the blindness of the flesh, by which thoughts cannot be seen, so that it is necessary to speak aloud in the ears; thus, although flying fowls be multiplied upon the earth, yet they derive their beginning from the waters. The spiritual man judgeth also by approving what is right and reproving what he finds amiss in the works and morals of the faithful, in their alms, as if in "the earth bringing forth fruit;" and he judgeth of the "living soul," rendered living by softened affections, in chastity, in fastings, in pious thoughts; and of those things which are perceived through the senses of the body. For it is now said, that he should judge concerning those things in which he has also the power of correction.</P>

<FONT  SIZE=3>Chapter XXIV.-Why God Has Blessed Men, Fishes, Flying Creatures, and Not Herbs and the Other Animals (Ver. 28).</FONT></P>

</UL><P>35. But what is this, and what kind of mystery is it? Behold, Thou blessest men, O Lord, that they may "be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth;"<SUP><A HREF="#P2559_956450">222</A></SUP> in this dost Thou not make a sign unto us that we may understand something? Why hast Thou not also blessed the light, which Thou calledst day, nor the firmament of heaven, nor the lights, nor the stars, nor the earth, nor the sea? I might say, O our God, that Thou, who hast created us after Thine Image,-I might say, that Thou hast willed to bestow this gift of blessing especially upon man, hadst Thou not in like manner blessed the fishes and the whales, that they should be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the waters of the sea, and that the fowls should be multiplied upon the earth. Likewise might I say, that this blessing belonged properly unto such creatures as are propagated from their own kind, if I had found it in the shrubs, and the fruit trees, and beasts of the earth. But now is it not said either unto the herbs, or trees, or beasts, or serpents, "Be fruitful and multiply;" since all these also, as well as fishes, and fowls, and men, do by propagation increase and preserve their kind.</P>

<P>36. What, then, shall I say, O Thou Truth, my Light,-"that it was idly and vainly said?" Not so, O Father of piety; far be it from a minister of Thy word to say this. But if I understand not what Thou meanest by that phrase, let my betters-that is, those more intelligent than I-use it better, in proportion as Thou, O my God, hast given to each to understand. But let my confession be also pleasing before Thine eyes, in which I confess to Thee that I believe, O Lord, that Thou hast not thus spoken in vain; nor will I be silent as to what this lesson suggests to me. For it is true, nor do I see what should prevent me from thus understanding the figurative sayings<SUP><A HREF="#P2561_958150">223</A></SUP> of Thy books. For I know a thing may be manifoldly signified by bodily expression which is understood in one manner by the mind; and that that may be manifoldly understood in the mind which is in one manner signified by bodily expression. Behold, the single love of God and of our neighbour, by what manifold sacraments and innumerable languages, and in each several language in how innumerable modes of speaking, it is bodily expressed. Thus do the young of the waters increase and multiply. Observe again, whosoever thou art who readest; behold what Scripture delivers, and the voice pronounces in one only way, "In the beginning God created heaven and earth;" is it not manifoldly understood, not by any deceit of error, but by divers kinds of true senses?<SUP><A HREF="#P2562_958943">224</A></SUP> Thus are the offspring of men "fruitful" and do "multiply."</P>

<P>37. If, therefore, we conceive of the natures of things, not allegorically, but properly, then does the phrase, "be fruitful and multiply," correspond to all things which are begotten of seed. But if we treat those words as taken figuratively (the which I rather suppose the Scripture intended, which doth not, verily, superfluously attribute this benediction to the offspring of marine animals and man only), then do we find that "multitude" belongs also to creatures both spiritual and corporeal, as in heaven and in earth; and to souls both righteous and unrighteous, as in light and darkness; and to holy authors, through whom the law has been furnished unto us, as in the firmament<SUP><A HREF="#P2564_959724">225</A></SUP> which has been firmly placed betwixt waters and waters; and to the society of people yet endued with bitterness, as in the sea; and to the desire of holy souls, as in the dry land; and to works of mercy pertaining to this present life, as in the seed-bearing herbs and fruit-bearing trees; and to spiritual gifts shining forth for edification, as in the lights of heaven; and to affections formed unto temperance, as in the living soul. In all these cases we meet with multitudes, abundance, and increase; but what shall thus "be fruitful and multiply," that one thing may be expressed in many ways, and one expression understood in many ways, we discover not, unless in signs corporeally expressed, and in things mentally conceived. We understand the signs corporeally pronounced as the generations of the waters, necessarily occasioned by carnal depth; but things mentally conceived we understand as human generations, on account of the fruitfulness of reason. And therefore do we believe that to each kind of these it has been said by Thee, O Lord, "Be fruitful and multiply." For in this blessing I acknowledge that power and faculty has been granted unto us, by Thee, both to express in many ways what we understand but in one, and to understand in many ways what we read as obscurely delivered but in one. Thus are the waters of the sea replenished, which are not moved but by various significations; thus even with the human offspring is the earth also replenished, the dryness<SUP><A HREF="#P2565_961244">226</A></SUP> whereof appeareth in its desire, and reason ruleth over it.</P>

</UL><P>38. I would also say, O Lord my God, what the following Scripture reminds me of; yea, I will say it without fear. For I will speak the truth, Thou inspiring me as to what Thou wiliest that I should say out of these words. For by none other than Thy inspiration do I believe that I can speak the truth, since Thou art the Truth, but every man a liar.<SUP><A HREF="#P2569_961767">227</A></SUP> And therefore he that "speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; "<SUP><A HREF="#P2570_961870">228</A></SUP> therefore that I may speak the truth, I will speak of Thine. Behold, Thou hast given unto us for food "every herb bearing seed," which is upon the face of all the earth, "and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed."<SUP><A HREF="#P2571_962130">229</A></SUP> Nor to us only, but to all the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the earth, and to all creeping things;<SUP><A HREF="#P2572_962259">230</A></SUP> but unto the fishes, and great whales, Thou hast not given these things. Now we were saying, that by these fruits of the earth works of mercy were signified and figured in an allegory, the which are provided for the necessities of this life out of the fruitful earth. Such an earth was the godly Onesiphorus, unto whose house Thou didst give mercy, because he frequently refreshed Thy Paul, and was not ashamed of his chain.<SUP><A HREF="#P2573_962706">231</A></SUP> This did also the brethren, and such fruit did they bear, who out of Macedonia supplied what was wanting unto him.<SUP><A HREF="#P2574_962843">232</A></SUP> But how doth he grieve for certain trees, which did not afford him the fruit due unto hi.m, when he saith, "At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge."<SUP><A HREF="#P2575_963090">233</A></SUP> For these fruits are due to those who minister spiritual<SUP><A HREF="#P2576_963170">234</A></SUP> doctrine, through their understanding of the divine mysteries; and they are due to them as men. They are due to them, too, as to the living soul, supplying itself as an example in all continency; and due unto them likewise as flying creatures, for their blessings which are multiplied upon the earth, since their sound went out into all lands.<SUP><A HREF="#P2577_963882">235</A></SUP> </P>

Therefore he who serves God and not his own belly,<SUP><A HREF="#P2582_964362">237</A></SUP> I plainly see why he may rejoice; I see it, and I rejoice with him exceedingly. For he hath received from the Philippians those things which they had sent from Epaphroditus;<SUP><A HREF="#P2583_964557">238</A></SUP> but yet I see why he rejoiced. For whereat he rejoices, upon that he feeds; for speaking in truth, "I rejoiced," saith he, "in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again, wherein ye were also careful,"<SUP><A HREF="#P2584_964815">239</A></SUP> but it had become wearisome unto you. These Philippians, then, by protracted wearisomeness, had become enfeebled, and as it were dried up, as to bringing forth this fruit of a good work; and he rejoiceth for them, because they flourished again, not for himself, because they ministered to his wants. Therefore, adds he, "not that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content. I know both how to be abused, and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."<SUP><A HREF="#P2585_965493">240</A></SUP> </P>

<P>40. Whereat, then, dost thou rejoice in all things, O great Paul? Whereat dost thou rejoice? Whereon dost thou feed, O man, renewed in the knowledge of God, after the image of Him that created thee, thou living soul of so great continency, and thou tongue like flying fowls, speaking mysteries,-for to such creatures is this food due,-what is that which feeds thee? Joy. Let us hear what follows. "Notwithstanding," saith he, "ye have well done that ye did communicate with My affliction."<SUP><A HREF="#P2587_966010">241</A></SUP> Hereat doth he rejoice, hereon doth he feed; because they have well done,<SUP><A HREF="#P2588_966105">242</A></SUP> not because his strait was relieved, who saith unto thee, "Thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; "<SUP><A HREF="#P2589_966250">243</A></SUP> because he knew both "to abound and to suffer need,"<SUP><A HREF="#P2590_966321">244</A></SUP> in Thee Who strengthenest him. For, saith he, "ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no Church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity."<SUP><A HREF="#P2591_966838">245</A></SUP> Unto these good works he now rejoiceth that they have returned; and is made glad that they flourished again, as when a fruitful field recovers its greenness.</P>

<P>41. Was it on account of his own necessities that he said, "Ye have sent unto my necessity ? Rejoiceth he for that? Verily not for that. But whence know we this? Because he himself continues, "Not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit."<SUP><A HREF="#P2593_967264">246</A></SUP> From Thee, O my God, have I learned to distinguish between a "gift" and "fruit." A gift is the thing itself which he gives who bestows these necessaries, as money, food, drink, clothing, shelter, aid; but the fruit is the good and right will of the giver. For the good Master saith not only, "He that receiveth a prophet," but addeth, "in the name of a prophet." Nor saith He only, "He that receiveth a righteous man," but addeth, "in the name of a righteous man." So, verily, the former shall receive the reward of a prophet, the latter that of a righteous man. Nor saith He only, "Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water," but addeth, "in the name of a disciple" and so concludeth, "Verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward."<SUP><A HREF="#P2594_968072">247</A></SUP> The gift is to receive a prophet, to receive a righteous man, to hand a cup of cold water to a disciple; but the fruit is to do this in the name of a prophet, in the name of a righteous man, in the name of a disciple. With fruit was Elijah fed by the widow, who knew that she fed a man of God, and on this account fed him; but by the raven was he fed with a gift. Nor was the inner man<SUP><A HREF="#P2595_968483">248</A></SUP> of Elijah fed, but the outer only, which might also from want of such food have perished.</P>

For on that is the mind fed wherein it is gladdened. And, therefore, fishes and whales are not fed on such food as the earth bringeth not forth until it had been separated and divided from the bitterness of the waters of the sea.</P>

In each particular kind of Thy works, when Thou hadst said, "Let them be made," and they were made, Thou sawest that it was good. Seven times have I counted it written that Thou sawest that that which Thou madest was "good;" and this is the eighth, that Thou sawest all things that Thou hadst made, and behold they are not only good, but also "very good," as being now taken together. For individually they were only good, but all taken together they were both good and very good. All beautiful bodies also express this; for a body which consists of members, all of which are beautiful, is by far more beautiful than the several members individually are by whose well-ordered union the whole is completed, though these members also be severally beautiful.<SUP><A HREF="#P2604_971117">251</A></SUP> </P>

And I said, "O Lord,! is not this Thy Scripture true, since Thou art true, and being Truth hast set it forth? Why, then, dost Thou say unto me that in thy seeing there are no times, while this Thy Scripture telleth me that what Thou madest each day, Thou sawest to be good; and when I counted them I found how often?" Unto these things Thou repliest unto me, for Thou art my God, and with strong voice tellest unto Thy servant in his inner ear, bursting through my deafness, and crying, "O man, that which My Scripture saith, I say; and yet doth that speak in time; but time has no reference to My Word, because My Word existeth in equal eternity with Myself. Thus those things which ye see through My Spirit, I see, just as those things which ye speak through My Spirit, I speak.

But, as to other things, they say Thou neither madest them nor compactedst them,-such as all flesh and all very minute creatures, and whatsoever holdeth the earth by its roots; but that a mind hostile unto Thee and another nature not created by Thee, and in everywise contrary unto Thee, did, in these lower places of the world, beget and frame these things.<SUP><A HREF="#P2611_973581">252</A></SUP> Infatuated are they who speak thus, since they see not Thy works through Thy Spirit, nor recognise Thee in them.</P>

</UL><P>46. But as for those who through Thy Spirit, I see these things, Thou seest in them. When: therefore, they see that these things are good, Thou seest that they are good; and whatsoever things for Thy sake are pleasing, Thou art pleased in them; and those things which through Thy Spirit are pleasing unto us, are pleasing unto Thee in us. "For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of a man which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we," saith he, "have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God."<SUP><A HREF="#P2615_974595">253</A></SUP> And I am reminded to say, "Truly, `the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God;' how, then, do we also know `what things are given us by God'?" It is answered unto me, "Because the things which we know by His Spirit, even these `knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.' For, as it is rightly said unto those who were to speak by the Spirit of God, `It is not ye that speak,'<SUP><A HREF="#P2616_975004">254</A></SUP> so is it rightly said to. I them who know by the Spirit of God, `It is not ye that know.' None the less, then, is it not, have said to those that see by the Spirit of God, `It is not ye that see;' so whatever they see by the Spirit of God that it is good, it is not they, but God who `sees that it is good.'" It is one thing, then, for a man to suppose that to be bad which is good, as the fore-named do; another, that what is good a man should see to be good (as Thy creatures are pleasing unto many, because they are good, whom, however, Thou pleasest not in them when they wish to enjoy them rather than enjoy Thee); and another, that when a man these a thing to be good, God should in him see that it is good,-that in truth He may be loved in that which He made,<SUP><A HREF="#P2617_975791">255</A></SUP> who cannot be loved unless by the Holy Ghost, which He hath given. "Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us;"<SUP><A HREF="#P2618_975992">256</A></SUP> by whom we see that whatsoever in any degree is, is good.

</UL><P>47 Thanks to Thee, O Lord. We behold the heaven and the earth, whether the corporeal part, superior and inferior, or the spiritual and corporeal creature; and in the embellishment of these parts, whereof the universal mass of the world or the universal creation consisteth, we see light made, and divided from the darkness. We see the firmament of heaven,<SUP><A HREF="#P2622_976565">257</A></SUP> whether the primary body of the world between the spiritual upper waters and the corporeal lower waters, or-because this also is called heaven-this expanse of air, through which wander the fowls of heaven, between the waters which are in vapours borne above them, and which in clear nights drop down in dew, and those which being heavy flow along the earth. We behold the waters gathered together through the plains of the sea; and the dry land both void and formed, so as to be visible and compact, and the matter of herbs and trees. We behold the lights shining from above,-the sun to serve the day, the moon and the stars to cheer the night; and that by all these, times should be marked and noted. We behold on every side a humid element, fruitful with fishes, beasts, and birds; because the density of the air, which bears up the flights of birds, is increased by the exhalation of the waters.<SUP><A HREF="#P2623_977576">258</A></SUP> We behold the face of the earth furnished with terrestrial creatures, and man, created after Thy image and likeness, in that very image and likeness of Thee (that is, the power of reason and understanding) on account of which he was set over all irrational creatures.

But when Thou didst begin to execute in time the things predestinated, that Thou mightest make manifest things hidden, and adjust our disorders (for our sins were over us, and we had sunk into profound I darkness away from thee, and Thy good Spirit was borne over us to help us in due season), Thou didst both justify the. ungodly,<SUP><A HREF="#P2633_980759">262</A></SUP> and didst divide them from the wicked; and madest firm the authority of Thy Book between those above, who would be docile unto Thee, and those under, who would be subject unto them; and Thou didst collect the society of unbelievers into one conspiracy, in order that the zeal of the faithful might appear, and that they might bring forth works of mercy unto Thee, even distributing unto the poor earthly riches, to obtain heavenly. And after this didst Thou kindle certain lights in the firmament, Thy holy ones, having the word of life, and shining with an eminent authority preferred by spiritual gifts; and then again, for the instruction of the unbelieving Gentiles, didst Thou out of corporeal matter produce the sacraments and visible miracles, and sounds of words according to the firmament be Thy Book, by which the faithful should of blessed. Next didst Thou form the living soul of the faithful, through affections ordered by the vigour of continency; and afterwards, the mind subjected to Thee alone, and needing to imitate no human authority,<SUP><A HREF="#P2634_981834">263</A></SUP> Thou didst renew after Thine image and likeness; and didst subject its rational action to the excellency of the understanding, as the woman to the man; and to all Thy ministries, necessary for the perfecting of the faithful in this life, Thou didst will that, for their temporal uses, good things, fruitful in the future time, should be given by the same faithful.<SUP><A HREF="#P2635_982233">264</A></SUP> We behold all these things, and they are very good, because Thou dost see them in us,-Thou who hast given unto us Thy Spirit, whereby we might see them, and in them love Thee.</P>

And we see without that they are, and within that they are good, but Thou didst see them there, when made, where Thou didst see them to be made. And we were at another time moved to do well, after our hearts had conceived of Thy Spirit; but in the former time, forsaking Thee, we were moved to do evil; but Thou, the One, the Good God, hast never ceased to do good. And we also have certain good works, of Thy gift, but not eternal; after these we hope to rest in Thy great hallowing. But Thou, being the Good, needing no good, art ever at rest, because Thou Thyself art Thy rest. And what man will teach man to understand this? Or what angel, an angel? Or what angel, a man?

For this is the promise to the saints, that at the resurrection they shall be equal to the angels of God (Luke xx. 36). And thus the Jerusalem which is above, which is the mother of us all, the City of God, shall not be spoiled of any of the number of her citizens, shall perhaps reign over even a more abundant population."

He points out that the refuge of a particular place ( e.g. the bosom of Abraham) is not enough. We must have God with us here as our refuge, and then we will be hidden in His countenance hereafter; or in other words, if we receive Him into our heart now, He will hereafter receive us into His countenance- Ille post hoc seculum excipiet te vultu suo . For heaven is a prepared place for a prepared people, and we must be fitted to live with Him there by going to Him now, and this, to quote from his De Serm.

The objectors to the doctrine sometimes speak as if it were irrational (Mansel's Bampton Lectures , lect. vi., notes 9, 10). But while the doctrine is above reason, it is not contrary thereto; and, as Dr. Newman observes in his Grammar of Assent , v. 2 (a book which the student should remember has been written since his union with the Roman Church), though the doctrine be mysterious, and, when taken as a whole, transcends all our experience, there is that on which the spiritual life of the Christian can repose in its "propositions taken one by one, and that not in the case of intellectual and thoughtful minds only, but of all religious minds whatever, in the case of a child or a peasant as well as of a philosopher." With the above compare the words of Leibnitz in his "Discours de la Conformité de la Foi avec la Raison," sec. 56: "Il en est de même des autres mystères, où les esprits modérés trouveront toujours une explication suffisante pour croire, et jamais autant qu'il en faut pour comprendre. Il nous suffit d'un certain ce que c'est ( tie0sti ); mais le comment ( pw=j ) nous passe, et ne nous est point nécessaire" ( Euvres de Locke et Leibnitz ). See also p. 175, note 1, above, on the "incomprehensibility" of eternity.

(See also De Trin. xv. 5, end.) He is very fond of such illustrations. In his De Civ. Dei, xi. 26, 27, for example, we have a parallel to this in our text, in the union of existence, knowledge, and love in man; in his De Trin. ix. 4, 17, 18, we have mind, knowledge, and love; ibid. x. 19, memory, understanding, and will; and ibid. xi. 16, memory, thought, and will. In his De Lib. Arb. ii. 7, again, we have the doctrine illustrated by the union of being, life, and knowledge in man. He also finds illustrations of the doctrine in other created things, as in their measure, weight, and number (De Trin. xi. 18), and their existence, figure, and order ( De Vera Relig. xiii.). The nature of these illustrations would at first sight seem to involve him in the Sabellian heresy, which denied the fulness of the Godhead to each of the three Persons of the Trinity; but this is only in appearance. He does not use these illustrations as presenting anything analogous to the union of the three Persons in the Godhead, but as dimly illustrative of it. He declares his belief in the Athanasian doctrine, which, as Dr. Newman observes ( Grammar of Assent ,v. 2), "may be said to be summed up in this very formula on which St. Augustin lays so much stress,-`Tres et Unus, 0' not merely `Unum. 0' " Nothing can be clearer than his words in his De Civ. Dei, xi. 24: "When we inquire regarding each singly, it is said that each is God and Almighty; and when we speak of all together, it is said that there are not three Gods, nor three Almighties, but one God Almighty." Compare with this his De Trin. vii., end of ch. 11, where the language is equally emphatic. See also Mansel, as above, lect. vi. and notes 11 and 12.

He shows also that this deficiency pertains to the human faculties as such, and that, whether they set themselves to consider the things of nature or revelation.

From Palmer (See p. 118, note 3, above), we learn that "the Fathers gave the name of sacrament or mystery to everything which conveyed one signification or property to unassisted reason, and another to faith;" while, at the same time, they counted Baptism and the Lord's Supper as the two great sacraments. The sacraments, then, used in this sense are "varied in their periods," and Augustin, in Ps. lxxiii. 2, speaks of distinguishing between the sacraments of the Old Testament and the sacraments of the New. "Sacramenta novi Testamenti" he says, "dant salutem, sacramenta veteris Testamenti promiserunt salvatorem." So also in Ps. xlvi. he says: "Our Lord God varying, indeed, the sacraments of the words, but commending unto us one faith, hath diffused through the sacred Scriptures manifoldly and variously the faith in which we live, and by which we live. For one and the same thing is said in many ways, that it may be varied in the manner of speaking in order to prevent aversion, but may be preserved as one with a view to concord."

<br><br><sup id="P2459_929803">146</sup>: 1 Cor. iii. 2, and Heb. v. 12. The allusion in our text is to what is called the Disciplina Arcani of the early Church. Clement of Alexandria, in his Stromata , enters at large into the matter of esoteric teaching, and traces its use amongst the Hebrews, Greeks, and Egyptians. Clement, like Chrysostom and other Fathers, supports this principle of interpretation on the authority of St. Paul in Heb. v. and vi., referred to by Augustin above. He says (as quoted by Bishop Kaye, Clement of Alexandria , ch. iv. p. 183): "Babes must be fed with milk, the perfect man with solid food; milk is catechetical instruction, the first nourishment of the soul; solid food, contemplation penetrating into all mysteries ( h9 e0poptikh' qewria ), the blood and flesh of the Word, the comprehension of the Divine power and essence." Augustin, therefore, when he speaks of being "contented with the light of the moon and stars," alludes to the partial knowledge imparted to the catechumen during his probationary period before baptism. It was only as competentes , and ready for baptism, that the catechumens were taught the Lord's Prayer and the Creed. We have already adverted to this matter in note 4 on p. 89, and need not now do more than refer the reader to Dr. Newman's Arians. In ch. i. sec. 3 of that work, there are some most interesting pages on this subject, in its connection with the Catechetical School of Alexandria. See also p. 118, note 8, above; Palmer, Origines Liturgicae , iv. sec. 7: and note 1, below.
<br><br><sup id="P2460_931363">147</sup>: Those ready for strong meat were called "illuminated" (See p. 118, note 4, above), as their eyes were "enabled to look upon the Sun." We have frequent traces in Augustin's writings of the Neo-Platonic doctrine that the soul has a capacity to see God, even as the eye the sun. In Serm. lxxxviii. 6 he says: "Daretne tibi unde videres solem quem fecit, et non tibi daret unde videres eum qui te fecit, cum te ad imaginem suam fecerit?" And, referring to 1 John iii. 2, he tells us in Ep. xcii. 3, that not with the bodily eye shall we see God, but with the inner, which is to be renewed day by day: "We shall, therefore, see Him according to the measure in which we shall be like Him; because now the measure in which we do not see Him is according to the measure of our unlikeness to Him." Compare also Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho, c. 4: "Plato, indeed, says, that the mind's eye is of such a nature, and has been given for this end, that we may see that very Being who is the cause of all when the mind is pure itself." Some interesting remarks on this subject, and on the three degrees of divine knowledge as held by the Neo-Platonists, will be found in John Smith's Select Discourses , pp. 2 and 165 (Cambridge 1860). On growth in grace, See note 4, p. 140, above.

Augustin sometimes uses a version with "firmavit terram," which corresponds to the LXX., but the Authorized Version renders the Hebrew more accurately by "stretched out." In his comment on this place he applies this text to baptism as being the entrance into the Church, and in this he is followed by many mediaeval writers.
<br><br><sup id="P2511_943209">186</sup>: Ps. xxiii. 5. Many of the Fathers interpret this text of the Lord's Supper, as Augustin does above. The fish taken out of the deep, which is fed upon, means Christ, in accordance with the well-known acrostic of IlQUS "If," he says in his De Civ. Dei, xviii. 23, "you join the initial letters of these five Greek words, Ihsou=j Xristoj qeou= Uio/j Swt'hr , which mean, `Jesus Christ the Son of God, the Saviour, 0' they will make the word ixquj, ,-that is, `fish, 0' in which word Christ is mystically understood, because He was able to live, that is, to exist without sin in the abyss of this mortality as in the depth of waters." So likewise we find Tertullian saying in his De Bapt. chap. i.: "Nos pisciculi, secundum IXQUN nostrum Jesum Christum in aqua nascimur; nec aliter quam in aqua permanendo salvi sumus." See Bishop Kaye's Tertullian , pp. 43, 44; and sec. 34, below.

<br><br><sup id="P2550_951965">217</sup>: In his De Civ. Dei, xi. 3, he defines very distinctly (as he does in other of his writings) the knowledge received "by sight"-that is, by experience, as distinguished from that which is received "by faith"-that is, by revelation (2 Cor. v. 7). He, in common with all the Fathers who had knowledge of the Pagan philosophy, would feel how utterly that philosophy had failed to "find out" (Job xi. 7) with certitude anything as to God and His character ,-the Creation of the world,-the Atonement wrought by Christ,-the doctrine of the Resurrection , as distinguished from the Immortality of the Soul,-our Immortal Destiny after death, or " the Restitution of all things ." As to the knowledge of God, see Justin Martyr's experience in the schools of philosophy, Dialogue with Trypho, ch. ii.; and on the doctrine of Creation, See p. 165, note 4. On the "Restitution of all things," etc., reference may be made to Mansel's Gnostics , who points out (Introd. p. 3) that "in the Greek philosophical systems the idea of evil holds a very subordinate and insignificant place, and that the idea of redemption seems not to be recognised at all." He shows further ( ibid. p. 4), that "there is no idea of the delivery of the creature from the bondage of corruption. The great year of the Stoics, the commencement of the new cycle which takes its place after the destruction of the old world, is but a repetition of the old evil." See also p. 164, note 2, above.
