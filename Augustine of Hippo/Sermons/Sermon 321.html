<H5>Where he promised the little book of the healed man.</H5>
<P>We indeed spoke yesterday, as Your Charity remembers: This booklet, its appearance is. However, because it revealed some things to us, which you ought to know, for greater admiration and the glory of our Lord, concerning the memories of his saints, about which it is said: Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints; it is also fitting to provide a booklet, which contains everything we have learned from his mouth. But if the Lord wills, it will be prepared today and read to you tomorrow.</P>
