SERMON GIVEN AT CARTHAGE AT THE TABLE OF THE MARTYR CYPRIAN<BR>

<H5>Aug. again presents the reading of the apostolic letter.</H5>
<P>Recall the reading of the apostolic letter: Brethren, he says, if a man is overtaken in any fault, you who are spiritual should restore such a one in the spirit of gentleness, considering yourself, lest you also be tempted. Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. Let each one test his own work, and then he will have reason for boasting in himself alone, and not in his neighbor. For each one will bear his own load. Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches. Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap; for he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption; but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. And let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to those who are of the household of faith.</P>
<H5>How we bear each other's burdens. The law of Christ is the law of love.</H5>
<P>Up to this point, the letter of the Apostle has been read: up to this point, I have been a reader to you. But, my brothers, if the reader is understood, why is a disputant necessary? Behold, we have heard, we have understood: let us act, and let us live. And what need is there to burden your memory? Hold on to these things and think upon them. Or perhaps it troubles one of you, how it is to be understood what he said: Bear one another's burdens; and shortly after he said: Each one will bear his own burden? For you say in your hearts, those of you who noticed this: How do we bear each other's burdens if each one will bear his own burden? How will each one bear his own burden if we bear each other's burdens? I confess, it is a question. Knock, and it will be opened to you; knock with understanding, knock with eagerness, knock also for us, that we may speak something worthy to you, by praying; thus, in knocking, you help us, and this question will soon be solved. Would that, as soon as it is solved, each one would effectively do what he understands! In the burden of infirmity, we bear each other's burdens; in the matter of piety, each one will bear his own burden. What did I say? All men, what are we except men, and thus infirm, and who are not entirely without sin? For in this we bear each other's burdens. For if you have suffered weariness at your brother's sin, and he at yours, you neglect each other and commit a truly great sin. But if you endure what he cannot, and he endures what you cannot, you bear each other’s burdens; and because you bear each other’s burdens, you fulfill the most sacred law of charity. For this is the law of Christ; the law of charity is the law of Christ. Therefore He came, because He loved us; and there was nothing to love, but by loving He made us lovable. You have heard what it is: Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. What then is: Each one will bear his own burden? Each one will give an account for his own sin; no one will give an account for another’s sin. Each one has his own case; he will give an account to God for his own. But even the overseers who give an account for the flocks of Christ, give an account for their own sin, if they have neglected the flocks of Christ.</P>
<H5>Love, and do what you will.</H5>
<P>Therefore, brothers, if a man is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, whoever you are who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness. And if you rebuke, love within. Exhort, comfort, reprimand, be severe; love, and do whatever you want. For a father does not hate his son: yet the father, if necessary, chastises his son; he causes pain to preserve health. Therefore, this is: In the spirit of gentleness. For if a man is caught in any trespass and you say: It does not concern me; and I say to you: Why does it not concern you? and you answer me: Because each one will bear his own burden; I will answer you: Surely you have willingly heard, and understood: Bear one another's burdens. Therefore, if a man is caught in any trespass, you [who] are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness. Indeed, for his own sin he will give an account, because each one will bear his own burden; but if you neglect his wound, you will give a bad account of the sin of your negligence; and therefore, if you do not bear one another's burdens, you will have a bad account in this, because each one will bear his own burden. Do this so that you bear one another's burdens, and God spares you, because each one will bear his own burden. For if you bear the burden of another, when he is caught in any trespass, so that you restore him in a spirit of gentleness, you will come to the place where you heard: Each one will bear his own burden; and with a good conscience, you say to God: Forgive us our debts. Therefore, brothers, remember: If a man is caught in any trespass... Do not take it lightly: Man. For he could have said: If anyone is caught, if anyone at all is caught; he did not say this, but he said: Man. However, it is very difficult that a man is not caught in some trespass: for what is man?</P>
<H5>And the spiritual burden has to be borne by another.</H5>
<P>But these spiritual ones, whom he admonished to gently instruct that man who had been overtaken in a fault, perhaps said in their hearts: Let us bear the burdens of those who are overtaken by faults; because we do not have anything in ourselves that they might bear. Listen, because you should not be secure; the following words: Consider yourself, lest you also be tempted. Let the spiritual not be proud, not exalt themselves; although, if they are spiritual, they will not exalt themselves; I fear lest they exalt themselves precisely because they are carnal; yet let even the spiritual consider, lest they also be tempted. For is it because they are spiritual that they are not human? Is it because they are spiritual that they do not bear a corruptible body that weighs down the soul? Is it because they are spiritual that they have ended this life, which is entirely a temptation on earth? It was indeed well said, very well: Consider yourself, lest you also be tempted. And when he admonished them, that is, the spiritual, he immediately added that general sentence: Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. What does it mean: each other's? A carnal person should bear the burden of another carnal person, a spiritual person should bear the burden of another spiritual person. Carry each other's burdens, do not neglect each other's sins. Reprove those who trust you; admonish those whom you do not have the confidence to reprove; and if this is necessary, so that no one sins, pray, entreat. Perhaps I humbled you because I said, entreat? Listen to the Apostle: But commanding, he says, and entreating that you do not receive the grace of God in vain. The doctor, if he finds strength in the sick person, reproves; but if he does not find strength, and fears that the patient might possibly weaken under the bitterness of reproach, he supplicates, entreats, so that he may hear, do, and live. Therefore, the Apostle evidently said: Carry each other's burdens, because he had admonished the spiritual and had said: Consider yourself, lest you also be tempted; lest this spiritual one should so arrogate to himself as to think that he does not have a burden which ought to be supported by another.</P>
<H5>Sometimes man himself is his own devil. Flatterers and deceivers.</H5>
<P>Listen to this again, due to vanity, due to arrogance, due to pride, listen to it again: For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. It could not be said better, he deceives himself. Not in all things should the devil be blamed; for sometimes man himself is his own devil. For why should the devil be guarded against? Surely so that he may not deceive you. Are you not therefore your own devil, when you deceive yourself? What then? But let each one test his own work, and then he will have glory in himself alone, and not in another. When you do something good, if it pleases you on account of someone praising you; but if that other does not praise you for it, you would fail in doing the good work, deprived of the praises' voices—in another you have glory, not in yourself. If the praise is there, you do it; if perhaps your good work displeased a foolish man, you do not do it. Do you not see people pouring out their wealth to actors and offering nothing to the poor, how much they are praised by the mouths of many? Is what they do good because they are praised? Wake up at last: The sinner is praised in the desires of his soul. All of you cried out because you know the holy Scripture from which the testimony we recalled comes; let those who do not know it listen. The holy Scripture said, the holy Scripture predicted: Because the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul, and he who does wrong is blessed. Now if the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul, and he who does wrong is blessed, seek praisers. Evil desires rend you; do wrong daily to fulfill your desires, and seek praisers. Believe me, you will find only flatterers or deceivers. How are they flatterers, how are they deceivers? I must give an account of my words. They are flatterers who know you do evil and yet praise you; those who praise you for doing evil because they think what you do is good are not flatterers, because they praise from the heart, but they are deceivers because they seduce you into doing those evils with their frequent praise and do not let you breathe. For in empty airs, you think what you do is good: you waste your goods, empty your house, leave your children naked. Those praises have made you insane: you run, you move your hands, you accept favors, you bring them to your mouth; you waste your house and gather wind. How, you ask, are these my deceivers who praise me from the heart? They are your deceivers because they were first mistaken themselves. Will he not toil to lay a ladder to you so that he might not deceive you, who deceives himself? Therefore the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul, and he who does wrong is blessed. Beware of such a praiser, shun this kind of blessing. Rather, you do good. But, you say, I will displease such a person if I do it. Be displeasing to him, and please God; for if you displease him and please God, you will have glory in yourself, and not in another. But the wicked denounce the good, and lovers of this world curse those who despise the world, they speak reproaches, they seek something to blame; as soon as something evil is said, they instantly believe; if something good is said, they refuse to believe; and your heart is troubled, that you fail in well-doing, because no praiser or flatterer or deceiver is found, and your conscience's testimony is not enough for you, in the theater of your heart, under the eyes of God. Why are you troubled, I beseech you, why are you troubled? Because many evil things are said about me. Is this what you say? You would not be disturbed in the ship of your heart, unless Christ were sleeping there.</P>
<H5>When you are troubled by insults, awaken Christ, awaken your faith, which sleeps in your heart.</H5>
<P>You heard, when the Gospel was read, a great storm arose, and the ship was troubled and covered by the waves. Why? Because Christ was sleeping. When does Christ sleep in your heart, if not when you forget your faith? The faith of Christ in your heart is like Christ in the ship. You hear insults, you are wearied, you are troubled: Christ is sleeping. Awaken Christ, awaken your faith. You have what you need to do even when troubled; awaken your faith. Christ will awaken and speak to you: Are insults troubling you? What do I not endure for you first? This Christ says to you, thus your faith addresses you; listen to it, and see that it addresses you thus; unless perchance you have forgotten that Christ suffered for us, and before suffering so many evils for us, He heard insults. He cast out demons, and it was said to Him: You have a demon. Of Him it was said through the Prophet: The reproaches of those who reproached you have fallen on me. Therefore, awaken Christ, and He will say to you in your heart: When people revile you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for my sake, rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. Believe what has been said, and great tranquility will come in your heart. If, therefore, a man thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself; but let each one test his own work, and then in himself alone will he have reason to glory, and not in another. Whether he is praised or blamed, you have glory in yourself, because your glory is your God in your conscience; and you will be like the wise virgins, who took oil with them in vessels, so that they would not have glory in another, but in themselves. For those who did not take oil with them begged from others, and their lamps went out, and they said: Give us some of your oil. What is: Give us some of your oil, but: Praise our works, because our own conscience is not sufficient for us? What seemed obscure in the apostolic reading, as the Lord has granted, I have explained. The rest is clear: it does not require an expositor but a doer. However, that we may do what we have heard, let us ask Him, without whose help we can do no good; for He said to His disciples: Without me, you can do nothing. Turned to the Lord...</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">AND AFTER THE SERMON, BECAUSE THE PEOPLE REQUESTED THAT WE SHOULD NOT DEPART BEFORE THE BIRTHDAY OF BLESSED CYPRIAN, HE ADDED:</P>
<P>Truly I say to your Charity, that we cannot endure the desire and complaints of our people even through letters; but because this, which you request, has already been commanded by the holy old man, thus I conclude my speech. The birthday of the blessed Cyprian is certainly already approaching; due to that solemnity, you wanted to be forceful in keeping me: therefore, we who devote ourselves to the word, it is good that we also fast bodily.</P>
