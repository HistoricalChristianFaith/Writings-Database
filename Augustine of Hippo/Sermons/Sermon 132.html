<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ON THE WORDS OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN (6:56-57):<BR>
"My flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink."<BR>
"He who eats my flesh," etc.</B></P><P> </P>
<H5>Catechumens are invited to the grace of regeneration.</H5>
<P>As we have heard, when the holy Gospel was read, the Lord Jesus Christ exhorted with the promise of eternal life to eat his flesh and drink his blood. Those of you who heard this have not all understood it yet. For those of you who have been baptized and are faithful, you know what he said. But those of you who are still called Catechumens, or Hearers, could have been listeners when it was read, but did you understand? Therefore, our speech is directed to both groups. Those who already eat the flesh of the Lord and drink his blood, consider what you are eating and drinking: lest, as the Apostle says, you eat and drink judgment upon yourselves. But those who do not yet eat and do not yet drink, hurry to these feasts to which you have been invited. During these days, the masters feed, Christ feeds daily, that table of his is set in the midst. What is the cause, O Hearers, that you see the table and do not approach the feasts? And perhaps now, when the Gospel was read, you said in your hearts: We wonder what he means when he says: My flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink? How is the flesh of the Lord eaten and the blood of the Lord drunk? We wonder what he means? Who has closed against you that you should not know this? It is veiled: but if you wish, it will be revealed. Come to the profession, and you have solved the question. For what the Lord Jesus said, the faithful already know. But you are called "Catechumen," you are called "Hearer," and you are deaf. For you have open ears of the body, because you hear the words that are spoken: but you have as yet closed ears of the heart, because you do not understand what is said. I speak, I do not analyze. Behold, it is Easter, give your name for Baptism. If the feast does not arouse you, curiosity itself should lead you: that you may know what it is that was said: He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. That you may know with me what was said, knock, and it will be opened to you. And as I say to you: Knock, and it will be opened to you; so also I knock, open to me. Sounding with my ears, I knock at your chest.</P>
<H5>Married faithful, now eating the body of Christ, are admonished to keep chastity.</H5>
<P>But if catechumens are to be encouraged, my brothers, so that they do not delay to approach the great grace of regeneration; how much care should we have in building up the faithful, so that it benefits them to approach; that they do not eat and drink such feasts to their own judgment? And so, to not eat and drink to judgment, let them live well. Be encouragers not by words, but by your conduct: so that those who are not baptized may hasten to follow you, to not perish by imitating you. You who are married, keep the faith of the marriage bed with your wives. Return what you demand. Husband, you demand chastity from your wife, give her the example, not just the word. You are the head, where are you looking. Indeed you should go where it is not dangerous for her to follow: rather, you yourself should walk where you want her to follow. You demand strength from the weaker sex: both have the desire of the flesh; he who is stronger should conquer first. And yet what is regrettable, many men are conquered by women. Women keep chastity, which men do not wish to keep: and in what they do not keep, they wish to appear as men; as if the reason for the stronger sex is that the enemy may subdue him more easily. It is a struggle, a battle, a fight. Man is stronger than woman, man is the head of woman. Woman fights and conquers: do you yield to the enemy? The body stands, and the head lies low? But those who do not yet have wives, and yet already approach the Lord's table, and eat the flesh of Christ, and drink His blood, if you are going to marry, keep yourselves for your wives. How you want them to come to you, you should let them find you the same. Which young man is there, who does not wish to marry a chaste wife? And if he will take a virgin, who does not desire her to be untouched? Seek one untouched, be untouched yourself. Seek one pure, do not be impure. For she can, and you cannot? If it were not possible, neither she would be able. Because she can, let her teach you that it is possible. And that she may be able, God directs her. But you will be more glorious if you do so. Why more glorious? She is restrained by the guardianship of her parents, restrained by the same modesty of the weaker sex: finally she fears laws, which you do not. Therefore you will be more glorious if you do so; because if you do so, you fear God. She has many things to fear besides God: you only fear God. But He whom you fear, is greater than all. He is to be feared in public, He is in secret. You go out, you are seen; you enter, you are seen; a lamp is burning, it sees you; the lamp is out, it sees you; you enter a room, it sees you; you dwell in your heart, it sees you. Fear Him, to whom it is a care to see you; and be chaste at least from fear. Or if you want to sin, seek where He does not see you, and do what you want.</P>
<H5>Bound by a vow of continence.</H5>
<P>But as for you who have already vowed, chastise the body more strictly, and do not allow the reins of desire to be loosened even for what is permitted; so that you not only turn away from illicit intercourse but even disdain the sight of the licit. Remember, in whatever sex you are, whether male or female, you lead the life of Angels on earth. For Angels neither marry nor are given in marriage. This is what we shall be when we have risen again. How much better are you, who begin to be what men will be after the resurrection before death? Keep your ranks; for God preserves your honors. The resurrection of the dead has been compared to the stars established in the sky. For one star differs from another in glory, as the Apostle says: So also is the resurrection of the dead. For virginity will shine differently there, conjugal chastity differently there, holy widowhood differently there. They will shine differently, but all will be there. Unequal splendor, a common heaven.</P>
<H5>Each person must keep their rank.</H5>
<P>Thinking therefore about your steps, keeping and your professions, approach the flesh of the Lord, approach the blood of the Lord. Whoever knows himself to be otherwise, let him not approach. Be pricked more by my word. For those who know how to keep themselves for their spouses, just as they demand it from their spouses, who know how to keep continence in every way, if they have vowed it to God; but those who hear me saying: "Whoever of you does not keep chastity, do not approach that bread," are saddened. And I would not wish to say this: but what do I do? Shall I fear man, that I might be silent about the truth? Therefore if those servants do not fear the Lord, should I also not fear? As if I did not know it was said: "You wicked and slothful servant, you should have given, and I would demand." Behold, I have given, Lord my God; behold, before you and your angels and before your very people, I have distributed your money: for I fear your judgment. I have given, you demand. Even if I do not say it, you will do it. Therefore I rather say this: I have given, you convert, you spare. Make chaste those who were unchaste, so that together in your sight, when the judgment comes, we may rejoice, both the one who distributed and he to whom it was distributed. Does this please? Let it please. Whoever of you are unchaste, correct yourselves while you live. For I can speak the word of God, but I cannot free unchaste people persisting in wickedness from the judgment and damnation of God.</P>
