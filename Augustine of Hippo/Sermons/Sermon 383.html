<H5>How he still carried the burden of the episcopate with himself must be investigated.</H5>
<P>Indeed, on every day and at every hour, and with continuous care, most beloved, the bishop ought to ponder the weight of the stewardship he bears and how he will render account to his Lord. Nevertheless, when the anniversary of our ordination arises, then the burden of this office is especially considered as if it were newly imposed. It is significant that on the day we first received this, we thought only about how it should be carried out. But on subsequent days, especially on the one where its solemnity is observed, we counsel not only with cautious foresight about its future conduct but also with careful remembrance, we recall how past actions were conducted: so that we may imitate ourselves in good deeds, and if any blameworthy things have occurred, we take care that they are not repeated, pray that they are forgiven; and flee the accusation of the devil with diligence in doing right where we can; and where we cannot, overcome him with the piety of confession. For just as future sins are committed by neglecting justice, so past ones are reinforced by defending injustice. Therefore, just as charity prevents them from happening, humility erases those that have; so that what can no longer be avoided by doing right can at least be forgiven by not being prideful. Indeed, we have learned to say to our Father, who is in heaven: “Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.” So that we may say this truthfully, we must also love our enemies, though we ought to have them only if justice compels us. For if people are our enemies due to the merits of our evildoings, we should not be concerned to forgive them their debts but rather fear that we might repay them. For if they hate us for our iniquity, they are our debtors, not we theirs.</P>
<H5>He forgives his debtors, but he urges them to conversion.</H5>
<P>On this solemn day of my episcopate, I will first address briefly my debtors, who unknowingly intercede for me before God, while they commit debts that I remit, so that I may also deserve to have my debts forgiven. Therefore, I say to you whether present or absent, to whom I become an enemy by preaching the truth, to whom I seem burdensome by advising, whose interests I seek and am compelled to offend their will: Do not be like the horse and the mule, which have no understanding. For these beasts especially attack with kick and bite those who treat them, so that their wounds might be tended. I do not spare you, do not spare me: I oppose you, you oppose me: you resist, I resist. Wrestling brings us together, but the cause separates us. You are an enemy to the healer, I am an enemy to the disease: you to my diligence, I to your pestilence. They returned, he said, evil for good; but I prayed. What did he pray, except: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do? When they, he said, revile you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake, rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven. Yet you should correct your perversion, acknowledge our love; return love for love: we do not wish a greater reward with your perdition. This, to my debtors, to whom I remit, so that it might be remitted to me, may now suffice.</P>
<H5>He entreats those whom he may have accidentally offended to forgive him his debts and testifies his love to them.</H5>
<P>Next, even those to whom I am a debtor must be addressed somewhat. For as the Apostle says: "I am a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise." For such a debtor am I also, due to the smallness of my strength and the portion of stewardship, not to some but to all. But now I speak of those debts which I desire to be forgiven me, not demanded from me. For I am not puffed up with such vanity of mind to dare say that since I have borne the burden of this office, no man has been wrongfully harmed by me. For anyone occupied and stretched with so many and so troublesome duties, if not impossible, it is certainly difficult: how much more for me, who know my weakness, which I offer with yours and for me in your prayers to be healed by our Lord God by day and night? Therefore, disturbed by the storms and difficulties of various cares, if perchance I did not listen as I should have when requested, if I looked at someone more bitterly than was necessary, if I sent forth harsher words than I should have, if I disturbed a heart that was saddened and in need of assistance with an unsuitable response, if I overlooked, postponed, or even with a harsh gesture saddened a poor man pressing me urgently when my mind was on something else; if to anyone suspecting something false about me as a man from a man, I was unjustly excessively indignant, if anyone did not recognize in his conscience what I humanly suspected of him; you to whom I admit I am a debtor for these and similar offenses, at the same time believe me to be your lover. For the mother often steps on her chicks in straits, but with not her whole weight of the foot, and does not therefore cease to be a mother. Forgive, so that you may be forgiven. Forgive a debtor of difficulty loving you, who ought not to hold debts against enemies out of cruelty. In short, I beseech you all, commend you to the Lord my care for you: from this rightly I seek your care for me; so that whatever in the past was of my offenses, He may mercifully forgive and not severely recognize. That whatever time will be mine henceforth under this burden, let Him guide the traveler, and make pleasing to His eyes and useful to you; so that the sight of Him may find you not in my horror and punishment, but in my joy and crown.</P>
