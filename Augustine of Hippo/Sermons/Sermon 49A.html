[FRAGMENT]</B></P>
<P>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent His Son, made of a woman, made under the Law. But it offends to say made of a woman, because we confess that He was born of a Virgin. We do not confess made unless as human; but God is always making, He does not know how to be made. God does not know how to be made; but it is made that He may be something to someone, as it is said: Lord, you have been our refuge; and: The Lord has been my helper. How great is He who has never been made? But the Lord Christ was made man, so that He might be, that He who was always the Creator might be a creature. For remaining God, He was made man, so that He might become what He was not, not so that He might perish what He was. Therefore, what was made of the Virgin, why from a woman? Because among the Hebrews, where the first language of the Scriptures is, "woman" is a term signifying sex, not lost integrity. Read: when the woman was formed, God took, He says, one of his ribs, that is, of the man, and built it into a woman. Thus, woman Mary; so it was said to her, before she bore, before she conceived: Blessed are you among women.</P>
