<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ON THE BIRTHDAY OF THE LORD</B></P>
<H5>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace.</H5>
<P>We heard the voice of the angels, through whom the Lord Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin's womb, was announced to the shepherds when the Gospel was read: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will. A festive and congratulatory voice, not to the one woman whose womb brought forth the child, but to the human race, to whom the Virgin gave birth to the Savior. For it was fitting, and this was indeed proper, that to her who became fruitful and gave birth to the Lord of heaven and earth, and remained intact after giving birth, not mere women with human celebrations, but Angels with divine praises should celebrate the childbirth. Therefore, let us also say, and say with as much exultation as possible, who announce his birth not to shepherds of flocks, but celebrate his nativity with his sheep: let us also say, I say, with a faithful heart, a devout voice: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will. And these divine words, these praises of God, this angelic joy, let us contemplate with as much consideration as possible, let us meditate upon them with faith, hope, and charity. For as we believe and hope and desire, so we shall be glory to God in the highest, when our resurrected spiritual body shall be caught up in the clouds to meet Christ: if only while we are on earth, we pursue peace with good will. For in the highest is life, because there is the region of the living; and there are the good days, where the Lord Himself is, and His years do not fail. But whoever wants life, and loves to see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking deceit; let him turn away from evil, and do good: and so let him be a man of goodwill. And let him seek peace and pursue it: because on earth peace to men of good will.</P>
<H5>His mercy has anticipated us everywhere.</H5>
<P>But if you say, O man, Behold, the desire lies within me, but to perform what is good I find not; and you delight in the law of God according to the inward man, but you see another law in your members warring against the law of your mind, and bringing you into captivity to the law of sin which is in your members: persist in good will, and exclaim what follows: O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. For He is peace on earth to men of good will, after the war in which the flesh lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; so that you do not do the things that you would: for He is our peace, who has made both one. Therefore let good will persist against evil desires, and in persistence implore the aid of the grace of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. It is opposed by the law of the carnal members, and behold, it is now even taken captive: let it implore aid, not trust in its own strength; and at least wearied, let it not disdain to be confessed. For He will be present who said to those whom He already saw believing in Him: If you continue in my word, you shall be my disciples indeed; and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. The Truth will be present and will set you free from the body of this death. For this reason indeed the Truth, whose Nativity we celebrate, has arisen from the earth, that there might be peace on earth to men of good will. For who is fit to will and to perform, unless He who by inspiring helps us to be able, who by calling has provided that we should will? Because everywhere His mercy has preceded us, that we might be called, though unwilling, and obtain the ability to do what we will. Therefore let us say to Him: I have sworn, and confirmed it, that I will keep Your righteous judgments. I have indeed confirmed it, and because You have commanded, I have promised obedience: but because I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members; I am utterly humbled, O Lord, quicken me according to Your word. Behold, the desire lies within me: therefore approve, O Lord, the voluntary offerings of my mouth; that there may be peace on earth to men of good will. Let us say these things, and if any other the piety, instructed by holy readings, suggests: that the celebration of the Lord born of the Virgin, we may not frequent in vain, beginning with good will, to be perfected with the fullest charity; which is also spread in our hearts, not by ourselves, but by the Holy Spirit who is given to us.</P>
