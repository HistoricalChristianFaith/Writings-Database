<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>On the Birthday of Cyprian the Martyr</B></P>
<H5>The birthday of Cyprian the martyr is very celebrated throughout all of Africa.</H5>
<P>May the Holy Spirit teach us in this hour what ought to be said: for we are about to say something in praise of the most glorious martyr Cyprian, whose Natal day, as you know, we celebrate today. The Church so frequently uses this name, that is, 'Natal days', to call the precious deaths of the martyrs by the name of Natal days. Thus, I say, the Church so frequently uses this name that even those who are not in it say this with it. For who today, I do not say in this our city, but clearly throughout all of Africa and the overseas regions, not only a Christian, but a Pagan, or a Jew, or even a heretic could be found, who does not say with us the Natal day of the martyr Cyprian? What is this, brothers? When he was born, we do not know; and because he suffered today, we celebrate his Natal day today. But we would not celebrate that day, even if we knew. For on that day he drew original sin: but on this day he overcame all sin. On that day he proceeded from the troublesome womb of his mother into this light, which entices the eyes of the flesh: but on this day he departed from the most hidden depths of nature to that light, which happily and blessedly illuminates the sight of the mind.</P>
<H5>The Church of Carthage made famous by the bishopric and martyrdom of Cyprian. The table of Cyprian at Carthage.</H5>
<P>He governed the Church of Carthage while living, and honored it in dying. There he held the episcopate, there he consummated martyrdom. Indeed, in that very place where he laid down the remains of his flesh, a savage multitude had then gathered, who, due to hatred of Christ, would shed the blood of Cyprian: today, a venerating multitude hastens there, which, for the feast of Cyprian, drinks the blood of Christ. And the more sweetly in that place for the feast of Cyprian is the blood of Christ drunk, as more devoutly there, in the name of Christ, was the blood of Cyprian shed. Finally, as you know, whoever knows Carthage, in that same place, an altar is constructed to God; and yet it is called the table of Cyprian, not because Cyprian ever feasted there, but because he was sacrificed there, and by that very sacrifice he prepared this table, not on which he feasts or is feasted, but on which the sacrifice to God, to whom he himself was offered, is offered. But the reason that that altar, which is of God, is also called of Cyprian, is because as it is now surrounded by worshippers, so there Cyprian was surrounded by persecutors: where now it is honored by friends praying, there Cyprian was trampled by enemies raging: finally, where it is erected, there he was laid low. Sing to God, sing a psalm to His name: who ascends over the sunset, He did these things over the slain.</P>
<H5>The death of Cyprian is precious.</H5>
<P>But since Carthage has had his chair, let Carthage hold his memory; wherefore would we celebrate his birth, if the death of his saints were not precious in the sight of the Lord? His sound has gone out into all the earth, and his words to the ends of the world. He faithfully taught what he was to do, he bravely did what he had taught. He arrived at a precious death by living justly, but to a glorious life by dying unjustly; and he obtained the triumphant name of martyr, because he brought the struggle for truth even to bloodshed.</P>
<H5>Cyprian is renowned throughout the world for both his martyrdom and his writings.</H5>
<P>But because he not only spoke what was to be heard, but also wrote what was to be read, and reached other places through foreign languages, and indeed to other places through his own letters, and became known to many regions, partly through the fame of his most strong passion, partly through the sweetness of his most delightful reading: let us cheerfully celebrate this day, and let us all unanimously pray that we may be deemed worthy to hear and see the common father in the greater Church; we shall have both joy from his sermon and progress from the glory of his passion, through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</P>
