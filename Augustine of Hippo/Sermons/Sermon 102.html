<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ON THE WORDS OF THE GOSPEL LUKE 10, 16<BR>
"He who rejects you, rejects me."</B></P>
<H5>Due reverence to shepherds.</H5>
<P>Our Lord Jesus Christ spoke to His disciples at that time, and it was written down for us to hear. Therefore, we heard His words. For what good would it do us if He were seen and not heard? Nor does it harm now that He is not seen, yet He is still heard. Therefore, He says: "He who rejects you rejects me." If He said: "He who rejects you rejects me" only to the Apostles, then reject us. But if His word reached us, and called us, and placed us in their position; see that you do not reject us, lest the injury you do to us reach Him. For if you do not fear us, fear Him who said: "He who rejects you rejects me." But what do we speak to you, who do not wish to be rejected by you, other than that we may rejoice in your good morals? Let your good works be the consolation of our perils. Live well, so that you may not die badly.</P>
<H5>Death, what is it that is truly good, truly bad.</H5>
<P>Nor in these words which I said: Live well, lest you die badly, should you consider those who perhaps lived badly, and died in their beds; and their funeral was conducted with pomp, and they were placed in precious sarcophagi, in graves beautifully and elaborately constructed: and because perhaps each one of you says to himself, I would like to die thus, you would think that I wished to say a vain thing; since I said I want you to live well so that you do not die badly.</P>
<P>Perhaps someone arises who has both lived well and, according to the opinion of men, has died badly: perhaps he died from a fall, died from a shipwreck, died from beasts; and each carnal person says in his heart, "What good is living well? Behold, he lived well and died thus." Return, therefore, to your heart; and if you are faithful, you will find Christ there; He speaks to you there. For I cry out: He, however, teaches more in silence. I speak through the sound of speech: He speaks within through the fear of thought. Therefore let Him implant my word in your heart: for I have dared to say, "Live well, lest you die badly." Behold, since faith is in your hearts, and Christ is there, and He has to teach what I desire to proclaim.</P>
<H5>The opposite fate of the rich man and Lazarus after death.</H5>
<P>Remember in the Gospel that rich man and that poor man: the rich man clothed in purple and fine linen, and faring sumptuously every day; the poor man lying at the rich man's gate, hungry and seeking to be fed with the crumbs that fell from his table, full of sores, and licked by dogs. Remember, therefore: why do you remember, except that Christ is in your hearts? Tell me what you have asked Him inwardly, and what He has answered you. For it continues and says: It happened that the poor man died and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried in hell. And being in torments, he lifted up his eyes and saw Lazarus resting in Abraham's bosom. Then he cried out, saying: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame. Proud in life, a beggar in hell. For that poor man could get to the crumbs, but the rich man could not reach the drop. So of these two, tell me, who died well, and who died badly? Do not ask your eyes, return to your heart. For if you ask your eyes, they will give you false answers. For those things that could be exhibited to the dying rich man were very splendid and secularly adorned. What troops of weeping servants and handmaidens could there have been? What pomp of clients? What splendor of the funeral? What price of the burial? I believe he was buried in perfumes. What then, brothers, shall we say, that he died well or badly? If you ask your eyes, he died excellently; if you ask your inner master, he died very badly.</P>
<H5>Death from where ought it to be considered evil.</H5>
<P>If, therefore, such is the death of the proud guardians of their possessions, and giving nothing out of it to the poor: how do those die who seize others' property? Indeed, I spoke truly: Live well, lest you die badly, lest you die as that rich man did. A bad death is proven only by the time after death. On the contrary, consider that poor man: do not look with your eyes, for you will err; let faith observe, let the heart see. Imagine him lying on the ground before your eyes, covered in sores, with dogs coming and licking his sores. But when you recall him thus before your eyes, you immediately spit, turn away your face, and cover your noses. See with the eyes of the heart. He died, and was carried by the Angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich manâ€™s household seemed to be weeping: the Angels were not seen rejoicing. What then did Abraham answer the rich man? Remember, son, that you received good things in your life. You considered nothing good except what you had in this life. You received: but the days passed, and you lost everything, and you remained to be tormented in hell.</P>
<H5>He encourages good works.</H5>
<P>It is therefore fitting, brothers, that these things be said to you. Pay attention to the poor, whether lying down or walking: pay attention to the poor, do good works. Those who are accustomed to do so, do so: and those who are not accustomed to do so, do so. Let the number of those doing good increase: for the number of the faithful also increases. What you do, how good it is you do not yet see: for the farmer too, when he sows, does not see the crop, but trusts the soil. Why do you not trust God? Our harvest will come. Think that we are now laboring, laboring to receive, as it is written: They went forth and wept, casting their seeds; but they will come with exultation, bringing their sheaves.</P>
