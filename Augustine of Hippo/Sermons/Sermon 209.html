<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>On Lent</B></P>
<H5>Quarrels must be ended by Lenten observance.</H5>
<P>The solemn time has arrived, when I remind your Charity to think more attentively about the soul and to chastise the body. For these are the most sacred forty days throughout the whole world, which, as Easter approaches, the entire world, which God reconciles to himself in Christ, celebrates with devout proclamation. If there are any hostilities, which either should not have been born or should have died quickly, but have been able to persist until this time either through negligence, obstinacy, or immodest but proud shame among brothers, let them at least end now. Those over whom the sun should not have set, at least after many risings and settings of the sun, should finally be extinguished by their own setting and not be renewed by any further rising. The negligent forgets to end hostilities; the obstinate does not want to grant forgiveness when asked; the proudly ashamed disdains to ask for forgiveness. Hostilities live through these three vices: but they kill the souls in which they do not die. Let memory keep watch against negligence, mercy against obstinacy, humble prudence against proud shame. Whoever recalls himself being neglectful of concord, let him shake off his sleepiness by waking up: whoever desires to be the debt collector of his debtor, let him consider himself a debtor to God: whoever is ashamed to ask his brother for forgiveness, let him conquer through godly fear the evil shame: so that with harmful hostilities ended, with them dead, you may live. Love does all this, which does not act wrongly. Love, my brothers, to the extent that it is present, should be exercised by living well; to the extent that it is lacking, it should be sought by praying.</P>
<H5>Almsgiving aids prayer.</H5>
<P>But in order that our prayers may be helped by suitable aids, since in these days we ought to have them more fervent; let us also distribute alms more fervently. Let what is taken away from us by fasting and abstaining from usual foods be added to them. Although he ought to have larger ones who, due to some necessity of his body and the custom of foods, cannot abstain, so that he may add to the poor what he takes away from himself: but let the pious person give to the poor for this reason, because he does not take it away from himself; so that since he is less able to aid his prayers by chastising his body, he may include more abundant alms in the heart of the poor, which can pray for him. This is the most salutary and to be embraced advice from the Holy Scriptures: Place, it says, alms in the heart of the poor, and this will pray for you.</P>
<H5>What kind of abstinence should be undertaken.</H5>
<P>We also admonish those who abstain from meat not to shun the vessels in which they were cooked as if they were unclean. For the Apostle says speaking thus: "All things are clean to the clean." What happens in such observations is not for the purpose of avoiding uncleanness, but for restraining desire. Hence those who abstain from meat in such a way that they seek other foods with more difficult preparation and greater cost are greatly mistaken. For this is not to embrace abstinence, but to change indulgence. How shall we tell these people to give to the poor what they take away from themselves, those whose usual food is left behind in such a way that the cost is increased in acquiring something else? Therefore, be more frequently fasting during these days, spending more sparingly on yourselves, and giving more generously to the needy. Also, during these days, marital intercourse calls for continence: "For a time," says the Apostle, "that you may give yourselves to prayer; and return again lest Satan tempt you for your incontinence." This is not difficult and arduous for faithful married couples for a few days, which from a certain point in life to the end, holy widows have taken up, and holy virgins do throughout their entire life. In all these things let devotion glow and pride be restrained. Let no one rejoice so much in the gift of generosity that they lose the good of humility. And indeed all other gifts of God do not profit anything unless the bond of charity is present.</P>
