<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ON THE VIGILS OF EASTER</B></P>
<H5>Eagerly one must keep vigil on this most holy night. The good keep vigil, and the evil keep vigil too. The good should learn from the evil how to keep vigil.</H5>
<P>Blessed Paul the apostle, exhorting us to imitate him, among many other signs of his virtue, also says: In frequent watchings. How much more eagerly then should we vigil in this vigil, as the mother of all holy vigils, in which the whole world stays awake? Not that world, of which it is written: If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him: because all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, which is not from the Father. Such a world indeed, that is, the sons of unbelief, are ruled by devils and their angels: against whom the apostle himself says we have a struggle, where he says: Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world. Which we also once were, but now light in the Lord. Let us resist the rulers of darkness with the light of the vigils. Therefore, that world does not stay awake in this celebration: but that of which it is said: God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them. Although the celebration of this vigil is so bright throughout the whole world, as to compel even those to watch in the flesh, who, I do not say sleep in heart, but are buried in Tartarean impiety. They too stay awake this night, of which it is rendered visibly, that which was promised so long before: And the night shall be as bright as the day. This happens in the hearts of the pious, to whom it was said: You were once darkness, but now light in the Lord. This also happens among all rivals, both those who see in the Lord, and those who envy the Lord. Therefore, this night, both the hostile world and the reconciled world stay awake. This one stays awake to praise the Doctor delivered: that one to blaspheme the Judge condemned. This one, burning and shining with pious minds stays awake: that one, gnashing teeth and wasting away. Finally, charity keeps this one, iniquity keeps that one: Christian vigor keeps this one, diabolic envy keeps that one from sleeping in this celebration at all. Hence, even by our own enemies unknowingly, we are admonished how we ought to watch for ourselves, if even those who envy us stay awake because of us. Indeed, those who in no way are marked with the name of Christ, nevertheless on this night many with sorrow, many with shame; some also who approach the faith, already with the fear of God do not sleep. For different reasons, this celebration rouses them. How then should the friend of Christ stay awake with joy, when even the enemy stays awake with sorrow? How should the Christian ardently stay awake in such great glory of Christ, when the pagan is ashamed to sleep? How is it fitting for him who has entered this great house to stay awake in such great festivity, when even he who plans to enter stays awake? Therefore, let us watch and pray; that both outwardly and inwardly we may celebrate this vigil. God may speak to us in His readings; let us speak to God in our prayers. If we obediently hear His words, He whom we ask dwells in us.</P>
