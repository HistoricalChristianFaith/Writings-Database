Where Jesus showed Himself on the mountain to the three disciples</P>
<P>We heard a great vision on the mountain, where the Lord Jesus was shown to three disciples, Peter, James, and John, when the holy Gospel was read. His face shone like the sun; this signifies the clarity of the Gospel. His garments became white as snow; this signifies the purification of the Church, to whom it was said through the prophet: "And though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow." Elijah and Moses were conversing with Him; for the grace of the Gospel has testimony from the Law and the Prophets. In Moses, the Law; in Elijah, the Prophets: to speak briefly. These are the benefits of God through the holy Martyr, which are to be recited. Let us listen. It pleased Peter to make three tabernacles: one for Moses, one for Elijah, and one for Christ. The solitude of the mountain delighted him, he suffered the weariness from the tumult of human affairs. But why did he seek three tabernacles, except because he did not yet know the unity of the Law, the Prophecy, and the Gospel? Finally, he was corrected by a cloud. While he was speaking thus, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, the cloud made one tabernacle: why did you seek three? And a voice from the cloud said: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; listen to Him." Elijah is speaking; but listen to Him. Moses is speaking; but listen to Him. The Prophets speak, the Law speaks; but listen to Him, the voice of the Law and the tongue of the Prophets. He sounded in them, He appeared in Himself when He deigned. Listen to Him: let us listen to Him. When the Gospel was being spoken, think it was the cloud: from there the voice resounded to us. Let us listen to Him: let us do what He says, let us hope for what He promised.</P>
