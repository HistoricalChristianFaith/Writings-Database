<H5>Entering through closed doors is a sign of the omnipotence of God.</H5>
<P>Your Charity has heard, when the holy Gospel was read, that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ entered to His disciples after His resurrection while the doors were closed. A great miracle: but you cease to be amazed if you consider that He is God. For it would indeed be amazing if only a man had done this. Refer it to omnipotence, not to fantasy. He entered while the doors were closed. I answer you, so that you may know that it was true flesh, He showed the wounds to be touched. But just as it is not the nature of a bodily entity to enter through a closed door, so it is not the nature of a bodily entity to walk upon the waves of the sea. He entered through the closed doors; answer me, give me the solidity of flesh. He walked on the waters of the sea, you too give me the weight of flesh. Do you want to know that this was by omnipotence? He also granted it to Peter. He gave what He willed; He kept what was proper to Himself. For He who entered through the closed doors while living did not violate the integrity of His mother in being born. Therefore, brothers, let us admire and believe, believe and obey, obey and hope for the promises, if we do the commands: because He helps us to do the commands, from whom we hope for the promises.</P>
