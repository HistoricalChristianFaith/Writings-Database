<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ON THE FEAST OF THE MARTYR VINCENT</B></P>
<H5>The strength of the martyr is from Christ.</H5>
<P>In the passion which was recited to us today, my brothers, a fierce judge, a bloody torturer, and an invincible martyr are clearly shown. In his body, marked by various pains, the torments had already worn out, but still the members endured. So much evidence of miracles persisted in impiety, so many tortures afflicted did not yield to weakness; therefore, the divinity at work is recognized. For how could corruptible dust endure such immense torments unless Christ dwelt in him? In all these things, he is to be acknowledged, glorified, and praised, who both gave faith in the first calling and strength in the final suffering. Do you want to know that both were granted? Listen to the apostle Paul: "For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him." Vincent the deacon had received both, and he possessed them. For if he had not received, what would he have had? He had confidence in speech, he had endurance in suffering. Let no one, therefore, presume of his own heart when he speaks; let no one trust in his own strength when he endures temptation: because both to speak good things prudently, our wisdom is from him; and to bear evils courageously, our patience is from him. Recall the Lord Jesus Christ admonishing his disciples in the Gospel; recall the King of martyrs equipping his cohorts with spiritual arms, showing them battles, providing them aids, promising rewards; who, after saying to his disciples, "In this world, you will have tribulation," immediately added, as if to console the frightened heart, saying, "But take heart; I have overcome the world." Therefore, why do we wonder, dearest, if Vincent conquered in him by whom the world is conquered? "In this world," he says, "you will have tribulation; so that if it presses, it does not oppress; if it attacks, it does not vanquish."</P>
<H5>The double battle line of the world against the soldiers of Christ, allurements and terrors.</H5>
<P>The world produces a double line of attack against the soldiers of Christ. Take note, brothers. I said, the world produces a double line of attack against the soldiers of Christ. It flatters to deceive; it terrifies to break. Let not our own pleasure hold us, nor let external cruelty terrify us; and the world is conquered. Christ meets both approaches, and the Christian is not defeated. If human patience is considered in this suffering, it begins to seem incredible; if divine power is recognized, it ceases to be remarkable. Such cruelty raged in the body of the Martyr, and such tranquility was produced in his voice, and so much harshness of tortures raged in his limbs, and such security sounded in his words, that it was wondrously thought, while Vincent was suffering, that someone else or certainly another was speaking while Vincent was being tortured. And truly, dearest brothers, it was so: indeed, it was so; another was speaking. For Christ promised this also to His witnesses in the Gospel, those whom He prepared for such struggles. For He said: Do not meditate beforehand how or what you shall speak. For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you. Therefore, the flesh suffered, and the Spirit spoke. And while the Spirit spoke, not only was impiety refuted, but also weakness was strengthened.</P>
<H5>Vincent was not as much devastated by his torments as Dacian.</H5>
<P>The more torments there were, the more illustrious the Martyr appeared to us. For, pierced by a manifold variety of wounds, he did not abandon the fight but repeated it more fiercely. You might have thought that the flame hardened him, not burned him; and just as a potter's furnace takes soft clay and renders it a hard vessel. Our Martyr could say to Dacianus: "Now my flesh does not care for your fires, because: My strength has dried up like a potsherd." And since it is truly written: "The potter's furnace tests the vessels, and the tribulation of temptation tests the righteous men"; Vincentius was tested and purified by that fire: truly Dacianus burned and cracked. For if he was not burning, how did he smoke? For what were the words of the angry man, except the smoke of a burning? Therefore, applying external flames to our Martyr who had solace in his heart; but he himself, inflamed by the torches of rage, burned inside like an oven, and burned his inhabitant, the devil. Through the furious words of Dacianus, through his savage eyes and threatening countenance, and the movements of his entire body, his inner inhabitant was revealed; and through these visible signs, just like through the crackling crevices of his own vessel, which he had filled, he was displayed. The torments did not torture the Martyr as much as madness devastated him.</P>
<H5>The glory of Vincent after the suffering, even in this world.</H5>
<P>But now, brothers, all those things have passed: both the wrath of Dacian and the punishment of Vincent. However, the punishment of Dacian and the crown of Vincent remain. Finally, so that we may show the glory of the martyrs even in this world, dismissing for now the outcomes of future retribution: which region today, which overseas province, as far as the Roman Empire or the Christian name extends, does not rejoice in celebrating the feast day of Vincent? But who today would have even heard the name of Dacian, if not for having read about Vincent's passion? For the Lord, preserving the Martyr's body with such care, demonstrated nothing else but that He who did not abandon him breathless had governed him while living. Thus, Vincent triumphed over Dacian while living, and triumphed even in death. Living, he trampled upon the torments; dead, he swam across the seas. But He himself guided the lifeless corpse amidst the waves, who had given Vincent an invincible spirit to God amidst the claws. Neither did the torturer's flame bend his heart, nor did the sea's water submerge his body. But in all these things, there is nothing else but what is precious in the sight of the Lord: the death of his saints. To this glory may the Lord lead us under His protection, to whom be honor and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</P>
