Where the lazy servant, who did not want to use the received talent, is condemned.</B></P>
<H5>Bishop, whence called.</H5>
<P>Our brethren and fellow bishops in the Lord have deigned to visit us in their presence and to cheer us up, but I do not know why they do not want to help me in my weariness. I have said this to your Charity in their hearing, so that your hearing may intercede for me with them, so that when I ask them, they may also make a speech. Let them distribute what they have received, and let them be willing to work rather than to excuse themselves. As for me, who am weary and barely speaking, kindly accept a few words. For we also have a little book about the benefits given by God through the holy Martyr, let us all the more willingly listen together. What then is it? What shall I say to you? You have heard in the Gospel both the merit of good servants and the punishment of bad ones. And all the wickedness of that servant who was rejected and severely condemned was this: because he did not want to distribute. He kept intact what he had received: but his Lord was seeking gains. God is covetous for our salvation. If he is thus condemned who did not distribute, what should those who lose expect? We, therefore, are stewards, we distribute, you receive. We seek gains: live well. For these are the gains of our distribution. But also do not think that distribution does not pertain to you. You cannot distribute from this higher place, but you can wherever you are. Where Christ is reproached, defend Him: answer murmurers, rebuke blasphemers, alienate yourselves from their company. Thus you distribute if you gain anyone. Do our part in your houses. The bishop is called from this because he oversees, because by overseeing he takes care. Therefore, each one in his house, if he is the head of his house, ought to have the office of a bishop to see how his own believe, lest any of them fall into heresy - neither wife, son, daughter, nor even servant, because so much has been paid for him. Apostolic discipline has set the master over the servant, and the servant under the master; yet Christ gave one price for both. Do not despise your least ones, procure with all vigilance the salvation of your household. If you do this, you distribute: you will not be lazy servants, you will not fear such a detestable condemnation.</P>
