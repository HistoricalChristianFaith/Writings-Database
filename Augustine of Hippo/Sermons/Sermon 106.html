<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>On the Words of the Gospel of Luke 11:39-42:<BR>
"Now you, Pharisees, cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish"<BR>
"You are washed," and so forth.</B></P>
<H5>Only the external cleanliness of the Pharisees.</H5>
<P>You have heard the holy Gospel, how the Lord Jesus, in what he said to the Pharisees, was certainly warning his disciples, not to think that justice lies in bodily purification. For every day the Pharisees, before they dined, would wash themselves with water: as if daily washing could be the cleansing of the heart. Finally, he showed what sort they were. He who saw was the one speaking: for he could see not only their faces but also their innermost parts. Finally, to let you know this, that Pharisee to whom Christ responded thought within himself, he did not speak aloud, and yet the Lord heard. For he criticized the Lord Christ within himself, because he came to his meal unwashed. He was thinking, and the Lord heard, thus he responded. So what did he respond? Now you, Pharisees, you clean the outside of the cup: but inside you are full of deceit and robbery. Oh, come to the meal! How did he not spare the man by whom he was invited? He spared more by rebuking, so that by correcting in judgment he might spare him. Then what did he show us? That Baptism, which is administered once, cleanses through faith. But faith is within, not outside. Hence it is said and read in the Acts of the Apostles: Purifying their hearts by faith. And the apostle Peter speaks thus in his Epistle: So, he says, he gave you the likeness of Noahâ€™s ark, how eight souls were saved through water. And he adds: So also Baptism will save you in the same form; not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the inquiry of a good conscience. This inquiry of a good conscience the Pharisees despised, and they washed what was outside: within they remained most defiled.</P>
<H5>Almsgiving without faith cannot cleanse.</H5>
<P>And what did he say to them afterward? Nevertheless, give alms, and behold, all things are clean for you. Almsgiving is praised; do it and test it. But pay attention for a moment: it was said to the Pharisees. These Pharisees were Jews, like the distinguished ones among the Jews. For those who were more noble and learned were called Pharisees at that time. They had not been washed by the baptism of Christ: they had not yet believed in Christ, the only begotten Son of God, who walked among them and was not recognized by them. How then does he say to them: Give alms, and behold, all things are clean for you? If those Pharisees listened to him and gave alms, according to his word all things would be clean for them; what need was there for them to believe in him? But if they could not be cleansed except by believing in him who cleanses the heart by faith; what does it mean: Give alms, and behold, all things are clean for you? Let us pay attention, and perhaps he himself explains it?</P>
<H5>The alms of the Pharisees are insufficient.</H5>
<P>When he had said this, without a doubt they thought that they were giving alms. And how did they give? They tithed all their possessions, taking a tenth part from all their produce, and giving that. It is not easy for any Christian to do this. Behold what the Jews did. Not only the wheat, but also the wine and oil: and not only this, but even the contemptible things because of the command of God, cumin, rue, mint and dill, they completely tithed: that is, they took a tenth part and gave it as alms. Therefore, I believe that they recalled to themselves and thought that the Lord Christ was speaking in vain, as if to those who did not give alms: though they knew their works, that they tithed even the smallest and most contemptible of their produce, and gave alms. They mocked him among themselves for saying such things, as if to people who did not give alms.</P>
<P>The Lord knowing this, immediately added: Nevertheless, woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees, who tithe mint, cumin, and rue, and every herb. Know that I am aware of your alms. Certainly, these are your alms, these are the tithes: you even tithe the smallest and most insignificant of your fruits: And you neglect the weightier matters of the Law, judgment, and charity. Pay attention. You have neglected judgment and charity, and you tithe herbs. This is not doing alms. And he says, these are what you ought to have done, and not to leave the others undone. Which things to do? Judgment and charity, justice and mercy; and not to leave the others undone. Do those things: but prioritize these.</P>
<H5>The true alms which are commanded to be done.</H5>
<P>If these things are so, what did he say to them: Give alms, and behold, everything is clean for you? What does it mean: Give alms? Do mercy. What does it mean, Do mercy? If you understand, start with yourself. For how can you be merciful to another, if you are cruel to yourself? Give alms, and everything is clean for you. Do true alms. What is alms? Mercy. Hear the Scripture: Have mercy on your soul, pleasing God. Do alms, have mercy on your soul, pleasing God. Your soul begs before you, return to your conscience. Whoever lives badly, whoever lives unfaithfully, return to your conscience: and there you will find your begging soul, you will find it needy, you will find it poor, you will find it miserable, you will find it perhaps not only needy but mute with beggary. For if it begs, it hungers for righteousness. When you have found such a soul of yours (those things are within your heart), first do alms, give it bread. What bread? If a Pharisee were to ask, the Lord would tell him: Do alms with your soul. For this is what He said to him; but he did not understand, when He explained to them the alms they were doing, and they thought to hide it from Christ; and He said to them: I know that you do them; you tithe mint and dill, cumin and rue: but I speak of other alms: you neglect justice and love. In justice and love do alms with your soul. What is in justice? Look and find; displease yourself, pronounce judgment on yourself. And what is love? Love the Lord God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind; love your neighbor as yourself; and you have done mercy first with your soul, in your conscience. But if you neglect this alms, give what you want, donate as much as you want; take from your fruits, not tithes, but halves; give nine parts, and keep one for yourself: you do nothing, when you do not do with yourself, and you are poor with yourself. Let your soul be nourished, lest it perish from hunger. Give it bread. What bread, he says? He speaks to you himself. If you would hear, and understand, and believe the Lord, He Himself would say to you: I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Would you not first give this bread to your soul, and do alms with it? If therefore you believe, you ought to do, that you may first feed your soul. Believe in Christ; and the things that are within will be cleansed, and the things that are outside will be clean. Turned to the Lord, etc.</P>
