<H5>Curses of parents upon their children, how they are to be feared.</H5>
<P>Indeed, the mercy of God, brothers, as it must be believed, all these brothers, whom the wrath of God struck with one maternal plague, will someday attain the health of which we rejoice. Nevertheless, let the children learn to obey, let them fear their parents' anger. It is written: The blessing of the father establishes the house of the children; the curse of the mother uproots the foundations. Now these are not in the foundations of their homeland through the lands: they provide a spectacle everywhere, they make their punishment evident; they present their misery to the eyes, they frighten other peoples' arrogance. Learn, children, what Scripture says, to give due honor to parents. But you also, parents, when you are offended, remember that you are parents. A mother prayed against her children, she was heard; because God is truly just, because she had indeed suffered an injustice. One of them had used abusive words and laid hands; and the others patiently bore the mother's injury, and did not respond with one word against their brother for her. The just God who heard the praying one heard the grieving one. But what of that miserable one? Was she not punished more from where she was sooner heard? Learn this: to ask from God where you do not fear to be heard.</P>
<H5>Health not granted to two brothers in Ancona, so that it was allowed to them in Hippo. The memory of Stephen on what occasion it was built at Ancona before the discovery of his body.</H5>
<P>But we, brothers, should strive to give thanks to our Lord God for the one who was healed; and for the one who is still held, let us pour out prayers. Let us bless God, because He considered us worthy to see this. For what are we, because I appeared to these people unknowingly? For they saw me, and I was unaware: and they were admonished to come to this city. Who am I? I am a man, one among many, not among the great. And truly, as your Charity may hear, I am greatly amazed, and rejoice that this was granted to us: for this man could not have been cured at Ancona; indeed, he could have been, but it was not done because of us, as it could have been done very easily. For many know how many miracles are performed through the most blessed martyr Stephen in this city. And hear what will amaze you: his old memorial was there, and it still is there. But perhaps you say: His body had not yet appeared, whence came the memory there? The cause indeed lies hidden: but what the rumor brought to us, I will not keep silent from your Charity. When Saint Stephen was being stoned, some even innocent ones, especially those who had already believed in Christ, were standing around: it is said a stone came into his elbow, and being struck from there, came before a certain religious man. He took it and kept it. The man was among sailors, and the chance of navigation brought him to the shore of Ancona, and it was revealed to him there that the stone should be deposited. He obeyed the revelation, and did what he was commanded: from that time began there the memory of Saint Stephen to be, and there was a rumor that the arm of Saint Stephen was there, not knowing what had happened to the people. But it is understood that it was revealed to be there, for it was to place the stone that was struck from the elbow of the Martyr, because in Greek the elbow is called ἀγκών. But let those who know what miracles happen there, themselves teach us. These miracles did not begin to happen there, until after the body of Saint Stephen appeared. Behold, that young man was not cured there, so that he would be preserved for our eyes.</P>
<H5>Of the miracles performed at Uzalis.</H5>
<P>At Uzalis, where my brother Evodius is bishop, inquire how many miracles occur there, and you will find out. But passing over the others, I point out to you one thing that happened there, so you may see how great is the presence of majesty there.</P>
<P>A certain woman suddenly lost her sick son, whom she could not rush to help, in her arms as a catechumen: who cried out, "My son, a catechumen, is dead," she said.</P>
<H5>The cry of the people arose from the sudden healing of the girl.</H5>
<P>And when Augustine said these things, the people began to cry out in memory of Saint Stephen, "Thanks be to God! Praise be to Christ!" In this continuous clamor, the girl who was healed was brought to the apse. Seeing her, the people, with joy and weeping, with no words interposed, but only with the noise interposed, prolonged the clamor for a while: and when silence was restored, Bishop Augustine said: "It is written in the Psalm: 'I said, I will confess my transgression to the Lord God, and you forgave the guilt of my heart.' I said, I will confess: I had not yet spoken: I said, I will confess, and you forgave. I commended this wretched one, or rather, from wretchedness, I commended her to your prayers. We decided to pray, and we were heard. Let our joy be an act of thanksgiving. The Mother Church was heard more swiftly than that other mother cursed in her destruction." Turned to the Lord, etc.</P>
