<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>In Lent</B></P>
<H5>Pleasures must be restrained, not changed.</H5>
<P>The solemn time has arrived when we should remind you and exhort you in the Lord's Love: although the very time itself, even without us speaking, sufficiently reminds and exhorts you to fervently engage in fasting, prayers, and alms more earnestly and eagerly than usual. But the ministry of our sermon is added so that the trumpet of this voice may give strength to your spirit, which is about to fight against the flesh. Let your fasts, therefore, be without quarrels, outcries, and conflicts, so that even those under your yoke feel cautious and kind remission, and harsh severity may be restrained, not so that beneficial discipline is dissolved. And when you abstain from certain kinds of even permitted and lawful foods for the purpose of chastening the body, remember that to the pure, all things are pure: do not think anything is unclean unless unbelief has made it so. For to the impure and the unbelieving, says the Apostle, nothing is pure. But clearly, when the bodies of the faithful are subjected to servitude, reducing bodily pleasure profits spiritual health. Therefore, care must be taken not to seek expensive foods or other kinds in place of others, or even more costly ones without animal flesh. For when the body is chastised and subjected to servitude, delicacies must be restrained, not changed. For what matter is it, with what kind of food immoderate desire is condemned? It is certainly not only from meats, but also certain fruits and agricultural foods that the desire of the Israelites was condemned by the divine voice. And Esau lost his birthright not for a piece of pork, but for a pottage of lentils. Let me omit what the hungry Lord answered to the tempter even about bread itself: who indeed was not subduing his own flesh as rebellious, but mercifully reminding us what to answer in such temptations. Therefore, dearest ones, from whichever foods you choose to abstain, remember to preserve your resolution with pious temperance, not to condemn God's creation with sacrilegious error. Also, those of you who are bound in marriage, now especially do not disregard the apostolic admonitions to abstain from each other for a time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer. For what is beneficial to do on other days, it is far too impudent if it is not done now. I think it should not be burdensome for married people to observe this annually in solemn days, what widows have professed to do from a certain part of life, what holy virgins have undertaken all their life.</P>
<H5>"Almsgiving must be amplified by giving and sparing."</H5>
<P>Now indeed, to increase almsgiving in these days is, in a certain way, a duty. For where more justly than by showing mercy do you give what you deny yourself by abstaining? And what is more unjust than that what abstinence saves, ongoing avarice keeps, or delayed luxury consumes? Therefore, consider to whom you owe what you deny yourself; so that what temperance takes from pleasure, mercy adds to charity. What more shall I say of that work of mercy, where nothing is spent from the storerooms, nothing from the purse, but is forgiven from the heart; which, if it remains, is more harmful than if it departs? I speak of anger kept in the heart against someone. And what is more foolish than to avoid an external enemy, yet retain a far worse one in the innermost heart? Wherefore the Apostle says: "Let not the sun go down upon your anger;" and immediately adds: "Neither give place to the devil." As if to say that whoever does not quickly expel anger from his soul, through it, as through a door, provides entry to the devil. Thus, it must first be ensured that this sun does not set upon anger; lest the sun of justice itself desert the mind. But in whose heart it has persisted until now, let at least the approaching day of the Lord's Passion drive it out, He who was not angry with His murderers, for whom, hanging on the cross, He both prayed and shed His blood. Therefore, let anger depart from the heart of each of you by these holy days, so that prayer may proceed securely: and may it not offend, or falter, or under the stings of conscience be silenced, when it comes to that place where it must be said: "Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors." You will ask for something not to be repaid to you, and something to be given to you. Forgive, then, and you will be forgiven: give, and it will be given to you. These things, brethren, even if I do not admonish, you should care for with perpetual meditation. But since the voice of our ministry is also aided by the celebration of this present day with so many divine testimonies; I need not fear that any of you might perhaps scorn me, or rather the Lord in me: but rather hope that His flock, recognizing that what is said is His, may effectively heed Him.</P>
