<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>On the Solemnity of the Martyrs, of whom one is foremost,<BR>
Another victory was called Perpetua</B></P>
<H5>Witnesses of Christ and witnesses of the devil in the Passion that was read.</H5>
<P>The name "martyr" is Greek, in Latin they are called witnesses; if they are witnesses, for the truth of their testimony they endured so much. Truth served God, iniquity lied to itself. For it is written thus; the body of Christ speaks in the Psalm, which is the Church: False witnesses have risen against me, and iniquity has lied to itself. Witnesses and witnesses: false witnesses, and righteous witnesses; witnesses of the devil, and witnesses of Christ. We have seen, observed, and heard the kind of each witness, when the passion of the blessed martyrs, whose solemnity day is celebrated, was read. They were asked what they had done and replied that they had gathered together because they were Christians. This is the testimony of the truth. The judge said: “Since you have admitted to the crime.” This is the testimony of iniquity. God was proclaimed, and it was called a crime. In the proclamation of God, truth obeyed God; in the designation of the crime, iniquity lied to itself. For what they were saying was turning back on them, and the false crime was condemned by true crime. Our martyrs did not commit a crime; the martyrs of Christ did not commit a crime by gathering together to praise God, to hear the truth, to hope for the kingdom of heaven, and to despise the present wicked age. These did not commit a crime. This is called piety, this thing's name is religion, this thing's name is devotion, this thing's name is true testimony. What crime, therefore, did they commit who, after confessing their piety, were further killed? “This and that one,” said the judge of iniquity, the witness of falsehood, “this and that one be executed by the sword.” Behold the crime. Hear also the voice of piety: Thanks be to God, said the first witness Primus; Victoria Perpetua concluded the testimony. I believe that your Charity noticed, when the passion of the saints was read, that the first one to confess was called Primus, before the last; Perpetual Victory at the end. O victory without blemish! O end without end! For what is perpetual victory, if not victory without end? This is to overcome the allurements of the flesh, to overcome the threats of the perverse judge, to overcome the pain of the body, to overcome the love of life.</P>
<H5>Acclamation. Love of life in martyrs conquered by the love of life.</H5>
<P>I will say, if I can, with the Lord helping, my brothers, what I feel: in the holy martyrs, the love of life was conquered by the love of life. You who have acclaimed have understood; but for the sake of those who did not understand, suffer me, you who have understood, to briefly explain what I said. I said this: in the holy martyrs, the love of life was conquered by the love of life; by loving life, they despised life. Who, by loving silver, despises silver? Who, by loving gold, despises gold? Who, by loving estates, despises estates? No one despises what they love. We find martyrs who loved life and despised life. They would not reach that life unless they trampled on this one. They knew what they were doing, who were gaining by giving away. Do not think, dearest ones, that they lost their sense when they loved life and despised life; they did not lose their sense. They were sowing seeds and seeking the harvest. I see the farmer's sense, and I recognize wisdom in the martyrs. The farmer, by loving wheat, sows wheat. You who do not know what the sower does, perhaps you will rebuke him, and say: What are you doing, insane one? What you have gathered with such labor, you bring forth, you scatter, you take from your eyes, you cast on the ground, moreover you bury it? He replies to you: I love wheat; therefore, I throw wheat; if I did not love it, I would not throw it; I want it to grow, not perish. Behold what our martyrs did, incomparably wiser than farmers. For sowers scatter a few grains, and reapers gather many. But both what is scattered and what is gathered have an end; what is scattered is not much, what is gathered is much, yet both come to an end. And would you not have our martyrs scatter this life, destined someday to end by death, to gain life that has no death? Good usurers, good sowers; God is the one who multiplies. He Himself multiplies crops in the field; He nurtures whatever is brought forth from the earth. God can multiply grains: can He not preserve His martyrs? Behold, I tell you, listen to what they heard.</P>
<H5>Against drinking on martyrs' days.</H5>
<P>You also heard just now, when the Gospel was being read; that which was promised to them, you have received: They will deliver you up, he says, in councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues, and they will kill some of you; but I tell you: Not a hair of your head will perish, and in your patience you will possess your souls. You will possess and not lose; for there no enemy pursues, no friend dies. There you will be, where perpetual day has no preceding yesterday, nor following tomorrow. There you will be good money lenders, where the devil cannot follow you. Bear the present; rejoice in the eternal. Hard are the things you endure, but great is the fruit of what you sow. Read what has been said about you, when you sowed: They went forth and wept, sowing their seeds. With what fruit? with what end? with what consolation? But they will come with exultation, carrying their sheaves. From these sheaves crowns are made. Let us therefore celebrate the days of the martyrs, honoring the passions of the martyrs, not loving the drinking. Turned to the Lord.</P>
