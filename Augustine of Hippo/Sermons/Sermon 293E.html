<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>OF TWO MEN: CHRIST AND JOHN</B></P>
<H5>Christ is greater than John the man, though Christ is a man.</H5>
<P>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Was it not given, each one of them might be said about him, all things were made through him? He held divinity within himself, he granted grace to us. Let us recognize man for our sake, let us recognize God above us: the very man, the very God. But you see two men, both John and Christ; but, the man you see, is greater than John... and yet he is not worthy to loosen the strap of his sandal. Therefore, understand him to be the greater: and so much greater, that John is lesser to him, although he is greater than all the righteous. However, he is greater than earth and heaven: greater than angels, greater than all powers, greater than all authorities and dominions. Whence is he greater? because all things were made through him, and without him nothing was made. By this he is equal to the Father, by man he is less than the Father: for he himself said: I and the Father are one, he who said: The Father is greater than I. Both statements seemingly contrary, and both true: your heart should not quarrel, and the words of the Lord do not quarrel. I and the Father are one, he showed equality; The Father is greater than I, he showed inequality.</P>
<H5>In God it is not said: Was, or: Will be, but: Is.</H5>
<P>Where I and the Father are one, hear the Apostle interpreting the senses of both in one place: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, because this was his birth. Robbery is usurpation: just as Adam, these things were made robbery for him; and therefore, because he wanted to seize what he was not, he lost what he had. How did he want robbery? The serpent said to him, from where he himself had also fallen: I will set my throne in the north, and I will be like the Most High. This thought cast down the devil: this suggestion made man a participant in the devil's pride. For he envied the one standing, who had already fallen; he cast him down from where he himself fell. Behold to whom robbery was. But it was not to him, because he was born equal, and remaining from eternity to eternity, he was never not equal, never will not be; nor should it be said: He was, Is, and Will be, but Is; for what is said: He was, is no longer; but what is said: He will be, is not yet. Therefore he himself, when he commanded his servant Moses, when Moses said to him, What are you called? and said: What shall I say to the children of Israel? He replied: I am who am. Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: Who is has sent me to you. Where it is said: Is, it is genuine, it is sincere; it can never and nowhere be changed. This is God, this is the Son of God, this is the Holy Spirit. Therefore, brothers, this is above all things, and therefore the Son is equal to the Father; hence the Apostle: He thought it not robbery to be equal with God.</P>
<H5>Christ, a man God; John, a good man because of God.</H5>
<P>Whence comes: The Father is greater than I? But he emptied himself - see, distinguish the words - taking the form of a servant. Impress this on your ears, and discern how, when he said the form of a servant, he said taking; but concerning the form of God, he did not say taking, but said: who, though he was in the form of God, took the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, the death of the cross, therefore God also exalted him and gave him a name which is above every name. According to how he was made, he was exalted; according to this exaltation, according to how he was humble; for according to how he is equal to the Father, he is not exalted, because he was never humble. According to how he died, he rose again, and gave him a name which is above every name. Behold, Christ coming, and yet he was already there; he rose again, and ascended into heaven, and yet he had not departed from there. Do you think he is a man? Do not think so. Behold the man: of whom no one born of women is greater. Hear him concerning this man: I am not worthy to untie his sandal strap. Therefore understand two men: but one man is God, the other man is good for God's sake; one man is the truth, the other man is truthful because of the truth.</P>
