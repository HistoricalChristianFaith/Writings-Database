<h5>Let the bodies of the catechumens not be buried among the bodies of the faithful.</h5>
<P>Concerning the burial of catechumens: Lord Father and Brother, since he deigns, commands that I inform your holiness. And indeed, it is especially his concern, but in that charity about which we were speaking, we share everything with you, so that we may be partakers in Christ. Pain is somewhat usual and, with pardon, begrudging. For who would not forgive the sorrowful and troubled if perhaps they speak with a tinge of envy? However, you all ought to know, dearest ones, what many of you and almost all know, that according to the custom and discipline of the Church, the bodies of deceased catechumens should not be buried among the bodies of the faithful, where also the sacraments of the faithful are celebrated, nor can it be granted to anyone. Otherwise, it will be nothing other than culpable favoritism. For why should it be granted to the richer and not to the poorer, if what there is in consolation for the dead? For the merits of the dead are considered, not in the places of the bodies, but in the affections of the souls. My brothers, and in this manner, as the faithful, learn to think: for the sake of the sacraments, bodies cannot be placed where they should not.</P>
<h5>No one is certain they will live tomorrow.</h5>
<P>Nevertheless, we mourn and grieve for the catechumen who has departed from us and for whom our concern was. And from this, we admonish you, brothers, that no one may be certain he will live tomorrow. Run to grace, change your ways: let this be an admonition for you. What was healthier than he, what was more vigorous in body than he? Suddenly he has died. He was safe, and he passed away, and would that he had passed away and not truly died. For what shall I say, my brothers? Shall I flatter the man and say that even catechumens go where the faithful go? Shall we so flatter the sufferings of men that we dispute against the Gospel? We cannot, my brothers. We must run while we live, lest we truly mourn the dead and they be truly dead. If as much effort was put into the sacraments of the living as is put into the burial of the dead, perhaps no one would be reasonably mourned: for even if they were mourned, it would be with carnal affection. For he who attains better things is not to be mourned, having forsaken the temptations of the world, and fearing nothing, secure in Christ, not fearing the adversary the devil, not dreading a slanderous man.</P>
<h5>About the rich man and Lazarus.</h5>
<P>For perhaps that Lazarus, whose wounds the dogs were licking, was not buried; for God was silent about his burial. It is said only that when he died, he was carried to Abraham's bosom. It is not said that he was buried either. For he who was despised while alive and hungry, perhaps was also cast out unburied when dead. Yet he was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. But the rich man also died and was buried. What benefit was perhaps the marble tomb to a soul in hell, thirsting and not receiving even a drop from the tip of a finger? I do not wish to say any more, my brothers; it is enough to have terrified you thus far, lest we augment the grief of some of our brothers who have been struck by this misfortune. For I ought not to have said these things, unless we were compelled to exhort and admonish all of you.</P>
<h5>"Run while you live, so that you may live."</h5>
<P>Consider the frailty of man, my brothers; run while you live, that you may live; run while you live, that you may not truly die. The discipline of Christ is not to be feared. He exclaims: My yoke is easy, and my burden is light, in this very chapter that we were discussing a little earlier: Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light, and you argue back and say: "I do not yet want to be faithful"? "I cannot." What is: "I cannot"?<FONT SIZE=1>"... unless because the yoke of Christ is harsh, and the load is heavy? Therefore, does your flesh tell you the truth, and Christ lie? He says: It is gentle, and your vanity says: 'It is harsh.' He says: It is light, and your vanity says: 'It is heavy.' Believe Christ more, because His yoke is indeed gentle, and the load is light. Do not fear, and place it on your neck without hesitation. The yoke will be gentler on your neck the more faithfully you bear it. And so, brothers, we have said these things and admonished your love for two reasons: that no one may ask this and be sorrowful if he does not obtain it, and so that each one of you, O catechumens, when you live, beware lest you perish when dead, and, in what manner aid might reach you, let neither yourselves nor mother Church find."</P>
