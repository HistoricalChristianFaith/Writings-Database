<P>Epiphany is the manifestation in Latin. The Lord Christ was manifested to the Jews a few days before His birth: but on this day He was declared to the Gentiles by the star. The ox recognized its owner, and the donkey its master's manger. The ox from the Jews, the donkey from the Gentiles; both came to one manger and found the food of the Word. The Magi who came to worship Christ, and signify the first fruits of the Gentiles, did not receive the Law, nor did they hear the Prophets: the star was the language of heaven to them. As if it were said to them: "What did I seek for profit from you? The heavens declare the glory of God." And yet Herod was troubled, and he asked the Jews where Christ was to be born. And they answered: "In Bethlehem of Judea"; and they provided prophetic testimony; and while the Magi proceeded to worship, they themselves remained immobile. On the mound, there are stones; they show the way but do not walk. Nevertheless, the Magi went on to Bethlehem; but having found the city, how could they find the house? Behold, that star which shone from heaven, led them on earth, and stood over the place where the child was. How great the servitude of the elements, and the wickedness of the Jews! Herod was troubled, as though Christ had come to seek and find an earthly kingdom. The lion of heaven was born, and the earthly little fox was troubled. The Lord said of Herod: "Go, tell that fox." What did the troubled one do? He killed the infants. What did he do? He killed infants for the infant Word. They were made martyrs by blood before they could confess the Lord with their mouth. And Christ sent these first fruits to the Father. The infant came, and the infants went; the infant to us, the infants to God. "Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies, you have perfected praise." Let us rejoice, the day has dawned for us. The Magi, the first fruits of the Gentiles, signified us. The Jews recognized Him when He was born, the Gentiles recognized Him yesterday. Different walls came to the cornerstone, from there the Jews, from there the Gentiles; from different directions, but not to different ones. You have seen and known that the walls are as far apart from each other as they are distant from the corner. As they draw near to the corner, they draw near to each other: when they come to the corner, they cling to each other. Christ did this. The Jews and Gentiles, circumcision and uncircumcision, those with the Law and without the Law, worshippers of the one true God and of many false gods, were far from each other. How far? But He is our peace, who made both one. But those who came from the Jews are numbered in the good wall: for those who came, did not remain in ruin. They and we have been made one: but in one, not in us. Whence was Christ born? From the Jews. Thus you have written: "Salvation is from the Jews," but not for the Jews alone. For He did not say: "Salvation to the Jews"; but: "Salvation from the Jews." They comprehended, and they lost it; they bound him, and He fled from them; they saw Him, and they killed Him: we neither comprehended Him, and we hold Him; nor saw Him, and we believe; we are last, and precede. Those who preceded us lost the way: but we have found the way and, walking in it, we will come to the homeland.</P>
