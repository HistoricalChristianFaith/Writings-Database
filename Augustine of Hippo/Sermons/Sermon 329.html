<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>On the Birthday of the Martyrs</B></P>
<H5>Precious is the death of the Martyrs bought at the price of the death of Christ.</H5>
<P>Through the glorious deeds of the holy martyrs, by which the Church flourishes everywhere, we ourselves prove with our own eyes how true it is that we sang, because precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints: when both in our sight it is precious, and in his sight, for whose name it was done. But the price of these deaths is the death of one. How many deaths did one dying man purchase, who, if he had not died, the grain of wheat would not be multiplied? You heard his words when he was approaching his passion, that is, when he was approaching our redemption: Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone: but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit. For in the cross he made a great exchange; there the money bag of our price was loosed: when his side was opened by the spear of the soldier, thence flowed forth the price of the whole world. The faithful and the martyrs were bought: but the faith of the martyrs was proven; the blood is the witness. What was spent on them, they returned, and fulfilled what Saint John said: As Christ laid down his life for us, so we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. And elsewhere it is said: At a great table you have sat, carefully consider what is set before you, for such things you must prepare. A great table is where the Lord of the table himself is the feast. No one feeds the guests from himself: this the Lord Christ does; he is the inviter, he is the food and drink. Therefore the martyrs recognized what they ate and drank, so that they might render such things.</P>
<H5>Martyrs are victors not of themselves, but by the grace of God.</H5>
<P>But from where could they return such things, unless He gave from where they could return, who first bestowed it? Hence also the Psalm, where it is written, we sang: Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints; what does it commend to us? There, a man considered how much he had received from God; he looked around at how many gifts of the Almighty's grace he had received, who created him, who sought him when he was lost, who forgave him when found, who helped him when he struggled with weak strength, who did not withdraw from him when he was in danger, who crowned him when he was victorious, who gave himself as a reward: he considered all these things, and exclaimed, and said: What shall I render to the Lord for all He has rendered to me? He did not want to be ungrateful, he wanted to repay, and he had nothing to repay. He did not say: What shall I render to the Lord for all that He has given me; but, for all He has rendered to me? He did not give, but rendered. If He rendered, we had offered something. Indeed, we had offered our evils, He rendered His goods: for He rendered good for evil, when we rendered evil for ourselves. Therefore he seeks what to repay; he suffers distress, he does not find from where to pay the debt: What shall I render to the Lord for all He has rendered to me? And as if he found what he could render: I will take the cup of salvation, he says, and call upon the name of the Lord. What is this? Surely he was thinking of giving back. Yet he still seeks to receive: I will take the cup of salvation. What is this cup? The cup of bitter and healing passion: the cup which, unless the doctor first drank it, the patient would fear to touch. This is that cup: we recognize it in the mouth of Christ saying: Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me. For even the sons of Zebedee sought exalted places through their mother, to sit one at His right and the other at His left: to whom He said: Are you able to drink the cup that I shall drink? Do you seek height? It comes through the valley to the mountain. Do you seek the seat of glory? First drink the cup of humility. Concerning this cup the martyrs said: I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. Are you not afraid you may fail there? No, he says. Why? Because I will call upon the name of the Lord. How would the martyrs have conquered, unless He conquered in the martyrs, who said: Rejoice, because I have overcome the world? The Emperor of heaven ruled their minds and tongues, and through them conquered the devil on earth, and crowned the martyrs in heaven. O blessed are those who thus drank this cup! They ended their pains and received honors. Therefore, consider, beloved: what you cannot see with your eyes, think and contemplate with mind and soul, and see that precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints.</P>
