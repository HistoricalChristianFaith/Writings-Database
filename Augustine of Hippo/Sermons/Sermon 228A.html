On the Day of the Nativity of the Holy Martyrs

1. Our joy and the exultation of the church is always in the confession of the martyrs. Certainly, in the whole world, even outside the Christian name, the saints of God are celebrated. If anyone is accused of Christianity, glory is found in their accusation. Indeed, they are the people who, enduring all manner of punishment and weariness for the name of Christ, were not subjugated, but rather emerged as victors.

2. Today, however, beloved, we celebrate those by whose sufferings the Christian people attain the summit of faith. These are the athletes of Christ, whose dedication amidst severe persecutions did not betray the faith.

3. The strength of our martyrs is a testimony for us, teaching us to conquer in trials and persevere in faith. Hence, dearest brothers and sisters, let us celebrate with exultation, venerating the birthday of the holy martyrs. Let us also, as they did, strengthen our faith and prepare ourselves for the confession of the name of Christ with invincible constancy. May competing with the martyrs in our hearts lead us to the eternal reward, promised to the sufferers for the name of Christ.

Amen.</H3>

<H5>The sacrament of new life.</H5>
<P>For he who has died has died to sin once for all; but he who lives, lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. This is the sacrament in which those who are baptized experience the end of the old life and begin the new entrance. Hence the same says: Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death; so that just as Christ was raised from the dead, we too might walk in newness of life. Through this sacrament, let us recognize that we are dead to sin with Christ and live to righteousness in Christ. On the cross is the pain of the confessors; in the grave, the rest of the absolved; in the resurrection, the life of the righteous.</P>
