<H5>Christ's resurrection is narrated differently by the Evangelists.</H5>
<P>The resurrection of the Lord according to all four Evangelists is read these days. For this reason, it is necessary that all be read, because each one did not say everything; but what one passed over, another said: and in a way, they all gave place to each other, so that all might be necessary. The evangelist Mark, whose Gospel was read yesterday, briefly said what Luke more fully pursued, concerning two certain disciples, who were not indeed of the number of the twelve, but still were disciples to whom the Lord appeared while they were traveling, and walked with them. For he merely said that he appeared to two who were traveling: but this evangelist Luke, both what he said to them, and what they answered him, and how far he walked with them, and how they recognized him in the breaking of bread; he said all these things, as we have heard.</P>
<H5>The confessing thief overcame the faltering disciples.</H5>
<P>What then, brothers, what are we discussing here? We are being edified to believe that the Lord Christ has risen. We already believed when we heard the Gospel, and today we entered this church as believers: and yet somehow it is heard with joy when memory is renewed. How do you want our hearts to be gladdened when we seem to be better than those who walked on the way and to whom the Lord appeared? For we believe what they had not yet believed. They had lost hope, and we do not doubt where they doubted. They had lost hope when the Lord was crucified: this appeared in their words when He said to them: "What are these words you are exchanging with each other as you walk?" And they: "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?" And He replied: "What things?" Knowing all about Himself, He asked: because He desired to be in them. "What things?" He said. And they: "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word." Behold, we are better. They called Christ a prophet: we know Him as the Lord of Prophets: "He was," they say, "a prophet mighty in deeds and words. And how the chief priests crucified Him: and behold, it is now the third day since these things happened. But we had hoped." You had hoped: do you no longer hope? Is this your entire discipleship? On the cross, a thief conquered you. You forgot Him who was teaching: he recognized Him with whom he was hanging. "We had hoped." What had you hoped? That He was the one to redeem Israel. What you had hoped, and lost when He was crucified, the crucified thief recognized. For he said to the Lord: "Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom." Behold, because He was the one to redeem Israel. That cross was a school. There the Teacher taught the thief. The hanging wood became the chair of the Teacher. But He who restored Himself to you, restored hope to you. And thus it happened. Remember, dearest ones, how the Lord Jesus, from those whose eyes were restrained so that they might not recognize Him, wished to be recognized in the breaking of bread. The faithful know what I say: they know Christ in the breaking of bread. For not every bread, but that which receives the blessing of Christ, becomes the body of Christ. There they recognized Him, they rejoiced, they went to others: now knowing, they found, narrating what they had seen, they added to the Gospel. These things were said, done, written: they have reached us.</P>
<H5>The faith of Christians and the faith of demons are far distant from each other.</H5>
<P>Let us believe in Christ crucified; but Him who rose on the third day. That is the faith which distinguishes us from them, distinguishes us from the Pagans, distinguishes us from the Jews; the faith by which we believe Christ rose from the dead. The Apostle says to Timothy: Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, rose from the dead according to my gospel. And again the Apostle himself: For if you believe in your heart, he says, that Jesus is Lord, and confess with your mouth that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. That is the salvation about which I discoursed yesterday. He who believes and is baptized will be saved. I know you believe: you will be saved. Retain in your heart, proclaim with your mouth that Christ rose from the dead. But have the faith of Christians, not of demons. For behold, I distinguish these things for you: what is mine, I distinguish; according to the grace of God given to me, I distinguish for you. When I have distinguished, choose, love. Behold, I said: That faith, by which we believe Christ Jesus rose from the dead, distinguishes us from the Pagans. Ask a Pagan whether Christ was crucified: he loudly affirms. Whether He rose: he denies. Ask a Jew whether Christ was crucified: he confesses the crime of his parents; he confesses the crime, in which he also has part. For he drinks what his parents gave him to drink: His blood be upon us and upon our children. But ask him whether He rose from the dead: he will deny, mock, accuse. We are distinguished. For we believe that Christ rose from the dead according to the flesh from the seed of David. Did the demons not know this, or did they not believe these things which they also saw? Even before He rose, they cried out and said: We know who You are, the Son of God. We distinguished ourselves from the Pagans by believing Christ rose: let us distinguish ourselves from the demons in any way possible. What did the demons say, I beseech you, what did they say? We know who You are, the Son of God. And they hear: Be silent. Did they not say the same thing Peter said when questioned and asked: Who do people say that I am? And when various opinions were given, He further asked, saying: But who do you say that I am? Peter answered: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. This the demons said, this Peter: this the evil spirits, this the Apostle. And the demons hear: Be silent: Peter hears: Blessed are you. What distinguished them, let it also distinguish us. From what did the demons cry out? Out of fear. From what did Peter say? Out of love. Choose, love. That is the faith which distinguishes Christians from demons; not any faith. For James the apostle says: You believe: The Epistle of Apostle James has this: You believe that there is one God: you do well. Even the demons believe and tremble. He who wrote in the same Epistle said this: If someone has faith but does not have works, can that faith save him? And Paul the apostle distinguishing, said: Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; but faith working through love. We have distinguished, we have discerned: rather we have found it distinct, read it distinct, learned it to be distinct. As we are distinguished by faith; so let us be distinguished by conduct, by works, inflamed with the love which demons did not have. By that fire those two on the way were burning. For recognizing Christ and He departing from them, they said to each other: Was not our heart burning within us as He spoke to us on the way, while He opened the Scriptures to us? Burn so that you do not burn with the fire by which demons will burn. Burn with the fire of love, that you may distinguish yourselves from demons. That burning lifts you up, raises you, takes you to heaven. Whatever troubles you suffer on earth, however much the Christian heart is pressed down by the enemy; the burning of love seeks the heights. Take the example. If you hold a burning torch, hold it upright with the head upwards; the flame's trail rises to heaven: tilt the torch, the flame goes to heaven: turn the torch with the head downwards; do you lay the flame on the ground? Wherever it burns, the flame knows no other way, it seeks heaven. Inflamed by the spirit with the fire of love: make yourselves burn with the praises of God, and with the best conduct. One is warm, another cold: the warm one should set the cold on fire; and he who burns a little should desire growth, pray for aid. The Lord is ready to give: let us with open hearts desire to receive. Having turned to the Lord, etc.</P>
