<H5>The solemnity repeats what the truth declares to have been done once. Memory preserves the relics of thought.</H5>
<P>We know, brothers, and we retain with the firmest faith, that Christ died once for us; the just for the sinners, the Lord for the slaves, the free man for the captives, the doctor for the sick, the blessed one for the miserable, the wealthy one for the needy, the seeker for the lost, the redeemer for the sold, the shepherd for the flock, and what is most miraculous of all, the creator for the creature: retaining what he always is, bestowing what he became; God hidden, man appearing; enlivening with power, dying in weakness, immutable in divinity, passible in the flesh: as the Apostle says: "Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification." You know well this was done once. And yet, the solemnity, as if it were done often, repeats it at recurring times, which truth declares was done once with the voices of so many Scriptures. However, truth and solemnity are not contrary, as if the latter lies and the former tells the truth. For that which truth indicates as having been done once, the solemnity renews in the devout hearts by celebrating it often. Truth reveals what has been done, as it was done; solemnity, however, not by doing it, but by celebrating it, does not allow what happened in the past to pass away. Finally, "Christ our Passover has been sacrificed." He was killed once for all, who now dies no more, death no longer has dominion over him. Therefore, according to the voice of truth, we say the Passover was done once and will no longer be; but according to the voice of solemnity, we say the Passover will come every year. Thus, I believe what is written in the Psalm is understood: "The thought of man will confess to you, and the remnants of thought will celebrate a feast for you." For unless thought commended to memory what is said about temporally conducted affairs, it would find no remnants after the time has passed. Therefore, the thought of man, perceiving the truth, confesses to the Lord; but the remnants of thought, which are in memory, do not cease to celebrate solemnities at known times, lest it be judged an ungrateful thought. To this pertains the most illustrious solemnity of this night, whereby in keeping vigil, we work, as it were, through the remnants of thought concerning the resurrection of the Lord, which we confess most truthfully as having been done once. Those, therefore, whom preached truth has instructed, let not abandoned solemnity make irreverent. This made this night illustrious throughout the whole world. This demonstrates the Christian peoples in crowds, this confounds the darkness of the Jews, this overturns the idols of the pagans.</P>
