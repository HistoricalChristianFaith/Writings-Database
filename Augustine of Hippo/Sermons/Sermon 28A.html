<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>IN THE SERMON ON PSALM 115<BR>
[The Fragment]</B></P>
<P>Only God is truthful, but every man is a liar, as it is written. Therefore, if God is truthful and the only truthful one, but every man is a liar, how will man be truthful unless he approaches the one who is not a liar? Finally, it is said to humans: You were once darkness; behold, every man is a liar. But to God it is said: With you is the fountain of life, in your light we shall see light. And because God alone is truthful, for God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all; humans are darkness, God is light; man is a liar, God is truthful. When will man be truthful? Approach Him and be illuminated. Therefore, Scripture wanted to show that every man, absolutely every man as far as he himself is concerned, is a liar. For he is not a liar except through what is his own, nor does he have anything of his own except to be a liar, not because he cannot be truthful, but because he will not be truthful on his own. Therefore, to be truthful: I believed, therefore I spoke. Take away that belief: every man is a liar. For when he departs from the truth of God, he will remain in his own lie, for he who speaks a lie, speaks from his own. Therefore, say: What shall I return to the Lord for all that He has returned to me? For in my fear I said, and I spoke the truth: every man is a liar. But He returned to me, not punishment for the lie, but good for evil, and by justifying the impious, made from the liar a truthful one.</P>
