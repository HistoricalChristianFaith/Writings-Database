<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>FROM THE SERMONS OF THE EIGHT DAYS OF EASTER</P><P ALIGN="CENTER">Fragment</B></P>
<H5>Reptiles are allegorically narrated as living souls.</H5>
<P>Let us therefore see what the Scriptures say. Light through light, the just through the Word. The firmament of the sky, the assurance of the Scriptures. Waters below the firmament, the earthly people; waters above the firmament, the heavenly people. Dry land separated from the waters of the sea, souls thirsting for God from the multitude of the world's sins. The earth brings forth grasses and fruit-bearing trees, the works of mercy. The lights in the firmament of the sky, the preachers of the word, Evangelists and Apostles, spiritual gifts. Let us therefore attend to the lights going around the whole world, and see how the waters bring forth reptiles of living souls. The Evangelists go forth, men are evangelized. Therefore the reptiles of living souls are understood as sacraments. Why? Because the sacraments are necessary for this purpose, that they may be evangelized to the gentiles and that men may be separated from the gentiles, that is, that those bitter waters may bring forth and become sweet fish. For it is a great thing. No one can taste the water of the sea, but can eat the fish; they are born and thrive in bitterness. These are the sweet sacraments, which have been sent through the whole world. But they are called reptiles of living souls; not yet a living soul. Why? This is somewhat thick to understand. You heard just now, when the reading was read, that Simon Magus was baptized and did not lay aside his evil mind; he had the form of the sacrament, he did not have the power of the sacrament. Hear the Apostle, what he says about the impious: Having, he says, a form of godliness, but denying its power. What is the form of godliness? The visible sacrament. What is the power of godliness? Invisible charity. Hear the power of godliness: If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, and so on: and though I have this and that, but have not charity, I am nothing. For the sacraments are holy and great; but a man is nothing if he does not have charity. Therefore the power of the sacrament is charity. Which charity the heretic does not have when I find the form of the sacrament with him. Therefore, when a heretic comes to me, I respect the form of the sacrament, so as not to rebaptize; but I restore the power of the sacrament, so that I may instill the root of charity. Therefore, it will be a living soul which the earth brings forth, so that it may be a living soul, already having the power of the sacrament. This, therefore, is what was said: Let the waters bring forth reptiles of living souls, and so on.</P>
