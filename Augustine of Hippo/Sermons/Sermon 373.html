<H5>Christ more manifest.</H5>
<P>The solemnity we celebrate today, due to the manifestation of the Lord, has received the Greek name Epiphany. Indeed, on this very day, with the Magi worshiping as the first fruits of the Gentiles, He is commended as manifested, who is also said to have been born a few days ago. That cornerstone, which like two walls, namely of the circumcision and the uncircumcision, that is of the Jews and the Gentiles, coming from different directions, united them in His unity, and He became our peace, who made both one; so that it was announced to the shepherds of the Jews, the Angels came from heaven; and so that He might be adored by the Magi of the Gentiles, a star shone brightly from heaven. Whether through Angels or through the star, the heavens declared the glory of God: so that in the grace of Him who was born, the Apostles might also declare it, carrying the Lord like the heavens, and their sound went forth into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. Because these have also come to us, we believe, for which reason we also speak.</P>
<P>Many, therefore, are the things to be considered, brothers, in this gospel reading which we have heard. The Magi come from the East, seeking the king of the Jews, who so many kings of the Jews have never sought before. Yet they seek not a man of mature age or an old man, visible to human eyes seated on a high throne, powerful with armies, terrifying with weapons, shining in purple, gleaming with a diadem [or exulting on a cross, on which he would redeem all confessing martyrs, or rising from the dead, or ascending into heaven]; but a newborn, lying in a manger, clinging to the breasts, with no adornment of body, with no strength in his limbs, with no wealth of his parents, excelling neither in his age nor in the power of his own. And they seek the king of the Jews, from the king of the Jews; from Herod [a man], [seek] Christ [God and man; from an earthly king, a man, the king of heaven who had created man]: from the great, the little one, from the renowned, the hidden, from the exalted, the humble, from the speaking, the infant, from the wealthy, the poor, from the strong, the weak; and yet [although persecuted by Herod, Christ who ruled over himself and others], from the despiser, the one to be adored: surely in whom no royal pomp appeared, but true majesty was worshipped.</P>
<H5>Innocent children granted the crown of martyrs.</H5>
<P>Finally, Herod is afraid: the Magi desire. They wish to find the King, he fears ending his rule. Both ultimately seek: they, through whom they might live; he, whom he wants to kill: he, in committing a great sin; they, who forgives all sins. Herod indeed kills many infants, while he wishes to reach the death of one. And when he performed the most savage and bloody slaughter among so many innocents; he first killed himself with such iniquity. Meanwhile our King [Christ], the Word [of God] as an infant [God], with the Magi worshipping him, little ones dying for him, whether he was lying down, or nursing; and not yet speaking, he found believers; and not yet suffering, he also made martyrs. O blessed little ones, born just now, never tempted, not yet struggled, already crowned! In the passion for Christ, he who also does not believe that Baptism benefits little ones of Christ, might waver from your crown. Indeed, you did not have the age to believe in Christ about to suffer: but you had the flesh, in which you would endure suffering for Christ about to suffer. In no way would the grace of the infant Savior desert these infants, who came to seek what had perished, not only by being born in the flesh, but also by hanging on the cross [descending to hell, ascending to heaven, and sitting at the right hand of the Father]. For he who could have angel preachers at birth, skies as narrators, Magi as worshippers, could also grant that they should not perish here dying for him, if he knew they would perish by that death, and not rather live with greater happiness. Far be it, far be it, that Christ coming to free men, did nothing for the reward of those who would be killed for him, who prayed for them suspended on the wood by those who killed him.</P>
<H5>The Jews are very much like milestone stones.</H5>
<P>What shall I say about the misfortune of the Jews, who, when the Magi sought Christ, even brought forth the prophetic sign, pointed out the city Bethlehem [which they themselves did not find]? They are like the builders of Noah's Ark, who provided a way of escape for others but perished in the flood themselves; like milestone markers, they showed the way, but could not walk it [because they remained foolish on the path]. It was asked of them where Christ would be born; they answered: In Bethlehem of Judea. For thus it is written by the prophet: And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are not the least among the princes of Judah. For out of you shall come forth a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel. The seekers heard and went; the teachers spoke and stayed: separated by contrary affections, some became worshippers, others persecutors. Even now the Jews do not cease to present a similar pattern to us. For some pagans, wishing to know Christ as prophesied beforehand, when we bring forth clear testimonies from the Scriptures, suspect that they might have been fabricated by Christians, and prefer to believe the books of the Jews: and just as the Magi did then, they dismiss them to read aimlessly, while they proceed to worship faithfully.</P>
<H5>A spiritual spectacle in this feast.</H5>
<P>Let us therefore celebrate, rejoicing in the Lord, the feast day of the Lord; not only the day He was born of the Jews but also the day He was revealed to the Gentiles. It is pleasant to gaze at everything and, brought together into one view, discern with the mind the spiritual spectacle. Christ is born: a virgin conceives, a virgin gives birth, a virgin nourishes; fertility is present, and integrity is not absent. Angels announce, shepherds glorify, the heavens declare, the Magi long for Him, kings fear Him, Jews indicate Him, Gentiles adore Him: persecutors are thwarted, infants are crowned, believers marvel. What is this humble exaltation, this strength of the weak, this greatness of the small? Certainly, the Word, by which all things were made, accomplished all these things. The Word which was far from us was made flesh, so that He might dwell among us. Let us therefore recognize in time Him by whom times were made: and celebrating His temporal feasts, let us long for eternal rewards.</P>
