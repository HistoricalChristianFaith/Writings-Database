On the eve of our Lord's birth, we ought to be absorbed in contemplation and jubilation. For what could be more marvelous than the divine logos becoming flesh, and dwelling among us in order to redeem humanity? This mystery surpasses all wonders of the world: the Creator of man, born as man; the Eternal, entering time; the Lord of Heaven, placed in a lowly manger. Rejoice, brothers, because it is most fitting that human mouths do their best to exult when angels are giving glory.</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Of the Birth of the White Mass</B></P>
<H5>It is not the punishment, but the cause that makes a martyr. What it means to endure for the Lord. What life, what salvation is to be desired. Nevertheless, it is proper for us to be grateful even for temporal salvation.</H5>
<P>We celebrate the solemn day of the blessed martyrs and of many others, that is, of Massae Candida. They are blessed because they are poor in spirit; blessed because they are meek; blessed because they mourn; blessed because they hunger and thirst for righteousness; blessed because they are merciful; blessed because they are pure in heart; blessed because they have suffered persecution, not vainly, not having an evil cause, but for righteousness' sake. For it is the cause, not the punishment, that makes a martyr of Christ. He endures the punishment securely who wisely chooses the cause, so that what he suffers is for righteousness' sake; lest he suffer here and be led from tribulations to more grievous tribulations. Their souls were patient with the Lord, they waited for the Lord; they did not hasten to receive the reward. For this is to wait for the Lord, that you may receive when He wishes to give. He will indeed give: for truth does not deceive, nor does the almighty lack what He has promised to give, nor does the eternal fear any successor. Therefore He will give: only let our soul wait for the Lord. Thus the soul of the martyrs waited—the one soul of many—not outwardly whitened, but inwardly pure. Therefore their souls waited for the Lord: and the Lord was their helper and protector. They hoped and endured in their sufferings: hoping for eternal things, they bore the transient. And when they come, what will they receive? They will be intoxicated with the abundance of your house, and you will give them drink from the river of your pleasures. Let no one here think of bodily pleasure: there is another invisible pleasure, from an invisible source. Indeed, attend to what follows. As if you were seeking from where this future pleasure would come, he added and said: For with you is the fountain of life. Behold the life that does not die, behold the health that does not fall ill. For the salvation of man is vain. Certainly, there is nothing in human affairs more precious than this salvation: and yet it is vain. How then should we regard other things here? What are the riches of man, what are the pleasures of man, what are the powers of man, if the salvation of man is vain? Therefore, brethren, let us desire that salvation, let us seek it with all our prayers, let us strive to come to it with our habits; let us seek it by believing, hoping, loving. If He gives this salvation, let us give thanks. For assuredly it pertained to this salvation that the ten lepers were healed; to this salvation pertained that the ten lepers were cleansed by the Lord Christ; and yet the grateful are praised, the ungrateful are blamed. Therefore, receiving even this salvation from Him, let us give thanks, and if need be for His sake, let us even despise what He has given, that we may come to greater things. May He be with you, may He dwell in your hearts, may He work in your thoughts, may whatever truth you hear flourish in your good morals.</P>
