Jesus was transfigured on the mountain.</B></P>
<H5>Who would not die before they had seen the Son of Man in his kingdom.</H5>
<P>Before the Lord revealed himself on the mountain, as we heard when the holy Gospel was read, he said: "There are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom." We know, however, that at the end of the world, the Lord Jesus Christ will come as a judge and will give the kingdom to those on his right, and punishment to those on his left, who, as we believe and confess, will come to judge the living and the dead. All those who stood around him when he spoke, having met the condition of death, have slept, and they will not see the Lord in his kingdom until the time of the resurrection has come. So what did he mean when he said, "There are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man in his kingdom"? Undoubtedly, the holy Gospel revealed the question through subsequent events. For he took three with him up the mountain—Peter, James, and John—and before them, he was transfigured, so that his face shone like the brightness of the sun. Therefore, these were from those standing around who would not taste death until they saw the Lord in his kingdom. There will be a brightness at the end of the ages. The Lord showed this brightness in himself. His members will shine as did his head. It is written: "He will transfigure the body of our lowliness to be conformed to the body of his glory." Behold, he shone on the mountain like the sun, and he had not yet resurrected. He had not yet tasted death, but as God in the flesh, he accomplished what he wanted by divine power even though the flesh had not yet been resurrected. For to know it was not presumptuous if we too hope for this, listen to him and do not doubt. When he explained the parable of the weeds, he said: "He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the world. The good seed are the children of the kingdom. The weeds are the children of the evil one. The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. The reapers are the angels. Therefore, when the end of the world has come, the Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather all the offenses out of his kingdom and throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." What about the wheat? Listen to what follows: "Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom." And since they will be such in the kingdom, the Lord therefore said: "There are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man in his kingdom."</P>
<H5>Peter's empty counsel.</H5>
<P>Now then, brothers, what does it mean? Moses and Elijah appeared; they placed the Lord in the midst and were conversing with him. Saint Peter was pleased with solitude; he was weary of the turbulent human race. He saw the mountain, he saw the Lord, he saw Moses, he saw Elijah. They alone were there who belonged to them alone. He delighted in the quiet, idle, blessed life and said to the Lord: Lord, it is good for us to be here. Why should we come down from the mountain to be disturbed and not choose to enjoy ourselves here? It is good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles here, if you will: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. Peter, still not knowing how he ought to speak, wanted to divide them. He thought what he was saying was good. But what did the Lord do? He sent a cloud from heaven and covered them all, as if saying to Peter: Why do you wish to make three tabernacles? Behold one. Then they heard a voice from the cloud: This is my beloved Son, so that they might not compare him to Moses and Elijah and think the Lord was to be received as one of the Prophets when he was the Lord of the Prophets: This is my Son: listen to him. Terrified by this voice, they fell. The Lord approached and lifted them up, and they saw no one but Jesus alone.</P>
<H5>The great sacrament of the Transfiguration.</H5>
<P>A great mystery, if the Lord grants, I will speak now. Moses and Elijah speak with the Lord. In Moses, the Law; in Elijah, the Prophets. When we propose something from the Gospel, we prove it from the Law and the Prophets. And Moses and Elijah speak with the Lord, but as ministers at the sides, in the middle the ruler. What is it for Moses and Elijah to speak with the Lord? Listen to the Apostle: "Through the law," he says, "comes the knowledge of sin; but now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law." Behold the Lord where Moses and Elijah are, having testimony from the Law and the Prophets. At this time, the testimonies of the Law and the Prophets are necessary. But when we are resurrected, what need is there for the Law, what need for the Prophets? We do not seek testimonies because we will see Him Himself. But when will this be? After the resurrection. Therefore, those who had fallen rose again and saw the Lord alone.</P>
