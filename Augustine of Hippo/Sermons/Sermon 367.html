<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>On the words of the Gospel, Luke 16:19-31, where it speaks of the rich man and Lazarus</B></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"> </P>
<H5>The gospel narrative is set forth to the rich so that they may recognize their madness.</H5>
<P>Your Holiness has noticed, dearest brothers, and with me, as I believe, with the whole attention of the mind, has perceived the wealth of the rich man and the poverty of the beggar; one being lavish with food, and the other failing with hunger. Both indeed are men, both are carnal, both are mortal: but not both are equal. One nature, but not one life. Neither of them is exempt from the condition of death: and yet one feasts splendidly, and the other decays in rags and in hardship. The former rejoices in delicate dishes by the invention of cooks: the latter waits for crumbs to fall from his table. Now let the rich, who do not wish to be merciful, hear; let them hear that we all are born with one law, live by one light, breathe one air, and are extinguished by one death: which, if it did not intervene, not even the poor himself would endure. 

This ulcered and naked Lazarus, lying, is carried to Abraham's bosom by the hands of angels. Behold, the rich man, refreshed and splendid, is enclosed in a Tartarean prison. Where is that fine linen garment? where is that abundant and overflowing life with many riches? Do not all things pass away with death as with a shadow? "We brought nothing into this world," says the Apostle, "and we can take nothing out of it." We take or seize nothing with us. What if we took something, would we not devour living men? What greed of desire is this, when beasts themselves have a limit? They then snatch when they are hungry: they spare the prey when they feel satiation. Insatiable is the greed of the rich alone. It always seizes, and never is satisfied: it neither fears God nor respects man: it neither spares a father nor acknowledges a mother: it neither obeys a brother nor keeps faith with a friend: it oppresses the widow, invades the property of the orphan: it recalls freedmen into servitude, brings forward a false will. The possessions of the dead are occupied; as if those who do this will not also die. 

What is then this madness of souls, to lose life and seek death? to acquire gold and lose heaven? But because no one thinks of God, therefore judgment remains in death.</P>
<H5>On the just condemnation of a wealthy man.</H5>
<P>It is rightly said to the rich man: Because you received good things in your life, and Lazarus likewise bad things; now, however, he is comforted here, and you are tormented. Let the rich who do not want to be merciful hear this. Let those who refuse to distribute their aid hear that punishments are inflicted on them. Let them hear that the poor man is refreshed, while the rich man is tormented by more severe sufferings. Father Abraham, he says, send Lazarus, so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; because I am tormented in this flame. But he replied: Remember, son, that you received good things in your life, and Lazarus likewise bad things. Punishments are weighed for riches, refreshment for poverty, flame for purple, consolation for nakedness, so that the balance's equity may be preserved, and the measure of that scale may not lie: In the measure you measured, it will be measured to you. Therefore, mercy is denied to the rich man in punishments, because he himself, while he lived, did not want to show mercy. Therefore, the rich man asking is not heard in torments; because he did not listen to the poor man asking on earth.</P>
<H5>How a poor person becomes rich by the way of heaven.</H5>
<P>The rich man and the poor man are contradictory to each other: but again they are necessary to each other. No one would be in need if they supported each other; and no one would labor if they both helped each other. The rich man is made for the poor man, and the poor man is made for the rich man. It is the poor man's role to pray, and the rich man's role to give; it is God's role to judge the great and the small. From His mercy, a small amount generates a large abundance. The field of the poor is fertile, quickly yielding fruit for those in power. The way to heaven is through the poor, through whom one comes to the Father. Therefore, begin to give out, if you do not want to err. Release in this life the fetter of your inheritance by which you are bound; that you may freely access heaven: cast off from yourself the burdens of wealth, cast off voluntary chains, cast off anxieties and tedium, which trouble you for many years. Give to the petitioner, that you may yourself receive: give to the poor, if you do not wish to be scorched by flames. Give to Christ on earth, that He may repay you in heaven. Forget what you are, and consider what you will be. The present life is fragile, and prone to death. No one can stand: but we are all compelled to pass over. We go unwillingly, we leave unwillingly, because we are wicked. But if we were to send something ahead of us, we would not come to an empty inn. For what we give to the poor, we send ahead of us: but what we seize, we leave entirely here.</P>
