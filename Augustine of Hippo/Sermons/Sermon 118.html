"In the beginning was the Word," etc.</B></P><P> </P>
<H5>The eternal Word of God, begotten, not made.</H5>
<P>All you who seek many words from man, understand the one Word of God: In the beginning was the Word. But in the beginning God made heaven and earth. But the Word was there, when we heard: In the beginning God made. Let us acknowledge the Creator; for it is the Creator who made. But the creature is what was made. For the creature was not always as the Word was always God, through whom it was made. But when we heard: The Word was, with whom was it? We understand the Father, who did not make, nor create the same Word, but begot it. For in the beginning God made heaven and earth. Through what did He make? The Word was there, and the Word was with God; but what kind of Word? Did it sound and pass away? Was it thought upon and revolved? No. Was it remembered and spoken forth? No. Therefore, what kind of Word? Why do you ask me many things? The Word was God. When we hear: The Word was God, we do not double God; but we understand the Son. For the Word of God is the Son. Behold the Son, and what unless God? For the Word was God. What of the Father? Certainly God. If the Father is God, and the Son is God, do we double God? Far from it! The Father is God, the Son is God; but the Father and the Son are one God. For the only Son was not made, but born. In the beginning God made heaven and earth; but the Word was from the Father. Therefore, was the Word made by the Father? No. All things were made through Him. If all things were made through Him, was He also made through Himself? Through whom you hear all things were made, do not think He was made among all things. For if He also was made, all things were not made through Him, but He was made among other things. You say: He was made; was it through Himself? Who is he that makes himself? Therefore, if He was made, how were all things made through Him? Behold, He was made also, as you say, not I, for I do not deny He was begotten. Therefore, if you say He was made, I ask through what, I ask through whom. Through Himself? Therefore, He was before He was made, to make Himself. But if all things were made through Him, understand that He was not made Himself. If you cannot understand, believe so that you may understand. Faith precedes, understanding follows; for the Prophet says: Unless you believe, you will not understand. The Word was. Therefore, do not seek time for Him, through whom times were made. The Word was. But you say: There was a time when the Word was not. You lie, you read nowhere. But I read to you: In the beginning was the Word. What do you seek before the beginning? If you can find something before the beginning, it will be the beginning. He is insane who seeks something before the beginning. What then does he say that existed before the beginning? In the beginning was the Word.</P>
<H5>By analogy, it is shown that the Son is coeternal with God the Father.</H5>
<P>But you say: And was there a Father; and before the Word? What are you asking? In the beginning was the Word. Understand what you find; do not seek what you cannot find. Nothing is before the beginning. In the beginning was the Word. The Son is the radiance of the Father. Of the wisdom of the Father, which is the Son, it is said: For he is the brightness of eternal light. Do you seek the Son without the Father? Give me light without brightness. If ever the Son did not exist, the Father was dim light. For how was the light not dim, if it did not have brightness? Therefore always the Father, always the Son. If always the Father, always the Son. Do you ask me whether the Son was born? I answer: Born. For he would not be the Son if not born. But when I say: Always the Son; this I say: Always is born. And who understands: Always is born? Give me eternal fire, and I give you eternal brightness. We bless God, who gave us the Sacred Scriptures. Do not be blind in the radiance of light. Brightness is born from light, and yet the brightness is co-eternal with the light-giver. Always light, always its brightness. He begets his brightness; but was he ever without his brightness? Let God be allowed to generate eternally. I ask, hear about what we speak; hear, notice, believe, understand. We speak of God. We confess and believe the Son to be co-eternal with the Father. But man, he says, when he begets a son, the one who begets is greater, and the one who is begotten is lesser. See, it is true; among humans the one who begets is greater, and the one who is begotten is lesser, and he arrives at the strength of his father. But why, unless because as the one grows, the other ages? Let the father stand in time, and with growth the son follows him, and you will see the equal. But see, I give you from which to understand. Fire generates coeval brightness. You do not find among humans except lesser sons, greater fathers; you do not find coevals; but I give you, as I said, brightness coeval with its paternal fire. For fire generates brightness, but never without brightness. Therefore, when you see brightness to be coeval with fire, allow God to generate the co-eternal. He who understands, let him rejoice; but he who does not understand, let him believe. For the word of the Prophet cannot be voided: Unless you believe, you will not understand.</P>
