<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>On the Martyr Stephen</B><BR>
<B>The manner of the very day of Easter</B></P>
<H5>Of the man healed through the prayer of Saint Stephen. Augustine excuses himself for not being able to give a sermon.</H5>
<P>We are accustomed to hearing about the miracles of God through the prayers of the most blessed martyr Stephen. This little book is a sight; as for the written content, the knowledge is shown by the face instead of paper. You who know what you used to see with sorrow in it, read joyfully in the present what you see: so that our Lord God may be more abundantly honored, and what is written in the little book may be inscribed in your memory. Pardon me for not making the discourse long: you know my fatigue. As I was able to do so much yesterday while fasting and not fail, and so that I might speak with you today, the prayers of Saint Stephen have provided. Turned toward the Lord, etc.</P>
