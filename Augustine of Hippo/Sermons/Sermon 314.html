<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>On the Birthday of Stephen the Martyr</B></P>
<H5>Stephen must be imitated, especially in the love of enemies.</H5>
<P>Yesterday we celebrated the Nativity of the Lord; today we celebrate the Nativity of the servant: but we celebrated the Nativity of the Lord, on which He deigned to be born; we celebrate the Nativity of the servant, on which he was crowned. We celebrated the Nativity of the Lord, on which He received the garment of our flesh; we celebrate the Nativity of the servant, on which he cast off the garment of his flesh. We celebrated the Nativity of the Lord, on which He was made like us; we celebrate the Nativity of the servant, on which he was made close to Christ. For just as Christ by being born became united with Stephen, so Stephen by dying was joined to Christ. Yet the Church frequents with the service of dual devotion the day of the birth and the day of the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, because both are a remedy. For He was born that we might be reborn; he died that we might live forever. However, martyrs came to be born into evil struggles, carrying original sin: but by dying they passed over to certain good, ending all sin. For if the rewards of future bliss did not console those established under persecution, when would they endure those torments from diverse passions? If blessed Stephen, positioned under a shower of stones, had not considered future rewards, how would he have borne that hail? But he bore in his mind the command of Him whose presence he saw in heaven; and drawn up in the most fervent love to Him, he wished swiftly to leave the flesh and fly to Him: nor did he already fear death, because he saw Christ, whom he knew to have been killed for himself, living; and thus he hastened himself also to die for Him, that he might live with Him. For what truly would the most blessed Martyr see established in that contest, do you undoubtedly recall his words which you are accustomed to hear from the book of Acts of the Apostles. "Behold," he says, "I see the heavens opened, and Christ standing at the right hand of God." Jesus standing he saw: therefore he stood, and did not fall; because while standing above and looking down, He watched his soldier fighting below, suggesting unbeatable strength to him that he might not fall. "Behold," he says, "I see the heavens opened." Blessed man to whom the heavens were open. But who opened the heavens? He of whom it is said in the Apocalypse: "He who opens and no one can shut; who shuts and no one can open." When Adam was cast out of paradise, after that first and heinous sin, heaven was closed against the human race; after the passion of Christ, the thief was the first to enter, and thereafter Stephen saw it opened. Why do we marvel? That what he saw faithfully, he faithfully indicated and violently invaded?</P>
<H5>The same argument is discussed.</H5>
<P>Behold, brothers, let us follow him; for if we follow Stephen, we will be crowned. Above all, he is to be followed and imitated by us in the love of our enemies. For you know that surrounded by the frequent assembly of enemies, when struck with frequent blows of stones from here and there, calm and undaunted, gentle and mild among the stones by which he was being killed, looking towards Him for whom he was being killed, he did not say: Lord, judge my death; but, receive my spirit. He did not say: Lord Jesus, avenge your servant, whom you see bound to this punishment of death; but, do not hold this sin against them. Persisting therefore the most blessed Martyr in the testimony of truth, and burning with the spirit of love, as you know, he reached the most glorious end; and he who was called persevered to the end, attained what he was called at the end, Stephen by the glory of his name was brought to the crown. Therefore, when the blessed Stephen first shed his blood for Christ, it was as if a crown proceeded from heaven; so that those following might take it for a reward, who would imitate the virtue of the one preceding in battle. Afterwards, frequent martyrdoms filled the land. Whoever subsequently shed blood for the confession of Christ placed that crown upon their head, and preserved it intact for those to follow. And now, brothers, it hangs from heaven: whoever desires it will swiftly fly to it. And to exhort Your Holiness briefly and clearly, many words are not necessary: let anyone who desires the crown follow Stephen. Turned to the Lord, etc.</P>
