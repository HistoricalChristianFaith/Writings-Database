<H5>In that first fishing, three things are to be received symbolically.</H5>
<P>The fishing of our Redeemer is our liberation. We notice, however, two instances of fishing in the holy Gospel of the Lord, that is, when the nets were cast at His word: one before, when He chose the disciples; and this other, when He rose from the dead. That fishing represented the Church as it is now: this one after the Lord's resurrection, represented the Church as it will be at the end of the age. Indeed, in that first fishing, He commanded the nets to be cast without saying in which direction; but merely commanded that they be cast. The disciples cast them: it was not said, "To the right"; it was not said, "To the left." For the fish signified men: if it had been said, "To the right," only the good would be caught; if it had been said, "To the left," only the wicked. But because both good and wicked were to be intermingled in the Church, the nets were cast without distinction; to catch fish signifying a mix of the good and the wicked. Moreover, it is written there that they caught so many fish that two boats were filled to the point of sinking, that is, weighed down to submersion. The two boats did not actually sink, but were in danger. Why in danger? Because of the multitude of fish. It signified that because of the multitude the Church was to gather, her discipline would be endangered. Also, it is added in that fishing that the nets were torn because of the multitude of fish. What did the torn nets signify if not future schisms? Therefore, three things were signified in that fishing: the mixture of the good and the wicked, the oppression of the crowds, the separations of heretics. The mixture of the good and the wicked; because the nets were cast neither to the right nor to the left: the oppression of the crowds; because such a great catch was made that the boats were weighed down: the separations of heretics; because the multitude was so great that the nets were torn.</P>
<H5>Many now belonging to the Church are excluded from the Kingdom of God.</H5>
<P>Now consider the fishing that was read today. It took place after the resurrection of the Lord to signify what the Church would be like after our resurrection. "Cast," he says, "the net on the right side." Therefore, the number of those who will stand on the right is determined. For you remember that the Lord said he would come with his Angels, and that all nations would be gathered before him; and he will separate them as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats: he will place the sheep on his right, and the goats on his left. To the sheep, he will say: "Come, receive the kingdom," and to the goats, he will say: "Go into the eternal fire." "Cast on the right side." As if saying: "I have now risen, I want to signify the Church, which will be in the resurrection of the dead. Cast on the right side." The nets were cast on the right: and they were not able to haul them in because of the multitude of fish. And there it was said a multitude: but here a specific number, and a multitude, and greatness: there, however, no number was stated. For now, before the resurrection comes and the good are separated from the bad, that is fulfilled which the prophet said: "I have declared, and I have spoken." What is: "I have declared, and I have spoken"? I have cast the nets. And what? They have multiplied beyond number. There is a number, and they are beyond number. The number pertains to the saints, who will reign with Christ. Those beyond number can now enter the Church, but they cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<H5>The end of the right(eous) will come, to the detriment of the left(eous).</H5>
<P>Therefore I admonish you to rescue yourselves from this present evil age. Therefore I admonish you, if you want to live, do not imitate evil Christians. Do not say: Why? is that one not faithful, and gets drunk? Why? is that one not faithful, and has concubines? Why? is that one not faithful, and commits fraud daily? Why? is that one not faithful, and consults astrologers? For now, if you want to be grains, then you will be found in the lump. But if you want to be chaff, you will be found in a great heap, but destined to be burned with a great fire.</P>
<P>What then? They led the nets to the shore, he said. Peter pulled the nets to the shore: just now when the Gospel was read, you heard. When you hear shore, understand the end of the sea; when you hear the end of the sea, understand the end of the age. In that fishing, the nets were not pulled to the shore; but the fish that were caught, were placed in the boats. Here, however, they drew to the shore. Hope for the end of the age. The end is coming; for the good of the righteous, for the ill of the unrighteous. And how many fish? They drew, he said, the nets containing one hundred and fifty-three fish. And the Evangelist added a necessary fact: And although they were so many, that is, so great, the net was not torn. They will be great, but there will not be heresies: and therefore there will be no heresies, because they will be great. Who are great? Read the words of the Lord Himself in the Gospel, and you will find the great ones. For He said in a certain place: I did not come to destroy the Law and the Prophets, but to fulfill.</P>
<H5>Our righteousness must exceed that of the Pharisees.</H5>
<P>Amen, I say to you, that whoever breaks one of these least commandments, and teaches others so: breaks and teaches thus; breaks by living badly, and teaches well by teaching: he will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But in which kingdom of heaven? In the Church that exists now; because it also is called the kingdom of heaven. For if this Church, which gathers good and bad, were not called the kingdom of heaven, the Lord himself would not say, speaking in a parable: The kingdom of heaven is like a net thrown into the sea, which gathers all kinds of fish. But behold what follows? The kingdom of heaven is like a net thrown into the sea. The net, which are the fish: gathers all kinds of fish. But what? They draw it to the shore. This, the Lord says in the parable. And when they draw it to the shore, they sit down, and gather the good ones into vessels, but throw away the bad. And he explained what he proposed. For what does he say? So it will be at the end of the age. Do you understand the shore? They come, he says, the Angels, and gather the evil from among the just, and cast them into a furnace of blazing fire: there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Nevertheless, the Church is called the kingdom of heaven. And when the sea has fish swimming together, both good and evil, in this kingdom of heaven, that is, in the Church of this time, he who teaches good and does evil is called the least: because he is there himself. For he is indeed there: he is there in the kingdom of heaven, that is, in the Church, such as it is at this time. He teaches good, lives badly: he is necessary, he is a hireling. Amen, I say to you, he has received his reward. It benefits somewhat. For if those who teach good but live badly did not benefit at all, the Lord himself would not say to his people: The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses' seat: do what they say, but do not do what they do. Why? For they say and do not do.</P>
<H5>The present life in activity, the other in rest.</H5>
<P>Therefore let your Charity be attentive: for I wish to explain who the great fishes are. He who loosens, he says, one of these least commandments, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven. He will be there, but least. But he who does and teaches thus, shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Behold, these are the great fishes, caught on the right. He who does and teaches thus: does good and teaches good; does not contradict his speaking by living badly, when he has a good tongue but bears witness to a bad life. Therefore he who does and teaches thus, shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. And he follows: For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the Scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Now how do you understand the kingdom of heaven? It is that which is said to the right: Come, blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom. Unless your righteousness exceeds that of the Scribes and Pharisees. What does it mean, more than the Scribes and Pharisees? Look at those Scribes and Pharisees, who sit in Moses' seat, about whom it is said: What they tell you, do; but what they do, do not do: for they say, and do not do. Therefore the righteousness of the Pharisees is, to say and not to do. Let your righteousness exceed that of the Scribes and Pharisees, so that you may both say good things and live well.</P>
<H5>The law is not fulfilled unless God helps.</H5>
<P>So now, concerning the number of one hundred fifty-three fish, what need is there to disentangle the same thing? You know it. The increasing number is born from seventeen. Start from one, and proceed to seventeen, so that you add them all: that is, add one to two, and it becomes three; add three, and it becomes six; add four, and it becomes ten. Thus, add them all up to seventeen, and you reach one hundred fifty-three. Therefore, our entire intention should be no other than what the number seventeen signifies: for there lies the foundation of one hundred fifty-three. What does the number seventeen signify? Recognize the Ten in the Law. The Ten Commandments were given first: the Decalogue is said to be written on tablets by the finger of God. In the Ten recognize the Law, in the Seven recognize the Holy Spirit. For the Holy Spirit is commended by the number Seven. Therefore, sanctification is not mentioned in the Law except on the seventh day. God made light: it is not said, "He sanctified it." God made the firmament: it is not said, "He sanctified the firmament." He separated the sea from the land, commanded the earth to bring forth vegetation: it is not said, "He sanctified." He made the moon and the stars: it is not said, "He sanctified." He commanded animals to come forth from the waters, swimming and flying: it is not said, "He sanctified." He commanded animals to come forth from the land, quadrupeds and all creeping things: it is not said, "He sanctified." He made man himself: it is not said, "He sanctified."</P>
<H5>God appeases the struggle existing in man even after being reborn.</H5>
<P>It came to the seventh day, where he rested; and he sanctified it. By his rest, God sanctified our rest. Therefore, there will be our full sanctification, where we will rest with him without end. For why would God rest? Certainly, he was not fatigued by working. If you create by word, you are not fatigued; if you command, and it is done immediately, you stand, you remain whole. Did he say a few words, by which he made everything, and suddenly became tired?</P>
<P>Therefore, recognize the Law in the ten; recognize the Holy Spirit in the seven. Let the Spirit be joined to the Law. For if you receive the Law, and lack the assistance of the Spirit, you do not fulfill what you read, you do not fulfill what is commanded to you: but man under the Law is also held as a transgressor. Let the Spirit approach, assist; and what is commanded is done. If the Spirit is absent, the letter kills you. Why does the letter kill you? Because it will make you a transgressor. Nor can you excuse yourself due to ignorance, because you have received the Law. Now you have learned what you should do; ignorance does not excuse you, the Spirit does not aid you: therefore you have perished. But what does the Apostle Paul say: The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life? Whence does the Spirit give life? Because it makes the letter be fulfilled, so it does not kill. These are the holy ones, who do the law of God by the gift of God. The Law can command, it cannot help. The aid of the Spirit approaches; and the command of God is done with joy, with delight. For many do it out of fear. But those who do the Law, fearing punishment, would prefer that there was nothing to fear. However, those who do the Law, loving justice, rejoice even in this, because they have no enemy.</P>
<P>Therefore the Lord says: Make peace with your adversary quickly, while you are with him on the way. Who is your adversary? The Word of the Law. What is the way? This life. How is he an adversary? He says: You shall not commit adultery: and you wish to commit adultery. He says: You shall not covet your neighbor's goods: and you want to take away others' possessions. He says: Honor your father and mother: and you are disrespectful to your parents. The Law says: Do not bear false witness: you do not turn away from lying. When you see that this word commands one thing, and you do another, it is your adversary. You have an evil adversary, do not let him enter with you into the council chamber: reconcile while you are with him on the way. God is present to make peace between you. How does God make peace between you? By forgiving sins and inspiring righteousness, so that good works are done. When therefore you have made peace with your adversary, that is, with the Decalogue of the Law, through the Holy Spirit, you will belong to the seventeen. When you belong to the seventeen, the number will grow from there to one hundred and fifty-three. You will be positioned at the right to be crowned: do not remain at the left to be condemned.</P>
