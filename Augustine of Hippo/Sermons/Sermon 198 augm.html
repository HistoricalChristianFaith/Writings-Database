<h5>On Avoiding Worldly Joy.</h5>
<P>We admonish your charity, since we see you have gathered as if solemnly and assembled at this hour and in this place more frequently than usual, so that you may remember again and again what you were just singing, that your tongue may not be noisy while your heart is mute, but what you sounded with your voice to each other’s ears, you may cry out with affection to the ears of God. For you sang: Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may confess your holy name. And now, if the festivity of the nations which is happening today in secular and carnal joy, in the noise of the vainest and most shameful songs, in the celebration of that false festivity itself, if what the nations are doing today does not delight you, be gathered from among the nations.</P>
<h5>Mixed in body with the nations, you are separated by the dissimilarity of life.</h5>
<P>You certainly sang, and the sound of the divine song is still fresh in your ears: Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from the nations. Who can be gathered from the nations unless he is made safe? Those, therefore, who are mixed with the nations are not safe. But those who are gathered from the nations are saved by the safety of faith, the safety of the spirit, the safety of God's promises, the safety of good hope, the safety of the most sincere charity. Therefore, he who believes, hopes, and loves is not immediately to be called safe. For it matters what he believes, what he hopes for, what he loves. For no one lives in any life without these three affections of the soul: believing, hoping, loving. If you do not believe what the nations believe, do not hope for what the nations hope for; do not love what the nations love, you are gathered from the nations. Nor let the bodily mixture in such a separation of mind terrify you. For what is so separated as that they believe demons are gods, you believe God who is the true God? They hope for the vain things of the world, you hope for eternal life in Christ? They love the world, you love the maker of the world? Therefore, he who believes, hopes, and loves differently, let him prove it by his life, show it by his deeds. Today, will you celebrate the New Year with a pagan, play dice with a pagan, get drunk with a pagan? How do you believe, hope, and love differently? How can you sing with a clear conscience: Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from the nations? For you are separated from the nations, mixed in body with the nations by a different life. And see how great this separation is if you now do it, if you now prove it. For already our Lord God Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became man for us, gave the price for us. Therefore, if he has already given the price, he gave it to redeem, to gather from the nations. But if you mix with the nations, you do not want to follow him who redeemed. You mix with them in life, deeds, heart, hoping for such things, believing such things, loving such things. You are ungrateful to your redeemer and do not acknowledge your price, the blood of the spotless lamb. Therefore, to follow your redeemer, who redeemed you with his blood, do not mix with the nations in the likeness of customs and deeds. They give gifts, you give alms. For we do not say to you, brothers: "They give, do not you give"; indeed give more than they give, but as those who believe differently, hope differently, love differently, because we do not say to you: "They believe, do not you believe; they hope, do not you hope; they love, do not you love"; but we say to you: "They believe that, you believe this; they hope for that, you hope for this; they love that, you love this; they give that or to those, you give this or to these." Therefore, they give gifts, you give alms. They commit themselves to the chances of earthly things, you commit yourself to the words of the divine Scriptures. They run to the theater, you to the church. They get drunk, you fast. If you do these things, you have truly sung: Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from the nations. Now those who willingly heard what I said certainly stand with those who did not willingly hear, and yet they are already gathered from the nations, they are mixed with the nations.</P>
<h5>"From those who serve demons, let us separate ourselves by life and morals."</h5>
<P>I now speak to Christians: if you believe what the pagans believe, if you hope for what the pagans hope for, if you love what the pagans love, live as the pagans live; but if you believe differently, hope differently, love differently, live differently, and demonstrate your distinct faith and hope and charity by distinct lives. What do the pagans believe? As I have already said, they call gods those whom the Apostle Paul shows us otherwise: "For that which the pagans sacrifice," he says, "they sacrifice to demons and not to God. I do not want you to become partners with demons." Therefore, the morals of the pagans delight their gods. But he who said, "I do not want you to become partners with demons," wanted us to separate ourselves from those who serve demons by life and morals. Indeed, those demons delight in songs of vanity, delight in nonsensical noise and the various obscenities of theaters, the madness of the circus, the cruelty of the amphitheater, and the fierce contests of those who engage in disputes and quarrels up to enmities on behalf of pestilent men, for a mime, for an actor, for a charioteer, for a hunter. Doing these things, they as if place incense to demons from their hearts. For the deceptive spirits rejoice in the deceived, and they are fed by the evil morals and vile and infamous life of those they have deceived and seduced.

But if you say to a man: "You love the charioteer," he responds: "Of course, I love him," because, even if he denies it, he is caught favoring him, shouting for him, quarreling for him. And if you add: "You love him very much," he will respond: "Very much." If you say to him: "Be like him and your sons," immediately if he appears respectable, he will respond indignantly: "Why have you insulted me?" "Do I insult you when I say: Be like him, or do you insult yourself who love such a one that you fear to be like?"

On the contrary, you love the martyrs. So, just as you say to a pagan: "You love this charioteer," and he says: "I love him," and he is not ashamed, thus say to a Christian: "You love Cyprian," he responds: "I love him," say to him: "Be like him," he responds: "May God grant this!" How sincere this love is, how chaste, how secure, especially for one already crowned! For the love concerned with one still struggling is anxious, but nevertheless all love him who has already conquered, who already sits at the right hand of the Father, who from above, as the master of the contest that Paul recounts, not only watches those struggling but also helps those enduring.</P>
<h5>"Fear and love compel you."</h5>
<P>Therefore, many will struggle today in their hearts with the word they have heard. For we said: "Do not give gifts, give to the poor." It is little that you give only, give even more. Do you not wish to give more? At least give some. But you say to me: "When I give gifts, I also receive." What then? When you give to the poor, do you receive nothing? Surely you do not believe what the gentiles believe, surely you do not hope for what the gentiles hope for, surely you do not love what the gentiles love. Behold, if you say that you receive nothing when you give to the poor, you become like the gentiles, and you sang in vain: "Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from the gentiles." You have forgotten what will be said to those who gave: "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom," and what will be said to those who do not believe: "Depart into the eternal fire," which is prepared for the devil and his angels. If He would give the kingdom to these, and give nothing to those but only leave them, you ought to love what He gives and not wish to be deprived of such a great and ineffable good. But it is not only that He sends these into the kingdom and not those, but also says: "Depart into the eternal fire, which is prepared for the devil and his angels." Fear and love compel you. If you love less what is promised, fear what is threatened. For you begin with fear, you are perfected in love. By fearing the fires you do what is said, but as long as you do it by fearing, you act as a servant; but when you act out of love, you already act freely. Be a good servant to deserve to be free. Begin to fear whom you will love, whom when you have loved you will not fear. For it is written: "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear." This the apostle John says. But if perfect love casts out fear, let fear first possess the heart; love will be born there, and thus, as much as love grows, fear will decrease; as it increases, it will diminish; when it is perfected, it will be expelled. For there is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear. Do it if you love; if you do not yet love, do it if you fear; but if you neither fear nor love, you will sing in vain: "Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from the gentiles." For you are still gentiles, bearing the yoke with the unbelievers. Your Lord did for you what He did, do you for the pagans because, when the Lord did for you, you were not yet a Christian. Let them hear, whether they want it or not, who believe otherwise, hope otherwise, love otherwise: we say what we know; let them do what they want, only let them know that they do not do anything in vain whatever they do. For there is reward not only for good deeds but also for evil deeds. The reward for evil deeds is called punishment, the reward for good deeds is the crown.</P>
<h5>"Before you were a Christian, the Lord suffered for you."</h5>
<P>What, then, did your Lord do for you before you were a Christian? He suffered for you. And what does He say in the Psalms? "But I, when they were troublesome to me, clothed myself in sackcloth and humbled my soul with fasting." If you understand this figuratively, it is as though the Lord fasted by not taking the impious into His body. And in that fasting, He was hungry when, finding no fruit on that tree, He cursed it, and it withered. What does it mean when He says, "I clothed myself in sackcloth"? As if hiding His power within the infirmity of the flesh, He presented that same mortal flesh to the eyes of His persecutors. In that flesh, which He took from the old state of our mortality without any sin of His own, He bore our sins. And the sackcloth pertains to sins because of the haircloth made from the hairs of goats, which will be placed on the left, unless they first convert into lambs. Therefore, in that form of a servant, sinning in nothing, and hence owing nothing to death, He nonetheless paid on our behalf what He did not owe, to free us from our debts. In that sackcloth, He carried our price. For from the sackcloth, even the diminutive "small sack" is derived. But He carried our great price in the sackcloth with which He clothed Himself, opposing it to His persecutors, from whose impiety He humbled His soul with fasting. Indeed, when He hung on the cross, the sack was pierced by a lance, and the price of the world flowed out. So, your Lord suffered for you before you were a Christian, to buy you and make you a Christian.</P>
<h5>Let us fast for the nations.</h5>
<P>But what does Scripture say? Just as he laid down his life for us, so we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. If we cannot yet suffer for the nations, we can at least fast for the nations. How far are you from the imitation of your Lord! And when you fast, how far you still are! And it is good for you to draw near. But how do you shudder at that very perfection, whose step you fear, a step so close, so humble! This step is almost on the ground—I do not know if it should even be called a step—that you are unwilling to ascend. For what is great in fasting at this time, in eating late on such a short day? It is not great, it is not at all laborious. Concern for a single occupation often makes one do what you are unwilling to offer to God with devotion. Because the Church of God wills it, you do not wish to fast. If you were playing a game, you would fast, and you would fast to avoid rising from defeat. To win, fearing that you might be defeated by a man for money, you would fast, and you do not fast, fearing not that you might be defeated in spirit by the devil. For nothing is easier than fasting on such short days. But on the Kalends of January, you do not wish to fast. Test yourselves so that you may rejoice in yourselves, so that we may rejoice in you. How small a temptation! Yet it tests the Christian heart.</P>
<h5>Let the longing for Christ burn in our hearts.</h5>
<P>You hear the sermon now: you are suspended, invigorated by the word of God, and the exhortation itself warms the heart. We light something in your minds: we see it, we recognize it, but let that flame take strength. For from this place, after the sermon is finished shortly, you will go out to the storms and to the cold of the world. You know that this world seems to burn in perverse festivity: the winds are cold, where it is to be feared that Christian hearts may freeze. Therefore, brothers, as I said, let the strength of your heart grasp the divine word. If it takes hold, those storms which you are about to experience outside shortly will rather excite a greater flame - they will not extinguish it -, if it is not a small spark that can be extinguished. If your heart burns like chaff now, when you cry out, when you love, when you rejoice in the word of God, you will go out shortly, and it will be extinguished with a single breath of mouth, when it is said to a man: "Are you really going to fast today?". It will be extinguished immediately, because it had begun to burn like chaff. But if it burns like coals of fire, no matter how much perverse persuasion of contrary winds exists, they will increase the fire and excite it more intensely. But they burn like coals, who have come back to life. For coals, when they burn, appear to come back to life from the dead. Many also use this saying commonly; when they send for lighting, they say: "Bring the live ones", which they mean to understand as burning. Hence, naturally, they signify the extinguished ones as if they were dead. Therefore, if you have revived with the fervor of Christ's charity, let your desire for Him burn in your hearts in such a way that no breath of dissenters extinguishes it. For I know what you will experience when you leave here, and thanks be to God that you have gathered. For the fact that you gather more frequently these days does not displease us, on the contrary, it even pleases us. For you have found a way, because those whose habits are not like yours hurry to other things and engage themselves in various vain pleasures, and thus they grant you leisure and freedom, so that what has been said may be fulfilled in you: Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations. Therefore, you are gathered now; even if you go out and are mixed with them through bodily conversation, yet you do not consent to their evil and trivial matters, you will remain gathered from among the nations, wherever you are bodily. And would that you suffered from the wicked detractors only in the streets, and not even in your own homes! The father wishes to fast, the son does not, or the son wishes, the father does not; or the husband wishes, the wife does not want to, or she wishes and he does not. For he who does not want, and therefore does not want because he considers this day a festival, is a contrary breath: but let him burn in such a way that not only can he not be extinguished, but that that person may also be ignited by him.</P>
<h5>The festivals of the pagans arouse a new pain in the Christians.</h5>
<P>My brethren, if you understand well what you hear, I do not doubt that you feel sorrow for those who are still held in that madness. You feel sorrow for them because perhaps you too were once held by such madness; and now your heart is healthy compared to their madness, and you grieve compassionately but do not grieve with despair. For if it was possible for you to be changed so that what you loved yesterday you do not love today, it is also possible for him. Therefore, as long as he is such and you grieve for him, pray for him. And in order for your prayer to be heard, fast for him and give alms, and spend for him the day that you cherish - he who does not cherish himself dissipates it in contrary ways: for whoever loves iniquity hates his own soul - so that he may also come to hate iniquity, loving his soul, and inwardly grieve with you for others, and pray and fast for them with you. 

Indeed, brethren, although other days too occupy them with distractions, it is especially during their festivals that a greater license for trivialities stimulates them to greater love of the world and the destruction of pleasures. For when one does it in his home, in the cooler neighborhoods he raves less; but when everyone does it, they inflame each other. But I have already told you: their ardor is your coldness. All love is ardor. But it matters what is loved. When the heart burns for the world, it is cold to God. So let it grow cold to the world, let it burn for God. 

Therefore, when they do these things more fervently and more festively, as they incite themselves to wickedness against themselves, let them incite you to mercy for them. Indeed, they must always be mourned, as long as they are pagans, as long as they follow vanities, as long as they are devoted to demons. As long as they wish to worship what they have made, forgetting by whom they were made, they must always be mourned. But during their festivals, they excite a new grief. When you see them dissolving into various follies, into the pleasures of luxury, into immoderate drunkenness, into gambling and manifold insanities, let their new foolishness bring you new grief, if you are a Christian, if you are compassionate, because even when you were not what you are, the Church had compassion on you, which was still then in few numbers. Now that it has grown mature and widely spread in the name of Christ, should they not be mourned more who are still hard of heart, loving vanity and seeking lies? For those few who remain separated from the human race by some most stubborn obstinacy, greater sorrow is due, because a greater sickness causes them to vanish and they are not healed by the authority of such great medicine.</P>
<h5>"Christians should not go to the theaters!"</h5>
<P>And if only we were mourning for the pagans alone! We would almost not mourn for anyone. Christians should not go to the theaters: the pagans flee from there, even if not out of love for the truth, at least out of shame for the small number. Surely we must offer a greater sacrifice of prayers with sharper pain in our hearts, so that those who are called Christians may deserve to be corrected. So it is not impudent, brothers, rather it is very appropriate to fast, especially for those who toil because they want to, who, if they did not wish it, would not toil. For they are oppressed by their sins and they rejoice in their most polluted pleasures, and they do not hear the voice saying: Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you. They do not wish to be refreshed in the sweetness of Christ and think they are refreshed in the satiety of lust. That is not refreshment, but ruin. Nor should you celebrate the Christian feast days like drunkards, although fasts should be relaxed because of the sacrament of joy. However, it is one thing to signify joy by relaxing the fast, another thing to repel justice by the burden of the heart. The Lord says, the truth says: Do not let your hearts be weighed down with carousing and drunkenness. It is foolish and irreverent to want to please the martyrs for the reason that if they had not despised such things, they would never have attained the glory of martyrdom.</P>
<h5>"Not all pagans think the same about idols."</h5>
<P>But perhaps you are not going to suffer pagans of this kind. For some of their own despise those given to the wickedness of pleasures and drunkenness and say: "Just as you have bad Christians, so we have bad pagans. For good pagans, see what they are." Then they name the wise and philosophers of the world, as if endowed with excellent doctrine. But do not be frightened by them. Greatness is one thing, swelling is another. For what swells also seems great, but it is not healthy. Hear the Apostle saying: Beware lest anyone seduce you through philosophy and vain deceit according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of this world and not according to Christ, because in him dwells all the fullness of divinity bodily, and you are made full in him, who is the head of all principality and power. For as they interpret their idols skillfully and as if wisely, they flee to the elements of the world. You rebuke someone because he worships idols, and it is evident that he adores the idol: he is convicted in fact, and there he has his affection - in that idol, namely -, he places his hearing there, but what does a supposedly more skilled and wiser pagan say to you? "Unskilled pagans do this, to worship the idol as an idol, just as some of yours worship columns in the church."</P>
<h5>"The temple of your prayer is your heart."</h5>
<P>Therefore I say, brothers: do not act in a way that pagans may mock us; enter the church in such a way that you do not give pagans a reason not to enter the church. For the church is entered because of fraternal congregation. For the temple of your prayer is your heart. Clean the place where you pray, and you will be heard. For if you cleanse the visible place where you make your prayer, it is not for the eyes of God - for He sees everything as He has created everything - but so that your own eyes are not offended and do not divert your intention, how much more should you cleanse the place where you invoke and by which you invoke God? Your inner room, where you enter and shut the door, as the Lord Himself says, that is, your sense of body, should be closed against bodily temptations; but fraternal congregation ignites fervor in praying and praising God. Just as if some weight were to be moved, and that which is called a work chant were to be sung, wouldn't the multitude of those chanting and cooperating in unison and in the same effort even stir your weak strength, so that you would also want to hold the rope and rejoice in the fellowship of that work? Thus, the gathering of brothers sharpens charity. And every person prays inwardly when he prays well, just as the Lord answered the Samaritan woman: He said, The hour is coming and now is, when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. And shortly after: He said, The hour is coming and now is, when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth. For the Father seeks such to worship Him. God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth. Therefore, if God is to be asked in spirit, let it be a dwelling place: the dweller will be present. He said, We will come to him, I and my Father, and we will make our abode with him. So come to the church, that the fervor of praying may be stirred, that the devotion of a peaceful congregation may merit a hearing from God, not because God dwells in an earthly place where He may hear you. Do not think that God only hears within such walls: He heard the martyrs in the prison. He said, What house will you build for me, or what is the place of my rest? Didn't my hand make all these? And yet He said He has a place in the heart of a pious man. For He said: Upon whom does my Spirit rest? Upon the humble and quiet and those who tremble at my words.</P>
<h5>In a great house there are hired workers, servants, and children.</h5>
<P>Why did we say this? So that, while we criticize the pagans, we do not give them a reason to criticize us. Come to the places of the martyrs in such a way that the visit results in a holy remembrance in your hearts, and from the honor of the martyrs, let there arise an affection toward God, who did not abandon the martyrs in their tribulation, who helped them as they fought, who crowned them as they conquered. Thus you make yourselves worthy of the martyrs' prayers. Otherwise, a good servant is greatly indignant if, with the Lord being ignored, he himself is worshiped, a good servant who also became a son from being a servant. For there is a difference between one who is still a servant, yet to become a son from being a servant, and one who is already a son. A servant obeys out of fear, a son out of love. The great house has all: hirelings, servants, and sons. Hirelings are those who seek worldly benefits in the Church, about whom the Apostle says that they announce the Gospel not with pure intentions, and yet he permits it saying: Whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. Servants, however, are those who do what is commanded by the Lord out of fear. They are indeed of the house, and more interior in the great house than the hirelings; from these servants, sons are made when they begin to serve out of love. Therefore, as I began to say, the great house has all. What do we think the martyrs are, my brothers? God forbid we should count them among the hirelings, nor among those who are not yet sons! For they loved Christ and for His love they despised not only all worldly pleasures but also all torments, intoxicated by the cup of His Spirit about which it is said: Your intoxicating cup, how glorious it is! Therefore, a good servant, as I said, who is already called a son, does not want to be worshiped, but his Lord. Pay attention, brothers, and remember what you frequently attend, what the truth teaches in the Church. The faithful know in what order the martyrs are commemorated in the sacraments, when our vows and prayers are directed toward God; the faithful know, and the catechumens should hasten to learn. For who repels them? To whom is not open, if willing, what is closed to the indifferent?</P>
<h5>"Paul and Barnabas rejected the honor of sacrifices."</h5>
<P>But let us observe, brothers, what good servants have done while still existing in this body, when they were honored by men and began to be worshipped as gods of the nations: Paul and Barnabas, because they performed miracles in Christ, because they exceeded the human measure, were called by the pagans, according to their custom, Barnabas as Jupiter, and Paul as Mercury, because he was more prompt in speaking, and they began to offer sacrifices to them. They so abhorred this honor that they tore their garments and taught them, as much as they could, who alone should be worshipped, in whose power they did these things. Observe these things, brothers, so that you may be strong and guarded even against more elegant pagans. Why do I say more elegant, who are in greater danger? For the more learned they seem to themselves, the more unteachable they become. For they are ashamed to learn, lest they confess their ignorance, and there is no pious humility in them, which the humble God alone came to teach.

Or perhaps someone might say: "Paul and Barnabas refused the honor of sacrifices offered to them because one was called Jupiter and the other Mercury, whom the apostles detested as false gods with Christian religion, and therefore were indignant to be compared to demons or idols, not because they wanted God to be worshipped rather than themselves?" 

So they would say this to those wanting to sacrifice: "You are insulting us, comparing us to demons to whom we are better"; instead, they tore their garments sorrowfully and humbly admonished that such things should not be done to them nor to anyone, but that one should turn from these vanities to the one God, saying: Men, why are you doing this? We are men like you, announcing to you that you should turn from these useless things to the one who made heaven and earth and the sea and all that is in them. Saying these and similar things, they barely persuaded them not to sacrifice to them. 

But to show the impious more fully that they did not refuse these sacrifices because they considered it an insult to themselves but so that God alone would be honored, to whose worship they worked the most to convert everyone, consider Peter: when men marveled at his deed - rather not his, but God's - when that lame man of forty years, who sat at the beautiful gate, rose and walked by the word of God, he did not want glory to be given to himself, but to Christ, and said: Men of Israel, why do you marvel at this, or why do you look at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made this man walk? The God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son, whom you handed over for judgment.</P>
<h5>Let us observe the good angels of God.</h5>
<P>But if what men did is little, so that they wanted glory to be given not to themselves but to God, look at the angels. In Revelation, the holy angel - because there are also perverse angels, for whom and their leader the devil the eternal fire is prepared - thus the angel who did not fall through pride, but remaining in holy humility under God, not raising himself in haughtiness against God nor saying: I will place my throne on the northern side and be like the Most High, but remaining in the south, where Christ feeds and rests... For it is written: Where you feed, where you rest at noon. The southern part is indeed contrary to the northern: thus it signifies those who are cold and dark. But the south signifies the illuminated and fervent. Therefore, those who are good, as if in the south, are fervent and shine; but those who are evil, as if in the north, are cold and darkened by obscure gloom. With those in the south God feeds and rests, hence it is said: Where you feed, where you rest at noon, not with those, of whose part the devil says: I will place my throne in the north and be like the Most High. For he could not be worshipped except by such, who would think him to be a god. Therefore, that angel remaining in the south, fervent in holiness and luminous in wisdom, demonstrated certain things in Revelation to the apostle John. And he, disturbed, fell at the feet of the angel.</P>
<h5>He who lives in holiness esteems solely the glory of God.</h5>
<P>See, brothers, above all, to which angels humble men are similar and to which proud men are similar. For those who cause schisms and heresies desire their own name to be named and the name of Christ to be obscured, and they choose to sit in the north. For men would not follow them, having deserted the Church, as if they were Christ, unless their understanding was darkened and they were alienated from the warmth of charity. But to whom are those similar who, holding humility, choose to be cast out in the house of the Lord, rather than dwell in the tents of sinners?

What did Simon desire, if not to be praised in miracles and exalted in pride? For it was this very pride that compelled him to think that the gift of the Holy Spirit could be bought with money. Apostle Paul, contrary to this pride, in humility, remaining in the south, fervent in spirit, shining with prudence, says: "Neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase." And again: "Was Paul crucified for you, or were you baptized in the name of Paul?" How he refused to be worshiped in place of Christ, how he was zealous for the bridegroom and did not want to show himself to the infidel soul in place of the bridegroom!

So what kind of holy men were they according to their measure - for they will be perfect like angels after the resurrection of the body - but nevertheless according to their measure, just as they themselves rejected the honor which men bestowed on them as if rightly their own, while they wanted him to be worshiped and all hearts to be turned to him, in whom they themselves also gloried, truly good and faithful servants, children, such holy angels. For even though they were still men in the flesh and placed in such temptations, they rejected the honor that was conferred on them to pride, so that only he who alone is honored without danger to the honoring one is honored in all.

For where do they place themselves so that he may be honored? How do they humble themselves? Does it not seem great to plant and to water? But neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters. He does not call himself anything for the salvation of those he wished to build up in Christ. If, therefore, men still living in the flesh do these things, how much more so the martyrs and angels! For the more holy they live, the more they love the glory of God and have their hope in him alone. For we too will be like angels, but after the resurrection. Thus said the Lord: "They will be equal to the angels of God."</P>
<h5>Pagan priests prescribe idols to be worshiped.</h5>
<P>Return, therefore, with me to what I had begun to narrate, and be instructed beneficially on why you are devoted to God. For that angel was revealing miraculous and mystical visions in the Apocalypse to the apostle John, servant of Christ, son of the mother Church, and made among the sons of God. But he, disturbed by a certain vision, as I had begun to say, fell at the feet of the angel. However, the angel did not accept the honor given to him by a man, which was owed to God, and said to him: "Rise, what are you doing? Worship God. For I am your fellow servant and of your brothers." Why did we say this? Consider the summation. We had begun to speak about the pagans, as if they were more learned - for they are less learned, about whom these do not wish to have any precedent - because they say to us: "You also have worshipers of columns and even sometimes of pictures." And would that we did not have them, and may the Lord ensure that we do not have them! But nevertheless, this is not what the Church teaches you. For which of their priests ever ascended and, from a high place, commanded the people not to worship idols, as we publicly proclaim in Christ, so that columns or stones of buildings in holy places or even pictures are not worshiped? Rather, their own priests turned to idols to offer sacrifices for the people, and still desire to offer them.</P>
<h5>"Concerning the images of the stars and their worship."</h5>
<P>"They say, 'We do not worship idols, but what is signified by the idol.' I ask what idols signify, I ask what the idol of the sun signifies: is it anything other than the sun? Indeed, interpretations of other idols may perhaps have hidden meanings. For now, let us set these aside temporarily. Surely, the idol of the sun signifies nothing other than the sun, and the idol of the moon signifies the moon, and the idol of the Earth signifies the Earth. If therefore they do not worship what they see in the idol, but what the idol signifies, why, having the very things signified by those idols before their eyes, do they worship the idols instead?

For if what is signified could not be seen, it would be reasonable to worship the sign instead of the thing signified. But since they see the sun which is signified by the idol of the sun, why do they turn their backs to what is signified, and their faces to the sign that signifies it? For if they did not make idols of the things they see, and only made them for the things they do not see, they could deceive the less wise and say: 'Look, we worship the sun. But because we see it, we establish no idol for it. Similarly, as we see the moon and the stars, so we worship them; we have made no idols of them. For it is foolish to place a visible sign in a closed temple for something that can be seen and worshiped in the open sky. But since we worship the mind, or intellect, or soul, or virtue, or justice - these things are indeed invisible - we establish visible idols for them, so that by seeing and worshiping these, we may reverentially contemplate the invisible things.'

But now they are most clearly convinced of being devoted to the idols themselves, and not to the things signified by the idols, since they have made idols of visible things that are obvious to the eyes of all. The idol has the sun, which if they worshiped in the sky, they would rightly be reproached for their true piety and religion. Moreover, they have reached such madness that they turn their backs to the sun and face its idol. How can you be heard, so perverse, when you turn away from it and turn to its false and deceitful image made by human hand? It is as if you come to the house of the head of the household to ask for something, and he stands in his courtyard, yet you turn your back to him and face the picture where he is painted, and pray with all your heart not to the man but to the picture, even in the presence of the man whose image the picture is. Wouldn't he have you dismissed from his house as a jester or a madman?

Nothing would be more foolish than what these people do, even if the sun were to be worshiped. But since these things are not to be worshiped, we will speak in the name of the Lord, if He grants us time and ability. But now we say these things about how they are caught in their own actions. You have made a temple for the moon, you have placed an idol for it; the moon itself rises every day, and for scarcely two or three days a month it cannot be seen: worship it, if it is to be worshiped, if you have come to such disgrace that you wish to worship the visible creature as if it were God, although the invisible creature is surely superior, which nevertheless is not to be worshiped, but only the Creator alone is to be worshiped as God.

But behold, the very things you worship are before your eyes, whether it is the sun, the moon, the stars, or the earth, why do you seek their idols, when those present things themselves are to be worshiped, unless because men are devoted to the things made by their own hands, forgetting Him by whose hands they were made?"</P>
<h5>Augustine mocks those worshipping Neptune.</h5>
<P>But now let us see how they interpret the statues. "I do not," he says, "say that the statue of Neptune is Neptune, but Neptune is something else which is signified by this image." What is Neptune? "The sea," he says. This is the entire understanding because Neptune is the sea. But the Christian neither worships that statue which you call Neptune, nor the sea which you interpret as Neptune. And whom does he worship? The one who made heaven and earth and the sea and all that is in them. But what do you say? "The sea is signified by this statue." And this is said as if it were something secret, whispered into the ear, so that it might be considered a great mystery that this statue signifies the sea, so that if anyone worships that statue, it might seem to them that they are worshipping the sea. Therefore, only those who live inland should have statues of Neptune, who do not see the sea itself, so that those who do not have the thing itself might have the sign instead of the thing. But now they have made a sanctuary of Neptune next to the sea itself, and turning their backs to the sea, they worship Neptune. Nor do the waves crashing behind them draw back to the worshipper, and what is more foolish, the one who prays wants the sea to be silent and the statue to hear, because apparently the sea, not with its salty waves, but with the foreign bronze ears, has the ability to hear.</P>
<h5>The earth is to be tended not by worshipping but by plowing.</h5>
<P>Thus also with the image of the Earth. "Not," he says, "this which you see is worshiped, but this signifies the earth.” That, even if he did not say it, would be apparent. In vain he wants to draw forth as if from a mystery what is openly proclaimed in its name. For 'Tellus' is another name for the Earth. They nonetheless call the same earth the mother, to whom they have made a temple and an image. Behold, I understand, just as with the sun, just as with the moon: there is no need for an explanation; for those images are called by the same names as the things themselves whose images they are, which we certainly see and recognize very well. Or perhaps is it that what they add, the term 'mother,' is the thing that must be learned? "She is," they say, "the mother of all that is born." And let her be the mother of all that is born: am I therefore to worship the earth for this, and not Him who said: "Let the earth produce whatever it produces”? For without His word it would not only be barren, but altogether nonexistent. What then is this person, as though the narrator of mysteries, wanting to turn us away from the Creator and convert us to the creature, what does he expound to me as a great thing, that I should worship the earth? Indeed, this is rightly said to farmers, that if they do not want to suffer hunger, they should cultivate the earth, not by worshipping but by plowing.</P>
<h5>The pagans hide their books, the Christians bring them forth.</h5>
<P>Thus, I inquire about the statue of Juno: here we already desire a mystical interpreter. For Juno, unlike Mother Earth, does not reveal by her name what she signifies, nor is there an image of the sun or the moon. Therefore, the secret of Juno is great. What is this secret, I ask you? "This," he says, "few know." Perhaps many have heard from those few and have spoken. Perhaps their writings also reveal to those they do not wish to reveal what they worship, although our writings also reveal to them what we worship, but we do not fear. Our books are publicly sold: light does not blush. Let them buy, read, believe; or let them buy, read, mock. That Scripture knows how to hold guilty those who read and do not believe. The book is sold publicly, but He who is proclaimed in the book is not for sale. Or is He also for sale, because He exposed Himself to be bought by the nations at such a price as anyone has? Zacchaeus bought Him with half of his estate, the widow bought Him with two small coins, the poor guest bought Him by offering a cup of cold water; and He is possessed by all buyers: He is not too small for anyone, He enlarges all. Such is He who is proclaimed in the book. Buy the book yourself and read, we do not blush. Hide your sacred books in hidden caves, there is such curiosity of men that they both investigate and reveal.</P>
<h5>We do not worship Juno, as she is a creature.</h5>
<P>What then is Juno? "Juno, they say, is the air." Long ago they urged us to worship the sea in Neptune, to worship the earth in the image of Tellus; now they invite us to worship the air. These are the elements by which this world consists. Therefore the Apostle Paul warning in his epistle: Beware, he says, lest anyone deceive you through philosophy and empty deceit, according to the elements of this world. For he was speaking of those who explain idols as if more wisely. Therefore when he said: Through philosophy, he added in the same place: According to the elements of this world. Not just any worshippers of idols, but those who interpret signs as if more learned should be avoided. "Therefore, they say, Juno is the air." Let them call a familiar thing whatever they want: I will not worship the air, for it cannot be cultivated in the way the earth is cultivated by farmers. For the farmer works on the earth, as I said before, not by worshipping, but by working, to find fruit. But the air cannot be cultivated in this way nor is it to be worshipped. Praise the work, adore the worker. "To know," they say, "that the air is Juno, the Greeks call her thus: Hra is said in Greek; era, however often repeated, sounds like air. But we, who say that we must serve the one Creator in religion, for that reason we do not worship Juno, because it is an idol; for that reason we do not worship, because it is a creature.</P>
<h5>"Pride of the devil must be avoided."</h5>
<P>But I ask this of them, if I worship only God, will the air be angry? For if I worship the air, God is angry; although He is always tranquil and administers and governs all that He created without any disturbance, in some ineffable way God is, however, angry. When He wants to be worshipped alone, He does not want this out of arrogance: for He alone is worthy of worship, and He does not want to be worshipped for His own exaltation, but so that man may be better. For He does not need worshippers, but you need the One who is worshipped. The prophet says, "I said to the Lord: You are my God, for You do not need my goods." Therefore, if He alone demands to be worshipped without arrogance, whoever else demands and arrogates this for himself privately, as if he deserved to be worshipped in his own right, and does not find it sufficient to be worshipped in Him who created, he demands this out of arrogance. And the arrogance of the devil must be avoided, so that we may humbly reach the height of God. For the devil alone wants to be worshipped instead of God, because he said: "I will place my throne in the north and I will be like the Most High."</P>
<h5>On the Worship of Vulcan.</h5>
<P>For what will they say about the symbol, for example, of Vulcan, to recall all the elements—since it is said there are four: earth, water, air, fire; and about the sky we have already spoken, when we spoke of the sun and moon? "Vulcan," they say, "is fire," not the ethereal fire where the sun and moon and other stars are, but this fire which is on earth adapted for the uses of men. "For this reason," they also say, "Vulcan is depicted as lame because the movement of this fire quivers as if it were limping." So what then? Since man has fire in his control, he who kindles it and extinguishes it at will, uses it as he pleases—do men have so much power over a god, and does anyone who blows out the lamp extinguish a god? I do not know whether it is worse to worship the idol itself by itself or to offer such an interpretation of it. But what is that to us? Perhaps they will even interpret invisible things: for these are visible. Let us quickly come to the security of our faith, so that we are not at all corrupted by them.</P>
<h5>Those who offer worship to Mercury are slaves of the devil.</h5>
<P>"Mercury, he says, I worship with intellect; intellect is not seen, it is something invisible." Certainly, we also concede that intellect is something invisible, and it is indeed invisible and such an entity that is better than the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all those things which are seen; for an invisible substance, being as it is a kind of life, is better than any visible substance, because everything visible is a body. And a great thing indeed is intellect: however, if you consider that very intellect which they say they worship, what has it done? Do not many err with great intellect? And perhaps most especially those who think that intellect should be worshipped in the image of Mercury. Therefore, if human intellect can err without God as its guide, when human intellect is sound, it does not wish to be worshipped as God, but it wishes Him to be worshipped, by whom it desires to be enlightened. For unless human intellect is enlightened by the illuminating God, it is darkened in its errors. But I ask you, what do you worship in Mercury? "Intellect," you say. Intellect is a sort of intermediate thing, because intellect, either turned away from the Creator, is darkened and becomes foolish, or turned to the Creator, is enlightened and becomes wise. But you have said an intermediate thing, when you said you worship intellect. "Yes," he says, "intermediate, for even the name Mercury sounds like one who runs in the middle." For it is said that Mercury is called as if running in the middle. Therefore, if he is worshipped for that reason, because he is an intermediate thing, why is not He rather worshipped, who recalls the intermediate intellect, as you say, to Himself, so that it may cling to Him, being suspended and turned away from the inferior things, such as the intellects of the saints, the intellects of the martyrs, and the intellects of the angels? For if the intellect were such as this angel I mentioned, illuminated by God, it repels the adoration of man from itself and advises its worshipper to rather adore God. "Worship God," it says, "for I am a fellow servant of you and of your brothers." Therefore, should you worship an intermediate intellect, from which a better intellect reproaches you? For if you worship an intermediate intellect, the enlightened intellect will reproach you. Why? Because the enlightened intellect does not wish intellect to be worshipped but rather the illuminator of intellects. Indeed, by that illumination it is benign and benevolent, and wants all intellects to turn to Him, by whom it also knows itself to be enlightened. Or perhaps does a foolish intellect want itself to be worshipped? Clearly, this is true. Beware, then, lest, when you wish to worship Mercury as intellect, you worship the devil, who has a foolish intellect. For the devil, even when he said: "I will place my seat in the north and I will be like the Most High," did not want to worship God and wanted to be worshipped as God, rising against God. But because he departed as if from the south to the north, his intellect became darkened, and because it is darkened, also proud, and because it is proud, thus he wants you, deceived, to worship Mercury, so that while you worship Mercury, you end up worshipping the devil.</P>
<h5>"Every creature is either bodily or spiritual."</h5>
<P>May your holiness pay attention and see from human beings what we say. Apply your mind and understand. Every creature is either corporeal or spiritual. Only the Creator is spiritual; but the creature, as we have said, is either corporeal or spiritual. Pay attention, so that according to our abilities you may have as much as the Lord will assist against the pagans, not just any, but those who consider themselves more learned and interpreters of idols and who are puffed up and inflate and mock the true name of truth. Every creature, as I said, is either corporeal or spiritual. Corporeal like the earth and all that is produced in it, like the sea and all that swims or crawls in it, like the air and all that flies in it, like the sky and all that shines in it. All these creatures are corporeal. But spiritual is better than corporeal. What is the spiritual creature? That which is not perceived by the senses of the body, but by the intellect of the mind, like all souls, whether irrational as in beasts, or rational as in humans, whether deficient as in the impious, or progressing as in the converted, or perfect as in angels and archangels, thrones, dominions, principalities, powers of the higher habitation. Therefore, since a creature is either corporeal or spiritual, and a third cannot be found, the highest bodies, which are not better, are celestial. Now what is beyond - not by spaces of places, but by the nature of force - is not a body, but a spirit: a certain life, but a mutable life, because it is a creature; true immutable life, the Creator. Therefore, mutable life, that is, a spiritual creature, is also formable and illuminable, that is, it can be formed and illuminated; but immutable life, that is, the substance of the Creator itself, is creating and illuminating. The creature is indeed formed and illuminated, but the Creator forms and illuminates.</P>
<h5>Of the heavenly regions and their inhabitants.</h5>
<P>Pay attention and understand. Therefore, every life that can be illuminated and attain wisdom, when it is of good will, loves God who illuminates it and advances turned towards Him and, clinging to Him, is formed to the integrity and perfection of wisdom, and in its kind to the fullness of blessedness: namely, the rational and intellectual life, such as is of angels, such as is of humans. Therefore, if such a life, when it is praiseworthy, loves its illuminator, every such life, through culpable will, abandoning the life that illuminates it, is darkened and becomes proud, like that of the wicked angel or wicked human: for it does not want to cleave to God, but wants, through a certain private pride, to be considered as God. Fallen and turned into this certain proud and wicked life, the archangel and his angels have become the devil and those demons, and they have taken a certain space in this murky air, where they rule over all wicked humans. Therefore the Apostle says: "According to the prince of the power of the air, who now works in the sons of disobedience." And again, exhorting us to endure the persecutions of this age: "Our struggle," he says, "is not against flesh and blood," that is, not against humans, "but against principalities," he says, "against powers, against the rulers of this world’s darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places." For when he said that the prince of the power of the air works in the sons of disobedience, lest they focus on humans and think they are struggling against them, through whom they suffered persecutions, and not perceive with their minds that enemy whom they should overcome in Christ: "Your struggle," he says, "is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, and rulers of this world’s darkness, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places." Moreover, lest by calling them rulers of the world he be thought to mean those as rulers of the entire creation that God made, he showed which world he meant by adding and saying: "of this darkness." And what darkness is, you can recognize. For the apostle himself said that infidels are signified by the name of darkness, when he spoke to the faithful: "For you were once darkness, but now are light in the Lord." Thus, also what he said about "in the heavenly places" must be understood, not in those higher resting places of the holy angels, where even the luminaries and stars are placed, but because this air is also called heaven, whence even the birds of the heaven are so called.</P>
<h5>Of the light which shines for the purified in spirit.</h5>
<P>Therefore, let your holiness attend, that the mercy of the Lord may enlighten you. For we sound these things with our ears; He acts within, as we believe, as we hope from His mercy to whom we sing praises. Therefore, as I had begun to say, a soul turned away from God, as from the light of truth and as from the midday sun, finds itself in the north. The kingdom of the north, however, is the kingdom of the devil who says: "I will set my throne in the north, and I will be like the Most High"; there the hearts of men grow cold, and made cold by that flame, they cannot savor spiritual things of divine wisdom. Therefore, they begin to think only of bodies, and seek even divinity in bodies, that is, in the sea, on the earth, in the air, and primarily in celestial bodies, such as the moon, the sun, or the stars. Since the sense of sight is the most prominent among the senses of the body, whatever shines to the eyes, particularly if it stands out in the world, is thought to be great. But if someone tells them that there is something great which neither eye has seen nor ear heard, nor has entered into the heart of man, they say that nothing which cannot be seen exists. Therefore, such hearts have grown cold. If they have grown cold, they are in the north; if they are in the north, they are governed by the one who said: "I will set my throne in the north, and I will be like the Most High." But those who in any way have lifted up their hearts and sharpened their study as much as they could to see something that cannot be seen with the eyes of the body, transcending—easily indeed—the earth they tread upon and all things that are on the earth, transcending even the sea and whatever swims or creeps within it, transcending also the air and all the birds—for that too is an earthly element—transcending the entire etherial heaven with all the lights that shine therein or perhaps are hidden therein, they saw that there is something not seen, as is the mind, as is intelligence, as is reason; they also saw that this too changes and sought something immutable, moving beyond in thought and the sharpness of the mind even the spiritual creature and understood the Creator Spirit, and as if struck by the unusual brilliance of wisdom, they returned, as if to rest in the darkness of their flesh, and some of them felt the need to purify their soul, which, cleansed from all carnal desires, would become fit to obtain that which had dazzled them with its ineffable light.</P>
<h5>The devil offered himself as a mediator to those seeking purification.</h5>
<P>Attend, my brothers, and take heed sorrowfully. They saw it necessary to undergo purification so that the light which cannot be grasped by the weak vision of the mind, when the same vision is healed, shaped, and strengthened, can be grasped. They saw the need for medicine, and as they were seeking this medicine, the devil immediately intervened because they were seeking arrogantly, boasting in their supposed doctrines, especially because they were able, if they could, with sharpness of intellect and acuity of mind, transcending all creatures, both bodily and spiritual, to reach the knowledge that there is something both spiritual and unchangeable, and from it, all things that exist both spiritually and bodily come forth; however, the Creator does not move in places, does not move in times, while bodies move in places and times; but the substance of the soul, that is, the spiritual creature, does not move indeed in places but is moved in times through the mutability of various affections, and hence to be something intermediate, because the highest God is not moved either in places or in times, while the substance of bodies, that is, the lowest creature, is moved both in places and in times. Hence, it (the soul) is intermediate because it does not move in places as God does not, but is moved in times as bodies are. Therefore, when they saw and were seeking purification, that proud devil occupied them with proud thoughts and arrogantly presented himself as a mediator, through whom it seemed to them that their souls could be purified. He persuaded them with certain signs of his pride, so that it seemed to men that the soul, which wishes to reach God, could be purified through magical arts, he established sacrileges in the temples, promising sacrilegious purification. Indeed, many images, as Scripture says, were established from the honors of men who were considered great, whether absent or dead. All these things, however, in the name of Christ, are now taken away by public laws and no longer publicly performed, while some of them were once considered public magic. But just as before there was private magic, now these things are done secretly since public performance has been forbidden.</P>
<h5>Wise ones from the nations have come to the knowledge of God.</h5>
<P>When, therefore, the proud and unjust enemy of souls opposed himself as a mediator, listen to the Apostle teaching why he opposed himself, namely because their pride gave him a place. Hence he admonishes, saying: "Neither give place to the devil." But how we may find their pride, let the same Apostle say. And first let us note that some of them had also attained to the knowledge of God, whom he nevertheless desired to be saved through Christ. For they had attained to the knowledge of God, but had not attained to salvation. For it is one thing to attain to the knowledge of God, quite another thing to attain to salvation, where there is also the fullness of that very knowledge, when the knower cleaves to the known. Among the Athenians, when the Apostle spoke as to pagan men, because they boasted themselves above other nations in the height of their learning, and among them was, as it were, the summit of philosophy - for there stood out the learned and wise of this world - when the Apostle, therefore, spoke among them, he did not put forth testimonies from the prophets, but from their own he brought forth neither did he keep silent about them being theirs, not ours, for, even if something good is found there, many bad things are found there, not like our prophets whose scriptures contain only good. Among the Athenians, therefore, when the Apostle spoke of God, he said: "In him," he said, "we live, and move, and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said."</P>
<h5>The invisible things of God from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.</h5>
<P>But what sort of people they were and why they were reproved, I shall explain elsewhere: "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness," he says. What do we understand by "against ungodliness," if not both of the Jews and the Gentiles? But lest it be said: "Why is the wrath of God revealed against the ungodliness of the Gentiles, since you said against all? For did the Gentiles receive the law and become transgressors? It is right that the wrath of God is revealed against the Jews, to whom the law was given and who did not want to observe it; but it was not given to the Gentiles," observe, brothers, and understand how the same Apostle declares all guilty, and all in need of salvation and the mercy of God. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, those who hold the truth in unrighteousness. Understand, brothers, see how he did not say: "They do not have the truth," but: "They hold the truth in unrighteousness." And as if you were to ask, saying: "How can they have the truth, who did not receive the law?", because what is known of God is manifest in them. How could what is known of God be manifest in them, who did not receive the law? He continues and says: "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; even his eternal power and Godhead," indeed we understand "clearly seen." By what are they seen? By the things that are made.</P>
<h5>From bodies, understand the soul; from the soul, understand God.</h5>
<P>Why does man attend to works and not seek the maker? You observe the earth bearing fruit, you observe the sea full of its creatures, you observe the air filled with flying things, you observe the sky gleaming with stars, you recognize the changes of the seasons, you consider the four-part year, the leaves falling and returning to the trees, the seeds given their numbers, each thing having its measurements, its weights, all things managed according to their orders, the upper sky with total peace, the lower earth having its own kind of beauty in receding and succeeding things: considering all these, you see already all brought to life by a spiritual creature, and do you not seek the maker of such a great work? But you say to me: "I see these things, I do not see Him." Because He made something else for you whereby you might see these things, something else whereby He Himself might be seen—He gave bodily eyes to see these things, He gave a mind to see Himself— therefore you are not allowed to say in vain: "I do not see Him"; inspect these things according to understanding, and you will see the one working. For neither do you see the soul of a man; indeed, the soul of a man is not seen, but from the administration of the body, when we observe one walking, working, speaking, moving all the members according to the proper duties of each, we say: "He lives, there is in him something we do not see," and we understand it through these things we see. Therefore, just as you understand the soul, which you do not see, from the movements and administration of the body, so from the administration of the whole world and from the governance of souls, understand the Creator.</P>
<h5>Nations have vanished in their thoughts.</h5>
<P>But it is little to understand, for they also understood, and see what the Apostle says, consider the words which I began to say from the beginning. "The wrath of God," he says, "is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness. Because that which may be known of God is manifested in them, for God has shown it to them." And as if you were asking how He manifested it, he says, "the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead," that is, being understood they are seen, "so that they are without excuse." Why without excuse? Because, he says, "they hold the truth in unrighteousness," he shows how. "Because, knowing God"—he did not say "because they did not know God," but what did he say?—"because, knowing God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened." By what merit, if not by pride? For see what follows: "Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools." They ought not to have arrogated to themselves what He had given, nor boast of what they had not from themselves, but from Him: which was certainly to be restored, so that in keeping what they had been able to see, they might be healed by Him who had granted them to see. For if they had done this, they would have maintained humility, and could have been purified and adhered to that most blessed contemplation. For to such men the true and truthful physician, the mediator, the conqueror of pride, the exalter of humility, would be revealed. But you say, “Was He not yet humbly born?” But He would have been revealed by prophecy, just as He was revealed to Abraham—for the Lord Himself said, “Abraham desired to see my day, and he saw it, and was glad”—just as He was revealed to other fathers and prophets. For thus they were saved by faith in the One who was to be born and to suffer, just as we are saved, having been born and suffered. But it is no wonder since He revealed Himself to their humility and concealed from their pride. Because there was pride in them, a false and deceitful and proud one interposed himself, who promised them by some arts of pride that their souls would be purified, and made them worshippers of demons, that is, of evil angels. Hence all the sacraments that are celebrated by pagans, which they say avail for the purification of their souls.</P>
<h5>God delivers idol worshippers to the desires of their hearts.</h5>
<P>And listen to the Apostle consequently saying this, that for the reward of their pride they received this, because they did not honor God as God should be honored. Their foolish heart, he says, was darkened. Claiming to be wise, they became fools, indeed through that false mediator, who rejoices in idols, who rejoices when unclean animals are fed – that is, the pigs which the younger son fed, having gone far away from his father: for just as the Lord is near to those who have broken hearts, that is, the humble, so the Lord is far from those who have exalted hearts, that is, the proud. Claiming, he says, to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of corruptible man. The idols are already there, and those indeed of all the Greeks and other nations, which have the likeness of men. But there is no idolatry greater or more superstitious than that of the Egyptians – for Egypt flooded the world with such images as the Apostle subsequently describes –, when he said: Into the likeness of the image of corruptible man, he added: And of birds and quadrupeds and serpents. For, brothers, have you seen in other temples idols with the head of a dog or a bull, or the figures of other irrational animals? Has anyone seen these things in any temple except in the temple of Isis? For the idols are of the Egyptians. The Apostle embraces both kinds when he says: Into the likeness of the image of corruptible man and of birds and quadrupeds and serpents. Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to dishonor their bodies among themselves. These evils come from impiety. For the head was pride. Moreover, these following sins are not only sins but also punishments. For when he says: God gave them up, it is already a matter of retribution for some sin, so that these things happen, but these punishments are still sins as well. Why? Because they can still return from them if they wish. But truly, when it comes to punishment, it is no longer permitted to return from it; that will be the punishment which will no longer be called sin. For in these intermediate states, they are both punishments and sins. The first, which is pride, is a sin alone, not yet a punishment. Those that follow are both sins and punishments. Whoever does not want to return from them will come to the punishment which is no longer a sin but the penalty for all sins. Because the first sin is pride, it is clearly written elsewhere: The beginning of all sin is pride. And how is the root of all evils avarice? Because wanting more than God is avarice, wanting more than is sufficient is avarice. For God alone is enough for the soul. Hence it is said by Philip: Show us the Father, and it is enough for us. But what is more prideful than the one who, presuming on himself, abandons God? What is more covetous than the one for whom God is not enough? Therefore, pride itself is avarice in the origin of sins. Therefore, the soul, as an adulteress, having abandoned the one true and lawful husband, God, prostitutes itself to many false gods, that is, demons, and is in no way satisfied.</P>
<h5>The Romans worshiped many gods, with the devil rejoicing.</h5>
<P>How many gods did the Romans worship! At first, forsaking the one true and unchangeable God, they worshipped gods as if they were their own. They began to fight with other nations, and believing that they were defended by their gods, they persevered and sought to violate the gods of others with certain sacrifices, and increased the number of their own gods by adopting the sacrilegious rites of either the subjected or to-be-subjected nations. Thus, they invited canine faces, and shapes of bulls and serpents and birds and all the monstrosities of the Egyptians, and thus they appeased them as if propitiating them. For it is also read among their authors that the gods of the Egyptians were even adverse to the Roman gods not long before the time of the incarnation of the Lord. For just as the Apostle says about the Cretans: A certain one of their own prophets said: "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons," so too can we say: A certain one of their own prophets said:</P>
<P>all kinds of gods and beasts and barking Anubis<br>against Neptune and Venus and against Minerva<br>
they hold weapons.</P>
<P>For it seemed unworthy to this poet that the dog-headed Egyptians would fight against the human images of the Romans. Yet the demons fought amongst themselves, the Egyptians' for the Egyptians, and the Romans' for the Romans. However, to possess both peoples altogether, they made an agreement among themselves, and everything began to be worshiped by the Romans. For the Apostle says: “Not that an idol is anything, but that what the pagans sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God. I do not want you to become partners with demons.” Just as these people deceive themselves, saying: “...,” as if you would disdain the idol that the craftsman made, because it has no life. You would disdain the idol if you despised the demon who delights in the idol. Therefore, it is pointless to interpret the image as a representation of the creature, because the creature does not rejoice in such worship by men unless it is a sinful creature which, out of pride, demands undeserved honor, deceitfully terrifying human frailty. God handed them over, he says, to the desires of their hearts in impurity, so that they might dishonor their bodies among themselves, they who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. What does it mean they exchanged the truth of God for a lie? In the likeness of the image of corruptible man and birds and quadrupeds and reptiles.</P>
<h5>"Pass from the creature to the Creator."</h5>
<P>And lest anyone of them should say: "I do not worship idols, but what idols signify," he immediately added: And they worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator. Understand prudently, beloved. For they either worship an idol, or a creature. He who worships an idol turns the truth of God into a lie. For the sea is the truth, but Neptune is a lie made by man, with the truth of God turned into a lie since God made the sea, but man made the idol of Neptune. Likewise, God made the sun, but man by making an idol of the sun turns the truth of God into a lie. But lest he says: "I do not worship an idol, but I worship the sun," let him hear what follows: They worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator. Therefore, having forsaken the Creator, they fell to the creature. And what is more shameful, they were not content even with that. For if they, having forsaken God, had worshiped what God made, they would be detestable. But how much more detestable are they, who even forsaking what God made, worship what craftsmen made? Having left the creature, you go to an idol, and when you try to defend yourself, confused by the idol, you return to the creature. Now indeed, to truly defend yourself, pass from the creature to the Creator. "But I cannot," he says, "reach Him except through these." Who says this? The learned one. Who says this? He who holds the truth of God in a lie. Who says this? He who, when he had known God, did not glorify Him as God or give thanks: not he who did not know, but he who did know.</P>
<h5>Of the necessity of a mediator between man and God.</h5>
<P>Of these proud ones who hold the truth of God in a lie, there are two kinds. Some have entrusted themselves to their own virtue, sought no helper, thinking their souls could be purified through philosophy, as if needing no mediator. But these matters are not to be discussed at the present. We are now dealing with the sacrilegious rites of pagans. However, they claimed that no sacrifices helped them. They say that Pythagoras was of such a kind. Let this boasting see what it promises itself about its own strengths! He who presumes upon himself presumes upon man. Who, however, will liberate the unhappy man from this body of death, except the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord, the only true mediator, God and man? If He were only man, He would not be a mediator; if only God, He would not be a mediator. But if He were not a mediator, He would not reconcile man to God, who had been far separated through iniquity. Therefore, these also hold the truth of God in a lie, because they presume upon themselves, while every man is a liar, nor is anyone liberated except through the confession of sins with an interposed propitiator. And these are not indeed seduced by sacrilegious rites, but in another way, that proud enemy of souls deceives them, making them like himself through the arrogance of human presumption, not seeking with humility Him from whom they fell by pride. Such were all to whom Christ was not revealed, even if they wished to be purified by no false rites. For to a soul that is unclean, it is a great impurity to think it can be purified by itself. But concerning those who worshiped no idols nor engaged in Chaldean or magical rites, it is not appropriate to speak hastily, lest perhaps it escapes us that the Savior may have been revealed to them in some way, without whom no one can be saved.</P>
<h5>"Without a mediator, no one can come to God."</h5>
<P>But there are others who, having seen or believed that there is a God to whom they must be reconciled and not presuming upon their own strength, wished to be purified by sacred rites. Yet, even they, swollen with vain curiosity and preferring themselves to others through the doctrines of demons, gave place to the devil through pride and believed they could be cleansed by the deceptions and empty mysteries of the powers of the air, that is, demons. The Apostle mentioned such people when he said: "They exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the likeness of corruptible man and birds and quadrupeds and reptiles." For some of them soared and, having transcended all creation, understood the Creator above all, but, remaining weak, they also grew proud in this. And now such people say to us, or those who follow their authority: "We cannot be purified except through these mediators," namely such powers. Therefore, they seek a mediator. Why? "Because the human mind, entangled and oppressed by its desires, needs purification. And unless it is purified, it does not take pleasure in the unchangeable, even if it can somewhat and in some way be seen." And indeed they rightly feel that no one can come to God without a mediator.</P>
<h5>What a mediator is and who it is.</h5>
<P>But what a mediator is, must be inquired. For there is a false mediator, and there is a true one. The false mediator, as we have often said, is the devil. He wrongly inserts himself among those who seek him and wish to be proud, performing certain signs and miracles. For the magicians of Pharaoh also did similarly to Moses, although they could not do everything, because they do only as much as the aerial spirits through whom they act allow. But God did as much as He pleased. Therefore, through certain signs, as I said, spirits insert themselves among the proud and promise them purification. However, the true mediator is the Lord Jesus Christ alone, whom the humble of old recognized through revelation, and desired to be purified through Him. Before He was born of Mary, He was revealed to those worthy, so that through faith in Him, who was to be born and suffer, they might be saved, just as we are saved through faith in Him who was born and suffered. Indeed, He came so humbly to show that He purifies and saves only the humble. For at that time, before the Word became flesh, He was revealed not only to the holy patriarchs and prophets among the Hebrew people but also examples are found among other nations. For, whoever sought humbly, lacked not the humble mediator, who alone reconciles to the Father, and alone truly said: No one comes to the Father except through me, accommodating to them His humility, so that those who persist in humility might deserve to be purified through Him, who is the humble mediator. Was Melchizedek of the people of Israel? Yet Scripture commends him as a priest of the Most High God in prefiguration of the mediator Himself. Indeed, Abraham was blessed by him. Was Job, such a great and strong man, a wrestler and victor against the devil, who, sitting in dung, full of worms, humbled himself and defeated him by whom Adam, in his pride, was defeated in paradise with an intact body, was this man of the people of Israel? And yet, in his words, the true mediator is understood to have been proclaimed and foretold. Just as the mediator mentions some, as enough to suffice, so it is to be believed that the revelation of the mediator came to all who sought purification, even before He appeared in the flesh, they who humbly sought the purging mediator, without whom no one is purified. No one, however, unless purified through the mediator, arrives at that which, even if it can be seen in part by some small part of the understanding of the soul, cannot be obtained except by the most purified. Therefore, even if some sought as the Apostle says, so that the invisible things of God might be understood through those that are made, but held the truth of God in falsehood, that is, they claimed to be wise and were puffed up with pride, not rightly honoring Him from whom they had received understanding, to such the proud mediator opposes himself to the proud, as He is humble to the humble, through certain congruities and through an ineffable and marvelous justice, remaining in the inner sanctums of God, which, though we cannot see, we honor. Therefore, the proud mediator meets the proud, the humble meet the humble; but the humble meet the humble so that they may be led to the height of God; the proud meet the proud so that He may shut off from them the height of God.</P>
<h5>Of the humble mediator and the proud mediator.</h5>
<P>For see how the devil interposes himself as a mediator. He is not mortal by flesh, but a sinner. The Lord, however, willed to be mortal by flesh, but not a sinner. He shared death with men, not sins. For if He were a sinner, He could not be a mediator. For if He were both mortal and a sinner, He would be what other men are, and would no longer be a mediator, but would need a mediator. For any man is a sinner and mortal. But God is just and immortal. The humble mediator is just, mortal, and not merely just, but just because He is God, mortal because He is man. The proud mediator, unjust and immortal: for he is not dissolved by body, because he is not clothed with flesh - in this respect, I call him immortal; for true immortality belongs only to God, as it is said: "Who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light," as the only-begotten Son is also immortal, because He and the Father are one, but He willed to be mortal by taking on manhood. Thus, the devil, unjust and immortal in a certain manner, interposed himself as a mediator to man, who is unjust and mortal. Two things below, two things above. But for the lowest things to be reconciled with the highest, a mediator is needed. What are the two things below? Unjust, mortal. What are the two things above? Just, immortal. Therefore, that mediator purifying and restoring, if He were also unjust and mortal, He would not be a mediator, not having one thing from below and one thing from above, but both from below: iniquity and mortality. Again, if He had immortality from above and iniquity from below, He would indeed have one thing from each, and thus He would seem to be a mediator, but not restoring, because not purifying. For having iniquity with man, He would be considered worthy of punishment with him, and thus be a mediator who obstructed the way to God. For sins do nothing but separate from God; listen to Scripture saying: "Has God weighed down His ear that He should not hear? But your sins separate between you and your God."</P>
<h5>Further on the two mediators.</h5>
<P>Therefore sins block the way; mortality, however, does not block the way, because mortality is the penalty of sin, coming from the judgment of God. That which deserved this penalty blocks the way. This we say: not what God made for you blocks the way to God, but what you did to yourself. For God made the mortality of the body for you, but you made sin yourself. That true and truthful mediator, therefore, shared with you what God made for you as a punishment, but he did not share with you what you did sinning. He shared with you mortality, but he did not share with you iniquity. For he was made in mortal flesh, yet he was not made by sin a debtor to death. For he emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, made in the likeness of men, and found in appearance as a man. This was said so that we do not think he was changed, but because he wanted to appear humbly and servilely, remaining in secret as Lord and God with God, the Son equal to the Father, through whom all things were made. Having therefore assumed mortality and participating with us in the infirmity of our punishment, he cleanses from sins and liberates from mortality itself: hence he is worthy who by dying killed death, because he suffered death undeservedly. This true and truthful mediator, the humble and exalted mediator, the mediator leading back to that from which we fell. But that proud mediator, the false and deceitful mediator, has iniquity in common with sinful men; however, he does not have the mortality of the flesh, and therefore he does not relieve their mortality, while he offers iniquity to be imitated, because, just as the iniquity of the first life deserved this death, so the persevering iniquity of this life merits eternal death. Indeed, the devil will suffer this along with those he deceives, for whom he now does not undergo mortality, which is carried out in the mortality of the flesh; and therefore he wants to be a mediator, because he has one thing in common with them—that is, iniquity—but he does not have the other—that is, mortality.</P>
<h5>To what the works of Christ the mediator aim.</h5>
<P>Therefore, the proud seduces the proud more because mortality offends the proud more than iniquity. Thus, they abhor the mortality in the humanity of Christ more than the iniquity in the pride of the devil. So, he leads those inflated by vain and false doctrines through some sacrilegious rites, promising purification in temples, and through magical consecrations and detestable secrets, drags them to astrologers, fortune-tellers, augurs, and haruspices. He dares to boast that he is stronger and greater than Christ because he was not born in the flesh from a woman, was not apprehended, was not scourged, was not spat upon, was not crowned with thorns, was not suspended on a cross, nor did he die and get buried: all these things the proud deride. The humble mediator assumed these, not taking on iniquity with men but taking on humanity to heal them from the swelling of pride, and make them victors over that false mediator. They would learn to confess their sins and be cleansed from their own injustice by Christ's righteousness, and through humble association with His mortality, reach the sublime height of immortality.</P>
<h5>"No one outside the Church promises you purification."</h5>
<P>Therefore, brothers, let us reject the malevolent mediator, the false and deceitful mediator, the mediator who does not reconcile but rather separates more and more. Let no one promise you any purification outside the Church, whether in temples or anywhere through sacrilegious rites; let no one promise anything outside of unity, even through Christian sacraments, because, although there is a sacrament outside of unity—which we cannot deny nor dare to violate—the power and salvation of the sacrament, making one a co-heir with Christ, is only in the unity and bond of peace of the Church. Let no one deceive you away from God, no one from the Church, no one from God the Father, no one from the Church the mother. That false mediator, transforming himself into an angel of light, and his ministers, transforming themselves into ministers of justice, wishes to separate you from God; if he cannot lead you to sacrilegious rites, he will want to separate you from the Church either to heresies or to schisms, so that by abandoning the mother you offend the Father. We had two parents who begot us mortally; we have two who beget us immortally: God and the Church. Those parents generated successors for themselves; these generate companions for themselves. To what end were we born to human parents, except to succeed the dead? However, by God the Father and the Church the mother, we are generated such that we live with our parents eternally. Whoever goes to sacrilegious rites or magical arts or consults astrologers, augurs, soothsayers, and the diabolic machinations of this world about his life or things pertaining to this life, is separated from the Father, although he does not leave the Church. But if anyone is separated from the Church by the division of schism, although he seems to keep the Father for himself, he most perniciously forsakes the mother. However, he who leaves both the Christian faith and the mother Church abandons both. Hold onto the Father, hold onto the mother. You are a child: cling to the mother. You are a child, suck the milk of the mother, and nourished by the milk, you will be led to the table of the Father.</P>
<h5>Christ the Lord has conquered our weakness.</h5>
<P>Your Savior took flesh, your mediator took flesh, and by taking flesh He took the Church. He anticipated, as if from the head, what He would offer to God, a priest forever and propitiation for our sins. The Word took on human nature, and the two became one, as it is written: They shall be two in one flesh. This is a great mystery, he says, but I speak of Christ and the Church. The bridal chamber of this marriage was the womb of a virgin. And He, as a bridegroom coming forth from His chamber, rejoiced as a giant to run His course. A giant because He is strong, conquering weakness with infirmity and killing death with death. However, He ran along the way; He did not stand on the way, so that He did not become the man signified as having stood in the way of sinners. For when the psalm says, Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, it denotes a certain one who stood in the way of sinners. Therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ ran in the way of sinners, but Adam actually stood in the way of sinners. And because he stood, he was wounded by robbers, fell, and lay down. But He saw the one who thus walked this way without standing, but running; He found the wounded, placed him on His animal, and gave him to the innkeeper, because He Himself ran the way to fulfill what was predicted of Him: He drank from the brook on the way, therefore He will lift up His head. For this world is a stream. Torrents of water are called those which flow due to sudden showers or winter rains or floods, surely quickly passing. Thus are all these temporal things: a torrent is passing, quickly about to cease. On this day, the first of January, those who rejoice in the luxuries and vanities of the world do not see the rush of the torrent carrying them away. Let them call, if they can, for a similar day of the previous year; let them at least recall yesterday. They do not see their joys passing like a torrent, so that afterwards they may say: These are those whom we once had in laughter and in the likeness of scorn. We foolish ones, we thought their life to be madness and their end without honor. How are they counted among the sons of God, and their lot is among the saints? Therefore, we have strayed from the way of truth, and the light of justice did not shine for us, and the sun did not rise upon us. Which sun? Not this visible one? To them, this one rises daily. For the Lord says about this: He makes His sun rise on the good and the evil. There is another who made this sun, invisible and intelligible, this sun of justice, of whom it is said elsewhere: The sun of justice rose for me. He did not rise for them. And listen to what they lament: What did pride profit us, and what did the boast of wealth bring us? All those things passed away, like a shadow. Like that torrent now has already flowed away; but nevertheless, He who was born, suffered, was crucified, buried, and rose again: from that stream on the way He drank, passing from here to the Father, with the faithfulness to follow for whom He drank from this stream on the way; therefore He lifted up His head, that is, Himself.</P>
<h5>Holy men profess Christ as the sole mediator.</h5>
<P>For the head of the Church is he himself, who has already ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father, showing us in his offering what we ought to hope for concerning our own flesh. For as the Apostle says: "For in hope we have been saved," and "we groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies." For we are adopted children, but he is the only begotten: in the beginning was the Word, God with God, as the evangelist bears witness, and equal to the Father, as the Apostle Paul says, yet he became humble so that he might be the one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. What an evil and false mediator is he who obstructs the way to God; all proud men strive to be like him: wherever they are, they want to be like their mediator. And just as you see among men, so also among angels. He who wished to be mediator and reconciler to God, of whom we have spoken much, that is, the humble and exalted Lord Jesus Christ, assumed every creature — for in man all is included: as we said above, creatures are either spiritual or corporeal — he therefore assumed all of man, taking the form of a servant; he assumed everything in the rational mind, everything in the soul, everything in the flesh, except for sin. Therefore, in him are all things, lest anyone err in seeking purification through another creature as mediator and purifier; hence the mediator has everything, hence the mediator assumed everything, for a creature as mediator can cleanse from iniquities and liberate from mortality, who does not presume to have any value in itself but clings personally and unitedly in an ineffable manner to the Word of God, so that it could be said: "The Word became flesh." His humility was scorned and exalted for this reason, lest humble men despair of themselves and the proud presume. Therefore, when proud men wish to be worshipped and, if God is preferred to them, become angry, they are imitators of that false mediator. Unlike humble holy men, who, when honored by erring men seeking to place their hope in a man, not heeding the divine Scripture saying: "Cursed is the man who trusts in man," grieve in their hearts and faithfully admonish, as much as they can, that hope should be placed in God, not in man, as even the Apostle did not wish hope to be placed in himself but in the truth he proclaimed. What was spoken through him was better than he through whom it was spoken, and he wished believers to place their hope in what was spoken through him, not in him through whom it was spoken. "Even if we," he says — and it is little if we; hear what follows — "or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed." He saw that a false mediator might transform himself into an angel of light and announce something false. Therefore, as proud men wish to be worshipped as God, arrogating whatever they can to themselves, wishing to be named and, if possible, to surpass Christ himself in glory, so do the devil and his angels.</P>
<h5>The Donatists place Donatus before Christ.</h5>
<P>My brothers, we speak to Catholics. They hold Donatus, the Donatist, as they do Christ. If they hear a pagan detracting from Christ, they perhaps suffer it more patiently than if they hear someone detracting from Donatus. You know what I am saying, and you are compelled to experience this daily. They love Donatus so perversely that they place him before Christ. Not only do they have nothing to say, but they even know they have nothing to say. For nothing holds them except the name of Donatus under the name of Christ; they have been seduced to the name of a man against Christ. This is why they have contracted the greatest hatred against us because we cry out to them: "Do not place your hope in a man, lest you be cursed." They hate those who preach peace, and if they suffer anything for their great crime - and not for Christ, but for Donatus - they think themselves martyrs; and because we say to them: "Do not blow away the baptism of Christ, love peace, return yourself to the world: Christ redeemed the whole world with His blood, do not reduce the buyer of everything to a part," for this reason, they hate us and, if given the chance, kill us by the hand of the Circumcellions. But since the Lord has helped, we have escaped, giving thanks to the mercy of the Lord. Therefore, we admonish and ask that you pray for us, that the Lord may always inspire in us the confidence to preach His peace, and that we do not fear them but rather love them and rejoice that what is written is fulfilled in us: With those who hate peace, I was peaceful; when I spoke to them, they fought against me without cause. And if they can be healed by no other way, let them fight against us, strike, kill, and yet be healed.</P>
<h5>Honor the angels and martyrs, worship God alone.</h5>
<P>But let us return, brothers, to what I had begun to say; for pain has carried me away from what I had intended. Just as there are proud men - who prefer to be worshiped rather than God -, so too proud angels prefer to be worshiped rather than God. And just as there are holy men - who prefer that God be worshiped rather than themselves -, so too all holy angels, which one must believe without any doubt also about the martyrs, prefer that God be worshiped rather than themselves. They want Him to be honored whom they honor, they choose to be loved in Him; they do not accept private honors from men, and even reject them. Hence also, as much as the Lord gave an example, we gave this example from that angel in Revelation, who did not want to be worshiped by a man, but God. Therefore do not be afraid, brothers, lest perhaps, if you worship only God with religious service, you offend some holy angel or some martyr. For if carnal prudence persuades you of this, measuring it from yourselves - if perhaps you are pleased to be honored by a certain private pride of arrogance, not in God nor for the sake of God, but in yourselves and for your own sakes, such that if it is not done, you become indignant -, so you think either the holy angels or the holy martyrs rejoice in such services of men and demand the service owed to God for themselves, you will be easily deceived by the pagans and entirely withdrawn from the Lord your God, from whom we have received such a command: You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve. Do you wish to securely honor the holy angels and holy martyrs? Worship Him in whom alone they wish to be honored. For if they are holy, they are angered with you if you worship them privately and not Him alone from whom they also received the grace of their beatitude. Because therefore they are holy, do not offend them by wanting to worship them separately. For by worshiping God, you worship all who cling to God with pious love and holy devotion. But if he gets angry because he himself is not worshiped with some private sacraments, he is already proud, a transgressor and false mediator, transforming himself into an angel of light. Now if he turns you aside to himself, he has blocked the way: not only can you not reach through him, but through him you are rather prevented from reaching.</P>
<h5>The sacrifice is not offered to any martyr or angel, but to the Lord of all.</h5>
<P>Do not let them sell you their empty rhetoric and say: "We honor the virtues of God, so that through them we may reach God, and we perform these rites for Saturn, these for Jupiter, these for Pluto, these for Neptune, these for Mars, these for Ceres." Therefore, indeed, not all rejoice in the same rites, because they arrogate private and personal cults to themselves; and by this fact, they are not sacred, but sacrilegious. And in all these things, their leader exults and triumphs, not so much in those rites as in the deception and error of men, delighting in malevolent arrogance. Therefore, let them not deceive you when they say to you: "If you honor the martyrs and believe that you are aided by them before God, how much more should we honor the virtues of God, through whom we are aided before God." Consider the sacraments of the Church and see whether a sacrifice is offered to any martyr, so that we offer one thing to this martyr and another to that one; but at all memorials we offer one thing, not to any of them, but to the Lord of all of us, in which sacrifice we also honor the martyrs according to their rank, not in themselves, but in Him through whom they conquered the devil. And they are the more mindful of us as we offer them less private veneration, because in the One in whom they alone have their joy, in Him alone do they have their honor. If anyone says to you: "Invoke the angel Gabriel this way, invoke Michael that way, offer this to one, that to the other," do not be deceived, do not consent; neither let him deceive you because the names of these angels are read in the Holy Scriptures: rather, consider how they are read there, whether they have demanded any private religious service from men and not rather that glory always be given to the one God to whom they are subject.</P>
<h5>Angels are ministers, acting what they are commanded to act by God.</h5>
<P>Not only if a man, but if anyone, like an angel or by some visitation or by a dream, tries to tempt you and says: "Do this for me, celebrate this for me, because I am an angel," for instance, "Gabriel," do not believe it. Worship securely the one God, who is Father and Son and Holy Spirit. Such worship pleases if it is an angel; but if he gets angry because you did not give anything outside, he is to be understood as the one about whom the Apostle says that he transforms himself into an angel of light: he wants to block the way, he intervenes wrongly; he is not a mediator reconciling, but rather separating. For that angel in the Apocalypse and others like him do not want themselves to be worshipped, but God. They are messengers, announcing what they have received to be announced; they are ministers, doing what they were ordered to do, bringing our prayers to God, not demanding those prayers themselves for God. The angel says to a man: I presented your petition in the sight of God's glory. However, he was not praying to the angel himself, and the angel was praying to God: the minister presented his prayer. Did he say, as do the perverse and corrupt ministers of some authorities: "Give me something, if you want me to deliver it, if you want me to admit you"? Our Lord does not have such a great house. His servants love him, his children love him. If you wish to corrupt any of them privately, so that you may be admitted to their Lord, you will be expelled far from that great house. For if they imitate angelic life - for it is written: "One soul and one heart is for God, and no one has anything of his own, but they have all things in common," as we read in the Acts of the Apostles that thousands of Jews had converted, to whom nothing was possessed as their own and was distributed to each as needed - if therefore these imitate angelic life, and if any of their friends, or brother or father or mother or any relative, wishes to privately offer something, not only do they reject it, but they also advise that, if it is to be offered and accepted, it should be offered to God, as they did who laid the prices of their goods at the Apostles' feet, as also those whom the Apostle encouraged to make some offering to the poor saints who were in Jerusalem - and this teaches, so that they know they are offering to God what they do -, how much more would those angels, surely more perfect, who in heavenly chambers and in the great house and the celestial city of Jerusalem, mother of us all, serve God with the most harmonious charity, wish no honor to be privately and personally shown to them, but they would be pleased with that honor alone which is shown communally to God as God, and to the very city as his temple, that is, to the whole Church.</P>
<h5>One true mediator: Christ the priest.</h5>
<P>And therefore, for the sake of purification, which is done through the mediator, he wanted to be the one mediator and himself become man, who is equal to the Father, so that through the related substance - which is man - we might reach the supreme substance - which is God. And so he descended, because we were in the lower places, and he ascended, so that we would not remain in the lower places. That one true mediator does not deceive anyone, who, although he is equal to the Father, also wanted to be lesser than him for our sake, not by losing what is equal, but by taking on what is lesser. He has already liberated our flesh in his own flesh. He no longer dies, and death will no longer have dominion over him. To him our prayers come, though in the sacraments of the Church they are directed to the Father. He no longer dies. For he himself, the High Priest, offers them, who offered himself as a holocaust for us. He is the one who leads us, placing himself between, not to obstruct but to direct; not to separate but to reconcile; not to hinder but to break the hindrances. He is the one high priest and one priest, who was prefigured in the ancient priests of God. Therefore a priest without bodily blemish was sought, because he alone lived without the stain of sin, even in a mortal body. For what was prefigured in their bodies, was manifest in his life. However, all of us bishops are called priests because we are set over others. Nevertheless, the whole Church is the body of that priest. The body belongs to its priest. For the apostle Peter also says to the very Church: Holy people, royal priesthood.</P>
<h5>Christ the King and Priest prefigured in the Old Testament.</h5>
<P>Then one priest was anointed, now all Christians are anointed. A king was anointed, a priest was anointed, others were not anointed. The Lord bore both roles, not in figure, but now in truth, both of king and priest. For this reason, in King David himself, from whose seed He was made according to the flesh, both were symbolized. He was a king, which we know and which is manifest. The role of the priest was also prefigured in him when he ate of the showbread, which was not lawful to eat except for the priests alone: which the Lord Himself also recalled in the Gospel, that He might be recognized by those who are able to understand that He was prefigured in David. For even Mary herself was descended not only from a royal line, but also from a priestly line. It is evident that she was from the royal line; thus, the Apostle says of the Lord Himself: Who was made for Him of the seed of David according to the flesh. Although His father is said to be Joseph by virtue of love, He was not born of his seed, as is declared in the Gospel. Therefore, it remains that Christ is called of the seed of David because of Mary, who was of the seed of David, that is, of the royal line. But how do we find the priestly lineage in Mary? It is written in the Gospel that Zechariah the priest had a wife, Elizabeth, from the daughters of Aaron. Therefore, Elizabeth was of the priestly line: for Aaron, Moses' brother, was a priest, and the whole tribe of Levi. But in the Gospel the angel says to the virgin Mary: Your relative, Elizabeth. Therefore, if Elizabeth, one of the daughters of the priest Aaron, was a relative of Mary, it is beyond doubt that the virgin Mary pertains not only to the royal but also to the priestly blood. Therefore, both roles, royal and priestly, are present in the Lord according to the man He assumed: royal, guiding us to every imitation of spiritual warfare, until He puts His enemies under His feet, and the last enemy, death, will be destroyed – for our king was also tempted by our enemy, so that as a soldier He might learn to wage war; and priestly, because to atone for and cleanse our sins He offered Himself as a burnt offering. Hence, formerly two were anointed in figure: the king and the priest.</P>
<h5>Of the loaves and fishes which Christ multiplied.</h5>
<P>Therefore, there were also two fish with those five barley loaves. For fish are related to the sauce: the dishes are usually seasoned with oil. Therefore, two fish with five loaves, that is, with the Old Testament, where the five books of Moses hold the preeminence. But with seven loaves, which are not called barley and already signify the New Testament, there are said to have been few fish because Christians had already begun to be few, that is, the anointed ones, from whom the entire Church throughout the whole world would be filled. For the five barley loaves signify, as if covered with layers, those things which are to be understood spiritually in the very law, which when unfolded, the Lord taught the apostles. Hence, twelve baskets of fragments are filled from the leftovers there. But the seven loaves signify the sevenfold operation of the Spirit in the New Testament, as John also says in the Apocalypse. For seven spirits are understood to be mentioned for seven spiritual operations, of which Isaiah had previously made mention: of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and strength, of knowledge and piety, and of fear of the Lord. And therefore, seven baskets of fragments are filled from those leftovers, by which the entire Church is signified by that number. Whence also the same apostle John writes to the seven churches. And in the epistles of the apostle Paul, the same number is found, not of epistles, but of churches. And many things sought diligently in those sacraments are found more sweetly. But now I have mentioned something of this on account of the anointing of the fish, so that I might show the royal and priestly person indicated at that time by the two fish, for two were then anointed, the king and the priest. From the chrism, Christ is named, that is, from the anointing. The body of Christ, however, is the Church. And therefore, all Christians are anointed, by a hidden sacrament to the rest, but known to the faithful. However, the priest alone is the mediator, the head of the Church without sin, through whom the cleansing of our sins is accomplished.</P>
<h5>Whether a bishop can be a mediator.</h5>
<P>Whence it came into my mind with great sorrow to remember that Parmenian, once a bishop of the Donatists, dared to assert in a certain letter of his that a bishop is a mediator between the people and God. You see that they set themselves up in place of the bridegroom, corrupting the souls of others with sacrilegious adultery. This is no slight audacity, and it would seem utterly unbelievable to me if I had not read it. For if a bishop is a mediator between the people and God, since there are many bishops, it would follow that many mediators are to be understood. Therefore, if the letter of Parmenian is to be read, let the letter of the Apostle Paul be erased, saying: "For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus." Now between whom is he a mediator, if not between God and his people? Therefore, between God and his body, since his body is the Church. That monstrous pride is thus apparent, which dares to appoint a bishop as a mediator, claiming the marriage of Christ with adulterous deceit. Let us see the friend of the bridegroom jealous for the bridegroom, not opposing himself in place of the bridegroom. Does he say: "I have betrothed you to myself"? He can say this who calls himself a mediator between the people and God, not he who says: "Was Paul crucified for you, or were you baptized in the name of Paul?" Not he who says: "For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus." Not he who says: "I have betrothed you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ." And therefore that adulterer who did not have a wedding garment was cast out of the wedding feast: for he did not have the garment in which he would honor the bridegroom, but through that habit sought his own honor in the bridegroom's feast.</P>
<h5>Christ was prefigured as mediator in the old sacraments.</h5>
<P>Therefore, we have one mediator, brothers, who is also our head. We, however, in the name of Christ, even if we are not prelates of the churches with you, still are with you as members of the body of Christ: we have one head, not many; for a body that wants to have many heads is already a monster. We were speaking about the anointing, that back then only the priest and king were anointed, but now all Christians. From this, see that you all belong to the priest’s body with us, that is, because you are all faithful. But especially those who are prelates of the Church are called priests, yet the rest of the body is not therefore not the priest’s body. And so in those old sacraments, because that one was prefigured, that is, our priest the Lord Jesus Christ, one priest entered the holy of holies; but all the people stood outside. Now, when bishops are assisting at the altar, are you outside, and do you not see, hear, attest, and receive inside? Back then one priest entered the holy of holies once a year. A year signifies the whole time. Thus, once in the whole time did our one priest, the risen Lord Jesus Christ, enter the true, not the figured, holy of holies, beyond the heavenly veils, offering himself for us. He entered, and he is there. But the people still stand outside with us: we have not yet risen to go to meet Christ and to remain always with him inside, when he will say to the good servant: Enter into the joy of your Lord. Therefore, this was prefigured back then by the one solitary priest entering the holy of holies, and the people standing outside, which is now fulfilled by our Lord Jesus Christ alone entering beyond the secrets of the heavens, and the people still groaning outside, saved in hope, awaiting the redemption of their bodies, which will be in the resurrection of the dead.

But nonetheless, we have a priest and high priest who intercedes for us in the holy of holies, sitting at the right hand of the Father, so that we do not fear in our pilgrimage if we do not stray from the way of truth, if we do not love another instead of him, but love each other in him, so that in every brother of ours walking in his ways, we look upon, honor, and receive him who was delivered up for our offenses and raised for our justification, for he speaks in his saints, as the Apostle says: Do you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me? And although he says: Neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but God who gives the growth, not because he wanted his own acknowledgment, but because he wanted him to be loved in himself, giving witness to some, saying: You received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus. Therefore, in all his saints he himself is to be loved, because he said: I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. For he did not say: "You gave to them," but: You gave to me; so great is the love of the head towards his body!</P>
<h5>Let us be secure because Christ prays for us.</h5>
<P>And so, because he himself is the mediator and priest entered alone into the Holy of Holies, but the Church - which is his body - still, as we said, groans outside in tearful prayers and laborious works, we do not find in ancient books that a priest commended himself to the people, to be prayed for, because he was prefiguring our Lord Jesus Christ, for whom no one prays. For whose figure was the priest, for whom no one prayed, except our Lord Jesus Christ who intercedes for us and does not need our prayers for himself? Which he also deigned to prefigure on this earth, when he prayed alone on the mountain, when the disciples were troubled by storms in the boat. And we, like in the boat, in the Church, are tossed by the storms of this world; but because he, as then on the mountain, so now in the heights of heaven intercedes for us, let us be secure.</P>
<h5>John commends the unique mediator, Christ.</h5>
<P>John the Apostle also says: These things I write to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: He is the propitiation for our sins. Look at who John is? The one who was reclining on the Lord's breast and drank from that breast at that feast so that he could pour forth for the people: In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Did that John then say: "And if anyone sins, you have me as an advocate with the Father: I pray for you"? See who says what. Not only did he not say this, but also if he had said: "And if anyone sins, you have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: He is the propitiation for your sins," it might have seemed proud and arrogant. He did not say this. And if he did not say this, with how much pride would he have said: "You have me as an advocate with the Father!"? With how much greater sacrilege would he have said: "You have me as a mediator with the Father!" to impose himself between sinners and God? And these people neither fear nor blush to say that a bishop is a mediator between God and men. Clearly, he is a mediator, but in the party of Donatus, not to guide but to exclude, as Donatus did: for he interposed his name to block the way to Christ. Therefore, they do not want to come to the Church because Donatus has blocked the way, because...<SUB>********</SUB> Through a whitewashed wall: earthly indeed, but not by Christian religion. He whitewashed to deceive.<SUB>I'm sorry, but there appears to be no text provided for translation.</SUB>And they could not pass even to Christ Himself, that is, to the body of Christ which is the Church spread throughout the entire world. Behold how He made Himself a mediator, just as that proud angel, of whom we have already spoken much. But consider what John says: I write these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father. He would not say "we have" unless he well knew and humbly commended himself. And He Himself, he says, is the propitiation for our sins. He did not say "your sins," as if making himself foreign to sins. For if he were to say this, it would be contradicted by himself in another place saying: If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</P>
<h5>Christ, the humble, makes the humble exalted.</h5>
<P>Therefore, brothers, strive not to sin, endeavor strongly not to sin. But if anyone does sin, he will cleanse us who is the expiation for our sins. Avoid all those evils through which the name of God is blasphemed, so that in your good conduct the glory of Christ’s name may gain others. Avoid as much as possible those things which can separate you from the altar of God. But the sins which creep in daily through the custom of daily life, and as if from the waves of the sea of this world through a certain weakness of ours they do not cease to enter, bailing them out with good works, lest you suffer shipwreck. Let these daily wounds be healed by the daily remedies of alms, fasting, prayers. Be zealous in all these good works, neither show to men what you do for your own glory nor avoid the eyes of those wishing to imitate, so that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father who is in heaven. Whatever you do, do everything to the glory of God, so that He who is humble and exalted may make us exalted from the humble. For thus our alms will reach Him, who became poor for us when He was rich, so that our fasts will reach Him, who fasted for us; thus our prayers will reach Him, and when in them we truly ask that our debts be forgiven, as we also forgive our debtors, just as He also forgave His debtors, saying on the cross: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." Blessed be He who granted you to be able to do what you do. For if you attribute to yourselves and arrogate to yourselves your good works, so that in those very sacrifices of humility pride inflates you, you will give place to that false mediator, so that he may interpose and block the way for you. For he seeks all entrances and through those very good works tries to creep in with serpentine slips. If he finds a man seemingly doing well and attributing to himself what he does and elevating himself with a certain pride over the one who does not do, he immediately opposes, to deceive as a mediator.</P>
<h5>All the faithful belong to the body of Christ the priest.</h5>
<P>But as I began to say, we do not find any priest in the old books who commended himself to the people to pray for him, because they prefigured Him for whom no one was going to pray, that is, our Lord Jesus Christ, who alone is the true mediator and priest, not prefigured. But truly the Apostle Paul, who knew he was from the body of the priest with the other members, commends himself to the prayers of the Church, because the members are solicitous for one another; and if one member is glorified, all the members rejoice, and if one member suffers, all the members suffer together. The Head intercedes for all the members, let the members under the Head intercede for one another. What then does the Apostle say? "Praying also for us," he says, "that God may open to us a door for the word." And the Church prayed for Peter when Peter was in chains, and it was heard, just as Peter also prayed for the Church, because the members pray for each other. They do not call themselves mediators and pray for those who want to be prayed for by them, and they call themselves mediators who, if they removed themselves from the midst, would make both one which wicked pride has divided. Therefore, let it be far from the hearts of Christians what is demonstrated in the pride of heretics! As we said to your charity, that former priesthood bore some figure: now what was then prefigured is fulfilled. We have a mediator and a high priest: He has ascended into heaven, He has entered into the inner sanctuary, in those true, not prefigured, holy of holies. The sacrament of this is celebrated in the Church: within you pray with us, to the words of the bishop you respond "Amen." Thus indeed the people as it were subscribe, because all pertain to the body of the priest. Therefore, let no one sell you, as they are accustomed to say, smoke: we have one mediator, the Lord Jesus Christ; He Himself is prayer, He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; confidently hold on to Him.</P>
<h5>Let Christians pray for pagans deceived by a false mediator.</h5>
<P>For you see, brothers, so that we might now return to what I was saying against the pagans, how you are fortified so that not only are you not overcome by them, but - as much as possible through your efforts - you may win them over to salvation, and pray and fast for them, so that they may know God and honor Him as He should be honored, not like the Apostle says about some: because, when they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God nor gave thanks, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was darkened, that they might seek a superstitious and sacrilegious pollution in the name of purification. For wanting to cling to that which always is, which is always of such kind, remains unchangeable, which they were able to grasp with sharp intellect in some way, but did not wish to honor with a humble heart, they fell into that false mediator, who envies the human soul and tries by all means to prevent it from passing from the labors in which he dominates to the rest where he would be superior to him, to whom belong all sacrilegious rites and the most deceitful machinations of mathematicians, sorcerers, haruspices, and Chaldeans.</P>
<h5>Pagans do not wish to come down from the swelling of their pride.</h5>
<P>But you, my brothers, who perhaps do not see with the mind's eye what they saw, and are not yet able to transcend with the thought of the mind the whole creation, not only corporal but also spiritual, and to see the unchangeable God by whom and through whom and in whom all things were made, do not be anxious, do not despair, for He who willed to descend even to the lowliest and weakest made Himself the way for you. For what does it benefit them that they see the homeland from afar while being proud? They do not find the way, because the way to that lofty homeland begins from humility. They, as if from a mountain of pride, see the homeland, from an opposite mountain they see it. But no one ascends to it, unless he first descends. They do not wish to descend, so that they may ascend; that is, they do not wish to be humble, so that they may be Christians. When they say to themselves, "And will I be this which my doorkeeper is, and not rather what Plato was, what Pythagoras was?" with rash words puffing up vanities, they do not wish to descend, they cannot ascend. For our Lord descended to us from the height of His majesty, and they do not wish to descend to Him from the swelling of their pride. He therefore descended, that He might choose the weak things of the world to confound the strong, and the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and the lowly and despised things of the world he chose, and things which are not as though they were, so that he might bring to nothing things that are.</P>
<h5>Christ teaches us humility by words and deeds.</h5>
<P>For this reason, He wished to become man, that God made man might teach humility, not by changing Himself into man but by assuming man. Nothing seemed to be able to be added to this humility, and yet He did not choose those human things about which men exult. He did not choose noble parents or those endowed with some dignity. For He wished to be born of a woman who was betrothed to a craftsman, so that no one might boast arrogantly about noble parentage and be incurably inflated against the justice of the poor and humble. He did not choose at least a noble city in which to be born – Bethlehem is a small town –: He was indeed from there, of the tribe of David. However, in this tribe, as in others, there were many poor and humble. And David himself, from whose seed according to the flesh the Lord Jesus Christ was made, wasn't he tending sheep before he was divinely chosen for kingship? Even then, He had chosen the ignoble things of the world so that the noble might be confounded, and in him was prefigured what would be fulfilled through his seed. Therefore, He chose also a humble family from which to be born. {But perhaps someone might say: "Even if He was born humbly, He wanted to boast in the nobility of His disciples." He did not choose kings, or senators, or philosophers, or orators. Rather, He chose commoners, the poor, the unlearned, fishermen. Peter was a fisherman, Cyprian was an orator. Unless the fisherman had faithfully preceded, the orator would not have followed humbly. Let no one who is despicable despair of himself: let him only hold to Christ, and his hope will not be false.}</P>
<h5>Let us hold the way of humility, lest we fall into false mediators.</h5>
<P>For those who, as I began to say, see the homeland from afar and from the contrary mountain of pride, spurn humility: therefore, they do not hold to the way. For our way is humility. Christ showed this in Himself. If anyone deviates from this way, he will come to a perplexing and inextricable mountain interposing itself, into the devil interposing perniciously and deceitfully as a mediator through innumerable sacrilegious rites, through soothsayers, augurs, diviners, astrologers, magicians. For those devoted to these do not descend to the way, but wander on a certain wooded mountain, from which some of them lift their eyes and see the homeland, but they cannot reach it because they do not hold to the way. But those who already hold the way, that is, the true and truthful mediator, the mediator who leads and does not obstruct, the mediator who purifies and does not entangle, persistently walk in what they hold. For some of them see the homeland, some do not. But let those who do not yet see the homeland not depart from the way, and they will arrive where those who see it already do. For the sharpness of sight in some is such that they can see from afar. It benefits them nothing to see where they are going but not know the way. But if they know the way, it is not so useful to them to see from afar where they are going, as it is to know where they are heading. However, those who do not have such sharpness, if they walk together, will arrive together. Whoever among you can transcend all creation in mind and see the ineffable light of wisdom, when he sees it, will see it cannot be spoken, and will see that all that is spoken from there is unworthy of its greatness, although fitting for the little ones who are nurtured to hear as it can be spoken, until they hear what cannot be spoken. But those who cannot transcend creation and see the ineffable truth, let them hold to the mediator, whom even those who already see something unchangeable must hold to, lest they see in vain. In Him, we have the bodily creation, which He also took in flesh; in Him also the spiritual creation, for there is the soul, there is the rational mind; in Him, the Word itself through which all things were made, because the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Holding this way, let us not deviate from it, lest we come upon false mediators who promise us purification and bring us impediments.</P>
<h5>Let us not think that the Word of God is far from human nature.</h5>
<P>For he alone is the mediator, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, who is the head of all principality and power; through what we hold, he leads us to what we ought to hold. For nothing holds a man so much as human affection. Therefore, he, God and man, through what we hold, carries us over to what is to be held. Indeed, so that man might not consider that he is far from human nature, that Word of God through which all things were made<SUB>Sorry, but I can't help with that request.</SUB>However, to approach the heavenly or super-heavenly virtues, and hence for himself to wish them to become mediators and purifiers at that word, and thus through pride and vain curiosity he would fall into the airy powers which, through various and multifarious errors, deceive the senses of human weakness, envying the passage to God and desiring to dominate those captured, for this reason, the Word itself through which all things were made became flesh, that is, it also joined to itself the carnal nature from man, so that man might learn that it was not distant from his own nature, which he thought to approach only through heavenly beings, and through a recognized middle way, purified, might adhere to unchangeable divinity. Therefore, he also deigned to perform earthly and heavenly miracles, to show that even those were subject to him, by which men might be terrified by signs and lying wonders. He also showed that every spiritual power either fears Christ or loves Christ, so that what fears Christ might not be feared by a Christian, and what loves Christ might be loved in Christ.</P>
<h5>The Christian serves one God and gives honor to Him.</h5>
<P>Therefore, dearest brothers, do not be frightened by men when they say that those powers of the elements, necessary for this life and the temporal things which are necessary for our uses, must be appeased and honored by their sacraments: neither do they have any power in these matters, except insofar as they are permitted from above. Remember that holy Job could not have been tested by such great temptations unless the tempter had received power from the Lord God. And take heed of the Apostle who says: "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation make a way of escape, that you may be able to bear it." Also, consider those who presume upon such things and bind their souls of light with the sacrilegious sacraments of demons and magical arts, how freely they lose their salvation. For they do not avoid the sufferings common to other men, nor do they not suffer even worse things with the torment of a bad conscience: losses, diseases, condemnations, deaths, often from the common scourge of humanity, often also for their own deeds. Consider if those who worship Neptune sail more successfully than those who do not worship him; if those who are bound to the temple of Earth have more fertile fields than those who are held by no such superstition; if the women who worship Juno give birth with less pain or danger than the Christian women who detest her; if those who worship Mercury are shrewder than those who laugh at such fictions, or because he is said to be the god of merchants, if those who sacrifice to him make more profits than those who contaminate themselves with no such sacrilege. And thus, in all these temporal benefits, guide the prudent eye of the mind: you will find everything governed under the most high power of God, to whom alone a Christian serves, holding fast to the way mediated for us, not caring for the deceptive allurements and terrors of vanity, giving honor to the truest God whether his temperance is tested by temporal prosperity or his courage by adversities, for God is faithful, who will not suffer us to be tempted above what we are able, but with the temptation will also make a way of escape that we may be able to bear it, consoling us in all things and filling us with the joy of good hope, until He leads us to where the way, which He has deigned to provide for our weakness, leads. Turned to, etc.</P>
