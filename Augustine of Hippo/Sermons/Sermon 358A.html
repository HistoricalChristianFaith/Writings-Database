Dearly beloved, let us rejoice in the Lord, no matter how great the sadness of this time. Since he who has endured to the end will be saved; with continual prayers let us strive to remain firm, so that we may arrive safely in the presence of our King.</H3>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>TREATISE OF SAINT AUGUSTINE ON THE GOOD OF MERCY</B></P><P ALIGN="CENTER"> </P>
<H5>True mercy makes us participants in the pain of another.</H5>
<P>We wish to admonish your holiness about the good of mercy: although we have often experienced that you are inclined toward every good work, it is still necessary to have a focused conversation about this matter. Therefore, we discuss, what is mercy? It is nothing other than a certain contracted misery of the heart. It is called mercy from the sorrow for the miserable: both aspects, misery and heart, resonate there. Therefore, when someone else's misery touches and strikes your heart, it is called mercy. Thus, pay attention, my brothers, all good works, which we perform in life, pertain to mercy. For example, you offer bread to the hungry: offer it from the heart with mercy, not out of contempt; do not treat another person like a dog. Therefore, when you perform an act of mercy, whether you offer bread, feel the sorrow of the hungry: if you give a drink, feel the sorrow of the thirsty: if you offer clothing, feel the sorrow of the naked: if you receive someone into your home, feel the sorrow of the stranger: if you visit the sick, feel the sorrow of the ill: if you bury the dead, feel the sorrow of the dead: if you reconcile the contentious, feel the sorrow of the quarrelsome. All these acts, if we love God and our neighbor, we do with heartfelt sorrow. These are the good works that confirm us as Christians. For the holy Apostle says: While we have time, let us do good to all. And what else does he say about this good work in the same place? He introduced the seed, he promised the harvest.</P>
<H5>Works of mercy will not be in heaven. Like a farmer, the seed must now be sent into the ground.</H5>
<P>But when you sow, because you perform a work of mercy, while you grieve for the one to whom you do it, you sow in tears. Nonetheless, there will come a time after our end when these seeds of mercy will no longer be necessary; for in that kingdom, those who here were distressed for God will no longer be miserable. But indeed, in that recompense, to whom will you offer bread when no one is hungry? Whom will you clothe naked, where all are clothed in immortality? To whom will you provide lodging, when all live in their homeland? Whom will you visit sick, where eternal health prevails? Whom will you bury dead, where everyone lives forever? Whom will you reconcile when there is complete peace that is promised here? Therefore, there will be no works there, no mercy needed. Why? Because you already carry the rewards, you do not scatter seeds. Therefore, let us not falter: we sow in tears, that is, with labor and sorrow. Thus, do not grow weary in the work of mercy: for you will receive the reward of your sowing. Winter sows in labor: but if the harshness of winter sometimes frightens the farmer, would he not cast into the ground the fruit purified with so much toil? He proceeds, and casts into the ground what he has gathered from the ground, what has been purified from the ground: he proceeds, and casts into the ground, trembling with cold, yet diligent. Whence comes such diligence in the cold? Faith and hope expel laziness. Does he see the harvest? But he believes it will rise. Does he already collect the fruits? But he hopes he will gather them; and he encourages himself with this faith, this hope, so that with great toil in the cold, he may sow the seed in the ground, and with God granting according to the work of his labor, he may confidently gather abundant fruits.
