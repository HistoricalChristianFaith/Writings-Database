<H5>God was made man, not God changed into man.</H5>
<P>He received from us what is vile, He gave to us what is great; He received our evil, He gave to us His good; He received death, He gave to us life; He received here insults, He gave to us honor; He received here the cross, He gave to us rest. How great are the evils He received here! How great are the goods He gave to us! Therefore our Lord Jesus Christ became the Son of Man; yet God became man, not God changed into man, but remaining in Himself perfect God, and changed into nothing worse; taking man to be changed in Him for the better, not for the worse in Him. And the rest.</P>
