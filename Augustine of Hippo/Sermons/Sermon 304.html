<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>On the Solemnity of Lawrence the Martyr</B></P>
<H5>The duty of deacons is to administer the blood of Christ. The mystery of the Lord's Supper, that we may lay down our lives for him whose blood we take.</H5>
<P>The Roman Church today commemorates the triumphal day of the blessed Lawrence, on which he trampled down the raging world, spurned its flattery, and in both ways conquered the persecuting devil. How glorious and adorned with so great a multitude of virtues, like a variety of flowers, is the crown of the martyr Lawrence, the whole of Rome bears witness. For in that Church, as you are accustomed to hear, he performed the office of deacon. There he ministered the sacred blood of Christ; there for the name of Christ he shed his own blood. He prudently approached the table of the Powerful One. To that table, of which the proverbs of Solomon spoke to us just now, where it is written: "If you sit down to eat at the table of the powerful, consider well what is set before you, and so extend your hand, knowing that similar things you must prepare for yourself." This mystery of the supper the blessed apostle John clearly explained, saying: "As Christ laid down his life for us, so we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers." Saint Lawrence understood this, brothers; he understood and he did it: and indeed, just as he received from that table, he prepared such things. He loved Christ in his life, he imitated Him in his death.</P>
<H5>We all must follow Christ.</H5>
<P>And so, brothers, if we truly love, let us imitate. For we will not be able to render a better fruit of love than the example of imitation; for Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example that we should follow in His footsteps. In this sentence, the Apostle Peter seems to have seen that Christ suffered only for those who follow His footsteps, and that the passion of Christ benefits nothing except those who follow His footsteps. The holy martyrs followed Him, to the point of shedding their blood, to the point of the likeness of His passion: the martyrs followed, but not alone. For after they passed, the bridge was not cut; nor was the fountain itself dried up after they drank. For what is the hope of the faithful who lead the yoke of marriage chastely and harmoniously under the marital covenant, or who tame the enticements of the flesh under widowhood, or who, even more boldly raising the pinnacle of holiness and flowering in new virginity, follow the Lamb wherever He goes? What hope, I say, is there for them, and for all of us, if only those who shed their blood for Him follow Christ? Will the Mother Church then lose her children, whom she has conceived more fruitfully, and more securely, in times of peace? Should persecution be prayed for, should temptation be prayed for, so that she does not lose them? Far be it, brothers. For how can one pray for persecution, who cries out daily: “Lead us not into temptation?”</P>
<P>The Lord's garden has, brothers, not only the roses of martyrs but also the lilies of virgins, and the ivy of married people, and the violets of widows. Indeed, beloved, let no type of human being despair of his calling: Christ suffered for all. Truly it is written of him: He who wants all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</P>
<H5>In which it is permitted to follow Christ, except in martyrdom. His humility must be followed. Vengeance, by Christ's example, must not be sought. Present things must be despised.</H5>
<P>Let us understand, therefore, beyond the shedding of blood, beyond the danger of suffering, how a Christian ought to follow Christ. The Apostle says, speaking of the Lord Christ: "Who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God." What majesty! But He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and being found in appearance as a man. What humility! Christ humbled Himself: you, Christian, have something to hold onto. Christ became obedient: why are you proud? How far did Christ become obedient? As far as the incarnation of the Word, as far as participation in human mortality, as far as the threefold temptation by the devil, as far as the mocking by the Jewish people, as far as the spitting and the bonds, as far as the slaps and the scourges; if that is little, even to death; and if some kind of death must still be added, even the death of the cross. We have such an example of humility, a remedy for pride.</P>
<P>Why then do you swell with pride, O man? O decaying flesh, why do you stretch yourself? O foul discharge, why do you inflate yourself? You pant, you grieve, you burn with anger because someone has wronged you. From this you demand vengeance, with a dry throat you seek retribution; nor do you cease from this intent until you have avenged yourself on the one who has hurt you? If you are a Christian, wait for your king: let Christ first avenge himself. For he has not yet been avenged, who suffered so greatly for you. And surely that majesty could either suffer nothing or be avenged immediately. But since there was such power in him, therefore there was also such patience: because it was for us that he suffered, leaving us an example so that we might follow in his footsteps. You do see, beloved, that besides the shedding of blood, besides chains and prisons, besides scourges and hooks, there are many ways in which we can follow Christ. Then, having passed through this humility and conquered death, Christ ascended into heaven: let us follow him. Let us hear the Apostle saying: "If you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God; set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth." Whatever enjoyable things the world offers from temporal matters, let it be spurned; whatever harsh and terrible things it rages, let it be despised. And whoever acts in this way, let him not doubt that he clings to the footsteps of Christ, so that he may rightfully dare to say with the Apostle Paul: "Our conversation is in heaven."</P>
<H5>True and unconquered virtue is charity.</H5>
<P>But then there can be invincible virtue in these, if there is no feigned charity. Therefore, he who spreads charity in our hearts gives us true virtue. For how would blessed Lawrence not fear the external fires placed upon him, unless the flame of charity burned within him? Therefore, my brothers, the glorious martyr did not fear the fierce flames of the torments on his body, because he burned with the most ardent desire for heavenly joys in his mind. Compared to the fervor with which his heart burned, the external flame of the persecutors was cold. For how would he bear so many stings of pains, unless he loved the joys of eternal rewards? Finally, why would he despise this life unless by loving a better life? And who can harm you, says the Apostle Peter; who, he says, can harm you if you will be lovers of good? Even if a persecutor does harm to you, do not fail in loving good. For if you truly love what is good with all your heart, you will endure all evil patiently and equanimously. For what harm did those torments inflicted by the persecutors do to blessed Lawrence, except that they made him clearer through the very punishments, and made this day most festive for us from his precious death?</P>
