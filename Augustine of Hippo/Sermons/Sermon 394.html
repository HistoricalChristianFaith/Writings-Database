<H5>Perpetua and Felicitas one solemnity.</H5>
<P>Two gems have shone today in the Church, and one brightness: because Perpetua and Felicitas share one festivity; nor can it be doubted about Felicity, which possesses perpetual dignity. The custody of the prison joined them, grace also joined them: because there is no discord between them. They sang together in prison, they went together to meet Christ in the air; they fought together against the cow, they will enter together into the eternal homeland; they bore martyrdom together; one nursed, the other gave birth. Perpetua said when she handed over her infant and removed the nursing one: Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Felicitas, groaning from childbirth, followed her companions fearlessly; and after being freed by groaning, what did she say to Christ? You have broken my chains; I will offer you the sacrifice of praise. And blessed David, to console her groaning, said: May the Lord give you according to your heart, and confirm all your plans. Oh frailty! The darkness was fleeing, and the human condition was not passing. But He who conquered death, both delivered her from the danger of childbirth, and lifted the burden of nursing from Perpetua. For when they ascended the steps of that ladder, and trod the deceitful necks of the dragon, they came to the verdant garden of heavenly meadows, and found there the Good Shepherd laying down his life for his sheep, and seeking the milk from His flock. For, it is said, the shepherd was seated, young and old, green in age, white in hair, who does not know old age. The youth in his countenance was shining, because he himself is the same, and his years will not fail. His head was whitening, because the just Lord loved justice, and acknowledged equity in the Martyrs. Around him, inclined sheep were resting, he milked them with a pastoral finger, in which he found an abundance of milk and a fertile conscience of piety. He milked with his fingers and addressed them with paternal consolations, with prepared heavenly promises, saying: Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. And he showed them vessels of milk foaming with a pure heart through clear almsgiving, and said: I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink. Perpetua received new milk from the sweet shepherd before she shed her precious blood. They answered: Amen, and began to seek piety. They prayed in prison, secure now of the shepherd. O Lord, they said, let not our confession be barren, so that we also may be worthy to be joined with your precious flocks, and not be separated from your martyrs. In a vision, the arena was set before them in the amphitheater with pompous sand. There is that Egyptian, who was in heaven Lucifer in beauty: he, about to fight, wallows in the dust, and Perpetua, about to triumph with the Lord the Savior, extended her hands on the cross, having before her the Lordâ€™s defender. She received triumph from victory, and obtained the branch from the crown. Let us also offer our gifts to them: others at the time were offering the visits of the prison; let us offer them the vow of solemnity, that we may be worthy of the kingdom with all the saints.</P>
