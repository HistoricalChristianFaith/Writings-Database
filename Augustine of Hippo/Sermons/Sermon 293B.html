<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>On the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist</B></P>
<H5>The morning discourse had preceded about the Word and the voice.</H5>
<P>Today we celebrate the birth of a great man: and do you want to know how great? No one, says Scripture, has arisen greater among those born of women. The one born of a virgin said this about him; this testimony he gave to his witness; this sentence the judge pronounced about his proclaimer; thus the Word wanted to honor his voice, as you know and have heard today even in the morning sermon.</P>
<H5>The voice does not beget the word, but makes it appear. As the word grows in the heart, the voice fails in the ear.</H5>
<P>The Word is Christ, the voice is John, since it is written about Christ: In the beginning was the Word. But when John spoke about himself, he said: I am the voice of one crying out in the desert. The Word pertains to the heart, the voice to the ear. When the voice strikes the ear, and the word does not reach the mind, it has an empty sound, but does not bear useful fruit. However, for a word to be born in my heart, it does not need a voice; but for what is already born in my heart to be carried to your heart, the ministry of the voice is required. Therefore, the word can precede the voice, but it cannot proceed without the voice. The voice is created not to produce a word that did not exist, but so that what existed and was hidden may appear. Therefore, let us see what we have said about the word and the voice in Christ and John. Seek Christ. In the beginning was the Word. Where was it? And the Word was with God. In the beginning, with God. How much before us! How much above us! And the Word was made flesh, to dwell among us. And how would we know this if we did not hear the voice? For Christ was walking among people, clothed in mortal flesh; and yet people came to John, and said to him: Are you Christ? But he, to prove that he was the voice, pointed out the Word which preceded; he repelled undue honor, pointing to Christ with his finger. For when they said, are you Christ, John replied: Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who takes away the sin of the world. Hear Him, recognize Him; I precede Him, I announce Him. Remember what he said: I am the voice of one crying out in the desert, prepare the way of the Lord; not for me, but for the Lord. For when I cry out, I announce Him, for the voice of the herald is announcing the advent of the Judge. But when He comes, whom I announce, and rests in your heart, He must increase, but I must decrease. For you know, beloved, that when the word, taken by the help of the voice, flows through the paths of the ears into the region of the heart, that word increases in the heart, while the voice fades in the ear. For the sound that strikes the ear does not remain, as the infinite word remains because it descends into the mind. Why is this? Because He must increase, but I must decrease.</P>
<H5>Christ grew, but John was diminished.</H5>
<P>John baptizes, and Christ baptizes too. It was said to John: Upon whom you see the Spirit descending as a dove and remaining upon him, he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit and fire. You know this, brothers; it happened when Christ was baptized: and behold, now throughout the whole world he is the one who baptizes. The baptism of Christ has grown everywhere; but the baptism of John, though it has a mystery in remembrance of the past, does not have a ministry in present celebration. The baptism of John has ceased; the baptism of Christ has grown. This is why he says: He must increase, but I must decrease. We find this saying in the births of both and in their passions. Although John the Evangelist says of John the Baptist: There was a man sent from God, whose name was John: he came as a witness, to bear witness about the light; although they came to bear witness to the light, today he was born, brothers, when the night grows, and the day begins to diminish; but Christ was born at the winter solstice, as you know, when the losses of night begin to transfer into the gains of light; because we were once darkness, but now are light in the Lord. Why were they born this way? Because he must increase, but this one must decrease. Even in their passions, John is beheaded by the sword, Christ is exalted on the wood; one is raised, the other is laid low; one is diminished by decapitation, the other extends to grow. He must increase, but this one must decrease. Not without reason, I think, are the ages chosen in their parents; for John is born of an elderly woman, Christ of a young virgin; one from despised barrenness, the other from untouched virginity; finally, one from a growing youth, the other from declining old age.</P>
<H5>Each was announced by an angel.</H5>
<P>What is his worth, my brothers, the dignity of this man, that an angel announced his birth to his parents just as he did for the Lord Christ? Why did he merit this? Because no one born of women has risen greater. As you know, the angel Gabriel was sent to the priest Zechariah, Gabriel was sent to the Virgin Mary; he promised a son to each, and received a response from each. Zechariah responded to the angel who promised a son: "How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is barren, and advanced in years." And Mary responded: "How will this be, since I do not know a man?" Both despair of the law of nature: still, I believe, they did not know, with the gift of God's grace, the law of nature would cease. Therefore both respond with doubt; yet he is punished, she is blessed. To him it is said: "Behold, you will be mute"; to Mary it is said: "Blessed are you among women." Zechariah loses his voice; Mary conceives the Word. After this, the Word becomes flesh in the Virgin, and the voice is born from silence; John, born, returns his father's voice; the speaking father names his son. Everyone marvels, everyone is amazed, and whispering among themselves, they say to one another: "What do you think this child will be?" Now let us speak of the Gospel. For the hand of the Lord was with him. What do you think he will be, who began in this way? He is yet so small, and already so great. And if this one, who now begins, will be great, what will he be who always was? He, whom John recognized while still enclosed in the secret of the maternal womb, and because he could not yet with voices, greeted with movements; what then will he be? Do you want to know what he will be? I will say briefly, listen to the Prophet: "He himself, he says, will be called the Lord of all the earth."</P>
<H5>Against the remnants of the old superstition persisting on this day.</H5>
<P>Therefore, celebrating with festive gatherings the birthday of the blessed John the Baptist, a great man, let us request the aid of his prayers. For since he is the friend of the bridegroom, he can also grant us the favor of belonging to the bridegroom, so that we may merit finding his grace. But if we wish to find his grace, let us not offend on his birthday. Let the remnants of irreverences cease, let the pursuits and places of vanities cease; let those things not be done which are wont to be done, not indeed now in honor of demons, but yet still according to the manner of demons. Yesterday, after evening, the whole city was ablaze with unclean flames; smoke had covered the entire air. If you give little heed to religion, at least consider the shared offense. We know, brothers, that these things are done by boys; but elders should have forbidden them. For one says: He who does not prevent sin, when he can, commands it. Indeed, brothers, in the name of the Lord the Church progresses year by year; these things are diminishing, and surely every lessening tends to nothing; but they are not yet so consumed that we can securely remain silent. Nor shall we be able to remain silent, unless antiquity and novelty come to their proper ends; that the old superstition be ended, and the new religion be perfected. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom is honor and glory with God the Father Almighty, and with the Holy Spirit for ever and ever. Amen.</P>
