<H5>The lights placed in the firmament are interpreted allegorically.</H5>
<P>The evangelists are luminaries, the firmament of God's Scripture. The Gospel, which has testimony from the Law and the Prophets, is the luminaries in the firmament of heaven. However, a little one in the Church cannot yet grasp solid food, but is content with milk, which signifies the lesser luminary and the stars. Therefore: The greater luminary for ruling the day, the lesser luminary for ruling the night. As long as men are carnal and cannot comprehend that wisdom by which all things are made, they are in the night: but He did not abandon the night; He provided faith. God did not abandon the night; He gave it His luminaries. The day seeks the sun, the sun suffices for it; the moon and the stars are given to the night, they illuminate it; and when the moon does not shine upon the earth, the light that is in the air comes from the stars. Hence, we go outside at night and see trees; and if we do not discern them clearly, we still see the light of the stars somewhat; thus, when the clouds are thick, the light of the stars is taken away, and man under the open sky is as if he were inside a room. Therefore, even the night has its own light. Let us see what the Apostle says about these gifts, these spiritual gifts: "To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for common good." How is it given? Indeed, to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge. Whoever understands the difference between the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge understands the difference between the greater luminary and the lesser luminary. Let us hear the word of Wisdom: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; He was in the beginning with God," and so forth. Those who comprehend, it is day for them, the sun shines for them; but if they did not come first from the night, they did not come to the light: "Darkness was over the face of the abyss, and God said: 'Let there be light.'" No one should say that light began as such. For we all are justified from sinners. Therefore, let those who can, grasp what I have said about the Gospel. But they say to me: We did not understand what "In the beginning was the Word" means. Therefore, if it is still night for you, consider that the Word assumed flesh and made for you as if a night-time light: "The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us." And God speaks through an angel in the bush to Moses. Listen to where the word of Wisdom is. Moses said: "What is your name? How do I proclaim you to the people? If it is said: Who sent you? What should I say?" Hear the word of Wisdom: "You shall say to the children of Israel: 'He who is has sent me to you.'" Who can grasp "He who is"? The things that are not. Who truly is? He who does not pass away, who always remains immutable. But this is the food of the mature, this is the sun of the day. And as if Moses said to Him: I am still night, illuminate the night, let me say something that the night can grasp, let me say something the little ones can retain: "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." Therefore: "I am who I am" for the power of the day, "I am the God of Abraham" for the power of the night. Faith temporally administered shines in the night; wisdom eternally abiding shines in the day. It nourishes in the night so that we may proceed to the day. Thus, the other gifts are the stars. For when he said: To some is given the word of wisdom, as if the sun to the power of the day; to others is given the word of knowledge, as if the moon to the power of the night; he also gives stars: to others gifts of healing, to others prophecy, and so on.</P>
