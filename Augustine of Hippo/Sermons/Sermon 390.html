<H5>The counsel of the Lord must be followed so that riches are stored in heaven.</H5>
<P>To engage in almsgiving, we wish, as much as the Lord grants, to exhort your Charity, which are accustomed to be companions of fasting in holy faithful men, so that to one who does not have may be added what is taken from one who has; so that, when you defraud your soul for your gain, you take away from the flesh what you establish in heaven. For you have a storehouse there, you have your guardian. For where do people most safely place what they love on earth? They hire the most fortified places for themselves and strive as much as they can to keep it safe from thieves. And while they wish for and keep this, when can it be securely on earth? Perhaps the guardian himself will be the thief. The Lord Jesus Christ, observing what people want and attempt when they keep their things on earth, gave advice: “Store in heaven, commend to me.” Therefore, He who commanded you to give did not want you to lose, but to migrate. Let your belongings go ahead, for you will follow. What you do not send ahead to where you will not be for long, where someone else could possess what you saved after you, you do not know. Therefore lift what you love from here, lest you cling to it by loving it here and lose it by clinging to it, and perish. Your Lord Himself is your guardian and the guardian of your possessions. If perhaps a close friend advised you on preserving grain, to lift it from lower to higher places where it would be better guarded, wouldn’t you take his advice? Your Lord gives you such advice: He doesn’t want you or your possessions to perish. Place it here if you do not want to lose it. Do you want to know what is being done? I know that no one can give better advice about this structure than the one who made it. You say: “Where should I store it?” He responds: “In heaven,” for He said: “Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” Accept the advice, presented to you with the option of such a great storehouse, from which you do not have a suspended plaque to possess forever.</P>
<H5>What is given to the poor is given to the Lord; He Himself will repay with interest.</H5>
<P>Perhaps you are wondering how to transfer your wealth there? Do not be anxious, and search for ladders or some contraptions through plotting. But just as it usually happens for citizens living abroad, make a transfer. Many indeed do this, when they find suitable persons, they give eagerly. Your Lord Christ did this, rich up above, poor here. He hungers here: He asks for a transfer from you, He will repay fairly. Why then do you hesitate, why do you delay giving? Or is He not capable of repaying? Give to the poor, you will not lose, do not fear: you give to Him, when you give to one of His least ones. Hear the Gospel. When those positioned on the right side were frightened, with certain needs listed, saying: 'When did we see you in these?' the Lord replies: 'When you did it to one of my least, you did it to me.' I, I say, received, when the poor received: in him I was hungry, in him I was satisfied. Give confidently: the Lord receives, the Lord asks. You would not have what to give to Him, unless you first received from Him. If you were lending to men, you would burden: He is not such a one to be burdened by a loan. If you want to be a lender, be so with me, says God to you, give to me: I will repay with interest. Now lift yourself up; extend your greed. Perhaps for a single coin, you will receive not ten, not a hundred, not a thousand, not the earth, but heaven. If you would give a pound of bronze and receive silver, or a pound of silver and receive gold, you would joyfully celebrate yourself as fortunate. What you give will indeed be changed; not gold, not silver, but eternal life will be done for you. It will be changed, because you will be changed. He who gave will become an angel. What he gave will become an angelic throne. There is no remedy that frees from death, except almsgiving. It is difficult for any man to lead this life without sins. Therefore, distribute, my brothers, distribute your resources: make for yourselves purses that do not grow old, a treasure remaining in heaven. Hear the Psalm: 'Although man walks in an image, he is vainly disturbed; he treasures, and does not know for whom he collects.' Give and it will be given to you.</P>
