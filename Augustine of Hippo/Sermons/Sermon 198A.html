<H5>A royal and priestly race in Christ and in the Church.</H5>
<P>The Apostle Peter says to the Church, which is the body of Christ: A holy people, a royal priesthood. Then only one priest was anointed, now all Christians are anointed. Both the king and the priest were anointed, the rest were not anointed. The Lord bore both roles, not in a figure, but already in truth, both of king and priest. For this reason, the Apostle says of the Lord Himself: Who was made for him from the seed of David according to the flesh. Behold then the royal lineage. Therefore, Christ is said to be of the seed of David because of Mary, for she was of the seed of David. But how is the lineage in Mary? It is written in the Gospel that the priest Zechariah had a wife, Elizabeth, of the daughters of Aaron. Therefore, of the priestly lineage, for that whole tribe is Levi. It is said in the Gospel to the virgin Mary by the angel: Your kinswoman Elizabeth. If Elizabeth, one of the daughters of Aaron the priest, was a kinswoman of Mary, it is undoubted that the virgin Mary pertains not only to royal but also to priestly blood. Therefore, in the Lord, according to the man He assumed, both roles are present, royal and priestly. Hence, then, in figure, both the king and the priest were anointed, which in Him, our head, is fulfilled, whose whole body we, the Church, evidently are. Hence deservedly we are called a royal and priestly lineage.</P>
<H5>Now the sole eternal Priest has entered beyond the secrets of the heavens and we still remain outside mourning.</H5>
<P>In those ancient sacraments, our one Lord Jesus Christ was prefigured. One priest would enter into the Holy of Holies, but all the people would stand outside. Is it the case now, with bishops standing by the altar, that you are outside and not inside? Back then, one priest would enter into the Holy of Holies once a year. "Year" signifies all time. Therefore, once in the whole span of time, our one priest, the risen Lord Jesus Christ, entered into the true Holy of Holies, not figurative, but true, beyond the veil of the heavens, offering himself for us. He entered, and he is there. But the people still stand outside with us; we have not yet risen to meet Christ and to always remain inside with him, as it is said to the good servant: Enter into the joy of your Lord. Therefore, it was symbolized by one priest alone entering into the Holy of Holies and the people standing outside, which is now fulfilled through our Lord Jesus Christ alone entering beyond the heavens' secrets and the people still standing outside, groaning, made safe in hope, awaiting the redemption of their body, which will come in the resurrection of the dead.</P>
<H5>The High Priest intercedes for us.</H5>
<P>For He Himself, the High Priest, offers our prayers, who offered Himself as a burnt offering for us. He is the one who leads us, interposing Himself, not to block, but to guide; not to separate, but to reconcile; not to hinder, but to break through hindrances. He is the one priest and the one high priest, who was prefigured in the ancient priests of God. Therefore, a priest without bodily blemish was sought because He alone lived without the blemish of sin even in mortal flesh. For what was prefigured in their bodies was signified to be future in His life.</P>
