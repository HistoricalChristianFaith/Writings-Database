<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>From the Gospel of John (20, 26-28):

And after eight days his disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, "Peace to you!" Then He said to Thomas, "Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing." And Thomas answered and said to Him, "My Lord and my God!"<BR>

<H5>Thomas the apostle touched the flesh of Christ, and proclaimed His divinity.</H5>
<P>You have heard that those who do not see and believe are more praised by the Lord than those who see and believe, and even those who have been able to touch. For the apostle Thomas, when the Lord had shown himself to his disciples, was absent; and when he heard from them that Christ had risen, he said: Unless I put my hand into his side, I will not believe. What if, then, the Lord had risen without scars? Indeed, could he not have resurrected his flesh, so that no traces of wounds would remain in it? He could have done this; but unless he had retained the scars on his body, he would not have healed the wounds in our heart. He was touched, and he was recognized. It was not enough for him to see with his eyes; he wanted to believe with his fingers. Come, he says, put your fingers here; I did not take everything away, I kept something for you to believe in; and see my side, and do not be unbelieving, but faithful. But when he revealed to him what had remained doubtful, he exclaimed: My Lord and my God. He was touching the flesh, and he was calling out to the divinity. What did he touch? The body of Christ. Was the body of Christ the divinity of Christ? The divinity of Christ was the Word; the humanity of Christ was soul and flesh. He could not touch the soul itself, but he could understand it, because the body which had been dead was moving alive. But that Word is neither changed nor touched, neither diminished nor increased; because in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. This is what Thomas cried out; he was touching the flesh, he was invoking the Word, because the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.</P>
