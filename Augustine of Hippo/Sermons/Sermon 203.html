<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>On the Epiphany of the Lord</B></P>
<H5>The feast of Epiphany was rightly instituted.</H5>
<P>"Epiphania" in the Greek language can be said in Latin as "manifestatio." Therefore, on this day, the Redeemer of all nations has manifested himself and has made this day a solemnity for all nations. Just as we celebrated his birth a few days ago, today we celebrate his manifestation. Our Lord Jesus Christ was born thirteen days ago and is said to have been adored by the Magi today. Because it happened, the truth of the Gospel speaks: on what day it happened, the authority of such a renowned solemnity proclaims everywhere. For it seemed just, and truly is just, that since the Magi were the first from the Gentiles to know Christ the Lord and, not yet moved by his word, followed the star that appeared to them, visibly speaking as if it were the Word as an infant, like the tongue of heaven, to recognize the day of their salvation with gratitude, and to dedicate it to the Lord Christ with solemn service and thanksgiving. For the first fruits of the Jews to the faith and revelation of Christ were among those shepherds who saw him coming close on the very day he was born. Angels announced it to them; a star announced it to these ones. To them it was said: Glory to God in the highest; in these ones was fulfilled: The heavens declare the glory of God. Both indeed, like the beginnings of two walls coming from different directions, circumcision and foreskin, ran to the cornerstone: so that he might be their peace, making both one.</P>
<H5>The humility of the nations.</H5>
<P>Nevertheless, they praised God because they had seen Christ; but these [Magi] not only saw Christ but also adored Him. In them [the shepherds], grace was prior; in these, humility was greater. Therefore, perhaps those shepherds, being less guilty, rejoiced more eagerly about salvation; but these Magi, burdened with many sins, more humbly sought forgiveness. This is the humility that divine Scripture commends more in those who were from the Gentiles than in the Jews. For that Centurion was from the Gentiles, who, when he had received the Lord in his whole heart, nevertheless said he was unworthy that He should enter his house, nor did he wish his sick servant to be seen by Him, but to be ordered well. Thus, he retained Him present within his heart, reverently withdrawing His physical presence from his roof. Indeed, the Lord said, 'I have not found such great faith in Israel.' The Canaanite woman was also from the Gentiles, who, when she heard from the Lord that she was a dog, unworthy of the children's bread, asked for crumbs as a dog: and therefore, she merited to receive because she did not deny what she was. For she also heard from the Lord: 'O woman, great is your faith.' Humility had made her faith great, because it had made her small in her own eyes.</P>
<H5>The salvation of all nations symbolized.</H5>
<P>The shepherds therefore come from nearby to see, and the Magi come from afar to worship. This is the humility by which the wild olive tree deserved to be grafted into the olive tree, and to produce an olive against nature; because it deserved to change nature through grace. For when the world was becoming entirely wild and bitter with this wild olive, it shined forth, having been made rich through the grace of grafting. For they come from the ends of the earth, according to Jeremiah, saying: Truly our fathers have worshipped lies. And they come, not from one part of the world, but as the Gospel according to Luke says, from the East, and from the West, from the North and the South, who will recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. Thus, the whole world is called from the four corners into faith by the grace of the Trinity. According to this number, when four are multiplied by three, the apostolic number twelve is consecrated; as prefiguring the salvation of the entire world from the four parts of the world, in the grace of the Trinity. For this number was also signified by that dish which was shown to Peter, full of all animals, as if signifying all nations. For it was also suspended by four lines from heaven, and having been let down three times was taken up; so that four times three made twelve. Therefore, perhaps after the birth of the Lord, with twelve days added, the Magi, the first fruits of the Gentiles, came to see and worship Christ, and they deserved to signify not only their own salvation, but also that of all nations. Therefore, let us also celebrate this day most devoutly; and let us worship the Lord Jesus, whom those first fruits of ours worshipped lying in the inn, dwelling in heaven. For they worshipped in Him what was to come, which we worship as fulfilled. The first fruits of the Gentiles worshipped Him nursing at His mother's breasts; the Gentiles worship Him sitting at the right hand of God the Father.</P>
