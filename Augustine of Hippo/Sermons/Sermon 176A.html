<H5>Therefore, it is necessary for a bishop to be blameless.</H5>
<P>Therefore, it is necessary for a bishop to be blameless. Who denies this? But since it is necessary for a bishop to be blameless, should it be fitting for a Christian to be blameworthy? Bishop is a Greek name, but in Latin it can be called overseer or visitor. We are bishops, but we are Christians together with you. We are specifically named from visitation, commonly all of us from anointing. If the anointing is common, then the struggle is common too. But why do we visit, if there is nothing good that we see in you?</P>
