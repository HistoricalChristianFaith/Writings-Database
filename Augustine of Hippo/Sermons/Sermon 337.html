<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>IN THE DEDICATION OF THE CHURCH</B></P>
<H5>The construction of the Church is a good work to be esteemed from the faith and charity of the one working. The structure of the heavenly Church.</H5>
<P>The good works of the faithful, from their temporal and earthly substance, when they are stored in heavenly treasures, are seen by faith, which has the eye of piety in the heart. Hence also these buildings, which are constructed for gathering religious assemblies, when the eye of the flesh inspects them, it praises inwardly what it sees outwardly, and receives in the visible light that which it rejoices in the invisible truth. For faith is not occupied with looking at how beautiful the members of this habitation are; but with how great a beauty of the inner man these works of love proceed. Therefore, the Lord will reward his faithful so piously, so joyfully, so devoutly working these things, that He will also place them into the construction of His own building, to which living stones run, shaped by faith, solidified by hope, compacted by love. Here, the wise architect Apostle laid the foundation, Christ Jesus, the same highest cornerstone, as Peter also commemorates from the prophetic Scripture, rejected indeed by men, but chosen and honored by God. By adhering to Him, we are pacified; by relying on Him, we are strengthened. For He is both fundamental, because He guides us; and cornerstone, because He unites us. He is the rock, upon which the wise man building his house most securely endures against all temptations of this age: neither falling when the rain rushes in, nor being overturned when the river floods, nor being disturbed when the winds blow. He Himself is also our peace, who has made both one: for in Him neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. For these two, as walls coming from different directions, were far from each other, until they were guided to Him, as to a corner, and were also united in Him to each other.</P>
<H5>Building in labor, dedication in joy.</H5>
<P>Therefore, just as this visible building was made for us to gather corporally, so that building, which we ourselves are, is constructed for God to dwell spiritually. For the Apostle says, "The temple of God is holy, which you are." Just as we construct this with earthly masses, in the same way, we should elevate that with well-ordered morals. For while we visit this now, that will be dedicated to the Lord at the end of the age when this corruptible body will put on incorruption, and this mortal body will put on immortality: because the body of our humility will be conformed to the body of His glory. See what he says in the Psalm of dedication: "You have turned my mourning into joy for me; you have torn my sackcloth and girded me with gladness: that my glory may sing to you and not be pierced with sorrow." For when we are building, our humility groans to Him. But when we are dedicated, our glory sings to Him: because there is labor in building, and joy in dedication. While stones are being cut from the mountains, and wood from the forests, while they are being shaped, hewn, and fitted together, there is labor and care; but when the dedication of the finished building is celebrated, joy and security follow the labors and cares. Thus also the spiritual building, whose inhabitant God will be not temporarily, but forever; while men are being separated from an unfaithful life to faith, while anything in them that is not good and perverse is being cut off and hewn away, while apt, peaceful, and pious joinings are being made, what great temptations are feared, what great tribulations are endured! But when the day of the dedication of the eternal house arrives, when it will be said to us: "Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world"; what exultation, what security will there be? Clarity will sing, and infirmity will not be pierced with pain. When He who loved us and gave Himself for us shows Himself to us; and who appeared to men as He had been made in the mother, will appear to them as God the Maker as He was in the Father; when the eternal inhabitant Himself enters His house which has been perfected and adorned, established by unity, clothed in immortality; He will fill all things, shine in all things, so that God may be all in all.</P>
<H5>Desire to dwell in the house of God. The house of God is the inhabitants themselves.</H5>
<P>A certain person asked for this one vision from the Lord; and if we will, we are that certain person. He toiled for this in his groaning desire, hence he washed his bed every night and soaked his couch with tears. For it was on account of this that his tears were his bread day and night, while it was said to him every single day: Where is your God? For he himself says: One thing I asked from the Lord, this I will seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the delight of the Lord and to be protected in His temple. He himself is the inhabitant, and the dwelling place. For those who dwell in the house of God are themselves also the house of God: which contemplates His delight and is protected in His temple, and is concealed in the hiding place of His face. We hold this hope; we do not yet see the reality. But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience, and through patience, we are built up.</P>
<H5>Our foundation is above, not below.</H5>
<P>Therefore, brothers, if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God: set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For Christ is positioned as our foundation there so that we may be built up toward the heavens. Just as for constructing earthly masses, whose heavy bodies naturally sink downward, the foundation is laid at the bottom: so for us, conversely, the cornerstone is set above to draw us upward by the weight of love. Therefore, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose. Do everything without grumbling. And like living stones, be built up into a temple of God: and like incorruptible wood, make of yourselves a house for God. Be squared, be polished, through labors, through necessities, through watchfulness, through dealings, be prepared for every good work: so that in eternal life, as in the company of the society of Angels, you may deserve to rest.</P>
<H5>An eternal dwelling is to be prepared through good works.</H5>
<P>For this place was built temporarily, and it will not endure forever: just as our bodies themselves, for whose necessity it was constructed through works of mercy, are not eternal but temporary and mortal. However, we have a dwelling from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens: where even our bodies, by the transformation of the resurrection, will become heavenly and eternal. And now, although not yet visibly, as it will be face to face, yet God dwells in us through faith: and to Him dwelling thus we are made a dwelling through good works; which works are not eternal, but lead to eternal life. Among which is this work by which this basilica was constructed: for we will not construct such buildings there. No place is built to fall there, into which no inhabitant enters to die. Now let your good work be a temporal one, so that your reward may be eternal. Now, I say, construct with spiritual love a house of faith and hope in every good work, which will not be needed there; for there will be no lack. Therefore, lay the foundations in your hearts with the apostolic and prophetic exhortations, lay down your humility like a floor without stumbling; reinforce the saving doctrine in your heart with prayers and teachings as with strong walls, enlighten them with divine testimonies as with lights, support the weak like columns, protect the poor like roofs: so that the Lord our God may restore eternal rewards for temporal goods, and may possess you dedicated and perfect forever.</P>
