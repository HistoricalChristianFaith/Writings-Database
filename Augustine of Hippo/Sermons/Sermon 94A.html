Dearly beloved brothers, let us contemplate the glory and joy of the just, which the holy scriptures promise us. For it is necessary that we be instructed and encouraged by them, in order to bear the trials of this present life with patience, and not be overcome by the temptations of the devil. Therefore, let us consider what the scriptures say about the good things that are prepared for the just.

In the book of Wisdom it is written, "The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and no torment will touch them. In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died, and their departure was thought to be a disaster, and their going from us to be their destruction; but they are at peace." Again, it says, "The righteous live forever, and their reward is with the Lord; the Most High takes care of them. Therefore they will receive a glorious crown and a beautiful diadem from the hand of the Lord."

Let us also hear what the Lord Jesus says in the Gospel: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they who mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven."

With these promises, dearly beloved brothers, let us strengthen our hearts, and let us not be disturbed by the tribulations of this world. For the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. Let us bear all things with patience and perseverance, looking forward to the eternal reward that is prepared for us in heaven. Amen.</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>On the Martyrdom of John the Baptist<BR>
And on persecution which also during a time of peace<BR>
Suffering must be endured by Christians.</B></P>
<H5>"From where John is a martyr."</H5>
<P>Regarding the present chapter, most beloved brothers, of the holy Gospel, which our Lord wanted to teach us, certainly the Church of Christ does not doubt that John is a martyr. And before the Lord's passion, he deserved martyrdom; born before, suffered before, not, however, as the originator of salvation, but as the precursor of the judge. For he went before the Lord himself taking on humble service, giving eminence to the celestial Master. Whence do we say that John is a martyr? Was he seized by persecutors of Christians, brought out, questioned, professed Christ, and suffered? For this indeed can be said of other martyrs after the passion of Christ. Thus, whence is he a martyr? Because he was beheaded? For it is not penalty that makes a martyr, but cause. Because he offended a powerful woman? Whence did he offend? By what matter did he offend? By speaking the truth to the king, regarding his deed, because it was not lawful for him to have his brother's wife. The truth deserved hatred, and by deserving hatred reached passion and the crown. These are the fruits of the future age. Luxury dances, and therefore, innocence is condemned; but it is condemned by men, crowned by Almighty God.</P>
<H5>Martyr because for the truth, which is Christ, dead.</H5>
<P>Therefore, let no one say: I cannot be a martyr, because there is no persecution against Christians. You hear that John endured martyrdom; and, if you truly consider it, he died for Christ. How, you ask, for Christ, who was not questioned about Christ, nor forced to deny Christ? Listen to Christ Himself saying: I am the way, and the truth, and the life. If Christ is the truth, anyone who is condemned for the truth suffers for Christ, and is legitimately crowned. Therefore, let no one excuse themselves: all times are open to martyrs. Let no one say that persecution does not happen to Christians. The sentence of the apostle Paul cannot be invalidated, because it is true; Christ spoke through him, he did not lie. For he says: All who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. He says all: he excluded no one, he separated no one. If you want to prove what he said is true, begin to live godly in Christ, and you will see that what he says is true. Indeed, because earthly kings have ceased their persecution, does that mean the devil does not rage? That ancient enemy is always vigilant against us: let us not sleep. He suggests temptations, sets traps, injects bad thoughts; to provoke with a worse fall, he offers gains, threatens losses. It comes to his point, and with labor the evil of his suggestion is repelled, so that present death is willingly accepted. Understand, brothers. If someone forces you, for example, some noble, having power over your life, forces you to give false testimony, and does not say to you: Deny Christ, what do you think, to choose falsehood or to die for the truth? And yet the persecutor says nothing else to you than: Deny Christ. For if Christ is the truth, as we have said, surely he denies Christ who denies the truth. But everyone denies the truth who speaks a lie. He who gives false testimony, why? Because he fears, certainly. Is it not persecution for all Christians, whenever they struggle for the truth? Now each is tested individually, and in his own cause each one is tried.</P>
<H5>He kills himself who tells false testimony.</H5>
<P>But what will it advantage you, threatening slaughter, thirsting for blood, swollen with power, lifted up like smoke; what would your enemy, who compelled you to perjury and false testimony, have done to you? Weakness responds: He would have killed me, it says. - He would not kill you. - Absolutely, I know he would kill me. If that is so, then I will also respond: You, brother, kill yourself, who speak false testimony. But he would have killed, but killed your body: what could he do to your soul? The house would be destroyed, the inhabitant would be crowned. Behold what your enemy would have done to you if you had stood in truth and not spoken false testimony: he would certainly have killed, but the body, not the soul. Listen to your Lord giving secure counsel: Do not, he says, fear those who kill the body and afterward cannot do anything further; but fear him who has the power to kill both body and soul and cast them into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him. John feared this one: he did not wish to be silent about the truth and endured the iniquity of wicked men; he deserved the hatred of the king through a shameless woman and reached martyrdom.</P>
<H5>How true martyrs are distinguished.</H5>
<P>For all who will live piously in Christ are shaken by such persecution. For they suffer persecution for worldly gain, or for fear of loss; or for the present life, or for the threat of death; because this world is not without persecution. But it must be discerned, who suffers for what; and they will be true martyrs, if they strive for the truth, which is Christ, and are crowned lawfully. For those who suffer persecution for this world, which is in evil, can endure temporal punishment.</P>
<H5>Desire and fear, two weapons of the enemy.</H5>
<P>Therefore, brothers, since we have learned in the present reading to fight for the truth unto death, and not to bear false witness, not to perjure, to uphold justice in peril, for it is not great, to uphold justice in security or in delights, let us always consider to be vigilant against the devil, our tempter and persecutor; and in the name and with the help of the Lord our God, let us be more fervent in watchfulness against him, lest in any way he overcomes us through greed, by which he is accustomed to tempt; because whom greed and fear do not conquer, which are the weapons of the enemy, from which men, who have hope in this world, are entangled in various snares, so that they cannot prevail to obtain the truth. Indeed, the devil has two doors by which he knocks to enter; first through greed, thereafter through fear. If he finds both doors closed among the faithful, he passes by. And what, you ask, is greed, what is fear? Hear what it is, so that you do not desire what passes away, and do not fear what in time fails and perishes; and then at last he will not find a nest where the enemy may dwell; because the struggle has been set before us until the end; not only for us, who stand or sit in a higher place and speak to you, but the struggle has been set in all the members of Christ.</P>
<H5>Another way of swearing elsewhere.</H5>
<P>Therefore, to this day in Numidia, it is customary to adjure the servants of God in this way: "May you conquer." You see that such an adjuration of the fighter is not said without reason. For here where we speak, in Carthage, and in every proconsular province and Byzacium, and even in Tripoli, the customary phrase to adjure each other, the servants of God, is: "By your crown." Which crown no one will receive, unless he conquers. And I adjure you by your crown, that you fight against the devil with all your heart; and if we conquer together, we will also be crowned together. Why do you say to us: "By your crown," and act poorly, live poorly? Live well, act well, have a good conversation both outside and inside, and you will be our crown. The Apostle was instructing the people of God, which you are, when he says: "My joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord." If the prosperity of the times smiles upon you, stand firm in the Lord; if the adversity of the times roars, be steadfast in the Lord. Do not fall from Him who always stands, and stands expecting the fighter, and helps you, so that by standing and fighting you may conquer, and at last come to Him to be crowned.</P>
