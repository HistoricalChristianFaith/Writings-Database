<H5>Christ is the day from day.</H5>
<P>He sanctified this day for us, the day that made every day; about which the Psalm sings: Sing to the Lord a new song, sing to the Lord all the earth. Sing to the Lord and bless his name, proclaim his salvation day by day. Who is this day from day, if not the Son from the Father, light from light? But that day, which begot the day, which would be born from the Virgin on this day; therefore, that day has no beginning, has no end. I say, God the Father is the day. For Jesus would not be a day from day, unless the Father were also a day. What is day but light? Not the light of carnal eyes, not the light common to men and animals, but the light that shines for angels, the light by which hearts are purified when seen. For this night passes, in which we now live, in which the lamps of the Scriptures are lit for us; and that will come, which is sung in another Psalm: In the morning I will stand before you, and will contemplate you.</P>
<H5>Justice from faith.</H5>
<P>Therefore, that day, the Word of God, the day that illuminates the angels, the day that shines in that homeland from which we are exiled, clothed itself in flesh, and was born of the Virgin Mary. He was wonderfully born. What is more wonderful than the birth from a Virgin? She conceives, and she is a virgin; she gives birth, and she is a virgin. For he was created from her whom he created; and he bestowed fertility upon her, he did not corrupt her integrity. Mary, from where? From Adam. Adam, from where? From the earth. If Adam from the earth, and Mary from Adam, then Mary is also earth. If Mary is earth, let us acknowledge what we sing: Truth has sprung from the earth. What benefit has he bestowed upon us? Truth has sprung from the earth, and righteousness has looked down from heaven. For the Jews, as the Apostle says: Ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they have not submitted to the righteousness of God. From where can man be just? From himself? Who gives bread to himself when he is poor? Who clothes himself when he is naked, unless he receives a garment? We did not have righteousness; there were only sins here. From where is righteousness? What righteousness without faith? For the just lives by faith. He who claims to be just without faith lies. How does he not lie, in whom there is no faith? If he wants to speak the truth, let him turn to the truth. But it was far away. Truth has sprung from the earth. You were sleeping, it came to you; you were snoring, it awakened you; it made a way for you through itself, lest it lose you. Therefore, because Truth has sprung from the earth, our Lord Jesus Christ was born of a Virgin; righteousness has looked down from heaven, so that men might have righteousness not of their own, but of God.</P>
<H5>Christ was generated for the regeneration of man.</H5>
<P>What great mercy! What preceded was indignation! What indignation preceded? We were mortal, burdened with sins, bearing our punishments. Every person, when born, begins with misery. Do not seek a prophet; ask the newborn, and see them weep. When, therefore, there was such great indignation of God on earth, what sudden mercy arose? Truth sprung from the earth. He created all things, was created among all things; made the day, came into the day; was before time, marked the times. The Lord Christ is eternally without beginning with the Father: and yet, today, what is it? It is his birth. Whose? The Lord’s. Does he have a birthday? He does. In the beginning was the Word, God with God, does he have a birthday? He does. Unless he had human generation, we would not arrive at divine regeneration: he was born so that we might be reborn. Let no one doubt being reborn, for Christ was born: he was generated, not needing regeneration. For whom was regeneration necessary, if not for those whose generation was condemned? Let, therefore, his mercy be in our hearts. His mother carried him in the womb, let us carry him in our hearts; the Virgin became pregnant with the incarnation of Christ, let our hearts be filled with faith in Christ: she bore the Savior, let us bear praise. Let us not be barren: let our souls be fruitful to God.</P>
<H5>The generation of Christ is twofold.</H5>
<P>The generation of Christ from the Father without a mother; the generation of Christ from the mother without a father: both generations are remarkable. The first generation is eternal, the second temporal. When was He born from the Father? What is "when"? You seek "when" there, where you will not find time? Do not seek "when" there. Seek "when" here: you seek well when He is from the mother. You do not seek well when He is from the Father: He is born, and He does not have time; He is born eternal from the eternal, co-eternal. Why are you amazed? He is God. Consider the divinity, and the cause of amazement perishes. And when we say, He is born of a Virgin, a great thing, you are amazed. He is God, do not be amazed; let amazement pass, let praise approach. Let there be faith: believe that it was done. If you do not believe, it was done, you remain an unbeliever. He deigned to become man: why do you seek more? Was it not enough that God humbled Himself for you? He who was God became man. The inn was narrow: wrapped in swaddling clothes, placed in a manger: you heard this when the Gospel was read. Who would not wonder? He, who filled the world, did not find a place in the inn; placed in a manger, He became our sustenance. Let two animals approach the manger, two peoples: For the ox knew its owner, and the donkey the manger of its Lord. Attend to the manger: do not be ashamed to be the Lord’s beast of burden. You will carry Christ, you will not go astray walking on the road: He sits upon you, the way. Do you remember that donkey brought to the Lord? Let no one be ashamed, it is us. Let the Lord sit upon us, and call us wherever He wants. We are His beast of burden, we are going to Jerusalem. With Him sitting upon us, we are not pressed down, but elevated; with Him leading us, we do not go astray: to Him we go, through Him we go, we do not perish.</P>
