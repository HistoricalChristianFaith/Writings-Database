<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ON THE BIRTHDAY OF THE LORD</B></P>
<H5>The birth of Christ is twofold and both are marvelous.</H5>
<P>The Son of God, who is also the Son of Man, our Lord Jesus Christ, born without a mother from the Father, created all days; born without a father from the mother, consecrated this day; in divine birth, invisible; in human birth, visible; in both, wonderful. Hence what the prophet foretold about Him: "Who will declare His generation?" it is difficult to judge of which it was said; whether about that by which He, never not born, has the co-eternal Father, or about this in which He, being born at some time, had already made His mother, in whom He would be born: whether about that in which He is always born, who always was; for who will declare how Light was born from Light, and both are one Light? how God was born from God, and the number of gods did not increase? how it can be said as of something past that He was born, although in that birth time neither passed, so that it might be past; nor preceded, so that it might be future; nor was present, as if it were still happening and not yet perfect? Who will therefore declare this generation; when what is to be declared remains above time, while the speech of one declaring it passes in time? Also, who will declare this generation from a virgin, whose conception in the flesh was not done carnally, whose birth from the flesh brought abundance to the nourisher, did not take away integrity from the parent? So whomever of these generations, or indeed both, who will declare them?</P>
<H5>Christ, son of Mary, bridegroom of the Church.</H5>
<P>This is our Lord God, this is the mediator of God and men, our Savior, who was born of the Father and created the mother; created of the mother and glorified the Father: without a female birth the only one for the Father, without a male union the only one for the mother. This is the one beautiful in form beyond the sons of men, the holy son of Mary, the holy bridegroom of the Church, whom he made similar to his own mother: for he also made her our mother, and he keeps her a virgin for himself. To her indeed the Apostle says: I have espoused you to one husband, to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. Of whom he again says, our mother is not a servant, but free, whose many children are more than her who has a husband. Therefore, both the Church and Mary have perpetual integrity and uncorrupted fecundity. For what she deserved in the flesh, this one has preserved in the mind: but whereas she bore one, this one bears many, to be gathered into one by one.</P>
<H5>Why Christ came in the flesh.</H5>
<P>This is therefore the day on which He came into the world, through whom the world was made; on which He was made present in the flesh, never absent in virtue: because He was in this world, and He came unto His own. He was in the world, but the world did not recognize Him: because the light shined in darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it. Therefore He came in the flesh, to cleanse the sins of the flesh. He came to this healing land, to cure our inner eyes, which our outer land had blinded: so that with them healed, we who were once darkness may become light in the Lord; and the light may not now shine present in the darkness of the absent, but appear certain to the beholders. For this, the bridegroom came forth from His chamber, and rejoiced as a giant to run His course. Handsome as a bridegroom, strong as a giant, lovable and terrifying, severe and serene, beautiful to the good, harsh to the evil, remaining in the bosom of the Father, He filled the womb of the mother. In which chamber, that is, the Virgin's womb, the divine nature joined to itself the human: where the Word was made flesh for us, so that coming forth from the mother, He might dwell in us; so that going before to the Father, He might prepare for us where we may dwell. Therefore let us joyfully celebrate this day solemnly; and faithfully desire the eternal day, through Him who was born for us eternal in time.</P>
