<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>On the Birthday of the Martyr Vincent</B></P>
<H5>Vincent everywhere conquered. Redeemed by the blood of Christ, he does not perish. Patience is a gift of God. Perfect victory over all hostile machinations.</H5>
<P>We have witnessed a great spectacle with the eyes of faith, the holy martyr Vincent constantly triumphing. He triumphed in words, he triumphed in sufferings; he triumphed in confession, he triumphed in tribulation; he triumphed burned by flames, he triumphed submerged by waves: finally, he triumphed tortured, he triumphed dead. When his body, in which was the trophy of Christ the victor, was cast into the sea from a small boat, it silently said: We are cast down, but we perish not. Who granted such patience to his soldier, except he who first shed his blood for him? To whom it is said in the Psalm: For thou art my patience, Lord; Lord, my hope from my youth. A great contest gains great glory; not human, nor temporal, but divine and eternal. Faith fights; and when faith fights, no one overcomes the flesh. For even if it is torn, even if it is lacerated; when does he perish who has been redeemed by the blood of Christ? A powerful man cannot lose what he bought with his gold, and does Christ lose what he purchased with his blood? But all this should be attributed not to the glory of man, but of God. From him truly is patience, true patience, holy patience, religious patience, right patience; Christian patience is a gift of God. For many robbers also suffer most patiently; and while not yielding and overcoming the torturer, afterwards are punished with eternal fire. The cause distinguishes the martyr from patience, or rather, from the hardness of the wicked. The punishment is the same, but the cause is different. We sang with the voice of the martyrs (for Vincent had said these things in his prayers): Judge me, O God, and distinguish my cause from an unholy nation. His cause is distinguished: because he fought for truth, for justice, for God, for Christ, for faith, for the unity of the Church, for indivisible charity. Who granted him this patience? Who? Let the Psalm tell us. For it is read there, it is sung there: Will not my soul be subject to God? From him indeed is my patience. Whoever thinks that Saint Vincent could do these things by his own strength is greatly mistaken. For whoever presumes that he can do this by his own strength, even if he seems to conquer through patience, is overcome by pride. To conquer well is to conquer all machines. When it offers allurements, it is conquered by continence: when it inflicts punishments and torments, it is conquered by patience: when it suggests errors, it is conquered by wisdom. Finally, when all these things have been conquered, it suggests to the soul, Well done, well done, how much you were able! How much you have fought! Who is compared to you? How well have you conquered? Let the holy soul answer it: Let them be confounded and put to shame that say to me, Well done, well done! When then does he conquer, except when he says: My soul shall be praised in the Lord; let the meek hear and be glad. For the meek know what I say; because in them dwells the Word, in them dwells the example. For whoever is not meek knows not what the taste is of what is said: My soul shall be praised in the Lord. For every not-meek person, proud, harsh, exalted, wants to be praised in himself, not in the Lord. But he who says: My soul shall be praised in the Lord; does not say: Let the nations hear, and be glad; let people hear, and be glad: but: Let the meek hear, and be glad. Let those who have a taste for it hear. For Christ was meek: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter. Therefore meek, because he was led as a sheep to the slaughter. Let the meek hear, and be glad. For they have a taste for what is said: Taste and see how sweet the Lord is: blessed is the man that trusts in him. We have heard a long reading, the day is short: we should not hold your patience even with a long sermon. We know that you have listened patiently, and by standing and listening a long time, you have sympathized with the martyr. May he who hears you, loves you, and crowns you.</P>
