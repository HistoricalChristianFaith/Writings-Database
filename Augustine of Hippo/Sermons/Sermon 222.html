<H5>Who are the adversaries of the Lord's flock. Where these most wicked spirits dwell. Be watchful and pray that we do not enter into temptation.</H5>
<P>When you, beloved, are urged by the very solemnity of this holy night to watch and pray, our solemn address is also due to you, so that against the contrary and envious powers and the rulers of darkness, like against nocturnal beasts, the shepherd's voice may also awaken the flock of the Lord. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, as the Apostle says, that is, against men weak in mortal body: but against principalities and powers, and the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spiritual wickedness in the heavenly places. Indeed, do not think that the devil and his angels, whom the Apostle signifies by these words, are the rulers of this world, concerning which it is written: And the world was made through him. For when he called them the rulers of the world, lest anyone should understand the world, which in many places of Scripture is called by the name of heaven and earth; he immediately added, as if explaining, of this darkness, that is, of the unbelievers. Therefore he says to those who are now faithful: You were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. These are, therefore, the spiritual wickedness in the heavenly places; not where the stars are arranged and shine, and the holy Angels dwell; but in the dark dwelling of this lower air, where even the mist gathers: (and yet it is written: He who covers the heaven with clouds). Where also birds fly: and yet they are called the birds of heaven. Therefore, in these heavens, not in that higher tranquility of the heavens, these wicked spirits dwell, against whom we are called to spiritual wrestling: so that having conquered the evil angels, we may enjoy that reward of being united with the good Angels in incorruptible eternity. Hence, in another place the same Apostle, signifying the dark principality of the devil, says: According to the spirit of this world, according to the prince of the power of this air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience. Therefore, what is the spirit of this world, this is the rulers of the world. And just as he explained there what he called the world, in the sons of disobedience: so also here, when he added, of this darkness. And what he says there, the prince of the power of this air; here in this place, in the heavenly places. Thanks be to our Lord God, who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of the Son of His love. Therefore, separated by the evangelical light from those darknesses, and redeemed by His precious blood from those powers, watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. For whoever has the faith that works through love, the prince of this world has been cast out from your hearts: but outside, like a roaring lion, he goes about seeking whom he may devour. Therefore do not give place to the devil, wanting to penetrate from any side: but He who cast him out by suffering for you, may He dwell within you against him. When he ruled over you, you were once darkness; but now you are light in the Lord: walk as children of light. Against the darkness and its rulers, watch in the mother light, and pray to the Father of lights from the bosom of the mother light.</P>
