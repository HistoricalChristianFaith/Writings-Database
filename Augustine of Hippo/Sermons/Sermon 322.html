<H5>Where he presented the promised book of the healed man</H5>
<P>Yesterday we promised your Charity a little book, where you can also hear about the one healed, which you could not see. Therefore, if it pleases your Charity, or rather because it ought to please what also pleases me, let both brothers stand in your presence: so that those who did not see him may see in this one what the other was suffering. Let both, therefore, stand, one to whom grace was given, and the other from whom mercy is to be sought.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">EXAMPLE OF A LETTER FROM PAUL TO BISHOP AUGUSTINE</P>
<P>I ask, most blessed lord Pope Augustine, that you order this little book of mine, which I have presented by your command, to be read to the holy people.</P><P>While we were still in our homeland of Caesarea in Cappadocia, our older brother inflicted grievous and intolerable injuries on our common mother, to the point that he did not hesitate even to lay hands on her. All of us children, gathered together, bore this patiently, not even asking our brother why he did this to our mother. However, she, incited by the prompts of feminine pain, decided to punish her injurious son with curses. And as she was hurrying to the sacred Baptismal font after the crowing of the cocks to invoke Godâ€™s wrath on her aforementioned son, a demon, in the likeness of our uncle, appeared to her and asked where she was going. She responded that she was going to curse her son due to his intolerable contumely. Then that enemy, finding an easy place in the heart of the enraged woman, persuaded her to curse everyone. Inflamed by venomous counsels, she fell upon the sacred font, with hair disheveled and breasts exposed, and most especially prayed to God that we, exiled from our homeland and wandering foreign lands, would terrify all people by our example. Instantly, an effective vengeance followed her maternal prayers, and that same elder brother of ours, both in age and guilt, was seized by such a trembling of the limbs as Your Holiness saw in me up to three days ago. Keeping the order of our birth, within one year the same punishment seized all of us. Seeing her curses had reached such efficacy, our mother could no longer bear the consciousness of her impiety and the reproach of people: but, tying a noose around her neck, concluded her sorrowful life with a more tragic end. Therefore, all of us, unable to bear our disgrace and leaving our common homeland, were scattered variously. Of all ten of us brothers, the one who follows in birth order to the memory of the glorious martyr Laurence, who was recently housed at Ravenna as we heard, deserved healing. But I, who am the sixth in birth order among them, together with this sister of mine, who follows me in age, wherever there were holy places among the nations or lands where God was said to work miracles, I traveled with great love for the desired health. But to pass over the other celebrated places of the saints in silence, I also came in the same travels to Ancona, a city of Italy where the Lord performs many miracles through the most glorious martyr Stephen. But I could not be healed elsewhere because I was reserved for this place by divine predestination. Nor did I omit the city of Uzalis in Africa, where the blessed martyr Stephen is often proclaimed to work great things. However, three months ago, on the day of the January Calends, both I and my sister, who is here with me, detained by the same affliction, were clearly warned in a vision. For a certain person of bright appearance with venerable white hair said to me that within three months, the desired health would be present to me. My sister, in a vision, saw Your Holiness in the same form as we see you now: by which it was signified to us that we should come to this place. For I also often saw your Blessedness through other cities on the journey to this very place, just as I see you now. Therefore, clearly admonished by divine authority, we came to this city about fifteen days ago. Both my own passion and my pitiable sister, who offers an example of common misfortune for the instruction of all, are witnesses to this. Those who see in her how I once was may recognize in me how much the Lord has worked through His Holy Spirit. I was praying daily with great tears at the place of the memory of the most glorious martyr Stephen. On Easter Sunday, as those present saw, while I was praying and holding the rails with great weeping, I suddenly fell. Completely unaware of myself, I did not know where I was. Shortly thereafter, I arose and did not find that trembling in my body. Therefore, not ungrateful for such a great gift from God, I offered this little book; in it, I have disclosed both the calamities you were unaware of and what you have learned about my well-being and health: so that you may deem it worthy to pray for my sister and to give thanks to God for me.</P>
