<H5>A Sermon Held in Carthage. The Common Counsel of the Holy Martyrs.</H5>
<P>The illustrious martyr of Christ, through whom He most notably ruled, increased, adorned, and illuminated the Church, is remembered by today's anniversary celebration of his passion. This celebration does not recall something that has passed but more joyfully and gratefully commends it to our memory as fixed and enduring. Therefore, it is fitting for us to praise his soul in the Lord with a solemn discourse, so that the meek may hear and be glad. Indeed, while that soul dwelled in these mortal members, it despised the death that would eventually come, to acquire an everlasting life; by faithful and prudent counsel, losing what would perish even if retained, to find what could not perish. For if temporal life is retained by denying Christ, it ends, and eternal life is not found. How much wiser, then, to neglect the one and gain the other, rather than to lose both by poorly loving the one? This is the common counsel of the holy martyrs, the common trade: to scorn what is fleeting, so that what is permanent may be won; to live by dying, lest they die by living: and to eternally live after dying once, rather than to die twice and not merit to live thereafter, by postponing the death that is to come, and when it finally comes, not coming to the everlasting life. This, I say, is the common counsel, the common trade of the holy martyrs. They learned this from their teacher, redeemer, and Lord, who said to all: "He who loves his life will lose it, and he who loses it for my sake will find it in eternal life." Consequently, a soul perishes if it is loved, and is found if it is lost; let it perish if it loves, lest it perish when it is loved. The statement can be understood in two ways: "He who loves his life will lose it." He who loves his life in this world will lose it in the age to come; and: he who loves his life in the age to come will lose it in this world. According to the former sense, he who loves his life by fearing to die for Christ will lose it so as not to live in Christ; and he who loves his life so as to live in Christ will lose it by dying for Christ. For it follows: "And he who loses it for my sake will find it in eternal life." He who said "for my sake" is the true God and eternal life.</P>
<H5>Cyprian taught about Christ, lived in Christ, died for Christ. He takes his name from Cyprus. Everywhere in the world his writings are read, his feast is celebrated. A list of his books is woven.</H5>
<P>Therefore, since this is the duty of all the saints, our martyr today has not only a reward for himself but also for many others. For he spread the good fragrance of Christ far and wide by teaching, living, and dying; teaching about Christ, living in Christ, dying for Christ. Therefore, beloved, since in this case, none other than Christ can be understood, where the Church, the bride, says: "My beloved is a cluster of henna," signifying the most fragrant of graces by an aromatic tree; clearly, just as he was made a Christian by Christ in his true faith, so he became Cyprian in the good fragrance of henna. For the apostle Paul also says: "We are the good fragrance of Christ in every place." Thus, the good fragrance of Christ in our Cyprian came from this seat; not because it was sufficient only for this city, nor only for Africa, of which this is the head; but it spread so far and wide that from the rising to the setting of the sun, the name of the Lord is praised in him, in whom his soul will be praised, so that the meek may hear and be glad. For what region on earth can be found where his eloquence is not read, his teaching praised, his charity loved, his life proclaimed, his death venerated, and the feast of his passion celebrated? How many warriors against the devil did the trumpet of his words incite by the example of his passion! How many thereafter not only reading his words but also admiring his fame, learned to love, and by loving, followed him! By teaching, he preempted some to be imitated; by suffering, he led some to follow. He confounded the mouths of those barking against the doctrine of Christ; returned virgins to Christ, not beautiful in body and color, but in behavior; broke the stings of jealousy and envy, and restrained their poisons; disputed healthily about the Lord's Prayer so that we understand what we ask for; and he made a booklet for the fallen, pastoring with advice and compassionate clemency, brought down the contemptuous to the humility of sorrow, and lifted the sorrowful from the depths of despair; praised, persuaded, and exhibited patience; shattered the presumptuousness of heretics through the demonstration and preaching of unity; while discussing mortality, and recommending the joys of immortal life, he erased all fear of dying and sorrow of mourning from the souls of the faithful; convicted the vainest and most pernicious worship of idols even by the testimony of secular letters; inflamed Christian hearts to the greatest usefulness and reward of almsgiving, refuting earthly greed. And what more can I say? Many everywhere keep his large body of writings. But let us give greater thanks to the Lord because we have merited to have a holy body of his members; where we pour out our prayers to the Lord, to whom it has pleased, and by whose grace he was such, with more ardent affection, and praise Him in the Lord, through whom we rejoice that He has been praised so.</P>
