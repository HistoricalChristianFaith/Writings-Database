The martyrs, then, are witnesses to this fact, that the resurrection of Christ is true, and that they have seen it with their own eyes; they bear witness to what they saw, not by lying, but through suffering.</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>TRACTATE ON THE LORD'S DAY OF THE OCTAVE OF HOLY EASTER</B></P>
<H5>Christ, not received by his own, is acknowledged as Lord by the nations.</H5>
<P>The blessed Apostles, when they performed miracles and healings in the name of Christ, were zealously prohibited by the Jews from speaking in His name, who had chosen them and granted them to be such. But they replied saying: If it is just in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, judge for yourselves; for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard. They professed themselves as witnesses of Christ; however, those who are called "witnesses" in Latin are called "martyrs" in Greek. Saying therefore: We cannot but speak what we have seen and heard, they scorned the prohibition of men to have the blessing of God. They saw and heard: What about us? We too must preach. But we have not seen. Surely, let us preach what we have heard; because the Apostle says: Therefore, faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ. Judea saw Christ the Lord in the flesh, the nations did not see; yet, not seeing, they heard and believed; seeing, they despised and killed. Therefore, we were to hear, not to see; however, the vision is preserved for us, so that what we now believe, we may see at the end of the world. That same Lord foresaw us, when He said in prophecy: The people whom I did not know have served me; those whom I have known resisted me, those whom I did not know have served me. However, from where did the people serve you whom you did not know, that is, to whom you did not show the presence of your flesh, to whose eyes you did not display your scars after the resurrection, how did they serve you? Continue, and hear: By the hearing of the ear they have obeyed me.</P>
<H5>Let us proclaim Christ wherever we can.</H5>
<P>Therefore, you also say: We cannot speak and preach what we have not heard about the Lord Christ. Let each one preach wherever he can, and he is a martyr. Sometimes, however, a person does not endure persecution and fears shame. It happens that he dines, for example, among pagans and is ashamed to be called a Christian. If he fears the diner, how can he despise the persecutor? Therefore, preach Christ wherever you can, to whomsoever you can, however you can. Faith is required of you, not eloquence: let faith speak from you, and Christ speaks. For if there is faith in you, Christ dwells in you. You have heard the Psalm: I believed, therefore I have spoken. He could not believe and remain silent. He is ungrateful to the one who fills, who does not pour out: therefore whoever is filled, ought to pour out. For such a fountain is born in him, which knows how to pour out, does not know how to dry up: It will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life. You preach confidently, because you do not lie about the fountain of truth: you have received, what you belch forth on your tongue. For if you wish to speak from your own self, you will be liars; the Psalm itself says this: I said in my haste: Every man is a liar. What is: Every man is a liar? Every Adam is a liar. Strip yourself of Adam, and put on Christ, and you will not be a liar. Let this suffice your Charity, for many things must be done.</P>
